ionaarc menu





blogs are like newspapers: whatever the editor writes, selects, prints gets published for that issue, that date. dictionaries, encyclopedias, archives are different: there there is a hierarchical organization as well as a chronological one, the hierarchy more important than the chronology.

pk's knatz.com was hierarchical from day one. i mounted that days work, but located it in a hierarchy, a logical tree: this post is didactic, this personal, this organizational. among the didactic posts this one concerns divisions of reason, this one concerns men living together or failing to live together in a society ... this one is cosmological, this one is both cosmological and theological, while that one distinguishes plants from animals, terrestraisl from extra terrestrials ...

this post (while it happens to get posted on 2011 09 16) is a taxonomic post: organizational, a hallway connecting rooms, an elevator indicating that men's wear is on the second floor, kitchen gadgets in the basement ...

blogspot organizes posts by year, by month, in order of day. my new ionaarc menu is getting built at the pknatz blog. to date it links to the posts here chronologically. my progress with it is still in 2005. ah, but once i've caught up to the present, i'll start to distribute the links in pknatz's category menus. thus a post date, while it may be important, as with a christmas piece, or a 9-1-11 piece, is normally trivial: what counts is taht this post relates to pk on semiotics, or to pk on human institutions, or tells a story about pk from when he was in grade school ...

pk's arrest





2011 07 23 when the federal court attacked and destroyed my domains it not only evaporated my thousands of text files online but my thousands of graphic files too. my pkimaging.com hosted many of the graphics for ionaarc. i'm fixing missing images asap as i find them.

in the summer of 2006 i decided to move all knatz.com modules about factitious human hierarchies, that is, about authoritarian institutions — nation-states, governments, churches, compulsory school systems ... to a new domain: againsthierarchy.org. all of the files at infoall.org, my deschooling domain, would be absorbed there. so would all of knatz.com's may society modules on civilization, on kleptocracy ...

in 1962 i'd begun graduate school, dreading it, but wanting to teach college english — while also writing fiction, publishing scholarship ... but my graduate school, while utterly capable of dispensing known ideas, proved wholly blind, deaf, and dumb to my suggestions for improving those ideas. mcluhan's publisher told him that audiences can't absorb more than a tiny percentage of new material. somehow mcluhan got published, and read, and rich, and famous ... anyway. there's no telling though how many original ideas die on vine, unheard by the society. i don't doubt that the more schools we have, the less we will hear; that the more governemtn funds "science," the sooner science will wither, replaced by authoritarian orthodoxy. the temple will kill any son of god over and over. it's a "pope" societies want obeyed, not any god: unless the "god" is firmly in the control of the church with its pope.

my graduate school hadn't understood a word i'd said, from 1962 thorugh 1970. by 1967 i was teaching: while trying to devise a way nyu might understand my thesis: my reading of shakespeare's sonnets in terms of orthodoxy versus experience. that never happened. but in 1970 i'd discovered ivan illich and his proposal to replace compulsory school systems with voluntary public cybernetic data bases, reinventing the ancient market place as it were. such record keeping should belong directly to the public, without government interference. post human resources, inannimate resources, match individuals based on expressed common interest ... and post feedback on the human and inanimate resources. that is, a colleage of a person listed as a resource, could evaluate the colleague: plank commenting on einstein, for example. einstein's student could also comment on einstein — as a teacher: tell if she thought he was looking up her dress more than he was concentrating on physics, for example. i offered to help illich to realize the creation of such networks. i'd already been waiting for an internet for years, imagining such in fiction, in dreams. illich told me to found such an institution myself, he was busy. i did. the free learning exchange, inc., nyc, 1970.

free publicity came quickly. a few people registered their expertise, a few more sought companions for a specified activity: guitar playing, for scream therapy ...

i circulated fliers around manhattan, heavily around nyu, where i matriculated, and around columbia, my alma mater, where i still lived. columbia's initial response was good; nyu's was hostile: though faculty from both were on my board of trustees.

all this was detailed at knatz.com, and then at infoall.org.

the public dribbled a few dollars toward flex. a church group gave a bit more.
time inc saw my cable tv public resouce listings, and draggd me down to madison avenue. but meeting me, they changed their mind about publicizing any grass roots internet. ibm hailed my idea as a good one, then dismissed it as not for them.

note above all: illich's proposed network was that saint's jessu-inspired invitation for titular christians to become actual christians. as a would-be disciple of jesus, i recognized illich as fully mature saint, closer to god than i: and i too was close. churches which didn't help us are lying hypocrites, in defiance of christ. but never mind, i continue my narrative:

i was already approaching middle age. i'd already been living on borrowed money for more than a decade except to a couple of years worth of slave-wages as a college instructor. i founded flex without any capital of my own. the public could have donated the necessary millions: and saved billions: plus, earned some measure of freedom from government interference. it didn't. the public rejects jesus while claiming that jessu will save them?

should jesus save those who block resources from his disciples?

anyway: nyu had ignored my brilliance as a doctoral candidate, had seen that my ideas didn't prosper. nyu had ever right to ignore my offer of a cheap internet in 1970 and in 1971 ... but having done so, nyu had no right to make use of the kleptonet cern and the us offered years later.

the us coopted my jesus-inspired internet. my internet needed no pcs. the public needed to learn no programming unless it wanted to. the public rejected cheap, and bought expensive, wasteful, planned-to-be-obsolete garbage eagerly.
dating services, google, yahoo, amazaon, ebay ... all imitate features of flex; but without being flex.

has cern, mit, sri, congress, microsoft, ibm ... once called illich or me in for consultation? not once. no more than the '49ers asked sutter what should be done with the gold they were stealing from his land.

anyway, impoverished, getting old, after an adulthood of thwarted reform, both of scholarship, of fiction, and of society as a whole, i decide i'd try one last device to try to win the attention of the thieves, to embarrass them if i couldn't correct or save them: i write to english professors at nyu, the group that first hadn't heard me there (even though all of the names had changed). i wrote a black satire: sayin that time was running out. if they didn't finally hear what i'd been trying to communicate with them since 1962, if they didn't hear by say 2007 or 2008, giving them another year or so, i'd come to nyu and bloody their nose, and maybe more than their nose.

understand: this is satire. satire is what pk did before pk invented the internet with ivan illich. satire is what pk has always written.

the postings, and the letters, were filled with meta-signals, with macroinformation, saying "this is not literal."
but nyu, more illiterate than decades before, called the fbi, and the fbi arrested me.

the public defender was a brilliant lawyer, perhaps the most intelligenct i'd ever encountered up close, but he made it perfectly clear: i'd get no more fairness from a trial than i'd gotten from my life. the us was determined to destroy me, and the truth, no relevant considerations, such as the meaning of what i wrote, would be admitted.

well. i'd sought a stage. i wouldn't get one. therefore, the best thing for me to do was to see if i could live long enough to be released: and tell more stories (for the public to ignore).

the lawyer told me that if i insisted on talking about deschooling, and about the stolen internet, the jury could be almost guaranteed to give the judge license for a long sentence. if i pleaded guilty, agreed with the government's falsehoods, i'd go home in a year.

on my return home, my landlord put it differently: "they saw they had made a mistake; but, being who they are, they couldn't admit it: so they gave you the shortest sentence they ever give: fifteen months. that translates as: innocent!"

the judge could have asked me to take down the couple of files nyu was offended by. to stay out of jail, maybe i would have. but he didn't. he just censored the entire section of againsthierarchy.org. why censor two files when you can censor two dozen?
hell, already in violation of the constitution, why not go for total irreversible damnation?

draft didn't progress, all getting moved to pknatz blog anyway

pk's society modules





my home page opened in the early 1990s with a couple of biographical files, then quickly began adding scholarly, philosophical pieces, especially on science and epistemology. by 2006 when i was arrested and my online modules were censored, pk files numbered around 4,000. the bulk of them were housed within a folder i called "teaching." my recent attempt to restore the most important of those files, the science files, the modules i call my thinking tools, got freshly frustrated, google moving a blog out of my control. meantime a few modules from the  teaching / society folder are almost as important. 

2011 07 19 modules i recreated from knatz.com here after my censorship i move to pknatz blog.

thinking tool set update





thinking will routinely seem warped to those using a different tool set. advanced thinking will routinely seem warped to those using a primitive tool set.

would the caveman follow pythagoras' "proof"? would pythagoras have a clue what godel had done? or mandelbrot?

if popper and wittgenstein freaked each other out, how would st. augustine and popper get along? how would god get along with wittgenstein?

2009 11 22
when i posted the above knatz.com was alive and well. when the fed censored my againsthierarchy.org all my domains tumbled. i'd long regarded my thinking tools as the most important section of knatz.com: i labored to recreate some of those modules at my subsequent pktools blog, but never mind: all tools are now being assembled and developed at the thinking tools section of pknatz blog. (at wordpress i can make menus by category (and draw a web of pages!))

knatz.com: redirects





knatz.com now brings browsers to this blog. i'm using  pknatz blog to recreate my censored domains: and when it's a bit better progressed we'll link "knatz.com" there. [as of 2011 07 09 i begin to add all ionaarc posts to the menus at pknatz: thus wedding them (without changing these urls).]

ionaarc is my first blog, it has the most posts. initially it was a supplement to knatz.com, my main personal domain. since the fed scuttled my five domains, ionaarc became the main remnant of my work online (or off).

2011 04 06 i'm very pleased by my new linedancealliance blog.

pkimaging.com was my business domain.
knatz.com was my first personal domain.
macroinformation.org was my science domain, spinning off knatz.com's information theory (knatz.com / teaching / thinking tools / information / macroinformation /).
infoall.org was my dede domain: deregulate — deprofessionalize — deschool: the three being my simplification/expansion of ivan illich's "deschooling."
againsthierarchy.org was the domain i initiated to give space apart from knatz.com for the knatz.com / teaching / society / subfolder social order /.
all five domains were destroyed by fed censorship in 2007 feb.

the name againsthierarchy was intended to suggest opposition to factitious, politically-imposed hierarchines. our idea of "the tree of life," or "vertibrates" reflect natural hierarchy. i'm all for it. churches, temples, represent an idea of magical hierarchy — a creator, a boss, owning everything: i used to be for that. but the church, this nation, the fbi, the army ... represent politically imposed hierarchies. i'm against all of them (and so should you be if you want surviving great grandchildren).

knatz.com had nearly three thousand text files, posts i call modules, all hyperlinked, all part of a coherent view of life, the world, learning, wisdom ... survival opportunities: and thousands of graphics: logos, drawings, photos, art ... knatz.com also republished persecuted and hard to find books: illich's deschooling society, for example. factitious hierarchies, from the school and university education system, to the the publishing industry, to plain old social homeostasis (tarring and feathering the god, the genius, the saint), the same system that elevated pilat over jesus, the temple over god, had made sure than my teaching didn't transmit. my 1970 free learning exchange, unlike my scholarship (or fiction) of the 1960s, found ready free publicity (hard cash needed to build infrastructure: an unregulated internet), but by 1973, flex had been successfully hooded. fewer and fewer learned about our offering (even though volunteers increased for a while!) the government and its cronies, media and so forth, had successfully kept its sheeple in the dark: exactly the way the temple kept god's new messages from the old faithful 2000 years ago.

fed jails tortured me into confessing. my public "defender" passed on the government's threat to jail me for forty or more years, me being then sixty-eight years old, going deaf, half-blind, and wholly broke: a pariah for a lifetime: unemployable: partly due to my obligation to god (my promise to serve christian conviviality by opposing all government coercion: after i'd made an alternate learning system functional (my efforts there sabotaged). this lawyer, admitting that he "may burn in hell for this," that is for not passing my perspective, relevant facts, to the court, freeing the court to pursue its persecution based on misinformation and blocked-information: he saw that i am a disciple of ivan illich and that we were a pair of disciples of christ, but he would do nothing to disabuse the court from the false testimony of the fbi. (the fbi substituted its document, stitched from my words, but not being my prose, not being my meaning, missing my meaning.) i had seen my most important remaining opportunity to lie in staging a last hurrah for deschooling, using my trial as the stage. but no. my lawyer convinced me that nothing of the kind would happen. the fed would convince the common citizenry of palm beach, the county i'd be tried in, that i was a terrorist, plain and simple. no mention of deschooling would be allowed. the jury would not hear of my experience in university where not a thing i tried to communicate was received by the powers, the faculty, the administration, the student body. (imagine a church in which the priests heard only your sins and never the church itself's sins!)

i confessed believing it to be the quickest route to getting back on line, to add my experiences with the fed at knatz.com (and elsewhere, as appropriate). but the fbi stole my computers. they were no longer properly synchronized once they returned them. the fbi had the key to my house, they ransacked everything. i still have some of my evidence against the system, against nyu, for example, but there's no telling what the fbi stole that i haven't discovered yet, may never discover (and if i don't, who will?) anyway: the fed broke me, already broken, as they intended to. they wasted my last couple of thousand dollars. now i'm on welfare: healthy, but helpless. i can't afford dsl. i can't afford to remount one let alone five domains.

i've been recreating some of knatz.com files at my blogs. ionaarc was my first. now there are a dozen or more. i'll list them in a moment: different blogs have different specialties, just as did different folders at knatz.com.

the domain knatz.com was originally purchased by my son, bkmarcus (brian knatz marcus), intended as a birthday gift. somehow title never transferred, which turned out to be a good thing.

pk blogs:


iona arc
macroinformation
infoall
pktools
paulknatz
instic
pkklep
pktheo
pknatzquotes
cybrev

and of vastly less importance:


pkbowdler
hscseniors

there's also a paulknatz blog at wordpress.com, but i haven't yet decided what, if anyting, to do with it.

properly, with a smidgeon of funding, i'd reestablish everything at at resurrected knatz.com! and grow it from there.

news





a woman attacked a gauguin hanging in a museum!
according to court documents, burns said she believed gauguin was evil and objected to nudity in the painting.
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110405/ap_en_ot/us_painting_attacked;_ylt=aof3p9jxzs1eiq8esb88uhxxfb8c;_ylu=x3odmtjoyzj0n2t0bgfzc2v0a2fwlziwmtewnda1l3vzx3bhaw50aw5nx2f0dgfja2vkbhbvcwm3bhnlywn5bl9tb3n0x3bvchvsyxiec2xra3bhaw50aw5nagl0yg--
did the church keep records of people attacking crucifixes in church? maybe because they didn't believe in torture and murder?
what would the us do if someone attacked a voting booth as an inadequate communication tool between slave and kleptocracy?

the white house biographies offer an unusual history lesson. some are examples of blatant boosterism and outdated scholarship. others are oddly selective or politically incorrect.
george w. bush's entry, for example, makes no reference to hurricane katrina or the economic collapse of 2008, but does find room for the names of his dogs.
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110405/ap_on_en_ot/us_white_house_biographies;_ylt=aimqzzamvfk9apiffaldc8vxfb8c;_ylu=x3odmtjuzmx2mm9kbgfzc2v0a2fwlziwmtewnda1l3vzx3doaxrlx2hvdxnlx2jpb2dyyxboawvzbhbvcwm0bhnlywn5bl9tb3n0x3bvchvsyxiec2xra2hpc3rvcmlhbnnxdq--

while both the liver and the brain influence caffeine consumption, "it turns out that your liver, more than your brain, determines daily caffeine intake," said study researcher neil caporaso, of the national cancer institute.  
"you might think, i drink caffeine to feel good, or not to feel bad, but that, in turn, is established by how fast your liver breaks down the caffeine," caporaso said. "if your liver breaks it down very rapidly, then likely you drink more."
http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20110407/sc_livescience/caffeinecravinglinkedtogenetics;_ylt=atd20op6594pejwxhi7mcaaplbif;_ylu=x3odmtnlnwvkc25qbgfzc2v0a2xpdmvzy2llbmnllziwmtewnda3l2nhzmzlaw5ly3jhdmluz2xpbmtlzhrvz2vuzxrpy3mecg9zazezbhnlywn5bl9hcnrpy2xlx3n1bw1hcnlfbglzdarzbgsdy2fmzmvpbmvjcmf2

the gigantic underground plume of partly molten rock that feeds the yellowstone supervolcano might be bigger than previously thought, a new image suggests.

the study says nothing about the chances of a cataclysmic eruption at yellowstone, but it provides scientists with a valuable new perspective on the vast and deep reservoir of fiery material that feeds such eruptions, the last of which occurred more than 600,000 years ago. [related: infographic - the geology of yellowstone.]

earlier measurements of the plume were produced by using seismic waves — the waves generated by earthquakes — to create a picture of the underground region. the new picture was produced by examining the yellowstone plume's electrical conductivity, which is generated by molten silicate rocks and hot briny water that is naturally present and mixed in with partly molten rock.
http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20110411/sc_livescience/yellowstonesupervolcanobiggerthanthought;_ylt=atkzsibb74.bvrn7e9pmx20plbif;_ylu=x3odmtnlbzbrnml1bgfzc2v0a2xpdmvzy2llbmnllziwmtewndexl3llbgxvd3n0b25lc3vwzxj2b2xjyw5vymlnz2vydghhbnrob3vnahqecg9zazmec2vja3lux21vc3rfcg9wdwxhcgrzbgsdewvsbg93c3rvbmvz
almost 17 million years ago, the deep plume of partly molten rock known as the yellowstone hot spot first breached the surface in an eruption near what is now the oregon-idaho-nevada border.

as north america drifted slowly southwest over the hot spot, there were more than 140 gargantuan caldera eruptions — the largest kind of eruption on earth — along a northeast-trending path that is now idaho's snake river plain.

the hot spot finally reached yellowstone about 2 million years ago, yielding three huge caldera eruptions about 2 million, 1.3 million and 642,000 years ago.

two of the eruptions blanketed half of north america with volcanic ash, producing 2,500 times and 1,000 times more ash than the 1980 eruption of mount st. helens in washington state. smaller eruptions occurred at yellowstone in between the big blasts and as recently as 70,000 years ago. ...

pk here now: i've been a doomsday fan since childhood. i've spent my adulthood warning us about dangers that no one wants to heed. (never forget, it's not the boy-who-cried-wolf who owned the sheep the wolf killed! he was behaving badly when he called a false alarm, but the society is doomed that ignores real alarms. the boy was mortal anyway; but did the society have to be?

today's thought





recently i've been posting news files in which i share news from the web. i've been making a new one each month. now i think i'll similarly post a thought of the day page.

what may be true in the long run lacks bearing on those of us in the short run.

the society says the cops are there to protect the weak: but the lynchers know that the cops are there to protect them: the lynchers.

what does big brother want us to think? ( ie, to pretend to think.)
i know, that we're individuals! that we're intelligent! that we're honest!

church: a conspiracy against god, to allow humans to declare that their group is saved, pretending to speak for god. jesus couldn't get a word in edgewise with the temple. other angels can't get a word in against the claimant groups. (similarly a citizen cannot get a word into a democracy: unless it's clear to all that he displays the prescribed delusions.)

news





news for march  mating game: too much choice will leave you lonely scientists have made a surprising discovery: the more options you have for choosing a lover, the likelier you are to end up with no-one. british investigators, in a new study released on wednesday, looked at the strange dynamics of choice in speed-dating, a fashionable way for singles to meet. speed-daters race through a rota of one-on-one meetings, judging each person for suitability after a conversation of a few minutes that ends when a bell sounds. assessing large numbers of candidates was not a problem in itself, the researchers found. in fact, many speed-daters found more potential partners when they were able to cast their net into a larger pool. but this advantage only worked when the available candidates were all broadly similar. when candidates were too dissimilar, speed-daters became confused by many conflicting factors -- and often failed to choose anyone. "there are models of human 'rationality' which posit that variety is a good thing," said researcher alison lenton at the university of edinburgh in scotland. "what will be surprising to some people is that our results suggest that increasing option variety leads to chooser confusion. people are more likely to choose no-one at all when faced with greater variety."  in short, variety is fine... but in manageable doses. http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110302/ts_afp/sciencesexlifestyle;_ylt=agsbziot64dpyshg_bxi0iaplbif;_ylu=x3odmtjoznqxndhibgfzc2v0a2fmcc8ymdexmdmwmi9zy2llbmnlc2v4bglmzxn0ewxlbhbvcwmzbhnlywn5bl9tb3n0x3bvchvsyxiec2xra21hdgluz2dhbwv0bw--

the above reminds me of shopping for clothes when i was a teen. my mother would take me to robert hall in hempstead, there were hundreds of suits, i couldn't prefer one to another. i first became a good salesman when it occurred to me that the same problem might be preventing my prospect from making up her mind and getting out her checkbook. there were six graphics on the display wall, all by the same artist. two were large, they were the same price. i just picked on arbitrarily, said "i think you'll see this best in better light," and carried it to the front window. that's all it took. separated from the wall, separated from the display group, my customer saw that it was removable, transportable. it became clear to her that it could be hers: should be hers. from the window i carried it to the wrapping counter for her. i had broken its, and her, "suction."

scientists skeptical of meteorite alien life claim mar 7 yahoo, links not working today washington – nasa and its top scientists are distancing themselves from a space agency researcher who concludes that he found alien bacterial life in meteorites that were collected many decades ago.
 
pk adds: a pair of young german scientists examined meteorite fragments in the 1940s and reported finding marks that suggested fossils of bacteria-like things. (sir fred hoyle told the story, repeatedly.) that was the end of their careers. 
things haven't changed since galileo, human societies all still belong with lilliput. universities bear all the earmarks of human hubris, arrogance, not letting the other idea get heard.


are the long nights and financial burdens of parenting really worth the emotional benefits? new research is saying no: when confronted with the real economic costs of having children, most parents will exaggerate their happiness to validate their choice to have children."many people believe that to be truly fulfilled in life, it is necessary to experience the joys of parenthood. children are considered an essential source of happiness, satisfaction, and pride,"  richard eibach and steven mock of the university of waterloo, wrote of their study in the march 2 issue of the journal psychological science. "however, the idea that parenthood involves substantial emotional rewards appears to be something of a myth."but, times are changing. since the 1920s, the economic value of having children has been dropping fast. children can no longer work on farms or bring home paychecks, and they demand more financial support than ever before, the researchers say.as children's economic value has plummeted, their perceived emotional value has skyrocketed, becoming, "the economically worthless but emotionally priceless child," as princeton sociologist viviana zelizer wrote in her book, "pricing the priceless child" (princeton university press, 1994).http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20110307/sc_livescience/momdadkidthemselvesoverthejoyofparenting;_ylt=asi2fauerup9zdkrvzqchhaplbif;_ylu=x3odmtnlcm1scmwybgfzc2v0a2xpdmvzy2llbmnllziwmtewmza3l21vbwrhzgtpzhrozw1zzwx2zxnvdmvydghlam95b2zwyxjlbnrpbmcecg9zazqec2vja3lux21vc3rfcg9wdwxhcgrzbgsdbw9tzgfka2lkdghl
elephants naturally understand when to lend a helping trunk much as people know when to lend a helping hand, displaying a complex level of cooperation confirmed only in humans and our closest relatives until now.elephants are widely regarded as possessing advanced brains, displaying levels of intelligence seen only in humans, dolphins, chimpanzees and others capable of higher forms of thinking. for instance, elephants recognize themselves in mirrors, learning that such reflections are images of themselves and not others, behavior apparently unique to species that show complex empathy and sociality.http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20110307/sc_livescience/elephantscooperateprovinghowsmarttheyreallyare;_ylt=ag9kbfebphtxzo2bzdlluseplbif;_ylu=x3odmtnzm3juymnqbgfzc2v0a2xpdmvzy2llbmnllziwmtewmza3l2vszxboyw50c2nvb3blcmf0zxbyb3zpbmdob3dzbwfydhrozxlyzwfsbhlhcmuecg9zazyec2vja3lux2fydgljbgvfc3vtbwfyev9saxn0bhnsawnlbgvwagfudhnjb28-

hundreds of disaffected anglicans left the church of england to become roman catholics on ash wednesday, the christian day of penance.the day set by the church to welcome converts wishing to join the ordinariate of our lady of walsingham, a unique grouping created by pope benedict xvi for anglicans left feeling isolated since the church of england decided in 1992 to ordain women as priests.seach yahoo for the url. i've been meaning to do something on the subject, i'll get to it:briefly: should a church conform to the culture? or lead the culture to a standard?the question conflexifies when we know that the church has altered and misrepresented evidence of the early church since the beginning; specifically: paul's epistles are far from honest about the role of women in christianity. now: do we want to conserve lies? do we want to stick up for choreographed oppression? apparently. make sure that the religion can't be corrected, dissipate the feedback, repress, forget facts.christians pretend to believe in god, but are all atheists. we believe we can get away with anything!we believe that an omniscient god couldn't possibly correct us! it's bad people who need correction, not the kleptocrats who stole the universe.
