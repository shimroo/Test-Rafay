look for oils displaying the api starburst

you can make a difference by recycling your used motor oil.
did you know used oil can be re-refined
into base stock for lubricating oil?
cars are an indispensable fact of life for most
of us. so, too, are abundant and clean supplies
of drinking water. what we do with the used oil
from our cars plays an important role in balancing
our desire for convenient transportation with
our desire for a clean and healthy environment
today and for future generations. 
we are all familiar with recycling newspapers,
aluminum cans, glass, and plastic bottles, but
you may not be aware of the efforts of the petroleum
industry and other groups to promote used motor
oil recycling: providing convenient collection
sites for the purpose of keeping used motor oil
out of our waterways and ground water supplies
and getting used oil into the recycling system.

motor oil has value even after it has been drained
from an engine. the oil you take to a collection
center to be recycled can be
reprocessed and used in furnaces for heat or in
power plants to generate electricity for homes,
schools, and businesses. it can also be sent to
a refinery that specializes in processing used
oil and re-refined into lubricating base oils
that can be used to formulate engine oils meeting
api specifications. 
what can you do? if you change
your own oil, be certain that you take it to a
collection center for recycling. if you take your
car to an automotive service outlet, you can be
fairly certain that they recycle the oil that
they change. but if you're not sure, ask. 
used motor oil that is collected by "do-it-yourselfers"
is critical to the used oil recycling system.
next time you change your own oil, remember, you
can make a difference by recycling the oil from
your car, truck, motorcycle, boat, recreational
vehicle, or lawnmower. by dropping off your used
motor oil today you help prevent pollution and
conserve energy for a safer and healthier tomorrow.
