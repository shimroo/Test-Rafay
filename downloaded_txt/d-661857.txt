president's column



i have just returned from afraq 2024 in hammamet tunisia. what an outstanding meeting. i was inspired by the number of participants and all the different countries represented. there were over 1200 attendees representing more than 70 countries. fifty-five quality exhibitors provided information on the latest products and technology. other booths highlighted great projects involving numerous countries. the program committee pulled together an interesting program representing farms, research institutions, ngo’s, government agencies and more. we owe special thanks to all of the sponsors and organizers including conference chair nadia cherif, the entire steering and national organizing committee, program chairs, peter britz, judith makumbo and nevine abou shabana, the african chapter executive officer, blessing mapfumo, and the entire african chapter board. it goes without saying (but we should thank them more often) that the conference management team did a stellar job organizing the event. the student workers (and presenters) showed great enthusiasm and competence and should give us confidence in the next generation of aquaculture professionals.
