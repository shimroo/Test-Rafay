"everybody has to take a stance on border safety," says rcmp sgt.
a sergeant with the rcmp's border integrity (bi) unit in manitoba says his team is seeing the results of recent investments to increased border security. it's been about a month since the federal and provincial governments took action in response to u.s. president trump's call for crackdowns on illegal migrations and fentanyl trafficking through the canada/u.s. border. those investments included additional boots on the ground by fortifying the bi unit's staffing contingent and deploying conservation and motor carrier unit officers to patrol the border and surrounding area, improved technology and even aerial support. "any extra resources that we have on the border to highlight criminality, trends or intelligence is always welcome. it's a better and more effective way to manage our resourcing," explained sgt. lance goldau. "whether that's an aircraft or the blackhawk helicopter that's become so famous."  related stories:  rcmp touts added tech in enhanced border security push border security focus of federal ministers, premier's tour of emerson port of entry "there's just simply too much at stake not to get this right," says canada's public safety minister manitoba cos now patrolling canada/u.s. border   goldau believes border safety is the responsibility of all law enforcement partners. "(like) working closely with conservation officers or motor carrier enforcement. i can't say enough about our u.s. law enforcement partners, whether it's the country sheriff's departments or u.s. border patrol. everybody has to take a stance on border safety," he said.  it is this collaborative approach that sgt. goldau says has allowed authorities to cover more terrain and share further intelligence in securing the border in manitoba. another facet of working towards improved border security, added sgt. goldau, is involvement from local residents. he says his team relies on information that's reported to them.  "if we don't know what's happening in a particular area, it makes it difficult for us to plan and deploy technology or focus our enforcement and investigative efforts. if i could leave any message with your listeners and readers it is, don't be shy." he encourages the public to report any and all suspicious activity they might see.  individuals can contact red river ibet by calling: emergencies – 9-1-1 (i.e. reporting a border crossing event in progress). 24/7 – (for border integrity emergencies and non-emergent matters) 1-888-man-ibet (626-4238). if members are out patrolling and no one answers, the call is forwarded to rcmp dispatch and any information provided will be passed on to the members in the field. non-emergent matters (i.e. to pass on non-emergent information or for questions) – email: rcmp.dibet.grc@rcmp-grc.gc.ca (emails are monitored on weekdays). keep your eyes peeled to pembinavalleyonline in the coming days and weeks as we hear more from sgt. goldau about how we can help the effort, including what suspicious activity may look like and what to do if you encounter a migrant or human smuggler.
