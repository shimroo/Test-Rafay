jd & amanda




we knew as soon as we were married that we would try for babies, and nothing would stand in the way of our plan. however, after almost a year of trying, we sought out help. i became pregnant on the fourth try, and our wild little maura is everything we imagined and more. there isn't a day that goes by that we don't thank god for this gift.






stacy




as a single mom i felt so blessed that i was able to have a little angel of my own using sperm donation. after he turned 2, i started thinking about the other vial i had and decided it was time to give him a sibling. soon i got a positive home pregnancy test, and found out i was having a girl. i was so happy! i thought i would never get a chance to be a mother and now i have two little angels.






tiffiannii & minerva




we loved our first donor, who represented our blended family well. however, our first attempt at iui failed due to poor calculations; we felt defeated and heartbroken. almost a year passed, and we decided to try again! after countless hours browsing, we found the perfect fit. two and and half months later we discovered we were pregnant with boy/girl fraternal twins! our twins are beautiful, healthy, and at the center of our love and joy.

how many vials do i need?


								national averages range from 3-4 insemination cycles per successful pregnancy.
								we recommend purchasing at least 5 vials per child to guarantee your donor remains available until reaching your personal family goals.
								additionally, you get 1 year free storage if you purchase 4 or more vials ($475 value).
							


							why should i think about storing vials?
						


								our donors sell out and retire quickly! we have thousands of clients forced to choose between a new donor or not having a second child because they chose not to store vials for future use while they were available.
								to help you plan for your future, we offer 3 years free storage if you purchase 3 years+ vials ($1,050 value) - as well as the ability to sell back any unused vials that have not left our control.
