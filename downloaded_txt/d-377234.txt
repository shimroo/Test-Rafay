hidden gem in beachwood canyon! i've done a couple trail rides here and they've all been amazing.

i believe they have the same three options all year long. a one hour trail ride, a two hour trail ride, and then a bbq evening trail ride. i've done all but the bbq one. i am definitely going to at some point because the photos on their website look awesome!

i have taken a couple different groups of friends and they've all loved it. if you don't know anything about horses don't worry! the horses here are so well behaved and trained. plus the trail ride is a walk so you learn everything you need to know from your guide. basic things like how to use the reins. the guide is with you the entire trail ride and again, i can't emphasize how well trained these horses are.

the views are amazing. you get a great view of the hollywood sign and views of the los angeles. the two hour trail ride gives you the best view with 360 views of all of los angeles. at least from what i remember.

you wear a helmet regardless of your level of experience. at least beginner and even intermediate riders do from what i have seen. i haven't seen a lot of really experienced riders there which kinda makes sense given the trail ride is mainly a walk and the horses follow a line. so this may not be as fun for someone with a lot of horse experience looking to use their skills.

a great activity for friends or a date. the guide comes by here and there to check on you. my guide each time i've been has taken photos of us during the ride which is a great touch.

my last guide mentioned sometimes people fall in love with the horse they ride that they end up buying it! it might be me at some point. we bought our tickets online and picked a time for our reservation.

one thing i will mention is the parking can be tough sometimes. carpooling if possible is definitely the way to go. overall, i highly recommend giving them a shot. it will for sure be a great experience! ...

風吹日曬，自由自在 🐴🐴🐴🇺🇸。

人生第一個騎馬體驗選給了hollywood 山，喜歡美國那種自在無拘束的教育方式，沒有亞洲人的太多規矩，可以讓自己學的很快，教練說坐上去就會騎了，ㄧ坐好了沒有各種囉嗦就把我們往山頭帶⛰️ 

在這邊騎馬真的很舒服，好萊塢風景真的覺覺美，另外會這樣選擇是一直想體驗古人山上騎馬🤣，教練也是膽子夠大一直把我們往山邊懸崖邊走，都覺自己快掉下去了，教練說還不夠😆，真的是冒了一身鐵汗💦 

教練還說我騎的很好😝，會前進又會退後的要我直接到最前面當帶隊的🤣.. ，聽到直接嚇屬人，等等帶錯路就完蛋😶‍🌫️。

早安 騎馬嘍 🐴🐴🐴 🇺🇸
以前都只有坐在馬兒上拍拍照🤳🏻，第一次的騎馬就給hollwood 拉～ 
選了ㄧ個最初階版的，以為會有騎馬教學之類，美國人真的太刺激了，說坐上去就會騎了😆，就直接教練帶路hollywood 山上騎馬，然後教練一直要我們加速還要騎山邊😆，太刺激了～ ， 西方人的教育我喜歡👍🏻🇺🇸，都是直接來的
