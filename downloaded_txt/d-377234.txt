hidden gem in beachwood canyon! i've done a couple trail rides here and they've all been amazing.

i believe they have the same three options all year long. a one hour trail ride, a two hour trail ride, and then a bbq evening trail ride. i've done all but the bbq one. i am definitely going to at some point because the photos on their website look awesome!

i have taken a couple different groups of friends and they've all loved it. if you don't know anything about horses don't worry! the horses here are so well behaved and trained. plus the trail ride is a walk so you learn everything you need to know from your guide. basic things like how to use the reins. the guide is with you the entire trail ride and again, i can't emphasize how well trained these horses are.

the views are amazing. you get a great view of the hollywood sign and views of the los angeles. the two hour trail ride gives you the best view with 360 views of all of los angeles. at least from what i remember.

you wear a helmet regardless of your level of experience. at least beginner and even intermediate riders do from what i have seen. i haven't seen a lot of really experienced riders there which kinda makes sense given the trail ride is mainly a walk and the horses follow a line. so this may not be as fun for someone with a lot of horse experience looking to use their skills.

a great activity for friends or a date. the guide comes by here and there to check on you. my guide each time i've been has taken photos of us during the ride which is a great touch.

my last guide mentioned sometimes people fall in love with the horse they ride that they end up buying it! it might be me at some point. we bought our tickets online and picked a time for our reservation.

one thing i will mention is the parking can be tough sometimes. carpooling if possible is definitely the way to go. overall, i highly recommend giving them a shot. it will for sure be a great experience! ...
