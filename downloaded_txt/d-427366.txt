1st sorrowful mystery... the agony in the garden





dear children! i am calling you to that love which is loyal and pleasing to god. little children, love bears everything bitter and difficult for the sake of jesus who is love. therefore, dear children, pray that god come to your aid, not however according to your desire, but according to his love. surrender yourself to god so that he may hear you, console you and forgive everything inside you which is a hindrance on the way of love. in this way god can move your life, and you will grow in love. dear children, glorify god with a hymn of love so that god's love may be able to grow in you day by day to its fullness. thank you for having responded to my call.

2nd mystery of light... the wedding at cana





dear children! today, little children, i invite you, through prayer, to be with jesus, so that through a personal experience of prayer you may be able to discover the beauty of god’s creatures. you cannot speak or witness about prayer, if you do not pray. that is why, little children, in the silence of the heart, remain with jesus, so that he may change and transform you with his love. this, little children, is a time of grace for you. make good use of it for your personal conversion, because when you have god, you have everything. thank you for having responded to my call.

5th joyful mystery... finding jesus in the temple





dear children! i call you to prayer, to have an encounter with god in prayer. god gives himself to you, but he wants you to answer in your own freedom to his invitation. that is why little children during the day, find yourself a special time when you could pray in peace and humility, and have this meeting with god the creator. i am with you and i intercede for you in front of god, so watch in vigil, so that every encounter in prayer be the joy of your contact with god. thank you for having responded to my call.
