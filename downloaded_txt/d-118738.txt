positive 
        coaching alliance 
in 
        any given year, more than 4 million volunteer coaches work with more than 
        40 million young athletes in the u.s. youth sports helps children learn 
        about determination, commitment, hard work, teamwork, and empathy while 
        increasing self-confidence and positive character traits. 
unfortunately, 
        these opportunities are often squandered because of the win-at-all costs 
        mentality of some youth coaches and parents. 
our 
        drills are based on the positive coaching model. we encourage you to review 
        our site often for updates and to submit any drills that you find helpful 
        for your teams so that we can all help each other become better coaches  
 welcome

when 
        you're well prepared, coaching youth sports is one of the most rewarding 
        experiences you will ever have. your philosophy should be simple, if the 
        kids learn and have fun they will come back next season.
