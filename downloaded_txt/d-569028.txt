ecml programme













programme 2024-2027
language education at the heart of democracy
(2022)1 on the importance of plurilingual and intercultural education for democratic culture provides the overarching framework for the ecml’s 7th medium-term programme, “language education at the heart of democracy”. this first ever holistic recommendation, embracing all languages, all sectors and wider society, reinforces the role of quality language education in equipping learners to become autonomous social agents, actively engaged in strengthening our democracies. 
with its unique position at the interface between policy, research, teacher education and classroom practice, the new ecml programme will focus primarily on activities to support and further develop the wellbeing, resilience and competences of all those working in the field, so that they in turn can empower their learners.  in this way, it aims to transform language education into a vibrant force at the core of democratic ideals.
