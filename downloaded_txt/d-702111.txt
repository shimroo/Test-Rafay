what we do 



identifying profitable market regimes 







philosophy 







“the trend is your friend” – this is a timeless saying on wall street for good reason. identifying and investing in trends remains one of the most profitable investment strategies, supported by decades of practitioner results and robust academic research.rather than trying to predict market directions, the key lies in identifying strong emerging trends early and capitalizing on market movements to maximize profits. 











proven researchframework 







our research framework goes beyond just simply tracking price movements, which often causes late-in and late-out effects. by systematically analyzing the participation rate of the broader market, including sentiment from smart- and dumb-money positions, our research uncovers emerging trends faster and with greater precision than traditional methods.these trends are then classified into six predefined market regimes based on their strength and direction, ranging from ‘very high reward’ to ‘very high risk’. each market regime has its specific risk-/return profile – providing a clear statistical edge. 











delivering results since 1999 







since 1999, our data-driven research has helped subscribers identify strong emerging trends, distinguish between trend reversals and temporary pauses within broader movements and minimize the risk of unfavorable entry or exit points.
