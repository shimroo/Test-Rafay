founded in 1921, booksellers aotearoa nz is the trade association for booksellers in new zealand.

we work to help bookselling businesses grow and succeed through advocacy, information, business products and services. we convene the bookseller community together for education, professional development and industry wide marketing activities like aotearoa nz bookshop day. 
a volunteer board of booksellers governs the association.
