the perfect place to stay in camden






couldn't have had a better experience. the hosts were friendly and informative, the food was delicious and the room was just adorable. exactly the kind of quaint little new england b&b that i hoped it would be. and within walking distance of downtown camden! just perfect.ian m. - tripadvisor

















close to everything!






friendly, knowledgeable hosts; roomy & appealing surroundings; trail to mt. battie overlook is a short walk from the back door; town kayak/canoe/boat landing close by;short walk to downtown shops and numerous waterfront dining choices. oh, and a great cooked-to-order breakfast!ekharmon14 - tripadvisor

















best vacation we've had in years!






"bliss" is the perfect word to describe camden windward house.serene, quiet, beautiful grounds, comfortable beds with an ultra-clean and charming turn of the century atmosphere. my family and i relished in being attended to, accommodated, and quite frankly spoiled.excellent service and personal care was the key to the outstanding windward house experience.a daily, home-cooked, made to order breakfast with local farm-to-table ingredients was fabulous! (gluten-free & vegan options are available too!) a perfect start to rev up for hiking, sailing, touring, shopping, etc. evenings were spent in the gardens by fireside reconnecting with family & friends - complete with readily available libations.if you are looking for the perfect place to relax and recharge - windward house is it.msg_luvs_maine - tripadvisor

















best b&b in camden ...hands down !!!!






we have stayed in camden many times at different locations but decided to change it up a bit and choose a b&b that we have never stayed in before. we are so happy we did.  windward house was so pleasant, the rooms were spacious, breakfast was great and the gardens were beautiful. since the new owners took it over several years ago they have worked non stop to upgrade every aspect of the inn. dan and matt were unbelievable hosts and couldn't have been nicer!! we had a huge room with its own entrance and large deck ( the quarterdeck ) and what's great about this inn is that you can basically leave your car parked and walk to the camden city center as it's only a block away!!jupiterdave - tripadvisor

















lovely b&b with delicious breakfast






my husband and i had a great time staying at the windward house in camden. matt and dan we very hospitable and we loved the delicious breakfast. it was a nice bonus to be able to select from a menu of different options.faraway178239 - tripadvisor

















mountain view chalet






stayed in quarterdeck- so cozy with fireplace and wake up with beautiful views of mt battie and all the fall color trees in foreground. dan and matt are great hosts we enjoyed getting to know. their property is immaculate and excellent location so close to town. made to order breakfasts were delicious as were the “barney” (bloody) mary’s. great place to stay for a camden visit!kent f. - tripadvisor
