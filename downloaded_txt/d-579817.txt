we make the smallest, lightest, dot fmvss 218 certified helmets, period. you don't have to believe us!, the 2007 dot test results prove it beyond doubt.


nexl® sports products, llc certifies nxt helmets to dot fmvss 218 at the same independent test facilities nhtsa use. dot compliance testing of our helmets confirms our ongoing certification. 

read all about it at dot certification. dot has published data of their helmet tests in , 2010 and 2009. we analysed the data to see how well our patented hdpe liner performs, read about it at new technology.



all nxt helmets, model -05, -101, -151 and -201 are certified to dot fmvss 218.

nxt dot helmets are at least 25% lighter and smaller than any other dot certified helmets. nxt helmets also meet astm roll off, edge anvil and kerb anvil tests. eps dot helmet liners are at least 1.3" thick, our patented hdpe dot helmet liners are 1.0" thick, any liner thinner than ours will not meet dot energy, penetration and retention requirements and will exceed the 300g limit of astm, cpsc and snell helmet standards.

  1/2 nxt dot helmet model -05, with or without our mini visor, 700g, 25 oz.

for you cruiser enthusiasts, many of our nxt -05 half helmets were used in star
      
      motorcycles' new  roadliner dvd, you can get your own copy of the dvd

chit chat.

  hang your nxt helmet over the cissy bar?, secure it!, we have seen too many that "flew off" and one that slipped down and jammed between the disc rotor and the frame, the rotor acted like a meat slicer and took off a good inch of helmet before it broke loose. remember, your helmet is lighter and lifts and flies away quicker. 

  
  steven s in ft myers beach bought a vtx1800 and got insurance quotes for   one with $10,000 no helmet pip, one with a dot helmet. the difference, $400, so he bought an nxt helmet and saved $250 in the first year, nice! 

thinking of custom paint? let us know as you place your order. dan m. bought 1/2 and 3/4 helmets and sent them to rick corgan in fl. 
  
  be-unique.com 
  
  to paint with his bike. here are pictures of the 3/4 helmet.
  
  







larry l. sent a 1/2 helmet to carl brouhard in grass valley, ca.

 brouhard designs.com 

 to be painted with his bike. we've seen flames before but not like this, this helmet looks like it's on fire.









motorcycle riders ask for pictures of our helmets on someone. craig   an early santa cruz county bike helmet buyer in 2001 came by to visit, he now lives in texas, here he is in his original helmet, upgraded to -05 and still going strong on weekly rides.








technology.

kiss goodbye to '60s technology, nxt helmets are designed to iso headforms to be more aerodynamic and form fitting in three shell and six liner sizes, no wads of "comfort padding". 
the lower weight, smaller size, improved helmet aerodynamics and better fit make for real riding pleasure. 
no neck and shoulder fatigue, no more bricks bouncing on your head or being choked by a parachuting bucket that wants to fly away.
we kid you not, helmets you literally forget you are wearing so you can enjoy your ride. check the new technology page and the unsolicited reviews and testimonials pages written by some of our many happy motorcycling customers.




only nxt helmets use our 

dual lamination hdpe foam liner covered by us patent no. 6,070,271. 

no other helmet can use nexl® technology, nxt is the lightest and smallest dot helmet.
