new leadership for the new year!
president's message by 2025 mvca president callie smith 

i am deeply honored to have been elected as the president of the mid valley claims association. first and foremost, i want to acknowledge the outstanding leadership of bryan harrison and our previous board. their dedication and hard work have set a high standard for us all. i am equally excited to welcome the new class of directors to our board, along with our new and returning members. together, we have big shoes to fill, but i am confident that our collective talents and commitment will lead us to success.
as we embark on this journey, i am truly excited about our upcoming events and educational opportunities. these initiatives are designed not only to benefit our members but also to contribute to the growth and development of our association.
it is a privilege to serve all of you and lead our organization towards new success. i look forward to working closely with each one of you. together, we can achieve great things and make a lasting impact in our industry.
thank you for your trust and support. let us move forward with enthusiasm and determination!
warm regards,
callie
