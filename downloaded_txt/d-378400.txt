as a follower of jesus, you know you are called to share the gospel, but sometimes knowing how to do that can be difficult. we want to help! at the league we have a method that is simple, repeatable, and effective: it is a 3-step process called read carry share®.








send god’s word to where it’s needed most
billions of people around the world have never experienced jesus through the word of god. we’re on a mission to change that.
together, league members and strategic partners have the opportunity to invite 20 million people to meet jesus by the end of 2025 by reading the gospel of john. for just 39 cents, you can reach 1 person with a gospel.

other ways to give



eft/ach
electronic funds transfer (eft) is a secure way to deliver your gifts directly and automatically from your bank to the pocket testament league. as with online giving, eft donations allow us to minimize administrative expenses. when you make an eft gift, your bank disburses the funds automatically according to your instructions until you decide to stop. you may extend your contribution into installments over the entire year. to direct your gifts via eft, please utilize the upic account number listed below.
donor advised funds
if you already have a donor-advised fund (daf), you can direct funds from your account to the pocket testament league.
our government issued ein number has been provided below to assist you in directing funds from your daf for the purpose of funding gospel sowing initiatives.
donate by check
make checks payable to the pocket testament league. if you’re donating in honor of someone or want to direct your donation to our operating costs or a specific project, please write that in the memo of your check.
tax receipts will be mailed within four to six weeks after the donation has been processed.
donate stock
make a larger impact by gifting stock and donating long-term appreciated securities, including stock, bonds, and mutual funds, directly to the pocket testament league. compared with donating cash, or selling your appreciated securities and contributing the after-tax proceeds, you may potentially increase your gift and tax donation.
contact rich wilson, rwilson@ptl.org, to learn more about various stock gift options or to get the process started.
