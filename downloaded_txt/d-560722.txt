welcome to wyvern medical


many people suffer from xerostomia (dry mouth) for a host of reasons e.g as a side – effect of other medication or necessary treatment for an underlying condition. it can also be a common complaint of elderly patients in nursing homes and hospices.
wyvern medical was first established by a uk pharmacist who, seeing the impact that dry mouth was having on his patient’s quality of life, wanted to offer effective relief .
having researched the key components of human saliva, the team went on to develop saliveze dry mouth spray and moi-stiks.
both products continue to be made in cambridge, england.
saliveze is supplied in a 50ml pump spray, making it ideal for use on the move. effective, mild tasting and ph neutral, saliveze is one of the most widely prescribed dry mouth sprays in the uk.
moi-stiks tend to be used in hospitals and nursing homes. they offer   effective management of oral hygiene and dry mouth issues on the ward or home-care environment. again they are mild and ph neutral and are gentle on the mouth and lips.
wyvern medical ltd are committed to helping people with dry mouth and often attend training sessions in nhs hospitals as well as supporting patients at support groups around the uk.
