more about aztec signs
samantha (sam) bryant has owned and operated aztec signs since 2007. a natural commercial artist and professional graphics designer, sam proved her skills as head graphic artist in the high-volume environment at joe batey signs in des moines, iowa from 1996-2000.
in 1999 sam and her husband morrie, an experienced signman since 1966, moved to dallas center and in 2000, they established their own full-service sign manufacturing and service business, aztec art & sign.
as this new business evolved, it proved more cost-effective and headache-free to abandon morrie's high-maintenance electric and neon service part of the business, and focus more on the commercial signage needs of our growing list of walk-in customers of the dallas county area: dallas center, adel, waukee, grimes, desoto, earlham, van meter, etc.
as a result, morrie retired as a signman (not that he doesn't offer his "occasional" critiques) at the end of 2006, to become a semi-retired website developer. sam became sole owner/operator and renamed the company aztec signs.
in addition to our versatility and workmanship, there are other advantages in having aztec signs help you with your signage - years of sign design and production, competitive pricing, and honest, friendly service, for starters. we hope you will give us a try the next time you are considering a sign project.thank you for your interest!samantha (sam) bryant, owneraztec signs320 n 14th stadel, ia  50003515.817.4827
