if you only do one thing, do it wellone of toronto’s oldest independent coffeeshops, jet fuel is a local landmark with a unique roast that lives up to its name.  there’s no menu, but just ask and we’ll make you whatever you like. all espresso-based coffees (no drip), and a great selection of hand-packed teas. hot or cold lemon-ginger that’s pressed while you wait. pastries baked fresh every morning. come early, they sell out.
