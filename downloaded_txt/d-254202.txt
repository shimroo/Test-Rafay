anecdote to the overwhelm



feb 9, 2025




our gospel reading this week is a familiar one: jesus tells fishermen to cast their nets again, and they miraculously catch more fish than their boats could hold! jesus tells them to follow him and become "fishers of people." this story is often interpreted to mean that jesus' disciples have the role of bringing people to jesus or to "the faith." while sharing our faith with the people around us is important - i don't think that the idea of trapping people and dragging them into our faith sounds like something jesus would endorse. in fact, it sounds a lot like the forced conversions that were common during the colonization of many lands across the world - an evil twisting of our religion to empower bloodthirsty empires.

i wonder how you would answer this question: what role does scripture play in your life? that’s the question i asked the wednesday study group… what role does scripture play in your life? the answers were varied, of course. some read the bible every day, or have read the whole thing. and others relate to scripture primarily on sundays, and appreciate the lectionary that gives us a variety of scripture texts in a three-year cycle. we discussed memories of confirmation requirements long ago to memorize verses. shared bible stories that are important to our faith and verses that have been used to harm or condemn.

a sign



jan 19, 2025




but i wonder why she chose that moment to push jesus.  wine at a banquet? jesus has the power to heal the sick and open the eyes of the blind! why is it so important that jesus’ first sign be this one? jesus seemed to think that this problem was trivial as well - he refers to his death and resurrection when he mentions that “his time has not yet come.” there are more important things on his mind. things with eternal ramifications. and his mom has him creating more wine for a banquet?! why did this need to be jesus’ first sign?
