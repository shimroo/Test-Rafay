the albert & vera weisbord archives

this is the internet archives of albert & vera weisbord, leading communist
radicals of the 1930's. organizers of 1926 passaic textile strike, 1929
gastonia textile strike, leaders of the communist league of struggle 1931-37.

albert weisbord was born in new york city on december 9, 1900 of poor
russian jewish parents. he graduated phi beta kappa from the college of
the city of new york in 1921. upon graduation from ccny he applied for
the harvard law school ("not so much to study law, but to examine at close
hand how law was the resultant of the action of social forces.") graduating
with honors.

albert joined the brooklyn branch of the socialist party, by 1920 he
became an active organizer. in 1921 he was elected national secretary of
the young peoples socialist league and later a member of the national executive
committee of the socialist party. in 1924 he was a delegate to the convention
of the conference for progressive political action. soon he would resign
from the socialist party to join the workers (communist) party. he moved
to paterson n.j. where he formed the united front committee of textile
workers, and involved himself in a strike of silk mill workers in west
new york, n.j. from there he was on to passaic where he organized a strike
of over 16,000 workers. in passaic he met vera buch.

vera buch was born august 19, 1895 in forestville, connecticut. as a
child, she survived poverty in the tenements of new york. vera attended
hunter high school (valedictorian) and hunter college where she won three
first prizes in french competition among colleges in the usa and canada.

in a tuberculosis sanatorium vera first became interested in the class
struggle. in 1919 she joined the left wing of the socialist party, beginning
a long period of work as a labor activist. she soon joined the industrial
workers of the world, and then the communist party when it first formed
in 1920. in 1922 she joined the workers (communist) party. in 1926 she
was sent to passaic to help in the strike, there she met albert weisbord,
who like vera was a committed revolutionist.

after passaic albert and vera were involved with the miners in the coal
fields of penn. (united mine workers) and in 1929 the gastonia textile
strike, where vera was arrested for murder. in 1930 albert and vera separated
from the communist party and were briefly associated with the left opposition
that was led by james p. cannon and max shachtman (communist league of
america). at one point albert was a trotskyist but by 1931 he had moved
outside of the left opposition towards a policy and program of his own.

in 1931 "the communist league of struggle" was formed with its official
organ "class struggle". during the entire publication of class struggle
(1931-1937) albert was the main contributor. in 1932 albert visited with
leon trotsky for three weeks in turkey. latter he traveled to germany and
spain, of these visits articles can be found in the collections of class
struggle.

in 1937 albert's book, "the conquest of power" was published, in 1964 his book 
"latin american actuality" was published. vera's book "a radical life" was published
 in 1977 by indiana university press.

albert weisbord died in 1977.

vera buch weisbord died in 1989.
