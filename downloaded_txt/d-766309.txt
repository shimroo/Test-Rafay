the emotionally strong leader workshop
addressing the feelings of others in the workplace can be a terrifying proposition. for many leaders, asking what lies behind the actions and reactions of their people is akin to opening pandora’s box. they don’t want to find out what’s lurking inside. many managers don’t know how to deal with — and they fear — their employees’ emotions.
in this session, you will learn the emotional skills and mental strategies needed to be stronger and more intelligent than your feelings and help others learn to explore their emotions. emotions should not be feared but celebrated. a wealth of amazing possibilities are available if we learn to harness the superpower of our feelings.

municipal world needs to be in the tool box of every municipal leader across our nation. the resources and update to date information give leaders insight and food for thought, plus well needed guidance on policy, best practices, and networking opportunities. i read the monthly magazine and listen to the mw shares podcast consistently, plus have read numerous books that are available through the municipal world online store. solid governance comes from informed leaders that have a vision for success, and municipal world can help both elected and administrative leaders create thriving communities. thank you, municipal world and keep up the fantastic work!





cheryl fort, mayor
township of hornepayne










i have thoroughly enjoyed reading all the articles in municipal world these past 10 years.  i find the topics always very timely to our community’s situations.  in some cases the articles have given excellent solutions to issues we are facing.  further to that, my two favorites are the george cuff and peter de jager articles.





leslie groulx, cao
district of clearwater










municipal world magazine shines a bright light on the pressing issues that confront local governments across canada. the greatest value, though, come from the case studies and best practices shared in the magazine each month from communities that have not just survived, but thrived, in the face of such challenges. it is a must-read publication for our chamber.





bob hammersley, president & ceo
st thomas & district chamber of commerce










after 25 years of municipal work, i have now moved to my next chapter of private consulting. i am glad that i am able to keep a municipal world subscription as it keeps me informed, updated and aware of important information, trends, and announcements.





tracey pillon-abbs, rpp, planning consultant










during my diverse 25+ year career in municipal government, there have been many, many changes in legislation, technology and societal values. but one constant has always been the ability to rely upon municipal world for articles that provide valuable information and insights into current issues. when one considers the positive impact of this on the quality of governance in canadian communities since the magazine was first published in 1891, municipal world magazine has created an incredible legacy.
