it's the law! 



did you know? 



hosts/sponsors of multi-day dance events, social dance clubs, dance instructors and deejays are required by u.s. copyright law to have permission from the artists to play music at classes, parties, and events? yes, that is the law. the national fastdance association (nfa) provides these permissions, i.e. music licenses to dance clubs, dance events and instructors, as well as deejays. we help our affiliates to save money on these music licenses, often saving them more than 50% of what they would pay by going direct to the pro’s.

what we believe 



we believe in supporting publishers and songwriters for the music they provide so we can continue to dance and enjoy their music. we believe they have earned and are entitled to their music royalties, monies distributed to them by ascap, bmi and sesac, the three largest  performing rights organizations (pro’s) in america.  every fall we negotiate licensing fees with the pro reps.  with over 400,000 dancers under our national music licensing umbrella, we are in a strong negotiating position to ensure that  our affiliates benefit by keeping licensing costs to a minimum.

music licensingcopyright laws require music users to have permission from songwriters and publishers in order to play their music publicly. music artists in america usually join one of the three performing rights organizations, ascap, bmi, and sesac. the national fastdance association has entered into licensing agreements with all three organizations so that our members may come under the umbrella of protection that our licensing agreements provide. music licenses can be secured for dances, parties, and classes, as well as for multi-day events. our prices are much lower than the pro's, so its a great deal and an inexpensive way to avoid unnecessary risks.
