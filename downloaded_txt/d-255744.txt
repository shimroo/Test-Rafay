junior nac results - chatham yacht club - july 24

eight boats raced the junior nationals under a daylong fog that seemed to get thicker as the day progressed. a windward-leeward course was used as patrol boats monitored the boat counts around each mark. amidst constantly changing wind directions,  cody lamoreux and barb shipley finished first and will take home the hardware come saturday night.
