our auggie is now 10 months old and we brought him home at eight weeks. we are amazed at what a fabulous and healthy dog he is. he was potty trained by 11 weeks. he has been great with kids,  at and even our bird.he is the happiest, most easy going dog we’ve ever had. we showed up out of the blue after visiting a different rescue and adopted auggie in about an hour and a half. we don’t know his mix, lab something, but whatever it is is perfect. our experience was and still is great.

lifeline puppy rescue is a no-kill rescue for young puppies throughout the rocky mountain region, kansas, & new mexico. 99% of the puppies we rescue come from city and county shelters. we like our mom & pop, friendly, small town image. people like adopting lifeline's puppies and giving them a chance at life. the lifeline connection to small towns and rural areas is crucial. when we work together, puppies no longer have to be destroyed.
