hello there. 

my name is jason beaird, nice to meet you! 👋 i’m a design leader, ux professional, front-end developer, user researcher, and general web nerd located in orlando, florida. i first encountered the internet through a lynx text browser in a dial-up bulletin board. i’ve been fascinated by it ever since.
while i love great design and designing things myself, i’m also a tinkerer. i enjoy solving problems and tend to find myself in the gray area between design, product, and engineering. i’ve been working with digital product teams for over a decade 15 years at mailchimp, powerdms, paylocity, and currently as a senior manager of product design at sprout social.
you might also find me threading about my own user experiences, sharing family adventures, running, organizing ux meetups, riding my onewheel, or sipping on a craft brew.
