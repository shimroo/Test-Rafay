“because i was losing my eyesight, couldn’t drive or see to cook, i could only walk to the 7/11 a block away and was living on slim fast and m & m’s for a year.  i was hardly gigging and got so depressed i really didn't want to live anymore. the jazz foundation found me, they got me eating again, i got my strength back. they called me every day, i got my hope back. they hooked me up with these school gigs, then the cats in ny started to call me again for club gigs. they brought me back to life.”cecil payne

“when katrina hit i lost all my belongings and all my music and was relocated to texas. the jazz foundation made it possible for me to come home and go back to work. without their help my music would have stopped. they put new orleans musicians to work when there was no work, and that helped us all more than i can say.”wardell “mr. big stuff” quezergue

“when i broke my hip, the jazz foundation saved my home, made mortgage payments when i had to cancel my tours, and even visited me in the hospital. i don't know what i would have done without them.”odetta gordon

“after my accident, i was bedridden and in so much pain i couldn't work. for years they kept me and my wife jeanie from losing our home. they paid our mortgage, sent us healthy food and called every week. they even wheeled me onto the stage at the apollo theater and gave me a lifetime achievement award. they let me know i wasn’t forgotten.”little jimmy scott

about us
the jazz foundation takes care of the very people who have always taken care of you.
they’ve been playing to the soundtrack of your entire life.

when you learned to dance, who was playing?
when you fell in love who made it more meaningful?
and when you broke up, who played the music that let you cry and then got you through?

and now, you can be there for them when they need you. what would life be like without blues, jazz, soul, rock, pop, and r&b? you will make it possible to pay someone’s rent and keep them from eviction or homelessness when illness, accident, or old age prevents them from working.
our musician’s emergency fund provides housing assistance, pro bono medical care, hurricane disaster relief, and financial support to musicians and their families in times of crisis. through jazz and blues in the schools and other performance programs, we create purpose and dignified work that bring live music to thousands of public school kids without music programs, in 17 states across the country.
whatever the need is, we don’t just fix the problem, we become family. we believe that love and creative solutions are needed to heal the lives of creative hardworking people who have already contributed to making this world more beautiful. because of you, jfa now assists in 7,000 cases a year, nationwide.
