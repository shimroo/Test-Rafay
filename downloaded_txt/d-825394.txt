the airgraver® is a 
  self-running, miniature air engine tool using no springs or electricity. just 
  blowing in the handpiece will cause it to run. as this is impractical, the 
  handpiece utilizes one of two types of  controllers. one controller is a set of 
  regulators that attaches to an air compressor and a foot pedal. the second 
  option is a palmcontrol® handle that automatically uses the natural palm 
  pressure of the user on the entire handle to control and vary the power of the 
  tool. even if a person is accustomed to foot 
  pedal engraving, a few minutes with the palmcontrol® is all it takes to 
  realize the improved responsiveness. the hand is more sensitive than the foot 
  and capable of subtle corrections. because the tool is self-contained, there 
  is no constant background noise or vibration from a separate power unit.    
 

most professional engraving 
  artists and jewelers could probably engrave with any tool and turn out nice 
  work given enough time, however tools with improved design help make the hand 
  engraving process easier and quicker.  the airgraver® is the most 
  advanced system for intuitive ease of use for the professional or beginning 
  engraver.  to discover the difference, enroll, support and learn 
  engraving from hand engraving 
centers and schools where all equipment on 
  the market is made available for students to work with.  the staff and 
  instructors of these schools are not paid to sell equipment and therefore are 
  unbiased. they are willing to allow students to decide for themselves what 
  works best for them.

the lindsay 
         palmcontrol® can increase the speed of learning compared to foot pedal 
         engraving. this is because the palmcontrol® is intuitive and natural in 
         the sense that what is done with your hand is what you get.  there 
         is no need to learn to coordinate continual foot movement to every hand 
         movement.
