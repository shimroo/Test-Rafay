  death road - safe, professional and fun  - we had a marvelous experience with kenneth, sdenka and wilster on death road mountainbike tour.
the entire experience from the pick up with complementary and good breakfast until the individual... read more drop offs war just perfect.
riding death road is challenging, you must be safe on the bike and the guidelines from the guides are lifesavers. and kenneth and sdenka were friendly, professional and made sure we had a fantastic and safe(!) time.
the complementary food and snacks during the time were more than sufficient and of good quality. the bus were very well supporting us with our personal belongings and food whenever possible. 
this agency might be a bit more pricy than others, but the small group, the professional guides and not at last the that great pictures were taken so that we could concentrate on riding down, made it worth to pay this add up.
best tour i had so far in south america. thanks to kenneth and the entire team. highly appreciated!
