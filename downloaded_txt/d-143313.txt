send quote as zen card





february 18th, 2025


do not say, “i understand! i have attained mastery!”


if you have attained mastery, then why are you going around asking other people questions? as soon as you say you understand zen, people watch whatever you do and whatever you say, wondering why you said this or that.


if you claim to understand zen, moreover, this is actually a contention of ignorance. what about the saying that one should “silently shine, hiding one’s enlightenment?” what about “the path is not different from the human mind?”






                                                    foyan (1067–1120)
