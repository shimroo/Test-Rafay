history of ronkonkoma



the indians considered the waters of lake ronkonkoma sacred. four of the thirteen tribes on long island shared its shoreline. these tribes were the setaukets, the nissequogues, the secatogs and the unkechaugs. evidence of when the first indians visited the lake is sketchy, but the activity of the indians in the ronkonkoma area is perhaps best evidenced by the vast collection of arrowheads and other stone weapons that have been gathered within the radius of a few miles of the lake. many of the present legends about the lake derive from these local indian tribes, the secatogs, unkechaugs, setaukets, and nissequogues, who utilized the shores of the lake. it is thought that the name ronkonkoma, which in the algonquin language means boundary fishing place, was chosen as a logical name by the indians for this body of water.
