love

reason alumni love wc—faculty, staff, and coaches


3
top reasons families choose wc—christian, academics, peer influence


97%
of parents rate our faculty as very accessible, encouraging, qualified





love might seem like an unconventional way to talk about a school…
but we know this: when kids feel loved, accepted, and part of a community, that’s when learning takes flight. and for us, it’s not some abstract concept. it’s at the foundation of how we help every student grow as a learner and a capable leader.

learning




how we approach learning is what makes us distinctively christian.

our faith-based approach to education isn’t an overlay to the curriculum and student experience. it’s woven into all that we do. and when done in tandem with love, not only do we get to see students who love to learn, but also we instill in them the ongoing love for learning.

opportunities
we see opportunities as another key to unlocking student interest and long-term potential

as our students progress in their educational journey at wc, so do their opportunities to engage in what interests them most. for a small private school we offer more opportunities per student than our peers, from arts and athletics to mission and service, and student-led clubs. and because our students are known and loved by our faculty and staff, we can help identify opportunities for even the most reluctant students to get engaged and discover their gifts.



















		wc’s youth basketball program may have opened a door for the moore family to discover wc, but their story goes much deeper than sports.
