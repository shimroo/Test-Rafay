toenail fungus


1. toenail fungus  

nail fungus is made up of tiny organisms that can infect fingernails and toenails. 
these organisms are called dermatophytes. 

nail fungus is very common. more than 30 million people in the united states have it under their nails. 

a nail fungus infection is also called  onychomycosis. 



the nail fungus moves in under the nail. the nail provides a safe place for the fungus and protects it while it grows. that's why it's so hard to reach and stop nail fungus.

most often, nail fungus appears in the toenails. this is because socks and shoes keep the toenails dark, warm, and moist. this is a perfect place for the fungus to grow.

ridged fingernails

the organisms that make up nail fungus can sometimes spread from one person to another because these organisms can live where the air is often moist. this can happen in places like shower stalls, bathrooms, or locker rooms, or it can be passed along when you share a nail file or clippers with someone who has a nail fungus infection. nail fungus may also spread from one of your nails to other nails.

symptoms of nail fungus

most often, the tiny fungus gets under the nail and takes hold. anything that damages a nail can make it easier for the fungus to move in, such as: an injury (like banging a fingernail with a hammer) or tight shoes that pinch the toes

toenail and ridged fingernails

toenail

toenail, the signs of toenail infection and athlete's foot, singly or combined, are drying skin, itching scaling, inflammation, and blisters. blisters often lead to cracking of the skin. small raw areas of tissue are exposed, causing pain and swelling. itching and burning may increase as the infection spreads around the toenail area.

athlete's foot may spread to the soles of the feet and to the toenails. it can be spread to other parts of the body, notably the groin and underarm's, by those who scratch the infection and then touch themselves elsewhere.

toenail, the organisms causing athlete's foot may persist for long periods. consequently, the infection may be spread by contaminated bed sheets or clothing to other parts of the body.
