     pricing and website errors

  




  while we do our best to ensure our website is as concise and accurate as possible, occasionally an error may pop up in our software. we reserve the right to make the final call on any pricing errors.



   ordering by phone

  




  we will be glad to assist you on the phone, but we prefer orders to be placed online. that way there is no confusion or incorrect entries – since you are entering the information directly by yourself instead of relaying it to us. if you would like to place the order on the phone, please have all of your information ready (i.e. preview the order sheet beforehand so you know what we will ask for). this saves time for both you and us. if you aren't sure of what pcm you need for your car's pcm programming, give us a call so we may assist you.



   sending in a pcm

  




  please include correspondence when sending anything into us. if your vehicle also has a tcm, please send that in as well (ask us if you are not sure). tell us your name, contact information, and the reason for sending in your pcm/etc (i.e. core return, reflash, etc). when sending in a pcm, please pack it carefully. we recommend wrapping in bubble wrap and securing it with packing paper/peanuts to keep it from getting slammed around in the box. depending on the pcm, you should ensure it for $100 - $300+.



   international orders

  




  for international shipments, we use usps, ups, fedex, or we can quote any shipping you want. if our website does not allow you to process an international order, please email us and we will take care of it for you.please note that ups and fedex are generally more expensive than shipping with usps. additionally, usps is generally lax in updating their delivery information. do not panic, sometimes a package will be detained in customs for a few days. so far we have not lost any international packages or had any issues.we do ship to apo addresses but our software cannot process a shipping quote. please fill out your order sheet online and then call or email your payment information. shipping is generally $10-$15 for a typical pcm going to an apo address via usps priority.



   order processing

  




  generally, an order for tuning takes 2-3 days to process and ship once we have received both an order sheet and a payment. if we are out of stock on a core, you will be notified. pcm programming that is sent in receives first priority. they are normally shipped the next business day. if you are sending in a pcm or pcm programming, it is wise to call or email to verify that we will be open when your pcm arrives so that are not sitting here for a week over a holiday, etc.products are shipped as soon as possible. occasionally during heavy ordering periods we run out of stock. you will be notified if we are out of stock, and given the option to wait or receive a refund. please note that your credit card is charged when the order is placed, not when it is shipped. this is how the software works and we do not have control over that so we apologize for any inconvenience.when your order is shipped, we will forward you a tracking number so that you can check on its progress.



   domestic shipping information

  




  generally, we ship our pcm programming 
through ups, when over $15.00 shipping. our website will calculate shipping automatically, but if you need a quote on something special, please call. when ordering, please provide a physical address as ups does not ship to po boxes. lastly, please note that ups and fedex are generally more expensive than shipping with usps.



   return policy

  




  tuning: due to the nature of our business we do not issue refunds. it is similar to buying an audio cd at your local music shop. we are custom building programs specifically for your needs. we do however take great pride in our work and it is a pleasure to help you achieve an excellent running car. things you can do to help us make our tune better is to provide catalogs, scanner readings, dyno sheets, or just a really helpful description of the problem. with our experience, we can also help diagnose other problems which may be interfering with the tuning. by purchasing a tune from us you accept our return policy.products: pcm programming 
products are accepted for return within 30 days of purchase date. you must contact us first before sending anything back. pcm programming 
and other products must be new, not removed from packaging or installed. we do not reimburse original shipping, and you are responsible for the return shipping. there is a 10% restocking fee. we reserve the right to make the final call on what is and is not eligible for return (i.e. if parts arrive damaged or appear to have been installed). custom ground camshafts and cylinder heads are not eligible for return under any circumstance.
