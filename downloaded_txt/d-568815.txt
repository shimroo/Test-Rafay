the
spirit of ria
university
 

 
what does the ria in ria university mean?
 
ria university (ru) may also be called ria university. dr.
charles tandy developed the ru concept while he was in malaysia, but he
was undecided about its name. while in malaysia, dr.
tandy constantly noticed the word ria and wondered about its meaning. he
found that in malaysia this
very popular word means lively or alive. 
 
when dr. tandy started using the name ria university for his
special kind of interdisciplinary educational institution devoted to life
extension, he found that many would spell it ria or r.i.a. university. thus
dr. tandy declared ria interdisciplinary action university or r.i.a. university or ria university or ria university to be
acceptable alternative spellings of ria university. ria university or ria interdisciplinary action university or r.i.a. university or ria university or ria university is an
interdisciplinary quest for intellectual excellence and compassionate
commitment. we of ru seek to extend life in both quantity and quality. 
 
the dares and dreams of ria university
 
we invite you to dare to
dream and join the adventure! we of ru expect to expand our creative ideas,
research endeavors, and educational activities beyond those presently envisioned.
presently, however, we are working on (or working toward) the following
projects: 
 
1.
the ru concept and website domain. we own the ria.edu domain.
with the ria.edu website we began preliminary intellectual construction and
implementation of ru more than a decade ago.
 
2.
ria university mall, including ria
university
bookstore. this was easy enough to do on a preliminary basis by
simply connecting our website to the products of amazon.com .

 
3. ria university press. this has
been actively implemented for over a decade and continues to be successful,
averaging the publication of several books each year (including the annual
death and anti-death series of anthologies). (see www.ria.edu/rup for more information.)
 
4.
ruias. the ria university institute for advanced
study
has been articulated in enough detail on our website so as to allow
fund-raising and limited implementation. (see www.ria.edu/ruias
for more information.)
 
5.
ibp. international baccalaureate®
programme:
an organization known as the international baccalaureate® offers high quality
international education via a worldwide community of schools. with reference to
ru, this project idea has not yet been developed in detail but the intellectual
construction of this programme (as distinguished from its implementation)
should not be difficult. the folks at www.ibo.org
already have more than 900,000 ib students in over 140 countries, yet each ib
institution is unique. the spirit of ru and of the ib mesh
extremely well. it is just a matter of fine-tuning to our own needs and
vision.    
 
6.
segits. self-sufficient
extra-terrestrial
green-habitat
intentional
transparent
[self-replicating]
communities: this ru project idea has been conceptually developed by dr. tandy
to some extent. dr. tandys work here so far has been on social-political
issues. the physical science and technology conceptual groundwork was of course
initiated first by the late dr. gerard k. oneill, then nasa, then the lifeboat
foundation, among others. for some of dr. tandys preliminary work, see the
websites www.segits.com and www.ouromniverse.com .
 
7.
cahb. cryobiology
applied
to human
biostasis:
this ru project idea has not yet been developed in any detail. other
institutions are of course implementing major aspects of this sort of activity,
ranging from teams of cryobiologists engaged in developing biological
vitrification procedures and technologies, to several longstanding cryonics
societies. cahb would expect to be on friendly terms with cryobiologists,
cryonicists, and the swiss organization dignitas. 
 
8.
healthspitals. one can envision the
future possibility of cahd-related research institutes, hospices (perhaps
including hospice ships in international ocean waters), anti-disease hospitals,
pro-longevity healthspitals, etc. 
 
9.
time travel. this ru project idea has
so far been conceptually developed by dr. tandy only to a limited extent.
(likewise, the related personalitypreserver program of the lifeboat
foundation has been developed only to a limited extent.)  for some of dr. tandys preliminary work, see
the websites www.helphachi.com , www.ria.edu/papers , and www.omniversephilosophy.com . 
 
10.
and more
 again, we of ru expect to expand our
creative ideas, research endeavors, and educational activities beyond those
presently envisioned. for only one example, ru may want, at least sometimes, to
work closely with other educational institutions such as the lifeboat
foundation <www.lifeboat.com> and
with other universities such as the singularity university <www.singularityu.org>.
