how to personalize an award


engraving advice








make our crystal awards and trophies extra special by creating a meaningful personalization message that will really move and impress the recipients. if you are looking for creative ideas on how to personalize an award or a trophy please consult the following reference composed by our most experienced staff.
 
please remember that personalization layout may vary on the nature of award and branding guidelines of your organization.  your logo must be placed on the award according to those guidelines.
 
award personalization text usually contains a combination of the following elements:
logo, recipient's name, award name, congratulatory message, year.  some customers
choose to include a meaningful quote if an etch space allows it.
award personalization message should be short and sweet, in this case - less is more.
 
when choosing an engraving font make sure it compliments your logo font and does not
clash with it.   we can engrave multiple fonts on each award.

famous awards and trophies










in october 2003 the former president george w. bush senior presented our crystal awards in the presidential library.
  

when we were approached to design the awards for america's promise organization we were thrilled and honored. 
     we immediately assigned our most skilled crystal artists to work on the awards. 
      their crystal creations demonstrated the highest standards of craftsmanship and quality.
 
 

      the awards were presented to deserving and exceptional members of american community who pledge their commitment to america's youth.
      presented in six categories, the awards recognize a community, a state, a business, a civic/service organization, a school/college or university, and a faith-based institution for their work to fulfill the five promises to youth.
