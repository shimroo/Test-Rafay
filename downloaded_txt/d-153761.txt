the strength of the college’s curriculum is what drew me to it, and it’s what allowed me to expand my opportunities and accelerate my career through that knowledge.



heather welsh
cfp®, aep®, msfs














 

the college has always been there for me, with some of the top thought leaders in the business as part of their curriculum. i don't know how else i could have gotten a world-class education in specialized financial planning knowledge without a distance learning partner like them.



scott winslow
msfs, chfc®, clu®, ricp®, aep®, ccfc














 

the college’s education has been like body armor for me. i’ll absolutely be a lifelong learner.



terry parham
msfp, cfp®, chfc®, clu®, ricp®, wmcp®














 

what i learned at the american college of financial services gave me the confidence and knowledge to get creative with helping business owners and others in need of succession planning fund their own retirements.



irv rosenzweig
cfp®, chfc®, clu®, crps®, aep®, aif®














 

the american college of financial services is the citadel of knowledge. applied knowledge is power, and it’s allowed me to explain complex issues in a way clients and their advisors can understand.



mickey rosenzweig
clu®, chfc®, aep®














 

when i’m talking to someone who wants to be a part of our team, it definitely sets them apart if they have a designation or degree from the college. we have developed our own career progression, and enrolling in a college program is a huge part of that.
