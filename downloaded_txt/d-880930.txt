“the title alone sums it all up well: drooker’s primal connection to the city lays everything bare. don’t bother with clothes for this party. come as you are or as you’ve never come before. . . . drooker is in a league all his own. there are pages after pages of sheer urban delight, gorgeously rendered architecture and exquisite interiors . . . like a brilliant broadway show, there is a story here that matters and adds up quite nicely. as the narrative marches onward with a majestic score in the background, the three main characters face life head on, naked and unafraid.”—the comics journal

“drooker’s comment on the sacrifices inherent to the pursuit of the arts feels both timeless and of-the-moment, thanks to his spot-on critique of late capitalism. any creative to ever question their craft or purpose will find themselves reflected here.” —publishers weekly “romantic, existential, timeless. beautifully drawn and beautifully told, like a dream!” —sophie crumb“stunning artwork, beautifully executed—a master class in graphic storytelling!” —peter bagge“eric drooker’s work is the poetry of broke, rebel new york, of the squats and punk brass bands and fire escape love stories, and flowers that grow from the toxic waste.” —molly crabapple“a heartfelt ode to the city and the artists who make it feel alive. drooker is a master of composition and exquisite design; he makes the city sing in these drawings! this book is visual poetry.” —edel rodriguez
