train like an astronaut
space camp has been helping inspire the next generation of explorers for more than 42 years. this internationally known program with more than one million alumni is based on nasa astronaut training and focuses on teamwork and leadership skills. launched in 1982, space camp has inspired and motivated young people from around the country, and later the world, with attendees from all 50 states, u.s. territories, and 150 foreign countries. we offer space, aviation and robotics camps to children between the ages of 9 to 18, adults of all ages, families, and educators.
