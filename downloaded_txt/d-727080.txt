washington university - hr at the link
designed around an integrative “employee experience framework,” washington university’s human resource office communicates its mission and values through a layered design approach. concentrating on the dynamic relationship between well-being and inclusivity, graphic and interior design are utilized to create a space with robust experiential design. the reception area welcomes visitors with an installation of dimensional, tonal letters elegantly introducing this department’s five areas of focus: mind/body, financial, work-life, culture, career.  the branded neon-look light mounted to an oak paneled wall creates the entry focal point, signaling that you’ve arrived. an abstract floor to ceiling graphic mural skillfully weaves the word ‘human’ into a network of symbols representing the human condition using unique iconography. this piece anchors the adjacent work café and conference center tying together color, texture, and brand identity. at the premiere corner windows, a custom pendant fixture hangs, depicting the university’s shield that gives subtle brand recognition at street level. capping off this comfortable lounge area, this feature is designed to be a modern representation of the university’s iconic logo at one of the most well recognized intersections of the city.

washington university - chancellor's office
the chancellor’s suite is a second-floor renovation of an iconic university administrative building. originally completed in 1902, the building is divided into two wings with a central linear hallway bisecting the plan and connecting public entries and vertical circulation at each end. this renovation attempts to foster workplace communication, collaboration, and transparency, eschewing the traditional higher-educational model emphasizing privacy, hierarchy, and seclusion. great sensitivity was used to honor the building’s classical ordering system while reflecting contemporary values. within the suite, central bearing walls were minimized to create a reception area and open office.  the project achieved modeled leed platinum certification exceeding the stated client goal of leed silver.
