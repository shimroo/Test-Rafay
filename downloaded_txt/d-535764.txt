importance of priming before painting drywall



freshening up and probably changing the color of the wall to spruce up the area is the purpose of commercial or residential painting. thus, you most probably desire long-lasting outcomes if you opt for a textured or smooth wall.  

however, when it comes to drywall there are things you’ve got to consider. the joints may show under the skin paint since these panels are nailed and taped. today, we’re going to share with you the importance of priming and why it helps you avoid drywall repair in the future. 
flaws are covered properly 
for those who don’t know, a primer can act as a seal. aside from blocking out the penetration of paint into the drywall, it can also hide minor imperfections as well. while drywall repair is important before painting for the best possible outcomes, small flaws are easily covered using the primer. also, it insulates the walls better and offers protection against drywall damage since this is an additional coating.  
to make things simple, you’ll get a uniform look since the primer will become the base that will protect both the color and the drywall.  
paint sticks better 
one of the best advantages of primers is better paint adhesion. you can consider it as a glue. this will make the paint stick to the surface. also, that is excellent news because it will keep the paint intact for a much longer period. aside from that, since the paint won’t be absorbed by the drywall, it will show off the color you pick. this is especially vital when you paint walls using dark colors. they will not fade away down the road.  
also, another thing is that walls are cleaned easier and it does not affect the color since the paint sticks better on drywall whenever you prime first. it is ideal to apply one coating after priming instead of two coatings without priming. 
save time and money 
it is tempting to ignore priming and go ahead with the residential or commercial painting, right? of course, you might think of that additional coating coverage as a waste of time. however, that is not the case. you’ve got to prime the drywall before painting on it most of the time. even though a lot of people consider it a waste of time, primers can save time. aside from that, it can also save money. the reason for this is that they help the paint to dry a lot quicker. else, they’ll be absorbed by the material and will require more time to dry. also, you do not really have to apply two layers of coating. if the drywall is in excellent shape, one layer of coating is enough. this is particularly true if you aren’t trying to paint white over black.  
is priming really necessary? 
to make things simple, it is vital to prime after installing new drywall. the new surface will be porous. thus, it will absorb the paint’s color. however, if you pick a paint-and-primer in one, you will not have to prime the drywall.
