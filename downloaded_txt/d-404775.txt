               chronological     history 
 
 

the   brooklyn   and   jamaica   rail   road   company    chartered   april   25,   1832     

the   long   island   rail   road   company    
chartered   april   24,   1834  



  the   brooklyn   &   jamaica    rail   road   the     long     island      rail     road 
                    
 and             atlantic     avenue                     
  
 
the   brooklyn   and   jamaica   rail   road   was   chartered     to   run   from   the
 

 
  

  
   atlantic   street   ended   just   east     of    flatbush     avenue. the   brooklyn   and   jamaica   right   of   way   from   here   to   classon   avenue   was 80   feet   wide.   (the   southerly   80   feet   of   atlantic   avenue   when   extended  east)
  
the   long   island  rail   road   company 

 the   long   island   rail   road   charter   called   for   the   road   to   be   built 
   




 
as steam was not allowed in the city of brooklyn,   from 1836 until 1839 trains were pulled by horses between brooklyn and bedford.   
   

  bedford 

a map accompanying a notice of a january 1835 auction of property  showed bedford avenue and "the proposed route of the branch railroad  to  the  contemplated   ferry   at  the  wallabout"  in  williamsburgh. 

 

 

 
 we read that the brooklyn and jamaica established a station at classon avenue with a railroad yard and wood pile.    
this map shows the property of the b. and j. on both sides  of their right of way.   this was 
the terminus for steam 1836 - 1839.   by 1851 atlantic street (avenue),   70 feet wide,   had been extended as far as classon  avenue - it then curved and ran into fulton avenue.   (30 feet of 
their rightof way had been ceded by the brooklyn and jamaica.)   since the 1860's atlantic street (avenue),   has run parallel with  pacific street  from here to east new york.





this map shows the private right of way of the brooklyn and jamaica between schuyler street and herkimer street.   schuyler  street was widened to become  atlantic  avenue.  one block of the right of way between bedford avenueand nostrand avenue remains today as herkimer place.


after the railroad was expelled and atlantic avenue was extended to the city line.  

  
  1836 
  in february 1836 one or more trial runs were made by the long island rail road. 
 
on february 3 the long island farmer reported: 


  
the ariel, built in 1835, was matthias w. baldwin's nineteenth engine.  post boy was built in 1836.

  sidney schaer's article in newsday disclosed an accident which disrupted service on may 3, 1836.
  
                                                

  


                                                


 december 1 1836 the brooklyn and jamaica was leased to the long island 
 
 

 
the railroad's third engine was the "hicksville",   built in 1836 by the locks & canals company of lowell, mass.  
its design  was that of stephenson's planet type locomotive,   a   2-2-0.  this engine was the first with "whistler's trumpet",   later   nicknamed "whistle",   after the builder's superintendent george w. whistler.

de  lancy   avenue  is   shown   and   flushing   avenue   is   not.   






de  lancy   avenue 

the   avenue   and   station   may   have   been   named   for:   
"right   reverend  william   heathcote   delancey   (october   8,   1797      april   5,   1865) 
the   son   of   john   peter   delancey,   a   revolutionary   war   soldier,   was   a   bishop   of   
the   episcopal   church   in   the   united   states   of   america." 
thanks   again   to   wikipedia   (  wikipedia  )   for   this   information.
 

we   had   never   heard   of   delancy   avenue   (or   flushing   avenue   at  this   location),   never   seen   it   on   a   map.     now   we   have   this   part  of   an   1839   map   from   the   new   york   public   library's   website.  
    new   york   public   library's   website 
 

the   property   identified   as   "delancy"   was   south   of   newtown   and  east   of   maspeth.    (we   show   this   but   it   really   doesn't   prove   anything.)  

the   1830   united    states   federal   census   showed:  
 "name:   william   delaney  
[warren   delancy]  
home   in   1830:   newtown,   queens,   new   york" 


 

thanks again to wikipedia we offer additional information about the delancey family:
   
stephen delancey (etienne de lancy in french) (october 24, 1663, caen  
november 18, 1741). 
the de lancy family were minor french nobility ("noblesse de france 

royale") and, despite being of the huguenot faith, delancey was to become 

one of the most successful merchants in the colony of new york with his 

well-known granary, warehouse and retail store, known to all as "delancey 

and co."
he played an active role in the life of the city and married anne van 

cortlandt.  three surviving sons (james (17031760), peter (17051770), and 

oliver (1708-1785). 
 
delancey street (new york) is named after james delancey, sr.,  whose farm was located 
in what  is now the lower east side. 
james de lancey was lieutenant governor of the colony of new york,  
served as chief justice of new york and presided over the 1735 trial of 
journalist john peter zenger. 
his son, captain james delancey (17321800), took over the family drygoods 
business and went into new york politics. 
oliver de lancey became a senior loyalist officer in the american war of 
independence. 
right reverend william heathcote delancey (october 8, 1797  april 5, 1865)
the son of john peter delancey,  a revolutionary war soldier, was a bishop of 
the episcopal church in the united states of america. 
his eldest son, edward floyd delancey, was president of the new york
genealogical and biographical society and an author.

1953   research   by   edna   huntington,   long   island   historical   society  librarian,   showed   that   connecticut   avenue   became   woodhaven   blvd.   actually   it   became   flushing   avenue,   trotting   course   lane,  woodhaven   avenue   and   then   woodhaven   boulevard. 
 
 
connecticut   avenue   station   was   probably   the   later  trotting   course   lane   and   then   woodhaven   station

  this june 1838 article implies that steam may have pulled trains between henry street and  bedford preceded by horse drawn cars.   or  the trains were preceded by horse drawn cars for some distance east of bedford.    a regular horse car service was established between south ferry and bedford.   the locomotives were disguised to resemble horse cars   -   dummy engines.  this is  the first arrt has ever read of this entire operation.  



 
 the same june 1838 newspaper shows a change of schedule

 



on july 4 1839  the new locomotive "taglioni" was placed in service  and the track to hempstead was opened from  hempstead branch -   later mineola   -   to a terminal on main street.  like   the   "hicksville",   "taglioni's"   design   was   that  of   stephenson's   planet   type   locomotive,   a   2-2-0. 
  
from hempstead news july 3 1839 

                     
"taglioni" was one of only two locomotives built by  poughkeepsie  locomotive  engine  company.  


from new york times and commercial intelligencer, april 4 1839.  



  from john h. white's history of american locomotive builders.   he uses "taglione".




 

"taglioni"?     perhaps!  




j. h. innes wrote in the long island railroad information bulletin:
   





  marie  and paul taglioni  
 
 the "taglioni" was named for   
marie   taglioni,    comtesse gilbert de voisins (23 april 1804  22 april 1884) who was a swedish ballet dancer of the romantic ballet era, a central figure in the history of european dance. she was one of the most celebrated ballerinas of the romantic ballet, which was cultivated primarily at her majesty's theatre in london, and at the théâtre de l'académie royale de musique of the paris opera ballet. she is credited with (though not confirmed) being the first ballerina to truly dance en pointe.    from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

  
or for marie's brother paul.   or perhaps their famous family    
 
paul taglioni was born in vienna in 1808 and died in berlin in 1884. he was the son of filippo, brother of marie, and father of marie the younger. he was trained in paris by his father and coulon. his other daughter, augusta, became a famous actress in berlin. paul made his debut with his sister, and remained her partner for many years. he married ballerina anna galster in berlin. anna and paul toured america in 1839.      from andros on ballet    


in   1841   the   taglioni   was   renamed   the   "john   a.   king"

carman's river station was at or near the later milleville 
 (or millville) station which became yaphank in 1846.  

 
 

   
 
many main line stations provided stage connections with villages on the north and 
south shores - medford for patchogue and bellport for that south shore village.   
fire place,   now brookhaven,   was served by a main line station by that name.

 service   begins   to   greenport     

and   to   boston   

the annual report for 1844 informs us that:

"....the entire line is opened, and has been in successful operation through its whole extent since the 29th day of july last."  
"upon the completion of the line immediate steps were taken to 
establish ferries,   to form a connection with the norwich and stonington lines,   and on the 9th of august last through trains 
were established to connect boston and new york.   regular trains were established between greenport and brooklyn,   and in november last arrangements were made with the post office department and the stages running along the shores of the island,   to form cross lines,   intersecting the railroad at various points."
"the income of this road has been earned under many disadvantages.   the incomplete state of the tunnel at brooklyn,   and non-arrival of the freight cars ordered for the line.....have all tended to keep down the revenue;   and the income.....has far exceeded the anticipations of the directors."

from   the   brooklyn   daily   eagle 
thursday july 25, 1844:   "we are gratified in being able to state that the road is finished through to greenport, and that a trip over the whole route, by the president and directors of the company and their guests, will be made on saturday next (july 27). we shall endeavor to make one of the party, and reserve our comments, therefore, for the present. the road will be open for travel on monday (july 29)."
on monday july 29 the eagle had a multi-column article describing the "grand excursion and dinner - three hours and a half to greenport."
a timetable dated july 26 and appearing on page one states:
"completion and opening of the road to greenport.   96 miles.on and after monday next, the 29th july, accomodation trains for the local business of the island, will run as follows..... 
leave brooklyn at 3 p.m. every day (sundays excepted) for greenport.....returning, leave greenport depot for brooklyn at 5 a.m. ..... light freight and packages taken by the passage train.the above arrangement affords an opportunity for the residents of sag harbor and greenport, and all other parts of the island, to remain in new york five hours, and return home the same evening."
"due notice will be given of the connection of the road with the eastern lines to boston."
on july 29 the same timetable is modified:"the 3 o'clock train from brooklyn and the morning train from greenport will discontinue the following stops, viz: east new york, union course, brushville, carll place, and westbury. these stops will be made by the way train to and from hicksville."
a timetable dated august 8 and appearing on page three of the eagle for august 9 states:
"long island railroad in connection with boston - through by daylight.a train will leave the depot at brooklyn on friday, 9th of august, at 8 o'clock a.m. for greenport,whence  passengers will be taken to stonington in the sound steamer narragansett, and proceed immediately to boston.  on the following day the steamer new haven will carry passengers from greenport to the norwich and worcester railroad, and alternate in this manner until further notice. ..... "baggage crates will go through to boston unopened. fare through, $4.50. meals extra.rooms with seats for four persons, can be secured the evening previous at an extra charge, as far as greenport."
the brooklyn daily eagle of august 13 had this article:

the new york & jamaica rail road company was chartered  september 3, 1859 to build from jamaica to hunters point  and opened may 10, 1861 - there was a   "newtown"   station. 
 
  brooklyn and jamaica property extended as far east as  rockaway turnpike.    the long island station was east thereof.

the new york & jamaica rail road company was chartered september 3,  1859 to build from jamaica to hunters point and opened may 10, 1861    
   in 1861 the long island rail road was paid by the city of brooklyn  to close its tunnel and abandon service within the city limits.         hunters   point   became   the   new   terminal.

the may 11, 1861 american railroad journal reported: 
 "on the sixth inst the freight trains commenced running between greenport and the depot at hunters point.    since that date no freight train has been started from the south ferry depot,    and no freight has been received at that point since the 4th.    an office has been established at the james slip ferry,    new york side,   both for the receipt and delivery of freight.    passenger trains also commenced running to and from hunters point on the 10th.    hereafter passengers for the trains will take the ferry boat at james slip, or at 34th street for hunters point."
  from vfs part two:
"as of april 1, 1862 operation of flushing trains onto the long dock at the mouth of newtown creek was discontinued, and all trains ran in and out of the l.i.r.r. depot. at the same time the flushing r.r. got rid of its ferry operation into fulton market slip and the lease of the ferryboat mattano, and passengers now used either the james slip ferry or the thirty-fourth street ferry."

at this time of racial strife and dissension we offer this:   
 
  
when i went to work for the long island rail road in 1954 a black man could only be hired as a
  laborer,   a porter to serve and clean up after whitey,  a gateman at a grade crossing, 
or a hostler to  move locomotives around yards and refill the coal and water.   he 
could not get hired as  a fireman but in the south he could and could shovel coal, keep the 
steam up and fill the tender  for the white engineer but never be promoted to the right side 
seat in the cab.    e.g.,  sim  webb, casey jones' fireman. from wikipedia:   "jones' african-american fireman, simeon t. webb (born may 12, 1874), died in memphis on july 13, 1957 (http://condrenrails.com/mrp/other-passenger-stations/poplar_avenue_station.htm states he died on the 15th) at the age of 83."  this article is from the babylon "signal" of july 1, 1882.  



  
  
is    this    any    way    to    run    a    railroad?
  
an   1882   newspaper   stated   that   it   was.   
 
 
   



   
 


    
now   here's   a   thought

for the scripture says, "workers should be given their pay."

the   good   neighbor   policy   
 


thomas jefferson had advocated close,   friendly relations with latin america.


president coolidge sent dwight morrow to mexico in 1927 as our ambassador.  he considered mexicans as human beings and approached them in a friendly,   sympathetic spirit. 
 
in his first inaugural address in march 1933,   president franklin roosevelt gave the policy its name   when he stated:  
"in the field of world policy,   i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor,    the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and,   because he does so,   respects the rights of others".

we do not display photographs of fatal wrecks.
especially the 1950 wrecks which we remember. 
and we heard some nasty stories - which we will not repeat - from people who were there.
but we have just acquired two 1950 rockville centre photos, which are not gruesome or bloody, which show the gauntlet track and eastbound home signal. some thought that gauntlet tracks had been outlawed after the 1893 parkville tunnel wreck. but the p.s.c. allowed the railroad to install one on the temporary rockville centre tracks. "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."

on saturday august 25 and sunday august 26, 2007,  long island rail road passengers were being transferred to buses between mineola and hicksville.   ronkonkoma trains were operating via the montauk branch and the central branch requiring a reverse move - and probably a second engineer -   at babylon and at bethpage junction.   why?   
because a bridge was being rolled into place   beneath the tracks at roslyn road mineola.   ain't the way it was done fifty or so years ago.
