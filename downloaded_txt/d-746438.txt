new york city




july 18 2005


for years, every woman admitted to the rikers island jail had to undergo a breast exam, pelvic exam, and a pap smear or be placed in medical isolation. inmates filed a class action lawsuit against the city for allegedly violating their rights by requiring strip searches and by coercing gynecological exams. the settlement requires administration to inform female jail inmates of their right to refuse gynecological exams without fear of being placed in isolation.
