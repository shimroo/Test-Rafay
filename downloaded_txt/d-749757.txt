  notable accomplishments

since its establishmentâ in 1994, awief has concentrated its efforts in rural villages of the democratic republic ofâ congo, africa.   		
		
					
we have built one of the best schools in the katanga 
					region of the democratic republic of congo.
the school provides preschool through technical 
					education in a village that had no electricity, toilets, or 
					sanitary water supply previous to our arrival.
with tuition at $7.00 (in 2010) per month, a basic education is 
					within reach for a typical local family. 
we provide free tuition for orphans and a work-for-education program for parents who cannot afford their 
					childrenâs tuition. 
fully equipped school workshops to train students and 
					make furniture for schools and goods for local markets.
in 2010, brought hydroelectricity substation to school and village 
computer lab teaches it skills and, in 2017, full kahn 
					academy lessons for 1st through college levels in english 
					and french.
we have shipped over 300 computers to schools in congo, 
					cameroon, nicaragua, liberia, and kenya.  
we are continuing to build schools in other villages in 
					congo that are self supporting and self governing.
starting in 2017, wambuyu tech is supporting a project 
					under the direction of mbuyu wambuyu (puma, our founder) to 
					build seven schools and a government polling center in the 
					kabongo territory of drc. 
nurturing projects in mali, cameroon, kenya, and other 
					regions of congo, some of which are now independently 
					operated.
