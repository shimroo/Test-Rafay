stories



from our guests



the closest to perfection



“it’s hard to find perfection, but our experience at wolf mountain vineyards was as close as you can get.  the staff and service was as professional as you can find. everything is taken care of and you hardly know they are there, and the food is as appealing to the pallet as the setting is to the eye. not to mention the best wines in georgia. there is not enough room in a short testimonial to say how enjoyable the experience was. many people came up to me and say this was the best wedding they had ever attended and you folks had a lot to do with it. “ - harmon snipes








your jaw will drop



“this eclectic winery, restaurant, event venue is full of surprises at every corner. number one star if the place is the wine. its really, really great. the food is amazing too. i loved walking around the place and learning about the history and unreal guitar collection by the gift shop; your jaw will drop! the views are spectacular and the vibe is upscale casual, easy to just sit and drink and hang out with friends or family. have fun with it. put on the floppy hat and flowy dress but if not dressier casual is fine too. they have a sunday brunch tht is amazing. we love this place a lot!!!”- p ta

















































wow! a lovely time.



“wow! we had a lovely time. the wine tasting was simply exquisite. the dynamic scenery and the lunch was fabulous. your staff is most hospitable, in the restaurant, in the tasting room and of course the ladies at the front desk. we plan to come back for a visit in the fall. blanc de blanc brut…keep up the good work. i am keepsaking the bottle!”  - thelma v




















i love everything about



“i love everything about wolf mountain creek vineyard. i've been to quite a few vineyards all over the us including napa and this might just be my favorite. besides the wine being outstanding. i think i've tried them all now. great job to the winemaker, brandon! it has the most charming but laid back, relaxing vibe. and the landscape is beautiful. you can drink wine on the patio with the most gorgeous views of blue ridge mountains off in the distance. the food and service is over the top too. i've decided there is nothing they can't do. can't wait to come back on my next visit to georgia.”- liesel herrera








i would give 10 stars



fantastic place!  we celebrated our son’s wedding last weekend and they did a great job!  i would give them 10 stars if i could!  great food, great staff, great venue all the way around.  thank you wm for making our special day so memorable!  all of our family and friends commented how wonderful everything was!- mark traub
