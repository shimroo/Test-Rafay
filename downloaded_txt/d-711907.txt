compete 












hosa members are encouraged to take full advantage of the hosa competitive events program, a constantly expanding and improving series of health care related competitive events. competition within a state is held in the spring as a means of identifying those members eligible for competition at the hosa international leadership conference. imagine the pride that members feel when their names are called and they stand on stage waiting to receive a hosa medallion for recognition as a first, second or third place event winner.
