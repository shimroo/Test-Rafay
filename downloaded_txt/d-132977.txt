as a wild gold rush town in the 1870s, the first permanent structure where denver now stands reportedly was a saloon, and the city boasted a theater with sold out performances of macbeth long before it had either a school or a hospital. so it comes as no surprise that mile high city nightlife continues at full gallop, with downtown and what's known as lodo  that stands for lower downtown -- especially hot to trot. with ten venues offering 10,800 seats, the denver performing arts complex is among the nation's largest performing arts centers, second only to new york's lincoln center in seating, and the largest in the world under one roof. covering four city blocks, the downtown artistic complex includes the new opera house, the 2,600-seat boettcher concert hall (the nation's first symphony hall in the round), the 2,800-seat temple buell theater, and the auditorium theatre, with a $62-million renovation. overall, denver boasts some 30 theaters including the circa 1929 paramount theatre for music, comedy, dance, films and evenings with celebrities, more than 100 cinemas, and dozens of concert halls, nightclubs, discos, and bars.

downtown capitalizes on mainstream fun, while lodo, the city's oldest region, boasts the trendiest places, often jammed and rocking into the night. clubs range from country-and-western to sports, comedy, and jazz. coffee bars are big, too, both downtown and on capitol hill. sports bars include lodo's bar & grill, with a patio overlooking coors field, sports column, with an outdoor rooftop café, the adam's mark hotel's players, and espn zone, with non-stop action amid 100 screens. glendale has become a magnet for topless bars, and other popular nightlife thoroughfares include broadway, and west colfax avenue, which has heritage square music hall, a dinner theater with family entertainment. for gentlemen's clubs, there's diamond cabaret & steakhouse, a half block from the colorado convention center, la boheme gentleman's cabaret on stout street, and shotgun willie's in glendale. brew pubs include wynkoop brewing, the nation's largest brew pub in historic downtown, the flying dog, with nearly a dozen craft beers, and the rock bottom brewery, operating under the theory that you haven't hit denver until you've hit rock bottom!
