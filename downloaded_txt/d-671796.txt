for more than thirty years, nicolas and frances mcdowall have been working with artists/printmakers to produce fine books, printed by hand in enviably idyllic surroundings. the press has been proud to have been responsible for a substantial catalogue of books, copies of which are to be found in major libraries throughout the world.
although many titles have long since sold out, copies of a significant number of books are still available and can be studied on this website and bought direct from us, the publishers.
sadly, our father nicolas also died in 2021 but having now taken charge, the press will continue to sell previous publications. we hope you will find all the information you need on this website but please do not hesitate to contact us if you wish to enquire further.
