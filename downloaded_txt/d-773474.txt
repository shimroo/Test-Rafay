“have just had whole house fitted with clearshield security screens and it looks great. service was both friendly and professional from obtaining quote by torsten to installation by kevin. torsten was very knowledgeable about the product and happy to answer any questions we had. i have no hesitation in recommending onesolomons to family and friends.”

“great product quality and super efficient installation. we recently built a new home and sarah and staff at onesolomons were all fantastic. the process was so fast and easy and the young guy who installed our window screens was simply amazing. highly recommended. belinda and ben”
belinda and ben
“we needed to have some outdoor blinds replaced on our deck. once we decided what we wanted, onesolomons was very efficient in getting measured, made and installed. the new blinds look great and no one would realise that they are not original. very happy with their product and service”
louise
