together, we can 



reach hearts and change the lives of those in crisis in cleveland 






give hope all year- become a hope partner with monthly giving










transform lives with a gift today!




























our mission: 



to provide help and hope to all people through the transforming power of god's love. 



the city mission empowers men, women, and children in crisis to overcome their unique, complex paths to homelessness. because no one person’s needs are the same, we create individualized, comprehensive programs to assist residents in building their stabilized and independent future. our mission to reach hearts and change lives in cleveland has not wavered since 1910, and we will continue to provide basic needs, critical recovery resources, and practical paths to a sustainable future to all seeking help and hope here.

what we do 



for over a century, our work has begun with meeting the basic needs of food, shelter and clothing to those in crisis. but through the commitment of many faithful friends we have been able to give so much more. by providing families and individuals with practical help so they feel safe and secure, engaging them in meaningful classes and casework so that they can discover a restored heart, and empowering them with the skills and resources the need to find a sustainable home, we are seeing lives completely restored.

our vision 



 is to be a catalyst for positive change in cleveland resulting in the radical transformation of individuals and communities for generations to come.

 












 



help 



help is where we begin, by ensuring essential needs are met.  whether escaping domestic violence, addictions, sudden loss of housing, or freezing temperatures, every individual in crisis requires immediate access to safety, food, shelter, and clothing.goal: to meet immediate needs; for residents to know that they are safe and secure. 








 



heart 



heart is where we begin the difficult process of restoration. whether overcoming trauma, facing past mistakes, or planning for a better future, we set individualized plans and goals with every resident, so that they can own their better future.goal: to heal and renew hope; to take steps toward becoming self-sufficient. 








 



home 



home is the ultimate hope for every person who seeks refuge at the city mission. whether seeking a physical house, a relational community, or a sense of purpose, we empower residents with the catalysts they need to transition into self-sustainable lives.
goal: to move into self-sufficiency; to reach goals and become a healthy contributor to one’s community. 










 





our impact on cleveland 



the people of cleveland need the mission now more than ever. as more and more individuals and families face crisis, it’s important that we come together as a community to support the most vulnerable among us. thank you for sharing the hope given to us in jesus christ to help these men, women, and children make their own histories.
