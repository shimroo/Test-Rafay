trying harder is not the answeryou’ve tried everything to fix yourself, your kids, and your job, but the changes never last. suddenly, the light dawns. it’s not your problems that need to be fixed. it’s your life! the good news is that god doesn’t ask you to live your life for christ, to let him live his life through you. with humour, cantor, and “plain vanilla talk,” bill gillham reveals:the root of our problems—the techniques we have developed for satisfying our needs for love and self-esteemthe key to victory—our true identity in christgod’s goal for our lives—conformity to christ’s image as he lives through usjesus is the only one who has every truly lived the christian life, and he wants to do it today—in you.
