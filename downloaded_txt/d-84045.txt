shell caster i
shell caster is the wizard of water, where magic is sprayed about in many a wondrous forms. from the phosphorescence topping the swell of moonlite wave, to the roar of the surf meeting the shoreline and the grains of sun-bleached sand sifting through our fingers, there is an abundance magic along the water’s edge.perhaps it is the shells that fascinate most – throughout time they have taunted and enchanted us with there beauty. strewn along the shore, radiating an unrelenting magic, shells are the musical notes of the soothing songs of the fair folk of this watery realm — the merfolk.with each breaking wave and salt-laced breeze, we are reminded of shell caster, who floats throughout this realm, and of the magic that’s just within our reach...

star weaver 
star weaver is the wizard of air. assisted by a variety of magical creatures, star weaver helps blend the magic of his realm with that of the other three realms, weaving his enchanted strands into the tapestry of beauty and harmony know to us as nature.the magic of nature is all around us. it is trapped in the blaze of a falling star, in the sounds of the sea shell, in the rainbow of scents in the leaves of autumn, in the smooth touch of an agate. this natural magic flows through and its trapped in air, earth, fire and water — the four realms of nature. in each realm, there is a wizard who oversees the flow, keeping it pure and constant.

summer musing
summer is a time of year to set the imagination free on a journey through the sights, sounds, and scents. a summer sunset is a time and place of magic—and romance—when the sounds of the surf, the drift of a breeze and the iridescent patina of the moment all calm the spirit and beckon to the muses of a summer mermaid._________________________________________________________summer musingimage size: 18.5" x 25” paper ap edition size: 60lithograph paper print: $155.00paper sn edition size: 750lithograph print:  $150.00canvas giclée:  $275.00edition size: 100_________________________________________________________adriftlithograph print:  $150.00canvas giclée:  $275.00edition size: 100_________________________________________________________prices reflect unstretched rolled canvas.other sizes available upon request.inquires: patticross91@gmail.com

a book of charm and enchantment from tom cross fairy garden: fairies of the four seasons is a book for anyone and everyone that wants to feel the magic inherent in the world around us. it is for the young and the young at heart. drawing much from the charming flower fairy™ books of cicely mary barker that first came into the public eye in 1923 and whose popularity endures yet today, fairy garden: fairies of the four seasons is filled with art that is rich in lightheartedness and laced with exquisite detail. steering clear of the darker forms of “faerie”, this book intentionally offers up the sweeter side of fairies that need to have a place in everyone’s childhood and should linger long into the memories of becoming an adult, a parent and a grandparent. the clever words and poetry of constance barkley lewis have beautifully captured the inspiration and intent of the art as well. these are the fairies of our youth: innocent, fun-loving and as much a part of nature as sunflowers in full bloom on a hot summer’s day. fairy garden : fairies of the four seasonscreated and illustrated by tom crosspoetry by constance barkley lewispublished by andrews mcmeel publishing96 pages, 9”w x 11” hlist price: $24.95
