crowded fire is a vital home for fierce new plays.

known for developing and presenting innovative and provocative new plays, crowded fire contributes to the creation of a contemporary canon that reflects the diverse world in which we live. crowded fire was recently described in american theatre magazine as “instrumental in introducing the bay area to new writers who push the boundaries of what theatre can be” and “one of the most reliable local stops for high-quality new work by diverse voices.”
