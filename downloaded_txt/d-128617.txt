more homes for bats on campus. the wildlife society at texas state along with assistance from the former bat association of texas state and the facilities department have erected four bat boxes at different locations on campus. the one pictured is right outside the supple building at the northeast end of the old greenhouse. each box is 14 feet off the ground and can hold a few hundred bats. it may be a few months or more before some bats find their new home, but check it out anyway. there's an informative placard by the box. funding for the project was provided by the environmental services award with faculty sponsorship from dr. sarah fritts (posted: 2-7-2025).
