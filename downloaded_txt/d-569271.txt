  want to help ceo and the weinberg food bank feed the hungry? 
 host a food drive!
food and fund drives are a great way for your organization to get involved in hunger relief. we gratefully accept the proceeds of food drives at schools, churches, businesses and other organizations. 
find out more - click the icon below to visit the food drive page.

 virtual food drives are great option too!  here's why: 
your donation goes further with the virtual food drive! thanks to the food bank's wholesale purchasing power and efficient distribution model, a gift made here provides more food than through a traditional food drive —– doubling or even tripling the amount of food your dollar can provide at the grocery store. your donation will help us purchase more of our most-needed food items, including fresh fruits and vegetables, meat and other sources of protein like peanut butter, and even fresh dairy products.
 

make a virtual food drive donation below:

   
or visit the virtual food drive shopping cart and select the items you'd like to donate!
