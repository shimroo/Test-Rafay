thank you so much for your program and your encouragement as a mentor. there’s no easy way to study for the bar but you made it bearable and through the structure of your program and your wisdom i was able to keep my sanity!

candace jones
weekly online video meetings with jackson were exceptional moments in professional coaching, and the value i received from the course and these sessions far exceeded the amount of money the course cost, which in fact was extremely reasonable…

rudy cellis
i’ve told anyone who’ll listen that i value your approach, and recommend it because it’s not just a gimmick, it’s a very effective approach. and i believed that before i knew that i passed.

virginia marsh
i was just writing to tell you that you are awesome! thank you so much for all of your help studying for the bar exam. i would not have been able to pass had i continued using the methods taught by barbri.
