who we are
the finger lakes library system is a cooperative library system, chartered in 1958 by new york state, to serve the public libraries in cayuga, cortland, seneca, tioga, and tompkins counties. our member libraries, currently numbering 33, are independent and governed by local boards of trustees. one of twenty-three library systems in new york state, we operate under a state-approved plan of service. the system is governed by an eleven member board of trustees with two representatives from each of the five counties served, and one at-large member. more about us…


finger lakes library system receives generous support from the friends of tompkins county public library, which enables purchasing of materials for the system-wide collection, continuing education opportunities, and more.  visit the friends of tcpl web site at:  www.booksale.org
