about colorado horse property
welcome to colorado horse property. this sounds odd, but in the 21st century, we found it frustrating that our rural clients had to screen through multiple sites, multiple systems and multiple formats to find land, ranches, farms or horse property. the creation of colorado horse property is based on having immediate access to only the land, ranches, farms or horse properties, all in one place within the entire state of colorado. with over 10,000+ properties listed only in colorado, we've created a network of land, ranch, farm and horse property specialists. typically, these have low property taxes, no hoa fees and lots of freedom. whether you are looking in the metro denver area, north, south, east or west, we have it all! start your search today for the perfect land, ranch, farm or horse property! view more

mark & alison eibner, rural, equine, animal and off-grid realtors™





like many stories of the burgeoning old west, colorado horse property has a long and storied past. mark and alison eibner incorporated their real estate company in 1993. however, this duo of premiere colorado brokers were in the game years before that. in fact, they have operated as broker producers since 1985. they've served their clients hard for 38 years, consistently growing through 7 administrations, 5 recessions and completed well over 4,000 transactions.
