cessna 150-152 club

since 1980 the cessna 150-152 club has been the place to go for information about the cessna 150 and 152. in these pages you will find the latest news, social information about our club, and technical information about each model of the cessna 150 and 152. from photos, to stcs, to light bulbs, it’s all here. most of this site is free, but only members get the technical stuff.
we also have a very active forum. our members discuss technical information and maintenance issues, piloting tips, adventures and group get togethers. the technical information on the website and information on our forum save our members much more than the annual cost of membership.












































































































































































 
cessna 150-152 fly-in
the cessna 150-152 club also runs the annual cessna 150-152 fly-in. every summer cessna 150s and 152s from all over the country gather in the heartland of america for flying contests, socializing, and to learn more about these wonderful airplanes. the cessna 150-152 fly-in, or “the confab in the corn” as we call it, is an aviation event like no other. part fly-in, part family reunion, this event is open to owners, pilots, or really anyone with an interest in the cessna 150 or 152, one of the most popular and best-loved general aviation airplanes of all time.
if you’re a confab alumni from any of the past events, you know all about our fly-in. if you’re one of the few 150 or 152 owners that haven’t been to clinton and attended the cessna 150-152 fly-in, then you should read about it in the fly-in pages on this site, then make the trek to cwi and join us. find out for yourself what has kept this event going for more than 20 years.
