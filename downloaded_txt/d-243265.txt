lesson (recent)
            also posted on  twitter and
             facebook
march
            4, 2024 -- proverbs 22:6 -- "train up a child in the way
            he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." i
            have a wife and two young kids. this verse tells me that it is my
            responsibility to train my kids in the ways of god both in principle
            and example. a few points... 1. it is imperative that both mom and
            dad be married. (if you are not, for the sake of your kids, get
            married legally, even if it's a civil wedding.)2. i'll be held
            responsible for what my school teachers are teaching my kids. (this
            is why i'm adamantly against christian parents sending their kids
            to public school. they are both heathen and anti-god. your kids will
            learn from the heathen kids there also. either send them to a good
            christian school or train them yourself (homeschool.))3. the
            christian school and the church are not a substitute for training
            your kids. although i send my kids to christian school, i still take
            the time to train my kids and to build a good relationship with
            them.4. the most important thing is for me is to be a good
            christian example in how i live my life and how i treat my kids.
            (the #1 cause of rebellion in kids is a hypocritical and
            inconsistent life lived by the parents.)5. have the right home life
            that's consistent with good christian values both in private and
            in public. (no "double life.")i can list many other points but
            i hope what i've said here is helpful.

click on the album picture to play. (if the player window does not
        show up, please check your browser security settings.) -- most ocr
        listeners are using "google chrome" as their browser of
        choice. 

having trouble listening in your area??
        -- i'm getting reports that there are some areas of the usa (and many
        countries) where the ocr site and/or stream are being blocked. 

if the issue in not with your device... open a vpn 
        (virtual private network) connection and point it toward a usa server. (uk would work too, since
        the station stream host is located in the uk.) -- this should solve the
        problem in getting the station and the site.

 old christian radio
      mission statement



      thank you for visiting my website and listening to old christian radio.
      .



i've created a unique kind of christian radio
station on the internet...old christian radio is a station that plays
great conservative christian music with
no "christian rock".
the main mission for this station's existence
is to be a blessing to the christian community
by playing godly christian music that doesn't
sound like the devil's music.


the musical emphasis on this station is of
a godly spiritual nature.music that appeals
mainly to "the flesh" is not played here)

this station's music format
              is: sacred/traditional christian with no outside programming.
my other website http://www.oldchristianmusic.com
              sells most of the music that is played on old christian
              radio.
old christian radio is commercial
free and listener supported.(since ocr is not a 501(c)3, gifts are not tax deductible
as charitable contributions.)



now... please allow me to introduce myself


my name is michael mcfadden. i live in
arlington,
texas. i'm an independent baptist. i've been saved since march 1991. i am
married and i have two children. i am member of trinity baptist church of
arlington, tx (this church is an independent conservative baptist church which
uses only the kjv 1611 bible.) in march 2010, i met my wife online at
www.christianfilipina.com 
 i narrowed my search to only baptist ladies and went from there. i ended up
finding the lady that god wanted me to marry.after
a long while of communicating,  i went to the philippines and married her in may
2011.
(she is also a baptist.)
 when i was young, i had a long standing interest in radio.
radio was a fascinating field to me. i dreamed that i'd be on radio someday
broadcasting good christian music. i've never liked what is called today's
(worldly) "christian music" and "christian living". because
of what i've seen in many churches, in my younger years, i have resisted many
opportunities to get saved. when i became an adult; i believed on the lord jesus
christ and got saved from my sins. i told god that i don't want any part of that
phony, worldly christianity being practiced today. i decided to become a
"conservative christian" (as in the way that jesus would want me to
live) in how i live my life and in the music i listen to.


if you like this station..... please bookmark this site 
and do your friends
a favor by telling them about old christian radio. 
god
              bless you and have a good day.
