i’m a singer, songwriter, guitar-slinger, recording artist and performer living and working on the island of kauai in hawaii. it’s been over 50 years since i released my first album, and i released my 7th studio album, the journey in 2021. it was recorded in a year and a half at the start of the pandemic at black bamboo recordings studio—allowing me to escape to the ocean to surf and windsurf between session dates.i’m excited to announce the fourth single release from my upcoming 8th album ‘hole in the world’. co-written with my friend and musical brother jim kimo west (weird al) on guitars, and featuring michael ruff (bonnie raitt) on keyboards, jimmy johnson (james taylor) on bass, and yours truly on vocals. with so many beloved ones passing on i felt it was time to write a eulogy to those who have left and to those left behind.purchase and/or listen nowfor the latest news about gigs, releases and more, visit me on facebook.
