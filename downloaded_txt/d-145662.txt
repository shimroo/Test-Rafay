   about the
  properties  
  buying a property is a significant financial investment, and it is
 important to explore all the available options to ensure you are making
 the right decision. while many people choose to work with a real estate
 agent to purchase a property, there are several advantages to buying
 directly from the owner. in this article, we will discuss five
 advantages of buying property direct from the owner instead of through
 a real estate agent.

lower costs: one of the most significant advantages of buying a 
	property directly from the owner is that you can avoid paying
	commission fees to a real estate agent. this can save you a
	significant amount of money, which can be put towards other expenses
	associated with purchasing a property, such as closing costs,
	repairs, and upgrades.
negotiation: when you buy a property directly from the owner, you
	have the opportunity to negotiate the purchase price directly with
	them. this can result in a lower purchase price, as the owner may be
	more willing to negotiate with a buyer who is not represented by an
	agent.
personalized service: when you work directly with the owner, you can
	receive personalized service throughout the entire buying process.
	the owner can provide you with information about the property,
	answer any questions you have, and offer insights into the local
	community and amenities.
more flexibility: buying a property directly from the owner can
	provide you with more flexibility in terms of the closing timeline
	and other details of the transaction. for example, you may be able
	to negotiate a longer closing period or request certain repairs or
	upgrades as a condition of the sale.
transparency: when you work directly with the owner, you can be
	assured of complete transparency throughout the transaction. you can
	ask questions and receive direct answers, and you can be confident
	that there are no hidden agendas or undisclosed issues.


summary: while working with a real estate agent can provide many
benefits, buying a property directly from the owner can also be a great
option. by purchasing a property directly from the owner, you can save
money, negotiate the purchase price, receive personalized service, enjoy
more flexibility, and be assured of transparency throughout the entire
process. if you are considering buying a property, be sure to explore
all your options and choose the approach that is best for your unique
needs and circumstances.


the owners have thought long and hard about
putting the two houses and hopkins property on the market.  over the
years both houses have been secured to provide a safe and private
residence in outstanding locations. the hopkins property is prime real
estate, and we hope to sell to help finance other projects on adjoining
property.

the reason we are not posting the asking price is
  that we assume that anyone interested has done their due diligence in
  knowing what the real estate market in all locations is like, and therefore
  have an idea of what these properties are worth. look over the
  listings and make a reasonable offer based on your research.  we will
  reply if you are serious.   we are open to self financing if
  you are willing to negotiate a feasible and fair down payment. 

   
 lets get in touch and talk about these properties.
