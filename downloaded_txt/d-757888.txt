the purpose of this book is to inform the public about how shabbily i was treated (and purposely mistreated) by the veterans administration. in vietnam, i incurred extreme body damage from three enemy bullets and an enemy grenade. i spent 13 months in army hospitals recovering from my wounds. i suffered chronic pain for the rest of my life.in 2011, this pain became so severe that i checked into the wilkes-barre va medical center in pennsylvania. even though the va neurologist confirmed that one of the bullets had damaged my sciatic nerve beyond repair, and recommended extreme treatment for pain, the va doctor - and later, the chronic pain clinic - refused to provide adequate treatment. this action was supported by the hospital director.this book is about my 10-year struggle with va bureaucracy to obtain the treatment that i so desperately needed.to lay the background for this struggle, the book recounts some of my gruesome experiences in combat in vietnam, including a detailed account of my ultimate firefight, as well as my fight for life and the long time that i spent recovering from my wounds.
