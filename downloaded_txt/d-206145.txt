new technical resource available









the new precast design guide is now available for download
providing detailed design guidelines for the design of precast buildings, this new book by barry crisp is an excellent resource for architects and engineers designing precast solutions.
 
this design guide is intended to fill this knowledge gap by providing a detailed review of this subject and thereby promoting a greater awareness and understanding of how precast concrete buildings are constructed. it will concentrate on discussing the concepts of precast concrete buildings but will refer to referenced documents for the detailed design. it has been written particularly for those already familiar with this form of construction but do not have the detailed knowledge of the detailing required to plan and design a complete precast concrete building.
