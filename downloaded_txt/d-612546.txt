“for thirty two years (2024) i have worked with adult wild black bears that are victims of human activity. this includes hunting, automobile and other injuries. we assist orphan cubs until old enough to be returned to the wild. we work with people recreating in bear country and home owners regarding perceived nuisance bears. this work has allowed myself the privilege to observe the many varied reactions to human interference exhibited by the bears. what i find incredible is a bear’s ability for exhibiting restraint.” …mike mcintosh
volunteer and employment
each year bear with us is required to renew ministry of natural resources authorizations. a) keep captive, rehabilitate and return black bears to the wild. b) keep black bears permanently in captivity. c) act as an agent when working to resolve human/bear conflicts. the mnrf regulates live trapping and relocating a bear.
we hope you find this website informative and a good resource.
