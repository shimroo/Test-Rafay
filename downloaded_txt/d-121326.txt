thank you for supporting our small, family-owned farm.marshall’s farm honey has been a favorite bay area brand for 33 years. we are appreciated by some of the worlds best known chefs because we take pride in producing one of the very few brands of honey that is truly raw, local, pure, and all-natural from the hills, valleys, and meadows, and microclimates of the san francisco bay area. subscribe to stay in the know



who we are is a reliable brand of local, raw, pure honey in the sf bay area for the past 33 years, but we are so much more…
we are proud to be an employer supporting several families, for the past 15 + years.
we are a family…
we are a family…
we are a haven for abandoned animals….
and we believe in natural medicine and the healing power of honey!
