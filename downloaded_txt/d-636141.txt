defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld, from treachery:
âover the coming decade, depending on how the world community conducts itself, there could be another five nuclear powers. there could be several more countries with
chemical and biological programs, and there could be additional countries with the ability to deliver those capabilities long distances. the effect of that, to the extent that those countries are not democracies, but rather countries on the terrorist listâ is to make the world a more dangerous place.â

excerpts from treachery

part 1: french connection armed saddam
part 2: libyan sincerity on arms in doubt
part 3: u.n. nuclear agency asleep at the switch
praise for treachery:
"treachery with its reams of classified and other insider information, reveals how our nation's enemies obtain weapons from china, russia, france, germany and other supposed friends. the book is must-reading if you want to know the confidential story of the growing danger of global arms proliferation."
-- rowan scarborough, pentagon reporter, washington times, and bestselling author of rumsfeld's war

"two big factors will determine america's national security over the next twenty years. the first is the capability of our military weapons as determined by the health of our defense industrial base. and, second, the extent to which our adversaries are able to buy or steal advanced military technology from the u.s. and our allies. bill gertz focuses superbly on the hemorrhaging of critical military technology to our enemies. treachery should be read by all our policymakers."

-- congressman duncan hunter of california, chairman of the house armed services committee
"bill gertz has written a bone-chilling expose about what has been done behind our backs. can we ever be safe? you must read this."

-- greta van susteren, host of fox news's on the record with greta van susteren
"bill gertz gets it! treachery brilliantly exposes our allies who have become our enemies in the war on terror just because the u.n., france, germany, and russia looked at iraq and other rogue states as trading partners rather than enablers of terrorism. this is a major piece of work in the war on terror."
-- lt. gen. thomas g. mcinerney, usaf (ret.), bestselling author of endgame.
"mr. gertz's articles are liable to have two types of consequences that i can only regret: in the short term, mr. gertz may succeed in rekindling the flame of french-bashing, which might provide short-term satisfaction to mr. gertz but will not help solve the difficult situation we face in iraq. french-bashing in the united states as well as anti-american sentiments in europe are both dangerous trends that we must all do our best to combat."

-- jean-david levitte, french ambassador to the united states

"bill gertz has written a first-rate analysis of the most serious problem to confront the nation since the cold war, and it reads like a thriller. you won't be able to put it down. but when you do, send it to your congressman or senator."

-- richard perle, fellow, american enterprise institute, and former assistant secretary of defense.

"a deeply disturbing account of how america's intelligence agencies failed to discern the elaborate plots of osama bin laden's men were planning against us. exciting. upsetting. strongly recommended."

-- jeane j. kirkpatrick, leavey professor of government, georgetown university, and former u.s. ambassador to the united nations.

"bill gertz, one of america's most accomplished and credible investigative reporters, offers a compelling analysis of our nation's intelligence problems, including their historical roots, and provides a comprehensive prescription for correcting the deficiencies and improving national security."

washington times book review by steven mosher
wire stories about 'the china threat'
reviews:
"there is no churchill in america today. where are they to turn then, those patriots in our security services who understand what the fecklessness, stupidity and corruption of the clinton administration are costing us? it would not be very surprising if they were to seek out a sympathetic journalist, in the slim hope that the american public might take their eyes away from hollywood and wall street long enough to pay attention. if so, their contact of choice would be bill gertz, defense reporter for the washington times."
-- john derbyshire, national review, dec. 4, 2000

"the china threat is especially strong in piecing together the larger pattern of modernization in the chinese military and the looming u.s.-china confrontation over taiwan."
-- tom donnelly, the weekly standard, dec. 4, 2000

"sheer fabrication out of ulterior motives, with which we express our strong dissatisfaction. it must be pointed out that there are always some people in the united states who cling to the cold war mentality and have prejudice of and hostility against china... we demand those who have plotted the so-called 'china spy case' see clearly the trend of history and immediately stop their despicable acts of wantonly attacking china."
-- sun yuxi, spokesman for the foreign ministry, people's republic of china, nov. 16, 2000

praise for betrayal



"this will be the clinton administration's least favorite book on its foreign policy. but the rebuttals are likely to be long on adjectives and short on refutation, for these tough charges are backed, the gertz way, by fact after fact after fact."
-- r. james woolsey, former cia director

"mr. gertz has performed a signal service by writing this thorough, frightening, and sad chronicle of how we fell from our ability to provide leadership in the quest for peace without appeasement."
-- the honorable caspar weinberger, former secretary of defense, chairman of forbes magazine

"i know of no national security reporter in the u.s. who is better sourced or more respected for accuracy than bill gertz. his reporting is essential reading for those who wish to stay in the know. an so is betrayal."
-- james webb, former secretary of the navy, author of fields of fire and the emperor's general
