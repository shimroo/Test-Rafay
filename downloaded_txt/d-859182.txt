            a drone pierced the outer shell of ukraine's chernobyl nuclear plant. radiation levels are normal


feb 14, 2025


a drone armed with a warhead hit the protective outer shell of ukraine’s chernobyl nuclear plant. friday's strike punched a hole in the shell and briefly started a fire. kyiv blamed russia, while the kremlin denied it was responsible. the u.n. international atomic energy agency said radiation levels at the shuttered plant in the kyiv region have not increased. it said the strike did not breach the plant’s inner containment shell. the iaea did not attribute blame. fighting around nuclear power plants has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war. chernobyl was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986.

            breakfast is booming at us restaurants. is it also contributing to high egg prices?


feb 13, 2025


it’s a chicken-and-egg problem: restaurants are struggling with record-high u.s. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem. breakfast is booming at u.s. eateries. first watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. fast-food chains like starbucks and wendy's added more egg-filled breakfast items. in normal times, egg producers could meet the demand. but a bird flu outbreak that has forced them to slaughter their flocks is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. some restaurants like waffle house have added a surcharge to offset their costs.

            seoul says north korea is destroying facility that hosted reunions of war-separated families


feb 12, 2025


north korea is demolishing a south korea-built property that had been used to host reunions of families separated during the 1950-53 korean war, the south’s government said thursday, as it continues to eliminate symbols of engagement between the war-divided rivals. relations between the koreas are at their worst in years, with north korean leader kim jong un continuing to flaunt his expanding nuclear weapons program and declaring to abandon long-standing goals of inter-korean reconciliation. the 12-story building at the north’s diamond mountain resort had been used for family reunions since 2009. the koreas last held a reunion in 2018, after kim initiated diplomacy with seoul and washington in an effort to leverage his nuclear program for economic benefits.

            her parents were injured in a tesla crash. she ended up having to pay tesla damages


feb 12, 2025


tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in china for defamation – and won just about every time. elon musk’s company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy in china and leveraged the patronage of political leaders to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability. that’s led some car owners to take drastic action. as concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the u.s., tesla’s record in china shows how musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts are by design intertwined.

            us inflation got worse with rising groceries and gasoline prices


feb 12, 2025


u.s. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of groceries and gasoline rose, a trend that will likely underscore the federal reserve’s resolve to delay any further interest rate cuts. the consumer price index increased 3% in january from a year ago, wednesday’s report from the labor department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. it has increased from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in september. the figures underscore the stickiness of inflation, which created a major political problem for former president joe biden. president donald trump pledged to reduce prices in last year’s campaign, though most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs.

            christian aid groups weigh life-threatening choices about who to help after usaid funding pause


feb 12, 2025


christian aid groups are being hard-hit after the trump administration froze most foreign aid and sidelined the u.s. agency for international development. faith-based humanitarian organizations that partner with usaid are now facing their own layoffs, furloughs and severe funding shortages. remaining staff are being forced to choose which of their lifesaving programs can continue without government funding. two of the 12 largest non-governmental recipients of usaid funds are faith-based: catholic relief services and world vision. these christian nonprofits serve millions of people globally and provide food, water and health care in conflict zones.
