jeremy laurin reunion - yay! i miss jeremy so much <3xmas season - busy. presents, kids, parties, alcohol. >_<alice memorial - unsatisfying. didn't actually spend much tiem focused on alice. brought up thoughts about friendship, growing apart, the way friendships were in highschool and how i miss those.new years - swear this holiday is overrated, but still went out and drank.also, i bought a dvd set of lost. man that show is sooooo good. it's the first season, so i miss anne, on who's laptop i originally watched it on. but i found out my awesome friend at work (sara) likes lost, yay!anyway...yeah. happy ten.

|depressed]so...anyone who's been on facebook...knows...ugh. i have no words. or so many that they don't make sense.i can't believe that i've lost my mom, my dad, and one of my best friends from high school and i'm barely 25 years old.on sunday morning i was content and optomistic for the day, i was eating mitsuwa bakery while watching a good movie. i had plans to clean my room and organize papers and go out to buy chistmas treats for people.then i answer the phone at like ten to 11 and hear a voice say "helen-kate?"and it amanda and she told me alice was dead... (the tears are welling up as i type this).i've already gone from depressed to that apathy to life which follows depression... and now i just have this horrible feeling of exhaustion combined with a shaky unexplicable anxiety coursing through my veins. i haven't had any nightmares yet like when my mom died, so i'm very relieved about that.i'm working on a collage of photos of alice for the memorial we're having at shani's house, and that's a little consoling.  the numerous trips to kinkos and the library the project is giving me (since i don't have a scanner or a printer) is at least keeping me too busy to mope around. and of course there's work, of which i must go to every day until christmas.it'll be really good to see kendall and shani and amanda and everyone again. nathan is also coming, and that makes me really happy since debate team was so important to alice.

another profitable going out night!

ah, halloween was so fun! me and jenny wandered out with just about no plan and ended up having a great time, despite the cold.highlights: -somehow we hit the end of happy hour, and had five rounds of drinks for about as many dollars each.-we said something to the people at the 102.1 tent at hooligans that they really liked, and ended up getting free cds (mine was the soundtrack to "whip it!" featuring the song "sheena is a punk rocker" which, of course, makes me think of sheena.), free t-shirts, and free movie passes to... a ewan mcgregor movie! yaaaaay!-cheese fries at hooligans that were so good and which i am going to try to recreate at home using the same sauce and garnishes.-some random house party of carroll people i didn't recognize....but the dog there loved me and kept snuggling me!-eggplant fries at pizza shuttle. mmmmm.jenny was the 1580's and i was the 1980's. sweet.

so angie and i were googling the christian bale rant. i don't remember why. somehow related to that movie that they filmed at the historical society, which we had just seen a commercial for. (i am so excited to see it,)on the side panel, in the related links was some kid named david talking about christian b. and out of curiosity we checked it out. turns out he's a youtube mini-celebrity, for this freaking hilarious video entitled "david after dentist."

|baby come back to me - utada]so, i'm going bananas because my korean chick boa released an american album (http://www.msplinks.com/mdfodhrwoi8vdwzhbnouy29tl3rlyw1zl3ryywnraw5nlmfzcd90at0xnde0jm1ppte0oti4oa==) and i can't believe that one of my peeps is trying to break america and doing reasonably well (number 5 on itunes isn't too bad right?)...and then there's a random song by a korean guy that i love named se7en, "girls" feat. lil kim, and i don't know if it's gonna do well either but i'm lovin it...and then i hear an r&b song on kiss fm called "baby come back to me" that has a very familiar voice, but being exhausted i don't process it and just go to bed...and later find out omfg it"s utada!!!!!!! they're playing utada hikaru on f'ing kiss fm!!!!!!* @_@ * @_@ * @_@ *she's most famous to non-j-pop-holics as the singer of "simple and clean" from kingdom hearts.  she sounds a bit ethereal but she's got a lotta soul.so, yeah, helen is uber happy!!!! woooooooooooooooooooo!!!!also, dorky beat box is funny:
