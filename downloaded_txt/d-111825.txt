for more than twenty years, the purpose of the childrens' disabilities site is 

to show what life is like with a special needs child and
to provide expert information and support for families who deal with this every day.

it is a cooperative approach of parents and professionals.
personally, my life changed forever when my son was born extremely premature (weighing only one pound) in 1988.
                after his earlier struggles to survive, our family began the subsequent
                struggle of raising a child with multiple special needs, most of which
                are not obvious or well understood. as you know this is no easy task!
since that time all three of my children and myself have been diagnosed with some form of special need. over the past twenty years, as i investigated resources for each, i expanded the website. along the way i have been deeply committed to providing online support. this website was created to help other parents of children with special
                needs, like yourself, with articles on topics that i have found to be
                helpful. some of these articles have really made an impact for me and many others, and i hope they do for you as well.if you find this website useful, please share with others or link to the site - childrensdisabilities.info.
