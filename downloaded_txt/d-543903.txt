podcast: thezrohour on bboxradio.com episode 19- finale








last wednesday march 21, 2012, thezrohour celebrated its 8th year as a podcast/radio show. this broadcast was also the last. this show is a collection of some of the best interviews/freestyles that have graced the show and dj ambush lit the decks on fire in the second half! founded by myself, dj ambush and alexie f. back in 2004, thezrohour was created to fill a need for the incredible amount of independent/underground hip hop artists that were emerging at the time. mainstream radio almost completely ignored (and still does) the local hip hop community in almost every area of the united states. there were new waves of artists coming out abroad that fans were not familiar with, that needed to be familiar with. over the years, thezrohour has reignited that focus and dropped some amazing music & interviews along the way. thank you to bboxradio for allowing us to broadcast live for the first time in the show's history. thanks to everyone for tuning in and supporting the show. all of the archived shows will remain available at thezrohour.com (complete archive), thezrohour.podomatic.com and itunes. there is a lot that people missed/overlooked and the music chosen for these broadcasts is timeless. we will meet again believe that!

respect the architects

the box that rocks: 30 years of video music box and the rise of hip hop music & culture is an exhibition of contemporary art that celebrates the global influence of video music box, and the show’s historic contribution to urban music and culture. in 1983, ralph mcdaniels launched video music box,
 a groundbreaking television program that ushered in the popularity and 
innovation of music videos. as the show’s creator and host, and the 
producer and/or director of over 400 music videos, ralph mcdaniels is a 
pioneer whose influence is still felt throughout the music industry. it 
is safe to say that hundreds of hip hop, r&b and dancehall artists 
owe their street credibility, record sales, and a great deal of their 
commercial success to video music box.

video: zebra katz - "ima read" ft. njena reddd foxxx







this creepy video seems inspired by "the shining". i'm feeling the simplicity of the lyrics and just the 808 as a backdrop. i can see the clubs reacting to this call and response style.

video: red bull music academy lecture featuring masters at work







their name says it all - masters at work. 'little' louie vega and kenny 'dope' gonzalez celebrate 20 years together, channeling dance music down new paths with their inventive production style and imaginative feel for different musical forms. the two native new yorkers have amassed an overwhelming body of work including hundreds of original productions and defiantly mix everything they can find - house, hip hop, funk, disco, latin, african and jazz - into a universal groove. xlr8r's shawn reynaldo sits down with them on the couch during red bull music academy's 'new york city to sf bay' lecture series in san francisco to discuss the start of their careers and dissolving the barriers between genres.

red bull music academy has long held this series of lectures that showcases many of the greatest contributors to music culture. the above video features an in depth interview with the hosts of arguably the greatest hip hop radio show ever- stretch armstrong & bobbito garcia. their radio show, broadcast on 89.9 fm wkcr in new york city in the 90's, was the conduit for many of the biggest names in hip hop today. they are also a major inspiration for thezrohour as well as many other hip hop radio hosts that came before them.

whitney we will always love you! funeral services begin at noon today








by now the world knows that one of our beloved musical icons, whitney houston, passed away one week ago just a day before the grammy awards. i haven't posted anything prior to today because i decided to wait until i could digest all of this. we all know of her professional achievements and personal demons that has brought us both joy and sadness. her music  lifted and inspired us. her beauty greatly admired. when it came to the surface that she battled with alcohol and drug addiction, many identified with that struggle and supported her recovery. all of us know someone from within our familial and friendship circle that is dealing with substance abuse. the results of her autopsy have not been fully revealed as of yet. most reports of her last days have indicated that she may have continued to spiral downward although she has been mounting a comeback over the past couple of years. her astounding voice has been ravaged by years of freebasing cocaine, smoking marijuana and heavy drinking.

whatever it is that she succumbed to, it doesn't make the loss any easier to accept. far too many of our greatest entertainers are dying at a rapid pace while many are still in the prime of their lives. anyone reading this that knows of a friend or family member who struggles with addiction, show them tough love. call them on it. be there for them as an ear, a shoulder; someone to point them in the direction of help if they want it. that is all we can do. it is up to the individual to truly want to release themselves from the burden of dependency. 

whitney houston's funeral service will be streamed live today online at 12pm est and will be broadcast on some news outlets such as cnn. i will be tuning in to say goodbye.
