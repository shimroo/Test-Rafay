karma yoga




                  karma yoga is the path of action, connecting every action in your life to god, and god can
                  be felt through and with your actions. we all do action in some form and why not do it
                  with god. karma yoga is selfless service, work performed in harmony with all creation.

babaji teachings




                  babaji taught people to chant the ancient mantra om namah shivaya, which may be translated
                  as i take refuge in god. a mantra is a sanskrit phrase which invokes the divine by a name.
                  there are thousands of names of god and thousands of mantras.

mantras




                  the word mantra is derived from two sanskrit wordsâmanas (mind) and tra (tool). mantra
                  literally means "a tool for the mind," and was designed to help practitioners access a
                  higher power and their true natures. mantras are the instruments of the mind.

              sada shiva
            




                    i revere shrä« shankara, the sadguru, the consort of girijä, the hoard of virtues, the
                    jewel of the day, who causes the lotus of wisdom to bloom, shankara, the bestower of
                    supreme bliss, the destroyer of the darkness of delusion, the true, beautiful shiva,
                    praised by the vedas, the ruler over käshä«, the annihilator of the sins of the
                    kali-yuga, the wishing-tree of happiness.
                  

                    i revere shiva of haidäkhäna, the most magnanimous sadguru, with the help of whose looks
                    of mercy human beings are capable of crossing the worldly existence. 
                    praise be to shiva of haidäkhäna, to shankara, the most beautiful! o lovely one whose
                    darshana is auspicious, may you take your abode in my heart forever!
                  

                    o sadäshiva of haidäkhäna! o immensely wise shankara! rise in the sky of my heart as a
                    sun that bestows the splendour of knowledge forever!
                  

                    i revere shankara, the guru, the mandara mountain of the yåga ocean, the refuge of
                    virtues, the annihilator of kandarpa's haughtiness, the lord over käshä«, the remover of
                    the evil of the kali-yuga, the beloved of cows and brahmins. o lord, you who delight in
                    assuming the appearance of an intoxicated and fully drunk being, you who love the games
                    on the kå«rma mountain, being adorned
                  

                    we revere the omnipresent god, the lord of the yåga and the yågä«s, the friend of the
                    poor, the comforter of all those who have suffered from pain and grief, the ocean of
                    knowledge, bhava who is merely perceptible by the mind, shiva, whose appearance is
                    peaceful, the enemy of [the demon] pura who has assumed the appearance of a saint.
                  

                    i revere him whose origin is the truth, who is the truth, who loves the truth, who is
                    engrossed in the truth, who is the refuge of all the righteous, who is the guide leading
                    the way to the truth, whose truth is unshakeable.
                  

                    shiva äshutåsha bestowed his blessings upon the inhabitants of avadha and, awestruck,
                    they received it. when shiva beheld the women and men, he was pleased. 'men and women
                    who are as virtuous as these are not to be found elsewhere.'
                  

                    i revere the beloved divine shiva, who resembles the full moon filled with the nectar of
                    delight, who is true and beautiful and bestows happiness, whose pair of foot-lotuses is
                    venerated by the blessed, who with the rays of his half-opened eyes annihilates the
                    darkness. i revere guru shankara, who is praised in the shruti and resides in
                    haidäkhäna.
                  

                    you grant both the fruits of fulfilment and of deliverance. you show respect and honour
                    to your devotees, while, for you, respect and honour do not exist. the ascetics revere
                    you in manifold ways. by serving you they attain various delights.

              divine mother
            




                    o lakshmi with the shinning lotus eyes, bless this thy slave with initiation. 
                    o lovely one, just with a little glance, bestow on me thy blessing's grace. 
                    o mother of the world, pleasing and cheerful, before thee all my troubles fade away.
                    
                    o fountain of true knowledge, comforting those who seek thy shelter, grant rescue also
                    to thy troubled son.
                  

                    thou art the moonlight, mother, thou alone shineth in the pure light of the blazing sun.
                    the radiance of the stars is thy reflection. thou art the burning ardor of the fire, in
                    water, soft fluidity thou art. thou art the earth, upholding all creation, unrivalled is
                    thy power's splendor. as vishnu's shakti thou upholdeth and blesseth the world.
                  

                    mine eyes are not as fortunate as to behold thy sight, but mother, if thou would'st only
                    melt with mercy, even thy vision would be easy to obtain. 
                    here in this world of vanities, thou art the everlasting powerful essence. mother thou
                    art the absolute sovereign of this world. queen of the universe, grant me protection.
                  

                    devotion to thy lotus-feet ever bestow a stream of joy. for even heaven and earth will
                    pass away! 
                    as ganga thou art purifying the world, o pour the nectar of affectionate grace on me. an
                    endless stream of miserable sinner and creatures, o tarita, have been redeemed by thee.
                    tara, thou art the empress of the world who ferries will across, save also me.
                  

                    thou art the ever-flowing source of grace and of abundance, lakshmi, remover of all
                    poverty. just once the gods appeared before thee begging. thereafter nevermore they had
                    to beg. thou melt'st with mercy, conquered by compassion and always benefiteth the poor.
                    o mother, full of mercy, let it rain and shower nectar of thy grace on us.
                  

                    omitting those who are blind and deaf with self-importance, thou are moved to pity by
                    the poor, almighty queen! throughout the universe thy mercy is renowned, even those
                    multitudes of ill-will sinners who hated thee, thou hast transformed. so why hast thou
                    forgotten, merciful mother this poor, wretched destitute of thine?
                  

                    no-one can even dream to count the jewels at the bottom of the ocean, 
                    and even a gifted poet can't describe the brilliant splendour of the sun. 
                    in this way, bliss-bestowing mother of the universe, 
                    who in this world is able to tell the tale of thy magnificence and glory?
                  

                    always remember her with fearless heart, 
                    who takes away from you all troubles 
                    and pours on you the elixir of pure awareness, as clear, as bright and cooling as the
                    moon. 
                    out of affectionate love for those who love thee, thou giv'st thy holy vision to their
                    eye.thou bringest forth a blissful stream of nectar, which like the holy ganga, cleanses
                    the world of all its sins.
