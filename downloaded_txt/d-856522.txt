    the 7 perceptual learning styles

perceptual learning styles are the means by which learners extract information from their surroundings through the use of their five senses. individuals have different "pathways" that are specific to them. when information enters that "pathway" the information is retained in short term memory. repeated exposure and use promote retention in long term memory. the seven perceptual modes (pathways) included in this theory are print, aural, interactive, visual, haptic, kinesthetic, and olfactory.

  a brief history of our institute
  the early days

in the early 1970’s, dr. russell french of the university of tennessee in knoxville formulated a framework of perceptual learning styles. teaching strategies and learning processes by russell l. french. daryl gilley, a graduate student of dr. french, tested students from a classroom within this framework. another graduate student of dr. french, edwin cherry, revised the framework and then tested others within this refined perceptual learning styles paradigm. the result of this early work in perceptual learning styles was the creation and development of the multi-modal paired associates learning test (mmpalt.)

       our organization
 the group formally organized in 1996 after meeting informally for several years to discuss perceptual learning style theory and the mmpalt. once chartered, the ilsr began revising the mmpalt-ii to improve the testing sequence and the mmpalt-iii was completed. institute for learning styles research conferences are held biannually during the winter and summer.

    multi-modal paired associates learning test (mmpalt-iii)

learning styles can be measured through the administration of the multi-modal paired associates learning test (mmpalt-iii). the instrument is a performance test that measures recall of paired information in each of the seven perceptual modalities.
