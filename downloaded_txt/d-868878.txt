avery did a stellar job of taking care of my trip to paris. from the air france interactions (dealing with them was daunting for me at times) to helping me once i landed in paris with additional questions, avery was always eager to help and was a godsend every step of the way. i highly recommend viking and avery.﻿

we asked paula to help us with round trip eurorail tickets from paris cdg airport to avignon and back. she also made a hotel reservation nearby for the night before the flight home. i had lots of questions; paula was very patient and willing to repeatedly query the us office of eurorail to answer my concerns. viking travel is now my go to choice for any future travel needs.
