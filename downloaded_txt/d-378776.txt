"tucker has the kind of charm and charisma onstage that seasoned performers dream of. on top of that she's got a powerful voice that's as bittersweet as it is silky smooth."  - seattle times"we first heard kate tucker at last january’s sundance film festival, and we’ve been smitten with the nashville-based singer ever since."  - esquire“one of nashville’s indie music gems.”  - no country for new nashville “cardigans-meets-beach house ethereal pop." - toronto star tribune"what i love about this project is that its aim is to blow it all back out [...] but the real beauty of the project is that just as it seeks to recapture some of what music has lost to technology, [...] it's really an effort to bring the best of the past and present together." - huffington post“i don’t get the idea that this is an artist comfortable with doing things ‘typically.’ she dares to be different here, and thus renders an otherwise simplistic rhythm – and the melodies adorning it – into something beyond grand in style.” - indiepulse “tucker’s voice is a delicate, but sterling force to be reckoned with… here is a singer/songwriter who isn’t interested in perfecting the past, but instead making a future that is hers and hers alone.” - too much love
