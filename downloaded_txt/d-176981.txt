king umberto is your other home in elmont. we extend our welcome to you.in 1976, king umberto opened on the corner of meacham avenue and hempstead turnpike. the restaurant and kitchen were very small with the bar squeezed between the pizzeria and the dining room. as word got around how delicious our food was, we were always packed to the brim! so ten years later, we expanded king umberto. in february 1987 the doors opened to a restaurant and pizzeria that could support all of our devoted patrons with ease. since that day, king umberto comfortably seats our customers, providing a wonderful atmosphere for all occasions. the pizzeria is located right next door to the restaurant, allowing us to have three times the original dining capacity. the old pizzeria is now a private dining area, perfect for parties of up to 70 people. we can cater custom affairs to meet your every need, just contact our staff to arrange an event. at king umberto, we have worked hard to bring you quality and service for the past 40 years and hope to do so for many more.
