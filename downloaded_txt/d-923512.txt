an
              exceedingly effective 100' foot, bare copper long wire
              antenna kit for outdoor installation. also known as random
              wire, these bare copper wire antennas have been used
              consistently since the beginning of radio. 
the bare
              copper longwire antenna is, and has always been, the
              standard for broadcast radio, producing superlative
              results. if you have the space up to 100' to install
              a longwire, then this is your am or shortwave antenna.
              hands down.
