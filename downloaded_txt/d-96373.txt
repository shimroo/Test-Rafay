visiting
the ucmp is primarily a research museum and our collections are only open to the public during our annual open house on cal day. however, we have a limited number of fossil exhibits on display, including a magnificent tyrannosaurus rex . these can be viewed, free of charge, any time the valley life sciences building is open. learn more here.
