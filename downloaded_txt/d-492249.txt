morehead city kayaking


while the morehead city kayaking scene may be overshadowed by neighboring communities like beaufort or atlantic beach, the town is nevertheless a great place to get out and explore, thanks to miles of water in every direction, and “hidden gem” destinations like harlowe creek or sugarloaf island. with lots of makeshift routes to explore, and conditions that can be conducive to newcomers and advanced paddlers alike, a morehead city kayaking expedition can serve as a fine way to enjoy the local landscape from an entirely new perspective.








radio island


visitors cruising along us highway 70 in between the towns of morehead city and beaufort will briefly travel over a small parcel of land that makes a momentary appearance in between the two on-the-water bridges. this small slip of terrain is known as radio island, and it’s certainly more than meets the eye. home to a yacht club, several marinas, a scenic beach, a fishing pier, and multiple boat or kayak launching areas, radio island offers visitors a surprisingly large number of things to do while being relatively “close to home” for morehead city or beaufort vacationers and locals. definitely worth a second look, radio island is a unique component of the crystal coast landscape, and is worthy of exploration in more ways than one.










cedar island


located on the edge of north carolina and serving as a midway point between the outer banks and the crystal coast, cedar island is a relatively undiscovered gem that feels miles away from the rest of the world. close to historic and natural attractions, miles of barrier island shoreline, and the state-run ferry to ocracoke island, a cedar island vacation can be as relaxed or adventurous as a family wants, with ample opportunities to explore costal north carolina’s great outdoors.








crystal coast fishing guide

new bern firemans museum


the new bern fire department began as a fraternal organization and was originally called the "atlantic hook & ladder company," and was the first chartered fire department in the state of north carolina. this original company became inactive during the civil war when many of its volunteers were fighting for the confederate army, and noting a need for local firefighters, invading union forces who had infiltrated and then settled in new bern during the latter portion of the war, set up a rival company in 1865, the "new bern steam fire engine company no. 1." the two companies remained in service well after the civil war ended, but the initial rivalry between north and south originating companies never dissipated. both companies would try to "out-do" each other with station equipment upgrades, and both companies regularly competed against each other in state-wide firefighting competitions. (incidentally, both performed exceedingly well, perhaps due in no small part in an effort to out-do the other rival.)

the mainland and waterfront boat slips are separated by a long boardwalk edging the water, which is ideal for a sunset or morning stroll. visitors can work up an appetite as they admire the miles-wide views of the bogue sound and money island bay, and can relax on strategically placed benches and wooden "deck swings" overlooking the scene. other amenities include shaded gazebos and information kiosks that outline the history of the waterfront, and indicate local points of interest. new visitors should also be on the lookout for the giant and colorful statue of king neptune, who stands guard over the local marinas and docks, and is located close to the hub of the downtown region.

summer visitors can rent kayaks and canoes off the downtown docks as well for their own, self-guided adventures, and anglers are advised to look into the local charter fishing services available. home to the annual big rock blue marlin tournament, morehead city is renowned for its charter fishing fleet, and fishermen who book a half-day or full-day trip will enjoy some of the best fishing on the east coast, guided by some of eastern north carolina's most experienced local captains and mates.

there are several hotels and inns located within walking distance of the downtown area, and most all of the local marinas offer exceptional, first-class services and amenities for travelers visiting by water. electric hook-ups, wireless internet access, showers, restrooms, laundry facilities and small supply stores are all common attributes, with countless restaurants, shops and local attractions located just steps off the docks.

the waterfront is also home to the popular jaycee park, which is the venue of choice for a number of popular annual events, including morehead city's summer concert series, double decker bus tours, and community-wide parades and holiday celebrations.
