simshost is closed
we're sorry. simshost closed permanently on its fifth anniversary date, june 1, 2007.

a note from the folks at simshost:
we sincerely thank the thousands of sims fans who helped to keep simshost on line all these
years.  with your understanding and support, we had a great run; however, simshost never
reached break-even and the gulf between operating costs and revenues from subscriptions and downloads
grew to the point that simshost was losing more money than we could possibly afford.  







during its 5-year run, simshost had the inestimable privilege of 
        hosting all these wonderful sites:
