it's been a quiet week




working busily on lots of projects at work and following a number of word game apps on the kindle (trying to improve/save what memory i have left). that left minimal time for knitting this week.

only fo is a tiny pair of baby sockies. they are knit from some leftover hand painted/dyed yarn that comes out self-striping at this tiny size.

needles are 2's. pattern is a basic sock, found long ago on elann.com which only exists in memory these days. 

cast on 30 stitches, join being careful not to twist. . .labels: baby things, stash busting

whatever lola wants

          there's a song from damn yankees that says it all. you can hear it  here.




and here's lola. in the sweater that she wanted (okay, her mom wanted). i made one like it (without the pink trim) for her partner in crime, charlie.

(no, lola and charlie are not mine!) sweaters were a special request from younger son for a friend.  

yarn, stylecraft chunky life and vanna's choice. free online pattern  here.



what does the fox say?

i'm not certain that we will ever know.this one (who goes by the name of fleabag) is destined for an easter egg hunt at the home of the baby grands.

so far, he's been silent.

and i need to make at least 2 more equally cute egg stuffers pronto! easter is a mere 3 weeks away.


pattern in the oop book in the background. yarn, odd bits of sock yarn, probably brown sheep wildfoote.


i'm not especially inclined to review this book. a quick search tells me that it's available (possibly) from uk vendors, but amazon lists it only in the used state. i bought mine (remaindered) at ollie's (good stuff, cheap) a couple years ago--for less than $5. i have made up only one of the patterns (fleabag) and it is fiddly beyond beyond. part of that is my own fault, as i used sock weight yarn and size 1 dpns. the pattern calls for dk/worsted and size 4s. i think you can see the problem.





baby, baby, bay-bee!

 and i am replenishing my stock of baby presents.

this newest carseat blankie is in webs house brand valley yarns dana in a baby blue. when dawn has failed to crack (darn you, dst!) it's hard(er) to get an accurate color on an iphone camera. it's a little deeper irl

i'll make a pair of matching booties and stash this one away for the next hypothetical future person.

can't say enough nice things about this leisure arts pattern booklet . i've made several of them (look back to januaryish 2014 for more pictures). there's a crochet version  also available. most knitters and crocheters would not need (technically) either of these booklets, but frankly, i'm not sure that i would have gotten the concept without mine! i mean, small blankie, perfect for tucking around a tiny infant; no excess fabric to trip up mom (or dad). come on, am i the only one who was in the dark?labels: baby things, dogs, kid things, reviews

little things mean a lot!





it's only a matter of time before the spring fundraisers start, and i want to be ready.

these little tea toters use smallish (15 g or so) amounts of worsted weight cotton yarn, a cute button, and about 45 minutes of knitting and finishing time.

with a tea bag or two tucked inside, they make a nice gift to tuck into a birthday card if you are so inclined. 





some leftover (from the last decade) fun fur and a couple hours yielded a fuzzy hat for the girl who is into hats.

just like eloise wore



there's a wonderful series of books by kay thompson about a little girl who lives in the plaza with her nanny and her dog weenie and her turtle skipperdee.

at the height of the cold war, this delightful moppet travels to moscow in the aptly titled book eloise in moscow.  i was making something a little special for the purple warrior princess when i realized it looks a whole lot like the hat that eloise wore.

and so, we will call this the russian hat and hope that it keeps pwp as toasty as eloise's kept her.labels: baby grands, children's things, silliness

cold weather; warm gear






finished this soft and cuddly scarf last week. it's from the last of some bernat soy and planned for a yarn bombing. however, the cold weather may have me rethinking that!




and the reaction of tpt (tiny prince two/too) got me thinking about the monster pants leftovers and so i cast on a couple of scarves for him and his big bro (tpo - tiny prince original).

i may have mentioned that both of the tiny princes are no longer tiny.

and yes, i know that scarves are often not recommended for little kids, but they aren't so little any more.










did i mention that it's cold?

these should go out in tuesday's mail (monday is a holiday). labels: big people clothes, kid things, stash busting

love is in the air





using up a ball of knit picks dishie (color tomato) to make some heart-themed dishcloths for a swap. 




all of these came from a 2001 leisure arts booklet: dishcloths from the heart.






i'm pleased with the way they turned out. none of them was difficult to knit, though i will admit that i ripped back (frogged) this one twice before i got my act together. 





and this, is a mug rug. if you look closely (make it bigger by clicking on the photo), you can see the heart there as well. on-line pattern, white bernat organic natural cotton, last of many balls.

i will miss that stuff!labels: holidays

monster pants finito!





seeing photos on facebook of scarf-bombed landscapes, i decided to cast on some bernat soy leftovers  and make a scarf to leave for someone who might need it.

bernat soy is discontinued blend of soy fiber and ack. it's soft and drapey, so it should be good for wrap around the face and neck.

i have 2 full skeins and some bits and pieces. should be enough.




and the monster pants (see previous post) are finished! yay!!

this is the front. 




and here is the business end.

weather permitting, they'll go out in the mail on monday or tuesday.

i will probably make another pair as a fair entry. but for right now, i need to concentrate on other stuff.labels: baby grands, children's things, silliness
