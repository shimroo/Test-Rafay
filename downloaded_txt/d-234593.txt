“i moved to auburn in december of 2021 and did not know anyone.  i opened my own marketing agency and knew i needed to get my name out in the community.  joining the auburn chamber was one of my first steps.  i went to my first leads for business with the chamber in january.  since that first meeting and all the leads for business since, i have gotten orders every time.  i love the staff and feel like they are family.  they are so willing to help with any needs i have for my business.  they have also done orders with me since i am part of the chamber.  i do not know why anyone in business would not choose to be part of the auburn chamber.  it truly is a profitable and smart decision if you are in business of any kind.  if you want to build your business or increase your revenue, then you should definitely choose to be a part of the chamber.”

kendyl white
owner, flipper marketing 








“owning and operating a small business can be overwhelming and even isolating at times. thankfully, being a member of the chamber of commerce provides a much-needed opportunity to connect with other business owners and professionals in our area. not only have those connections helped grow my business, but i have also truly enjoyed getting to know the chamber team and other chamber members at various events, and being around people who are passionate about their work and the community we live in.”

lauren beesley








“as a chamber of commerce member, i am able to see firsthand the partnership the chamber has with the city of auburn. these connections tie directly to the success of doing business in auburn. i contribute many of my connections personally and business-wise to my investment in the auburn chamber of commerce.  i will see the reward of being a member for many years to come.”
