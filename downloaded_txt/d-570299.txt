the service desk when i first came in to the office, my primary office, the two ladies and the gentleman was awesome. they checked me in. when i got back, the wait wasn't long. zarina was very helpful, very informal. she looked over my history, my past, and then asked me how i was feeling. she was very considerate and i appreciate her service to the utmost. i respect her opinion and i value her as my doctor.


anonymous


















yes, everything was really good. dr. schafer and his crew took very good care of me. i feel very well taken care of. this is, you know, this accident that happened was 100% my fault, but these guys are standing up and doing what needs to be done to get me better. and i really, really appreciate that. and i really do. so yeah, excellent care. very glad that i ended up with dr. schafer and his team. they really know what they're doing. thank you.
