romance row: lauderdale by the sea







photo credit: lbts

this year in springtime, i enjoyed a two-week writer’s sojourn in lauderdale-by-the-sea. during my stay, i laid my head on the pillows of ten different boutique lodgings that are adjacent to each other, a.k.a. romance row. i also took time to relax and reflect on my life’s passion – writing – and how the sea has always been my muse. it was romantic in the traditional sense, to be sure, as my beau also enjoyed part of this stay with me. but i also romanced the destination. or perhaps more appropriately, the destination romanced me. i left a little of my heart in this seaside town. here are my stories.

houses of refuge
florida’s east coast settlements have a long history of rescuing shipwreck survivors.

in 1715, a strong hurricane hit what is present day vero beach, shipwrecking eleven of twelve ships carrying treasure from the new world to spain. those who survived and made it to shore established a camp and received food and aid from local indians, the ais, who were hunter-gatherers. today, the location of the camp can be found at the mcclarty treasure museum just south of sebastian inlet.

romance row: driftwood beach club





this year in springtime, i enjoyed a two-week writer’s sojourn in lauderdale-by-the-sea, a quaint, seaside village located on florida’s southeast coast. the sea shored up her bounty of gifts for me. in turn, i gift you my stories. visit the story map to navigate this travel memoir.

highway to bliss
i arrived in lauderdale-by-the-sea with a friend who drove me 50 miles from palmetto bay to this seaside village. the journey is worth noting because it involved local miami traffic and a trek up i-95. this time, the highway from hell led me to this magical place. it’s not quite as dramatic as crossing the 7-mile bridge in the florida keys, but the feeling is similar. “i’m here,” i thought. “i can breathe now. i’ve really left it all behind.”

where in the world is maria?

after 12 amazing years as one of miami's trailblazing blogs, sex and the beach has formally retired. one april morning in 2017, i hopped on a greyhound bus with one suitcase, went on a roadtrip with no plan, and never looked back. currently residing in the nation's capital.my "single woman's guide to chronic living" told it like it is -- from the banal to the sublime -- and garnered best of miami and other awards throughout the years. satb made many miamians spit take with their cafesitos many a morning. while dinosaurs roamed the earth and print newspapers stained fingers, i also wrote a monthly humor sex and relationships column as manola blablablanik for a local weekly.once i was fresh on the road as a #miamiexpat, i still stirred things up as an "expat writer" from the 305 at miami new times, which featured my juicy op-eds about #asstown.since miami made me, part of my heart will be there forever, along with my beloved gente who are still part of my life, even if we don't get together for drinks on the beach. but the divorce became official in 2018 when i changed my area code and driver's license to the district, leaving the magic city for the infinite universe that beckoned.find satellites of me and my words on facebook, twitter, instagram, where the tribe sits around the fire. or simply browse the archives at leisure to enjoy 12 years worth of stories on this award-winning blog.
