the courts are not the government and have no authority lawfully over you.

















 --the courts are not the government and have no authority lawfully 
		over you.  
 why? 
 because they are for-profit corporations and must have a 
		corporate charter that must comply with the constitution.
when you are charged with any ‘crime’ (definition: violation of public 
		policy (code)) the first thing to do "order to show cause in the form of a conditional acceptance.' 
the maxims 
		of law are always true, such as “he who does not deny, admits” or “an 
		unrebutted affidavit stands as truth,” and the system of justice is 
		built around ‘honor and dishonor.’ 
when you receive a ‘presentment’ 
		(document or instrument) making a claim on you (foe example if cps wants your children, 
		or you violated a penal code or vehicle code) you would be in dishonor 
		if you fail to answer it and will receive default judgment. if you fail 
		to show up at court it is a default judgment. 
so don’t be in dishonor 
		and question the charge or debt owed. in the simplest form is would be 
		making a photo copy of the original ‘presentment’ (traffic ticket, court 
		summons, notice of default (foreclosure)) and writing in red pen 
		diagonally across it “refused for cause” “per ucc 1-308” then qualify 
		your signature by putting “without prejudice” (this retains all your 
		rights and without it you lose your rights) then “by:” to the left of 
		your signature and then your signature and below your signature 
		“authorized representative.” 
if your all capital lettered name is on the presentment, i.e. john h. 
		doe then that is a ens legis, legal fiction (not living soul) and you 
		are the authorized representative of that corporate fiction, see ucc 
		3-4021 showing the authorized representative is not liable for the party 
		signed on behalf of, i.e. john doe. get a friend or neighbor or anyone 
		‘not a party to the case’ that is not named or someone who will be 
		called as a ‘witness’, to fill out a ‘proof of service by mail’ and put 
		you response in the letter and mail it back 1st class, if it isn’t that 
		important, certified mail (and include the certified mail # in the proof 
		of service) if it is more important. if it is very important and will be 
		the best form of evidence at a court case get a green signature receipt 
		card to go with the certified mail ($3.50+ $2 for the green card) as 
		this will be allowed as evidence)
