about us 




words are power. urban word champions youth voice by providing platforms for literacy, self-expression, civic engagement, and leadership through free creative writing, college prep workshops, and performance opportunities.  urban word equips youth to harness their power as leaders at the intersection of the literary arts and civic engagement. we are the founder of the national youth poet laureate program, a renowned program that celebrates youth for their excellence as writers and their impact on their communities.through the transformative power of the written and spoken word, urban word provides young, creative voices, often those who are marginalized, the tools, training, and platforms to rewrite the narratives that shape their lives and their communities.
