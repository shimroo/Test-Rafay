having been in the catering business for over a decade, we wanted to share some insights that would be incredibly helpful for your catering companies, and those looking to get into the business. most of these we learned the hard way making mistakes, and if we can help you out with our words of wisdom we’re happy to pass the torch a long and save you the stress of learning these by making mistakes on the job. our team at crayons catering recently hosted an amazing celebratory party for john kinsky, owner of madison demolition pros. john celebrated 10 years in the construction industry with his team of house demolition contractors and he invited subcontractors to dinner with his company. it was a relatively high-pressure event as it was a great opportunity for crayons catering to generate more business from the construction industry. the whole day went so well and was perfectly timed that we wanted to jot down our insights for you to learn from.
tip 1: make sure you have the right venue details
the night before, it’s best practice to plug the venue address into gps to make sure you know where you’re headed and what route you’ll take. don’t forget to account for traffic. always leave a buffer of 15 minutes to load your catering vehicle and unload it when you arrive at the catering location. most likely, you won’t be able to park right in front of the venue front doors to anticipate in advance time to get all of the deliciously prepared foods into the right room.
it’s so stressful when you’re running late for an important and large job, so timing to the minute is key. if you’re serving food that’s not being prepared on-site, then every minute in your breakdown of timing counts. if you arrive too early and the client isn’t going to be eating the food until a certain time, like say for a lunch meeting, then you don’t want the food to be too cooled down by the time it’s being enjoyed.
make sure that your purchase order form has all the necessary details of where you’ll be stgaging the food and beverages as well as where the preparation area will be and the times for each course and the overall service. double check who will be providing and setting up equipment such as tables, chairs and linens. when you scope out the venue, make sure that power outlets will be easily accessible for any warming platters and cooking equipment you’ll be using.
tip 2. coordinate with other vendors
as the lead catering company, you’ll have one manager be the point person for your catering company as well as any other third parties. this could include rental companies, and of course the client. make sure any vendors for drinks and rentals know their delivery times and setup locations in advance of the big day.
determine who the on-site and day-of contact will be. this will be the person leading the team that everyone else will be looking to for direction. if headsets and communication devices are needed, plan this in advance.
tip 3. make sure food is safe and held in a temperature-controlled climate
this will vary greatly depending on the type of food being served and where the majority of the food will be prepped and cooked. make sure you have thermometers and someone in charge of checking food temperatures before and throughout service.
now that we’ve shared these tips, you’re in a better position for your next catering gig to run smoothly!
