krista demas p’28
“at gould, my son has found a caring, warm community, an academic experience that is challenging him in all the right ways, and a location that gets him in close proximity to town, sunday river resort, and two golf courses. we couldn’t be happier!”





eva ’25
“working in the visual arts department at gould has been a great experience because there are so many disciplines to pick from—hands-on activities like hand-building in pottery and metalwork to painting and fashion drawing. you can experience a little bit of everything and hone in on your passion. coming to the art cottage is something i look forward to every day, and something i hope to pursue in college.”





lauren jacobs ’03, phd
“at gould, i saw the very best of what education could be and the impact educators could have. it became clear that i was meant to be an educator and wanted to be the kind of educator and provide the educational experiences i had at gould.”





beata kulesza p’25
“i see how difficult it can be for young athletes to balance school with competitive sports, but gould does it right. our daughter’s been able to excel in the classroom, on the athletic field, and as a competitive snowboard racer without having to sacrifice one for the other. the flexibility gould offers with training schedules, combined with strong academic support, has allowed her to thrive in both academics and athletics.”
