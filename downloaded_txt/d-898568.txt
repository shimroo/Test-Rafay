what people are saying… 





                        as a first year mot student, my classmates and i have benefited greatly from trail guide to the body. it’s informative as an academic, and perhaps just as importantly, an emotional tool. thank you for making this relatively dry subject exponentially more entertaining.”



abigail dann
student in the mot program dept. of occupational therapy, university of pittsburgh 






                        trail guide to the body is the best anatomy book on the market. the ease of use and thoroughness of the material make it an irreplaceable book throughout the entirety of our program. i can't imagine teaching without it!”
