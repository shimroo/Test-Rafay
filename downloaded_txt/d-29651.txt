you were a talented child, you came to live in our town. we never bothered to scream, when your mask came off 












and who can bear to be forgotten, and who can bear to be forgotten

























never look back, walk tall, act fine





























































i'm an alligator, i'm a mama-papa coming for you, i'm the space invader, i'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you













she asked me to stay and i stole her room. she asked for my love and i gave her a dangerous mind.





































ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

it's a crash course for the ravers
it's a drive-in saturday
