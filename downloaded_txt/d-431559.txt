dockdogs
dockdogs was born in 2000 to create a nationally recognized competitive sport based on rules and precedents in track and field competitions.  much of dockdogs big air dog competitions’ popularity comes from having national standards and objective measures that allow people to train competitively and have objective feedback on their progress.  also, our open competitions allow “anyone with a dog and toy” to participate in the sport and have a chance at national recognition.
