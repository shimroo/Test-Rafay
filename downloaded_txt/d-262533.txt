empowering operators on the plant floor
plant scada keeps taking on data sets as you add them. a context-aware consolidated view of operations and enhanced visualization capabilities let operators use them efficiently.
 




















increase operator awareness



context-aware scada visualization with an out-of-the-box situational awareness layout provides flexible, consistent and rich context for operators.
equipment-driven interface gives operators real-time, holistic situational context that helps them improve efficiency and take timely corrective action.
a single interface seamlessly integrates alarming, trending, interlocks and control data together across multiple monitors without the need for coding.
minimal visual distractions let operators make timely decisions that mitigate risk and operational downtime.












advanced alarm management



alarm indicators quickly draw operators' attention and help locate the source of anomalies and their severity.
alarm shelving lets you temporarily silence alarms for a specific duration or until a specified time—with the ability to re-shelve as needed.
define up to 8 causes, responses and consequences for your alarms to give your operators the information they need to deal with abnormal situations.
an instant visual alarm summary shows the highest priority alarm for each piece of equipment, focusing operators on abnormal situations.












engineering simplicity



a wide selection of configurable symbols follows industry best practices for situational awareness and abnormal situation management.
inclusive symbol library significantly reduces time you spend building graphics while still letting you customize objects for your unique needs.
integrated development environment, modern graphics system and workspace concept reduce the time you spend building complex layouts.
equipment templates simplify design by reusing, duplicating and propagating changes.
deploy changes live without interrupting operations, stopping data gathering or taking systems offline.
centralized project deployment provides controlled transfer of project changes to servers and clients, native version control with local and remote rollback, and delta-only transfer.
unique cicode programming language gives you deep customization and flexibility in design and scripting.












additional capabilities



html5 web client (local network)
plant scada access anywhere extension (external network)
real-time reporting
process analyst trending
statistical process control module (spc)
architectural flexibility for centralized or distributed systems, inclusive of clustering
client and server redundancy
150+ communication drivers, including native integration to schneider electric devices
role-based user security permissions
multi-language support





























access plant scada from anywhere
three configurations let users visualize, collaborate and execute regardless of where they are or what device they have. users can securely monitor, control and troubleshoot plant equipment or processes from any location, on any device, at any time.
