ercim‚Äàpublished a stragegy report ‚Äútowards a shared ai strategy for european digital science institutes and organisations‚Äù

 generative ai (genai) and large language models (llms) are transforming science and society, presenting significant opportunities alongside inherent challenges. european digital science institutes and organizations are well-positioned to contribute to responsible development and use of these technologies.
this report summarizes the discussions and findings from the 2024 ercim visionary event "challenges and opportunities of foundational models and generative ai (genai) for science and society," held on 16 april 2024 in brussels. experts from across europe convened to examine the rapidly evolving landscape of genai and llms, their impact on science and society, and the role of european institutions in this context.
this report first presents the findings of the event. subsequently, it outlines several key highlights and high-level recommendations. for more details, see the section recommendations for institutional ai strategies.
