bonnell tree

b n l 
 is a genealogy/family tree project started in september of 
          1997. if you are a bonnell, or are willing 
          to admit that you're a relative, you might find this 
          interesting! i'm looking for new information and i'm willing to share 
          information as i climb this tree. 
          
      if you're on the tree any-where, i'll add you to the bonnell e-mail list,
      plus the url-web page list -- if you desire. 

	also, please visit the "in search of john bonnell" page. people have been looking
       for this guy for years!
