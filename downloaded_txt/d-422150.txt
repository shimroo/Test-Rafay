most parts are in stock, but there are times when unexpected demand for an item will cause it to go out of stock. as most of you know, because of the vast number of truck possibilities we do not stock power or trailer trucks.  these are made to order.  delivery is dependent on shop load, and parts availability.



as of 
1/12/25
 trucks are on a minimum of a twelve to fourteen week delivery schedule. car powering takes a little longer. 
    
all part and truck orders must be pre-paid. in stock parts orders are being shipped in about six weeks.
email us with your list and we will return a net due invoice. paypal is no longer accepted.
