our law firm specializes in criminal defense across the denver metro area and in numerous other district, county, and municipal courts throughout colorado. we focus exclusively on criminal justice matters. if you have been charged with or are under investigation for a crime, please contact our office immediately.
we handle cases from minor misdemeanors to serious felonies that could result in life imprisonment. when reaching out, please be ready to discuss your charges and the county of your court appearance. it is crucial not to communicate with law enforcement before consulting an attorney. our website offers preliminary advice on managing police encounters before you are able to speak with a defense attorney.
protect your rights
the choices you make at the beginning of your legal journey can significantly influence the final resolution of your case. it’s essential to approach these initial decisions with care and informed judgment, as they set the trajectory for everything that follows.
understanding your constitutional rights
the u.s. constitution grants us rights designed to safeguard us from overreach by the government. these rights serve as a shield, ensuring that the immense power of the state is used fairly and judiciously. however, the effectiveness of these constitutional protections depends largely on your awareness of them and your ability to assert them appropriately.
when and how to use your rights
understanding when and how to exercise these rights is crucial. for instance, the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney are fundamental protections under the miranda rights, which come into play the moment you are taken into custody. invoking these rights immediately can prevent self-incriminating statements and ensure that you have legal representation during interrogations.
moreover, the fourth amendment protects you from unreasonable searches and seizures, meaning that law enforcement needs probable cause or a warrant to conduct a search of your person, your home, your car, or your personal belongings. knowing how to assert these rights when confronted by police can prevent unauthorized searches that could lead to the discovery of incriminating evidence, whether relevant or not to the case at hand.
the importance of legal representation
in addition to knowing these rights, it is equally important to understand the process of securing a competent attorney who can navigate the complexities of the legal system on your behalf. an experienced lawyer can offer strategic advice, represent your interests in court, and negotiate with prosecutors to potentially reduce or dismiss charges based on the nuances of your case.
education on these rights and the early engagement of qualified legal counsel are critical. they not only ensure that your rights are fully protected but also enhance your chances of achieving a more favorable outcome in your case. always remember, the steps you take immediately after an accusation or arrest can profoundly impact the legal process and its results.

experience
achieving success in a criminal defense case hinges on a thorough grasp of the unique details of each situation. it’s crucial to understand both the strong points and potential vulnerabilities of the facts at hand.
gaining a deep insight into the existing evidence, as well as identifying opportunities to develop additional supportive evidence, is vital for every client’s defense strategy. knowing what evidence is available and how it can be used or challenged in court allows for a more tailored and effective approach to each case.
an effective defense also involves anticipating the prosecution’s strategy and preparing counterarguments. this proactive stance ensures that you are always a step ahead in the courtroom, ready to address and rebut any claims made against you. by meticulously analyzing every piece of evidence and constructing a robust defense, you can significantly improve the chances of a favorable outcome. engaging an experienced attorney who can navigate these complexities can make all the difference in protecting your rights and securing your future.

									i have no doubt that kevin churchill was the best attorney in that courtroom.								

									mr. churchill skillfully represented me at my bond hearing, and again at my plea & setting appearance. kevin most distinguished himself at my sentencing hearing. we met outside the courtroom to review procedure and finalize his presentation to the judge. as we were waiting for my opportunity to stand before the court, i thought of some important, but previously undisclosed facts & evidence, and shared them with kevin by passing a note. he whispered a few questions to clarify the new information, then on the spot, with no prior notice revised his argument just in time to speak briefly with the d.a., and stand before the judge with me...
