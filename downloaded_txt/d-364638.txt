welcome to
st. andrew lutheran church



please join us for our hybrid contemporary and traditional service each sunday at 9:30a.m.
we celebrate the lord’s table service every week through communion and invite all believers to receive this sacrament.
come to st. andrew lutheran as our welcomed guest. come because you love god and want to love god more. come because jesus first loved us and gave himself for us. come because you want to be filled with the holy spirit. come because you want to experience the mystery of god’s grace. whether your faith is strong or wavering, whether you attend church often or have never been before, you are welcome here.
