forever will you suffer
      "this book was audacious fun, reminding me of richard laymon and early graham masterton."  
— jack ketchum 
"forever will you suffer plays out like a film, with strong and eerie visuals, some genuine shocks, and a lingering feeling of creepiness. i strongly recommend it!"
— jonathan maberry
