dallas / ft worth / n texas live blues 3/320 thru 3/9/20








march is international women's history month!


in celebration of 2020 international women's history month big texas blues will feature the music and herstories of blues women for the month of march. (including miss marcy live in the knon studios schooling you on the herstory of her shero bessie smith on tuesday, march 17th in the 7pm hour.)




some history about the blues: classic female blues was an early form of blues music, popular in the 1920s. an amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.
 classic blues were performed by female singers accompanied by pianists 
or small jazz ensembles and were the first blues to be recorded. ma rainey, mamie smith (who recorded and released the first blues record), bessie smith, ethel waters, and the other singers in this genre were instrumental in spreading the popularity of the blues. 



the classic female blues singers were pioneers in the record industry, among the first black singers and blues artists recorded. they were also instrumental in popularizing the 12-bar blues throughout the united states. mahalia jackson and janis joplin are among those who named bessie smith as an influence. according to leroi jones,
 phonograph recordings of the classic blues singers "affected the 
existing folk tradition and created another kind of tradition that was 
unlike any other in the past".
 


daphne duval harrison wrote that the blues women's contributions 
included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing 
which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics
 using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. the blues women thus effected 
changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, 
broadway musicals, torch songs of the 1930s and 1940s, gospel, rhythm 
and blues, and eventually rock and roll."

think there were only a few classic blues women? check out this list:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_classic_female_blues_singers


for more information on classic and contemporary blues women, check out the national women in blues web site at: 

https://www.nationalwomeninblues.com/history/ 




why do we celebrate women's history month? 

the purpose of women's history month is to increase consciousness and knowledge of women's history: to take one month of the year to remember the contributions of notable and ordinary women, in hopes that the day will soon come when it's impossible to teach or learn history without remembering these contributions.



why we celebrate women's history month in march - thoughtco









the 2020 women's history month theme is “valiant women of the vote.” the theme honors "the brave women who fought to win suffrage rights for women, and for the women who continue to fight for the voting rights of others."
