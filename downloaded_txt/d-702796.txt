signs of lovefor ourdeaf dogs














       our mission is to provide information and hope for our deaf,        four-legged family members who have the wonderful capability of being amazing and loving pets.



























our precious deaf dogsall too often, precious deaf dogs are destroyed, mistreated, abandoned, and surrounded by a myriad of untrue myths. our aim is for their human family or caretakers to better protect, provide for, and promote the acceptance and love of these extraordinary creations.




    all about us
  

















our family










india

india was hogan’s vivacious and playful older sister who welcomed and loved hogan from the first moment they met.




india's life











hogan

hogan was 18-months old when the entire family embraced him with open, loving arms. he taught the world that deaf dogs can make wonderful four-legged family members and can, without a doubt, learn to understand a long list of words in american sign language.  he offered everyone the real promise of hope.




hogan's life











georgia

georgia entered our home as a foster pup when she was four months old. she never left!




georgia's life











dakota

dakota was an unexpected addition to our family and offered us heartfelt appreciation and love for his rescue. he suffered from kidney failure due to disastrous veterinary care.




dakota's life











clarence

clarence was mama’s baby angel the instant he arrived into our home. his devotion, dedication, and pure love were nothing less than extraordinary.




clarence's life











judea

judea was a mere eight weeks old when we received the news that this precious deaf bundle from heaven needed her loving, forever home. 




judea's life











elsie

caged and undernourished for almost three years, sweet elsie came to us in ct by ground transport from the ca/or state line. that place called home was instrumental in her rescue and life-saving efforts.

deaf dogs are greatly underrated, not until actually owning & living with one did we realize how wonderful & misunderstood they are. they don’t need to hear to listen.connie and hogan opened the world to the acceptance of our deaf dogs.
- mary lyons author, paramedic, therapy dog handler


























my reason for belonging to this and facebook’s deafdogs group has evolved. initially, i was seeking help and support. having never had a deaf dog before, i now enjoy belonging to a community with a shared passion for deaf dogs and i also try to help and support those just starting this wonderful journey. 
– mary motleyauthor


























“connie was so responsive, encouraging and genuinely caring when i reached out asking for advice/help after adopting our deaf puppy. not only helpful advice and tips, but when our scared pup finally realized she was home and played with our older, bigger dog, wrestling and wagging her tail, i took a video to capture the moment. a huge shift from having her tail tucked under her belly, every move so tentative. connie was the first person i thought to share the video with, knowing she would understand the absolute joy seeing our girl playing, having fun, and clearly trusting her new family. puppy zooms!! and i wasn’t disappointed - i could feel the warmth and happiness in every word in her response. i’m reading connie’s first book - her love and patience shines through on every page...easy, engaging stories, completely heartwarming. so, yes... i’m a big fan!! ☺️!”
