insulin
                potentiation therapy
 (  ipt )






cancer chemotherapy
            -- without major side
            effects.
gentle cancer treatment
            -- without
            trauma.
infectious disease
              treatment:  faster and more effective.  
 could fight drug
              resistance.
available to patients today, with  no need to wait years for government
            (fda) approval. more than 70 years of 
            successful use.   
with ipt, regular drugs act like "super"
            drugs, for treatment of many different diseases.
these are observations that some 
            ipt doctors have reported for many years.supported by  scientific papers, and  reports from many doctors. 
              however, despite more than 140 years of cumulative reported ipt success, and
              billions of dollars spent on other medical research, no
              clinical or laboratory research on ipt has been done or funded... yet.
ipt deserves laboratory
            studies and clinical trials.
"the second discovery of
            insulin." 



ipt is insulin potentiation therapy,
        a non-diabetic use of the hormone insulin to dramatically improve
        effectiveness and delivery of standard medications.  
 ipt has an
        outstanding 135 doctor-year track record (115 years for cancer) over 72
        years, and is ready for clinical
        trials and widespread use.

cancer
        treatment with ipt is reported to be gentler, safer, more effective,
        and less expensive, with no surgery, no radiation, and usually no
        side effects. 
breakthrough results have also been
        reported for arthritis, as well as for infectious, respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and other diseases.
this slight modification of standard
        medicine could help many medications act like super drugs, with better results for many
        millions of patients.  the us national institutes of health has
        expressed interest in clinical trials of ipt for cancer, but has so far
        provided no funding. 

ipt is 21st century medicine. 
        discovered in 1926 by donato perez garcia md, fostered by his son and
        grandson, with 140+ doctor-years of experience over 72 years, yet still
        unknown by the world,
        ipt is just starting a scientific and clinical rebirth.
