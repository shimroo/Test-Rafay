who we are 
security bank's heritage is one built on financial strength and integrity. our corporation was chartered as a state bank on april 3, 1931. at that time, it was called newbern state bank and was located in downtown newbern.
in october 1968, the name was changed to security state bank to reflect its expansion into other dyer county towns. in may 1969, the harrell avenue branch was opened in dyersburg. a second branch was opened in dyersburg on king avenue in september 1970.
as the financial needs of the community grew and security state bank prospered, a new bank was built on west main in newbern.
