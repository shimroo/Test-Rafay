 globe roller club
we strive to provide a safe, family-friendly environment.  because of current social conditions, we are changing our policy for this upcoming season and will be unable to allow children to be dropped off without being registered by a parent.  children must be registered or
have a parent with them all night.  registration is free and takes only a minute.
