                        what our students are saying
                        
                        




my entire experience at gcc for the past two years has been nothing short of phenomenal,
                                    i was so scared to go back to college later in life, plus i was able to utilize the
                                    mi reconnect program, which was so helpful. i cannot say enough good about gcc, this
                                    community is so lucky to have the college.

associate of applied business - general business





i attended gcc with the intention of transferring to a four-year university. i received
                                 a valuable education that left me with the confidence to attend a larger university
                                 and prepared me for the material.

i wouldn't be able to have the job that i love today without my degree from gcc!

general education




gcc makes it really easy to get involved. i am able to be the ra, work at the welcome
                                 desk, and join multiple activities, while being able to also focus on my studies.
                                 the faculty and staff have been great to work with and i truly feel that they have
                                 my best interest in mind. i would recommend gcc to anyone!
