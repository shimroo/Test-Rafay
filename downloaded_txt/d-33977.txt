	 despite free parking next door, port authority ponders building pay lot
	 
    


idiots.  fucking idiots, i tell you.i do not know what it is about landlocked states but the people that run those places are pea brained idiots.if there existed, near to you, a pay parking lot which was built next to a free lot that garnered only 320 parkers out of 2,200 pay spaces, e.g. a complete failure, would you then decide to build in your own town a pay parking lot right next to a large free lot? would you?well the port authority of allegheny county is currently pondering that same question as they go over plans for a $13 million dollar parking complex set to open in 2008 next to the robinson towne center which already has free parking.what the hell??do me a favor and replace these tards asap.tags: pennsylvania, parking, idiots
