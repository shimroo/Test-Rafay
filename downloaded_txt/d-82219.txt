what is the quinceanera celebration?
the quinceanera is a celebration of a young girl’s coming of age (her 15th birthday). it is a hispanic tradition that dates back to the ancient native cultures of mexico, central and south america. this rite of initiation, that is rooted in the customs of the toltec & aztec, the maya, the quechua and other indigenous civilizations, continues today in the traditions of the present-day hispanic cultures.
