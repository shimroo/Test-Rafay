history
ardnamurchan may appear, today, to be rather a peaceful, quiet and remote corner of scotland. however, the fact that it is a peninsula on the west coast with poor land access made it ideal for the "power barons" of the past. a base on this peninsula could be a highly important strategic fortification for overseeing activities in mull, skye, the argyll coast and even as far as the western isles.

sporting
