                  i love the flexmls pro app because, no matter what i’m doing or where i am, i can look at the mls. it’s a great way to keep in contact with clients and show them i’m thinking of them by sending potential properties.

                  the tech support team is very knowledgeable and easy to get in touch with. they walk through the steps so that you understand where the problem/solution is and usually it's all taken care of within 5 to 10 minutes.
