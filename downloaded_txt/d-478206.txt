3. painting

4. update cabinets  
you can totally make your cabinets look good as new without changing the whole cabinet. updating a cabinet is as easy as putting a new stain to it or changing the hard wares of its doors. it could do wonders and it would make the whole room look more put together.  
 
5. exterior love  
never forget to put some attention to the exterior of your home. it is important that you do it because if you don’t take care of the exterior part of the house it can be a little investment down the drain. so, show your exterior home some care and see what you can do about it.
