welcome


one of the very first flat fee mls listing companies offering for sale by owners an mls listing since 1999!
flat fee mls & for sale by owner packages
founded in 1999, flatlist.com has offered sellers a listing in their local
mls without paying a listing office commission, saving thousands of dollars in real estate commissions.

founder, stacie whitfield
seller's property will be listed in their local mls that covers the county where the property is located.
you are not required to offer a buyer's agent commission!
all flatlist packages include max exposure to buyers and agents including a listing on zillow, redfin, trulia, realtor.com, homes.com and hundreds of other sites that show mls listings.
local buyer agents will be able to view your listing and make offers via the mls.
all commissions are completely negotiable and are not set by law or the mls.
