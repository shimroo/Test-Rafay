recent sermons
christ for us was started by rev. rolf preus in order to share the good news of salvation by grace through faith in christ alone through sermons, papers, and bible studies. his son, rev. james preus has continued this project of sharing orthodox lutheran theology with the chief focus on christ for us. 

papers
the christ for us website has been a source of encouragement and study for many years.  it is extraordinary to have the writings and papers of reverend doctor robert d. preus and reverend rolf preus listed in one place.  we look forward to the many years to come as the preus brothers contribute to this large body of work.
