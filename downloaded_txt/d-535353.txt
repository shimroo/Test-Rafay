to think of st. margaret’s is to imagine education at its most dynamic—where learning is not confined to classrooms but shaped by the natural world and the vibrant community around it. situated on the banks of the mile-wide rappahannock river in tappahannock, va, st. margaret’s is not merely near the water but part of it. the river is both a presence and a teacher, offering students an unparalleled opportunity to learn through experience, discovery, and connection.at the same time, students enjoy independence in a historic riverside town. just a short walk from campus, they can visit local coffee shops, ice cream parlors, and restaurants, engaging with the world beyond their studies in a way few boarding schools allow. unlike rural campuses that feel removed from daily life, st. margaret’s offers the best of both worlds—an immersive, hands-on education shaped by the river and a setting that fosters confidence, self-reliance, and a deep sense of place.









































“i value the 'doing' as my former co-ed school had the majority of girls watching others on the stages, fields, and front rows of the classroom. at st. margaret's, it is an incredible sisterhood where we 'learn by doing' and grow from real achievements.”kendall q. '24, head prefect






























“where every rappahannock current inspires.”




























living & leaning by the gospel of do!



the ethos of st. margaret’s



girls thrive on the "gospel of do," a philosophy that fosters genuine achievement. grounded in the principles of growth with grace, this ethos inspires young women to pursue excellence while nurturing qualities of kindness and resilience. it envisions a future where success is not solely defined by accomplishments but also by their positive impact. through this holistic approach, girls are empowered to navigate life's challenges with a unique blend of strength and grace, shaping a brighter and more promising future for themselves and the world around them.
