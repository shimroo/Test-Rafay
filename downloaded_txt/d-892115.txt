we were the first officially recognized club
founded in 1989 by scott nickerson
scott later went on to found parrot heads in paradise.
we are about 150 members strong and very active
if you're not familiar with parrot heads you may be wondering who we are and what we do. many people think of parrot heads as laid back slackers who do nothing but dream of living in the islands and pass out on the lawn at buffett concerts.
we are. 
but we're also so much more: we're people from all walks of life who enjoy the music, lifestyle (whether real or imagined) and attitude toward living of jimmy buffett.
we sponsor or participate in numerous community service and charitable events throughout the year including the walk to end alzheimer's, numerous food drives for the atlanta community food bank and we collect toys for toys-for-tots.  through fundraising and our parrothead cruise event we support several breast cancer related charities including swim across america, paint georgia pink, sisters by choice, and the national breast cancer foundation.
we're a jimmy buffett fan club with a community service problem

the wing cafe and tap house
is the home of the atlanta parrot head club
we host a regular happy hour at 6:00pm on the third thursday of every month.  come join us on the patio!
the wing is located at 
2145 roswell road, suite 170, marietta, ga 30062
join us at one of our social or community service events
or stop by a club happy hour!
