about us 



for over thirty five years the bmw cognoscenti of st. louis have known to take their cars to bavarian. but what they have also known is how inaccurate it would be to reduce bavarian to just a repair shop. of course bavarian is a bmw repair shop, and now mini owners can gain admission too; but for those who know—bavarian has always been something more.

customer reviws






what our customers have to say 




★★★★★ 4.5/5 











						i cannot say enough wonderful things about john and his team!  great diagnosis, excellent work and very fair pricing.  and, the bavarian team is efficient and ever nice too!  highly recommend and worthy of a solid 5 star review!					









						super friendly, doesn't push unnecessary repairs or maintenance, feels like an old fashioned repair shop from the standpoint that they want to build a relationship with their customers vs just churn and burn. highly recommend for bmw owners.					









						took my bmw to bavarian and i must say i am pleasantly surprised by the pricing and the timeliness of their work. i have found a new place to bring my car. i trust john and his team completely.
