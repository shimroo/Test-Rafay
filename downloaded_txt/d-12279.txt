						staffordshire potteries."

						town in north staffordshire, is generally described as 
						the capital of the potteries"

						in 1874, it was made a municipal borough by royal 
						charter."

						manufactory of english porcelain was established here, 
						and ware of great lightness and beauty was produced."
