czech soccer trip - in march, 2000, i traveled to teplice, in the czech republic, to observe the youth training and development program at fk teplice, a club in the czech gambrinus liga (first division). i met with roman vlk, the head of the youth program for fk teplice and observed a number of training sessions and matched during the 8 days i was there. my notes are contained in a journal which you can access here. some of the sessions may also be reproduced in world class coaching magazine over the next few months.
