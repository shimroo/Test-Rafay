				welcome to the led shop australia®				






high quality leds since 2003high-quality and low-prices generally don’t come together in a one product. but at the led shop australia, our priority is ensuring our customers get value-for-money. all of our products are sourced from suppliers who we’ve worked with since 2003. our bulbs come with a 12 month warranty, which means if you receive a faulty unit, we’ll send you a replacement at no extra charge. at this level of quality you’ll be hard pressed to find a cheaper price elsewhere, including the big chains, who charge significantly higher prices. we also sell all our bulbs as singles, where most other suppliers only offer six or twelve packs. 12v led globes are our thing! 



low voltage led lights 6v 12v and 24v
the led shop australia stock a wide range of low voltage led lights for a variety of uses including automotive, cars, trucks, motorbikes, boats, caravans and solar homes, as well as other settings. so whether you are looking for 6v led lights, 12v led lights or 24v led lights; we’ve probably got you covered.

						i bought two lamps to use as an escape light for my fire alarm system. they are very bright - just what’s needed. these lamps are first rate, even have their own anti-static bag. thanks for suppling a quality product at a very reasonable price.					









jaymin@younggunsopalhunters  


						we love using the uv led flashlights, they are great! we will probably purchase more in the future. we use them for opal fossicking out here in white cliffs; we often take people out with us to give it ago as well.
