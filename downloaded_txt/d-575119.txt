advocacy and prevention






the community crisis center, located in elgin, illinois, was founded by a group of dedicated volunteers to meet the needs of individuals and families in crisis.
we provide safety, hope, advocacy, respite and education for those impacted by crisis and violence in illinois. founded in 1975, we are one of the oldest domestic violence shelters in illinois and were instrumental in organizing both the illinois and national coalition against domestic violence.
