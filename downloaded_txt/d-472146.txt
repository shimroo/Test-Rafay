and to prevent runaway motorboats.                                                                   beginning april 25, 2023, a                                              motorboat

personal watercraft (pwc)                                                      “personal watercraft” (pwc) means a class a motorboat less than 16 feet, designed to be operated by a person sitting, standing or kneeling on the vessel rather than the operator sitting or standing inside the vessel. examples include jet ski, sea-doo, waverunner and similar devices. boats have no brakes, and neither do pwcs. on some models, there is a moveable "gate" that can be dropped over the nozzle to provide reverse thrust. be careful, though, this was not designed to stop a pwc and jumping into reverse at high speeds may cause the bow to dive throwing the operator over the handlebars! however, some newer models feature a modified reverse bucket that has proven to be effective for slowing the craft significantly. still, the pwc glides with momentum and definitely does not stop on a dime - do not be fooled into thinking these are actual "brakes."                                                 pwcs are built for quick, sharp turns, tight-radius circling, and rapid acceleration. however, they are only truly maneuverable with the throttle engaged – to maintain steerage, you must apply throttle! the best way to avoid hitting an object is not to slow down, rather, you should apply throttle and steer away to avoid impact.

standing or kneeling on the vessel rather than the operator sitting or standing inside the vessel. examples include jet ski, sea-doo, waverunner and similar devices. boats have no brakes, and neither do pwcs. on some models, there is a moveable "gate" that can be dropped over the nozzle to provide reverse thrust. be careful, though, this was not designed to stop a pwc and jumping into reverse at high speeds may cause the bow to dive throwing the operator over the handlebars! however, some newer models feature a modified reverse bucket that has proven to be effective for slowing the craft significantly. still, the pwc glides with momentum and definitely does not stop on a dime - do not be fooled into thinking these are actual "brakes."                                                 pwcs are built for quick, sharp turns, tight-radius circling, and rapid acceleration. however, they are only truly maneuverable with the throttle engaged – to maintain steerage, you must apply throttle! the best way to avoid hitting an object is not to slow down, rather, you should apply throttle and steer away to avoid impact.
