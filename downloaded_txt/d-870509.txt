mountain biking 




  
  is a great way to enjoy the 
  outdoors while exercising and having fun at the same time.  this site 
  explores bike trails primarily in southern california but also explores other 
  areas of the west.


  
  i've tried through the descriptions and photos to give you an introduction to the  
  trails but the old saying is "seeing is believing". i hope you enjoy the site 
  and keep checking back as i will be adding new destinations.   
and make sure to check out the links page where there are related 
      sites and organizations you can join to contribute to this great sport.  
  and please visit  the 
biking gear page where you can learn 
      about the the latest latest biking gear that's a must for the trails.
