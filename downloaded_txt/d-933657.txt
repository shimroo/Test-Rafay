i just logged on to the internet and saw on msnbc the death toll now for u.s. servicemen and women is at a staggering 2,025.  please take a few minutes and think about what the families and friends of those marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen are going through...and honor their loss.  no matter what you think about the war politically, remember there are men and women serving in one of the most volatile areas of the world because their country, our country, asked them to - and they do it proudly.  they gave their lives so we can live ours freely.  we should all honor that sacrifice.
