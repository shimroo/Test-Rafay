kids love treasure hunting
think back to when you were a kid. do you 
			have some memories of hunting easter eggs? do you have some memories 
			of “discovering” what candy you had in your sack after halloween? do 
			you remember the excitement of opening presents at christmas? did 
			you ever get with your friends and go on “treasure hunts?” perhaps 
			you heard a story of a buried chest of bank robber’s loot? perhaps 
			it was a pirate treasure? or, like in my case, the lost dutchman 
			mine.

			kids love a treasure hunt. they love 
			discovery. they love finding something hidden. why not take 
			advantage of that natural drive and curiosity and provide them an 
			opportunity to develop their imagination, dedication to purpose, 
			critical thinking skills, and sense of determination by getting them 
			involved in treasure hunting....read

a draw is a minor terrain feature that also 
	starts at high ground, but is carved into the side of the hill by water and 
	erosion. the draw can be defined as having high ground on three sides and low 
	ground on one side. the draw runs downhill in between two fingers. the contour 
	lines form "v's" that point uphill. once again, notice that the v's of the draw 
	are the same v's we talked about when discussing determining uphill and downhill 
	using contour lines.
