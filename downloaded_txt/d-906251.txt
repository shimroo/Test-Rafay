all jihad, no nva



(my reprinted response to dawn legg's 9/30/05 post.)hi dawn, i was one of those terrified americans in combat in 1968 and what you say about the horror of war is very true. in the middle of the cold war, with the communists of the soviet union and china backing the north vitnamese and vowing to take over the world, the fear of such a possibility was greater than the horror and death.that the war was fought in such a ridiculous fashion, much like what we see in iraq, has to do with strategic thinking and planning and responsible execution.there is however, dawn, one huge difference between what happened in vietnam and what subsequently took place since the deaths of 1 to 2 million at the hands of pol pot and other communists.not a single nva (north vietnamese army soldier) seized the american embassy in iran in 1979. not a single nva was involved in the deaths of 63 people at the us embassy compound in beruit in 1983 nor the deaths of 241 marines six months later.no nva in '85 in madrid, none in august at rhein-main air force base where 22 were killed. it wasn't an nva on the achille lauro that pushed abe klinghoffer over the side in a wheelchair. no nva were involved in the pan am bombing over lockerbie that killed 259.it goes on and on to our embassies in africa with a death toll of 224, to the world trade center (first time). there was the uss cole, then came the beaut, as the world trade center towers collapsed, the pentagon was also attacked and the passengers dove their plane into a field in pa.about 4,000 were killed altogether and not a single nva was involved. sine then ther's been madrid, london, and most recently bali. this jihad has no discernable end and if you do not kill the terrorists they will most certainly try and kill you or those you love...guaranteed!so, i don't know what "the answer" is but i know it isn't capitulation because there is no such thing under these circumstances. no nva this time kiddo, just people who will deliberately kill anyone including themselves.what to do????bill benica, gunners mate 3/c usnboat captain t-111-10 rivdiv 111task force 117, dong tam, vietnam

we give thanks



a special thanks to molly and greg pirello of the 1865, richard jess, the slo vocal arts ensemble, pastor doug caroll, chaplain bill houston, and the wonderful men and women of the former arkii reastaurant on monterey st. for their tremendous generosity in helping us raise almost $600 towards our cayucos lost at sea memorial.additionally, our thanks go to the morro bay fisherman's association for their extraordinary contribution of $500. i will be telling you more about it in the future, but i really had to say thanks alot! the people of the central coast are as generous as any there could ever be anywhere else.last thought for today is to always read the other folks blogaroonies on this site 'cause these are some writing folks. as soon as i can find an appropriate ditty to plagiarize i'll be your guy!!! "happy trails""talk is cheap" is brought to you in part, by:the flying dutchman restaurant,ray's own brand sausages and jerkys,farm supply company, karen scott, audiology and chrys barnes, mortgage broker

just horsing around



went to the mid state fair rodeo for the first time last night. observations: i've been bullied alot worse growing up in nj than those calves were, besides it gives them something to do until they grow up and we eat 'em.horses are amazingly weird. they start out free spirited and wild and as soon as they're broken (somebody sits on them) they just stand around the rest of their lives unless a cowboy uses them for cowboying or whatever.went to the palm theatere and saw the penguin movie which should have been titiled "being a penguin really sucks!" of course, filming penguins might even suck worse.until then, "may all your trails be happy ones and don’t believe everything you hear because talk is cheap! "happy trails!""talk is cheap" is brought to you in part, by:san luis diagnostic center, 1865 restaurant,charter communications, pacific coast kitchen and bath, and slo roasted coffee.
