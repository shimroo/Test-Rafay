surgical treatments

 




 




laparoscopy

 




laparoscopy is a form of minimally invasive surgery. the surgeon inserts a tiny telescope (laparoscope) though a small incision at the umbilicus (belly-button).
the laparoscope allows the surgeon to visualize the pelvic organs on a video monitor.

 







 




robotic surgery

 




at the da vinci console, your surgeon operates while seated comfortably, viewing a highly magnified 3d image of the body’s interior. to operate, the surgeon uses master controls that work like forceps.

 







 




hysteroscopy

 




hysteroscopy is a form of minimally invasive surgery. the surgeon inserts a tiny telescope (hysteroscope) through the cervix into the uterus. the hysteroscope allows the surgeon to visualize the inside of the uterine cavity on a video monitor.
