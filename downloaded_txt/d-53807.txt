great pickup on our press release
great pickup on our press release! send2press was very responsive and communicated directly with us on a helpful addition to our release. we would use them again!

— steven harari





professionalism ensured
send2press pays attention to and points out the details that ensure the professionalism of depth news releases on behalf of its clients. at the end of every send2press project, i am confident it reflects well on our firm. seriously, what more can you ask?
— kerri s. milam




couldn't have been easier
everything was simple and easy. got a suggestion to adjust the time because of knowledge i didn't have, which was super appreciated. definitely will use this service again next time i need a press release.

we still provide a true concierge service 
for press release distribution


accredited staff, not order takersunlike many other press release services which require you to log-in and paste your content into a cms, and never give your project a professional check-up, send2press still works as a traditional wire service.


accredited editors, with a background in pr and journalism, work from your word processor file for review, final edits, and then we hand-post your news into our various systems for online syndication, social media placement, and direct-to-editors™ email targeting.


concierge serviceour “concierge style” press release distribution service provides an experienced staff editor to catch errors, correct for ap formatting and deliver a media-ready announcement – important for working journalists to take your news seriously.

we also do custom photoshop work to provide beautiful images with every news story – critical for maximum visibility in social media. we like to think we're more in the wedding cake business than the burger flipping business.
