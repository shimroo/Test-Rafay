hole 18- 18th hole bay hill
arguably one of the very best finishing holes in all of golf is the 18th at bay hill. the 18th green is not a good place to take risks if your match is on the line. it's got water on the right and bunkers on the left.

hole 3 - 16th hole augusta national
one of the most unforgiving greens in major championship golf, the undulations on this green can ruin your day if your approach shot does not land in the proper place.

hole 4- 5th hole oakland hills
the club engaged walter hagen, a man already set for greatness after winning the u.s. open, as its first professional. often referred to as "the monster" after ben hogan won here in 1951, hogan was overheard saying he was glad to have brought "this monster to its knees.â

hole 6- 16th hole firestone country club
this hole is the ultimate test of your long game. even a great tee shot only sets you up for a difficult layup with a fairway wood or long iron.

hole 10- 17th hole tpc at sawgrass
the hole seems easy enough, it's a relatively short 132 yard par-3, but this little gem has seen many a "players championship" dream come to a quick and decisive conclusion.

hole 11- 13th hole augusta national
now one of the more reachable par-5s in the majors, the hole sets up perfectly for a soft draw but offers severe penalties for hitting a fade or a hook.

hole 12- 3rd hole oakmont country club
the third hole here is probably one of the most easily recognizable holes in all golf because of the massive bunker guarding the left side of the fairway.
