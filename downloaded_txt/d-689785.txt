5th 
massachusetts battery(e) mission
it is the mission of the 5th massachusetts battery to be one 
of the most authentic civil war artillery reenacting units in the northeast 
region with something of interest to everyone.  in addition to closely 
adhering to original drill and field realism, we offer the following additional 
activities for those who are interested. 

competitive artillery target shooting with the american 
	artillery association.  we get the lead out! 
horse drawn artillery:  we are currently working with 
	horses in the field as appropriate for civil war artillery towards the goal 
	of a horse drawn piece within the next two years.  we offer an alternative 
	to horse owning people who may otherwise consider joining a cavalry 
	re-enacting unit. 
blacksmithing: we have use of one of a handful of civil 
	war traveling artificer forges in existence. amateur blacksmiths are 
	welcome. 
memorial graveside ceremonies honoring the original 
	members of the 5th mass battery. 
geneological research into the original members of the 
	battery. 
educational historical lectures and presentations in 
	schools and other public forums. 
civilian portrayals of 1860's life.  children and 
	non-military 1860's civilian impressions are always welcome. our children 
	are the next generation of the 5th mass battery. 




history and education
the 5th massachusetts battery is a chapter 501(c)3 non-profit organization 
dedicated to the accurate portrayal of an 1860's period volunteer field 
artillery battery.  we recreate the 5th massachusetts battery 
originally recruited from the boston and new bedford vicinities.

research ... and more research
one of the goals of our organizational charters is research into the history 
of the original 5th massachusetts battery.  for this purpose, we have 
ongoing research teams digging out any and all items pertaining to our battery 
and other civil war artillery batteries as they relate to the 5th mass battery 
and civil war field artillery in general.  we have three teams, each with 
its own objectives:

research the function and 
			equipment of a battery during the civil war. this 
			information is pertinent to how we conduct ourselves at 
			re-enactments or living histories.  
research the history of the 5th mass battery. what did the men actually 
			see as they marched down a road or through a town ?  this is data 
			over and above what is contained in the battery history 
research the 
battery personnel (table of all 321 original members) 
			--their personal history --before, during, and after the war. we 
			have collected many photos and
			letters 
			etc., but, there is much more still to be discovered. 








a personal account of the war by one of our original members 
		provides a first-hand perspective. 
		"reminiscences of the rebellionâ¦or what i saw as a private 
			soldier of the 5th massachusetts light battery from 1861-1863" by 
			william archibald waugh (born 1843).
our overall objective is to accumulate data and to make the results 
		available to other interested parties . also, through the research 
		process we hope to locate and catalog battery artifacts and to locate 
		original battery personnel descendents. 
this is a major task and would have been even harder if the original 
		battery members hadn't published their history in 1902. this document is 
		rich with insights into the battery activities throughout the war. this 
		book was just reprinted by butternut and blue in 1997 and is now 
		available to the general public. 
if you have any information please contact us.

		carte-de-visite (cdv) of henry d. scott, 1st lieutenant fifth mass 
		battery. wounded at gettysburg 7/2/63 through the mouth, and wounded a 
		second time a year later, he eventually became captain of the 16th mass 
		battery in 1864, the last field battery to be formed from massachusett
