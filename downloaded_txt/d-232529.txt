what we docamp winston and the camp winston foundation is a charity that offers summer programs, respite programs, and year-round support for youth with a variety of neurobiological abilities and their families/caregivers. our programs support youth living with autism, tourettes, adhd, learning disabilities, ocd, anxiety and odd. with an increasing number of children diagnosed with neurobiological disorders, demand for camp winston’s programs and services is rapidly growing. the importance of the camp winston experience for our youth and their families is now more crucial than ever. we believe in a future where neurodiversity is understood, valued, accepted and, most of all, celebrated.
























summer programs
14 day sessions are held from june to august. the programs are offered to neurodiverse youth aged 7-17. camp provides youth with an amazing opportunity to learn new skills in a beautiful muskoka setting. campers learn goal setting as well as social skills, recreational skills, domestic skills (employability) and self-care including mental health strategies.

respite programs
weekend sessions are held in september & may. the retreats offer opportunities for campers, siblings, grandparents and potential summer campers to experience weekends with unique programming. respite sessions help restore spirit and mind, maintain friendships, and recharge caregivers while reinforcing skills and guiding caregivers through behaviour management skills and coping strategies.
