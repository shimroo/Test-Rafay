i am an akc breeder of merit with the american kennel club, a pca judges education mentor, and
i have been a member in good standing with the papillon club of america since 1984, and the affenpinscher club of america since 2013.
i also belonged to the columbine papillon club based in colorado 
while it was still active. 

i have shown and titled numerous breeds of dogs in both breed and obedience since 1978, 
but have been exclusively breeding and showing papillons since 1982 and affens since 2013. 

i have served on several pca committes throughout the years; 
pca je mentor, pca color comittee, pap talk committee, serving as a regional reporter, proof reading advertisements,
and the pca reflections committee. 

i am the list moderator/owner of an on-line group; 
the original phalcne list(founded 1998), and i'm a member of about twenty more! 



the beautiful papillons that grace the pages of this website took over 50 years of pedigree 
research, skill, knowledge, heartache and dedication,and as a result crisanda was able to produce lovely, typey papillons crisanda was known for.
