earthfaire special offers!read morewe want to remind you of a few great offers we have here at earthfaire.
***
there is our pay-it-forward game -- it is an on-going project, to help spread the joy of giving, year-round. 
any order you place of $50 or more will be eligible for a yarn gift. my choice on the yarn and the colorway but know it will be brand-new and high quality.
it doesn't mean you have to knit for charity or use that yarn for someone else -- it just means that as you got something nice, so you also do something nice for someone else.
all i need from you with your minimum $50 order is for you to tell me you would like a skein -- i won't send it otherwise; i want to know that this appeals to you.

plus! we want to be sure you know about our fun wonder bags in lace weight yarn, fingering, dk, and worsted weight, your choice (+ beads to match). 
the yarn is high quality yarn; the beads as well, and they come together into glorious surprise package.
plus we almost always add a litte extra special something...
what a great way to treat yourself to a terrific surprise gift!
