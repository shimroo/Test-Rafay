just have fun and enjoy your life!!

we all complain about our lives from time to time. an unexpected expense comes up or we get laid off from our jobs. so many things can happen to us in even just one day. unfortunately, complaining is a waste of time. it is a grown up version of whining, and yes, we too have tantrums. the key to enjoying life is in how we react to the events and mishaps in our daily lives.
