for over 60 years, maranatha has served north alabama and beyond as a safe gathering place for retreats, summer camps, and group events. it has been, and will continue to be, a place where differences are set aside and our humanity, spirituality, and commonality are re-ignited.  nestled on the banks of the tennessee river on beautiful lake guntersville, the beauty of creation provides our campers a unique chance to unplug and experience maranatha… and find what it means to them.
