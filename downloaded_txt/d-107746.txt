welcome to lilligren and liljengren family history!


three brothers from the liljengren/bengtsson family emigrated from tönnersjö in halland, sweden, to the united states in the last part of the 19th century.  this site is dedicated to their memory and to their descendants.
this site is obviously under construction, but we hope to have more content uploaded soon.  in the meantime, please click on the link above named “an immigrant’s untold story.”

the boyhood home of the bengtsson/liljengren brothers.  it is still standing on the dahlabygget farm in the tönnersjö parish.  thanks to henrik carlsson for this photo.


about me
my name is dave lilligren, and i live on a small farm near sandstone, minnesota.  my grandfather, leslie “ted” lilligren, was the youngest son of nels peter liljengren (who was born nils petter bengtsson back in sweden).  over the past couple of years, i have been able to uncover many details about nils petter’s life, as well as his brothers lars and jöns.  in this process i have met many second and third cousins whom i never knew existed.  this site will hopefully serve as a platform to meet more relatives in the years to come.
