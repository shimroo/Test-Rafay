market rent valuation
landlord leasing provides a comprehensive rental analysis to effectively market your property for the highest achievable rent. our experienced team utilizes industry tools and will personally view your property to determine the optimal market value. 
			  we offer expert recommendations on repairs and enhancements to maximize your property's appeal and rental potential.






advertise & show property

			  exposure. we utilize social media platforms to enhance visibility 
			  and further reach. our licensed agents promptly schedule and personally show each listing with pre-screened applicants, providing a seamless rental experience.






credit & criminal screening
we want the best qualified tenant for your property. each potential renter is put through an extensive application process. this includes a transunion credit report, national criminal checks, a sex offender check, national and local eviction searches, 5 years employment and housing history, current income verification and landlord references.





lease preparation
our leases are tailored to suit the specific requirements of your property. we offer custom addendums, including non-smoking agreements, pet policies, and pool liability waivers. to ensure a smooth move-in process, possession of the property and keys are retained until the tenant's move-in balance is paid in full, and all utilities have been successfully transferred.






bookkeeping & accounting
all rental payments are processed through our office. owners receive and have complete control over the security deposit. our detailed monthly statements streamline year-end tax filing, documenting every dollar collected and property expense. owner payments are swiftly issued via electronic ach, ensuring prompt receipt before the 15th of each month.






cutting-edge technology
landlord leasing uses advanced software to provide owners and tenants 24/7 access to their accounts. our tech offers real-time updates, direct deposit payments, online rent payments, and maintenance requests. with dedicated portals and efficient communication, we ensure seamless and transparent management for your property.





maintenance services
we offer a 24 hour emergency service. landlord leasing only uses reputable licensed contractors with proven experience. repairs are taken care of quickly and inexpensively. we provide bids on any repair, alteration or improvement in excess of $500. our network of preferred vendors give us competitive rates and volume discounts.





lease enforcement
landlord leasing knows the laws that govern property management 
			  and will handle all violations and other issues quickly and 
			  professionally. we enforce rental payments and send late notices 
			  immediately. in the event of delinquency or eviction, we will 
			  serve the 3-day notice, retain legal counsel on your behalf, and 
			  handle the entire process with expertise and efficiency.
