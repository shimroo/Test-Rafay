hello and welcome to maumee, ohio.  whether you are visiting, moving to town, or a long-time resident, we hope that you enjoy our beautiful community and all it has to offer.stretching just over 6 miles along the maumee river, our city boasts beautiful park and recreation spaces, unique restaurants, comfortable coffee shops, and specialty stores. our community also encompasses a rich history with significant historical assets, namely fort miami, fallen timbers battlefield, the wolcott heritage center, and locks of the great erie canal.incorporated in 1843 as a small rural community, maumee is now known for the beautiful uptown streetscape, picturesque riverwalk, historical landmarks, and spring walleye river fishing.  our promise to our economic and environmental future is second to none and evidenced by the city’s commitment to substantially increased infrastructure investment, concentrated attention to our ecosystem through new aggressive reforestation efforts and alleviating sanitary discharges as well as cleaning our storm water of hydrocarbons before it enters the river.maumee is fortunate to have very actively engaged residents and businesses in our community which is once again desirable for those looking to experience spaces that balance pedestrians and vehicles alike.  we are an exceptional community because of integrated efforts by the maumee community schools, our capable municipal management, our city services as well as truly engaged public.all of these make the city of maumee a great place to live, work, and play!
