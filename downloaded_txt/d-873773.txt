greetings!   

				thank you 
								for your interest in my work and visiting here 
				at my lettersource 
site which i established in 1995.   

				many clients from over the years have this current website as my 
				main contact for placing orders. 

				i now plan to maintain it as more of an
				archive-and-linking site 
				to my new main website:

		gifts, the following five quick-links are 
		provided to my five most popular gifts for couples that i have done over
