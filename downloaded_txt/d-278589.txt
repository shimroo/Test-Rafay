high-quality power transmission products
zero-max’s power transmission products include variable speed drives, right angle gearboxes, keyless shaft bushings, and other products designed for high performance applications. adjustable speed drives are ideal for lower-speed applications and are easy to operate with a lever or screw control. crown® right angle gearboxes are available in both standard and ip65-rated/nickel-plated versions with counter-rotating, two-way or three-way options featuring a compact design with smooth, quiet operation.

overload safety devices provide dependable overload protection to prevent system damage and come in six different configurations. roh’lix® linear actuators convert rotary motion into linear motion and are designed for horizontal or vertical applications. phase adjusting hubs are an easy way to change the phase relationship between a drive component and shaft for fine-tuning timing adjustments.
power transmission products






flexible shaft couplings
zero-max flexible shaft couplings handle large misalignments while delivering zero backlash, maintenance-free operation. our high-quality shaft couplings are rohs compliant and available in several models and sizes to meet a wide range of mechanical needs.

aerospace-grade composite disc couplings provide high torsional stiffness and high dynamic load capacity for 24/7 operation. servoclass® couplings provide high torsional stiffness for precision positioning in servo motor applications.

control flex shaft couplings accommodate high parallel, angular and axial misalignment between shafts while providing constant transmission of torque in feedback device applications. schmidt couplings enable a variable parallel offset between two shafts and are adaptable to wide variations in radial displacement.
flexible shaft couplings
























overhung load adaptors for hydraulic systems
our overhung load adaptors set the standard for ohla design and include sae and non-sae mount options. rugged cast iron housings and 130,000 psi stress-proof steel shafts are standard and provide durability while protecting the motor and pump components from excess loading and hydraulic fluid contamination.

overhung load adaptors from zero-max are available with various shaft options in face or foot-mounting configurations. order standard overhung load adaptors from stock or work with an application engineer to design a custom solution to your unique material, mounting, load, and/or speed specifications.
