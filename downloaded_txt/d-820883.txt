	 wearechange confronts colin powell (cfr) on wmd's
	 



www.wearechangevancouver.orgcolin powell showed up in vancouver to give a talk on 'leadership'. i suppose it was inspiring because we are change was there leading the demo.  and vancouver's finest were there to lead the repression.  and the police felt inspired to arrest an independent journalist. about 50 activists were there to pass out literature documenting powell's long history of war crimes dating back to his participation in the coverup of the my lai massacre.  once those who had paid $200 a ticket had filed into the hall, most of those demonstrators faded away. that left about 15 members of wac to make themselves heard inside the hall from outside on the the conference centre promenade.  believe me, we made enough noise, with johnny and myself working the bullhorn and a little help from our friendly, neighbourhood bagpiper.  and given the history of colin powell, and his neo-con buddies in the bush administration we never ran out of things to say on the microphone. for the most part, the police were fairly well behaved for the first hour of the event.  they were highly visible but made no effort to prevent us from demonstrating.   after about an hour, a representative of the conference centre came out and spoke with us.  she acknowledged our right to be there – in the presence of police officers and security guards – and went back in side. about half an hour later the police gave an order to disperse, threatening arrest for criminal trespass if we failed to comply.  they went from being totally relaxed to insisting that we had to leave right then – and we had the distinct impression that they had been given an order to make sure we were no longer there when the crowd filed out of the hall. the police gave almost no time for us to disperse, immediately moving to clear us from the promenade.  people were complying but were walking backwards and asking the police some basic questions.  why weren't they doing their jobs and showing enough initiative to arrest a well documented war criminal?  why were they devoting their efforts to removing peaceful protestors whose democratic right to protest had been acknowledged when inside the hall was a man guilty of capital crimes.  certainly, since the theme of the day was 'leadership' they could show some and stand up for justice and not for totalitarian rule.  couldn't they? apparently not, as it quickly became apparent that the cops were keen on arresting someone now that they had been given permission from on high.  the sergeant seemed to have his attention mostly on me, and seeing that it was his intent to make an arrest, i quickened my pace to move away from him. now there was a guy there named mike.  i learned later that he had been invited there by wac but worked in the film industry – which might explain his very expensive looking camera and the professional manner with which he wielded it.  he certainly struck me as someone who hadn't been to many demonstrations: a newbie activist, but highly professional with a camera.  and if i could see all that then so, presumably, could the police.  all of which is relevant because mike was about to get arrested. when i quickened my pace to avoid being arrested, mike planted his feet to get a pan shot of the events.  this quickly made him the nearest person to the cop with the three stripes.  the officer quickly refocussed his attention on mike and announced that he had already given an order to leave and that mike was now in violation.  mike replied that he wasn't there as a demonstrator but as a journalist, assuming, as any reasonable person would, that he was thereby exempt from the order and permitted to document the events.  in a free society that is exactly what journalists are supposed to do in this sort of situation. the officer had options.  he could have placed his hand on his cuffs and given the order to disperse again – as i have seen cops do many times when they want people to leave but don't want to be forced to arrest anyone.  he could have explained to mike that  he was not recognizing his rights as a journalist and he had to leave anyways.  instead, he was gung ho to make an arrest. what surprised me most was the amateurish way he went about it.  this sergeant grabbed for mike's free hand to apply a joint lock, the type of technique known in martial arts as a compliance hold.  now his skill in applying the joint lock was not so great because it took him two tries to apply it successfully.  i had the distinct impression that he had learned this move at last weekend's karate seminar and was dying for a chance to try it out. now at no point was mike making a physical effort to resist arrest.  in fact, his completely calm demeanor made the officer's use of the joint lock look slightly ridiculous. at this point i saw that mike's camera was about to fall to the ground when the officer went to cuff his other hand.  i reached out and put my hand on the top handle of the camera.  when mike recognized me as someone who was with the demonstration, he released his grip on the camera.  i then took the camera, its film, and my own person away from the scene of the incident.  when i got to the street, it was time for me to go to work and i witnessed no more of the events at that demo. however, i heard later that the cop told mike that it was his intention to break his camera by letting it fall to the ground.  certainly, it is typical of the police to look for extra-judicial means of punishment.  by proactively allowing a journalist's camera to be destroyed, they effectively are issuing a fine of hundreds or thousands of dollars for which no paperwork needs to be filed. a further footnote: tickets to the event were sold with the promise that no question would go unanswered.  inside were four wac activists who had bought tickets on the assumption that they were serious, only to be disabused of their illusions two days before the event.  courageously, they stood and asked their questions anyways, only to be escorted out of the hall. no criminal charges were pursued, yet the first thing they saw when they emerged from the hall was our journalist, mike, handcuffed and under arrest. obviously, no one in authority was showing enough leadership to effect a coordinated policy on what justified punishment.  all of us working to disrupt the event went home unscathed.  yet a guy documenting the event in the public interest now has to deal with criminal charges of assault by trespass. another curious facet to this event was that powell's visit was sponsored by an array of local tv and radio media outlets.  it makes it a little difficult for the media to provide objective coverage of an event when they have endorsed it before the fact.  i would understand if this had been a triathlon or a music concert; it seems totally inappropriate for a political speaker to be so endorsed by the media.  unless of course, the media are tacitly acknowledging that they are not, in fact, independent but properly considered part of the ruling elite. i would like to add one further comment.  we were unprepared for mike's arrest and had to scramble around to find him a good lawyer.  fortunately, one of the best showed up to take his case pro bono.  nonetheless, it seems to me that those of us in we are change are unprepared for the legal consequences of our actions even though the nature of our methods regularly puts us at risk of being arrested.  there is an opportunity for us here to hold trainings covering the nature of civil disobedience, how to deal with the cops, jailtime, courtdates, what the law says and what will happen in reality, and how to defend yourself in court.  and by holding such trainings we can leave a legacy of hundreds or thousands of activists who are able to be effective agents in the struggle for 9/11 truth and for political progress even after the 9/11 issue is resolved. -- patrick borden

	 protocols of zion: an hbo movie
	 
    


not long after 9/11, new york filmmaker marc levin took a taxi driven by an egyptian, and in the course of their late-night ride, the cabbie made the startling charge that the jews had been warned not to go to work at the world trade center on that fateful day. provoked by this incredible statement, levin questioned him on his assertion, to which the driver responded, "it's all written in the book." the book in question was "the protocols of the elders of zion," and that late-night conversation sparked levin's probing new documentary protocols of zion.  worth watching.people that blame everything on the jews are fucking idiots. look in the mirror and blame yourselves.that being said,there is a lot more to 911 then the official government fairy tale.the 911 commission is now complaining of being stonewalled by the cia and nist still can't explain how building 7 collapsed. the anthrax shipped out to anti-patriot act senators daschle and leahy prove that 911 was indeed a part of an op or a fascist coup takeover of american foreign policy. let's have a proper investigation with subpoena power and a budget more that the lewinski blowjob investigation for chrissake.

this video is graphic. sometimes the truth is horrible.i'm sure there is much worse out there. this was just what i found tonight in less than an hour.the video contains disturbing scenes of american troops sadistically taunting iraqi children, randomly throwing grenades at passersby and the infamous puppy toss.juxtaposed against a hollow and hypocritical presidential address this is mandatory watching for every american citizen.george bush is a war criminal and unfortunately so are some of his troops.this is mandatory viewing

	 the secret government ( 20 & 90 minute versions)
	 
    


this is more of that crucial shit.20 years old but chillingly poignant. the full video "the secret government" is 90 minutes - this segment is edited by frank dorrel to 20 minutes.this is the 90 minute version. it aired on pbs in 1987 and is . moyers is a very respected tv journalist who also worked for lyndon b. johnson and has a very professional approach. he interviews many different people involved with the cia and other government agencies. his documentary gives quite an overview of what has actually happened in the last 50 years regarding the cia and the cold war (including iran, guatamala, cuba, viet nam and chile). he features such people as ralph mcgeehee and phil retinger (both former cia agents), rear admiral gene la rocque (ret. u.s.n.), theodore bissell (active in the cia at the time), sen. frank church and many others. moyers is so very credible

this 911 film focuses on prior knowledge and smoking gun facts. doesnt cover things found in virtually all of the other 911 films like government sponsored demolitions theories, reported explosions or other disaster scenes related evidence / theories. what this video is missing in production value it makes up for in information.i recommend that you take bullet points.next time you get called a "kook" battling trolls on line you will be able to serve there ass.

now let me say that i have the utmost respect for good honest police officers.it's a thankless job and they risk their lives daily.these are not the officers this post is about.at my job we sometimes use police and they're usually great people. seriously.there is another type of officer that gives good cops a bad name.one that "just follows orders" no matter how ridiculous.one that shoots an unarmed woman in the head then gets together with the rest of the swine and laugh about it.one that dresses up like an anarchist or protester and starts violence so his pig buddies can jump in and freely assault people.these are the pigs i am talking about.fuck these pigs.

	 my opening contribution to freedom
	 
    


my opening contribution towards freedomdear humans,        the most important election of our lifetime is going down in the united states right now   recounts ordered with vote fraud already documented in new hampshire,   greasy machines owned by diebold tabulating votes with hackable software and no paper trail are picking your leaders. not you !!   lack of action is as complicit as doing these crimes personally.   don't wait until your kids are micro chipped and the planets uninhabitable.   borrowing money off the chinese, to pay ruthless pakistani dictators billions of dollars, to promote "democracy in iraq makes about as much as sense as.........   (being the president  and not  agreeing to testfy under oath and only with dick cheney to the 9-11 commission  ?..  ridiculous....)   everyone one of us has look in the mirror and man the f**k up. it's now or never people. pretending it's there won't make it go away.   so what about this election  politics don't matter right ?.... why should you care ?   the more i research the candidates the more i am shocked to tell you the truth.   i've felt sympathetic to the the democrats especially since this disaster known as dumbya jacked the presidency  7 years ago.   so you would think that i'd be going  for obama or hillary.  unfortunately it's more complicated than that  anyone but a neo-con psycho ,bloodythirsty , war pig ,republican right ? well, the problem is, the more you look the more u realize  only there is only 1 peace candidate running that has a chance. this pro-peace candidate also has set records for grassroots fundraising but networks like fox smear him repeatedly,diminish and edit him out of there coverage.  remember fox is the same network that helped steal florida from gore and aired repeatedly the garbage scum attack piece aka swifboat veterans against kerry. unbelievably the man i speak about is a republican. his voting record  shows he has  fought for the constitution and freedom  for 10 terms. his name is dr.ron paul and he is the only candidate that realizes the nature of the impending foreign policy and economic disasters  that are enroute. if ever there was a time  that everybody needed to pay attention that time would be now. look into this yourself, and make up your own mind, but digg !!!! 10 minutes of tv news doesn't count.do extensive research outside of the 5 mega propaganda companies that own 90% of the airwaves include the 5 major networks and all the newspapers.when you go online look for what sounds like heartfelt truth and not some spun copy by a corporate lackey.this is my opening contribution to freedomfor my canadian and international friends, you need to realize that this next election is more important than you're own.   if you don't already feel like a slave , you will soon and so will your entire family ,it's only a matter of time.when the 9-11 remix gets dropped don't rush to judgement either because  there will be some wicked treachery behind it.if you agree with what i'm saying then help blog this,chat rooms/forums and get it out to your peoples.everyone needs to just make a little effort to bring upon massive change.turn off the television on the weekends and do something.dj ball dr ron paul vs evil make sure you read the comments on my video.synopsisfighting against ridiculous odds and a stacked deck dr. paul destroys pathetic media whores and stands out as the republicans best candidate.mccain goes crazy with a giggling cross- dressing guliiani at his side.watch president bush clearly stumble thru blatant lies and an incredible interview with a vice president who should clearly be impeached.unanswered questions from stonewalled 9-11 committee and victims family membersclips taken from the republican "debates", american enterprise institute, white house press briefings ,cnn and cspan.a chilling warning from scott ritter,the former un weapons inspector, closes this out.response is so good that one of the biggest independant media sites has it's at the top of their ron paul revolution columnthe original (guyfromboston w/profanity) edit is now up on the main page @http://www.truthnews.us and www.prisonplanet.com ron paul vs media whores and tranvestite warmongershttp://www.truthnews.us1st edit /*** profanity at very end***this gave me chills first time i watched it,amazing !ron paul unstoppable !!

those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.

john f. kennedy, in a speech at the white house, 1962


â€œvoice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. that is easy. all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.â€�
