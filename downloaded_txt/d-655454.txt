hi administrator,

i've reported a broken link on your site spkorb.org/guide.html that links
to http://info.isoc.org/guest/zakon/internet/history/hit.html and haven't
heard back, so i just wanted to verify whether you're the right person to
contact? if not, could you direct me to the person maintaining the website?
if you would be interested in updating your website, i have a similar
resource that you are more than welcome to use to update. let me know!

link replacement option:
http://www.onlineuniversity.net/history/history-of-the-internet/

best,
jennifer jenkins
