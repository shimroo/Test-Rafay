not-for-profit facilities encourage residents to be as active and independent as their abilities permit.
they recognize that long-term care, housing, and community services should be tailored to individual needs.
not-for-profit homes and services are governed by community-based board of trustees who are all volunteers. these men and women donate their time and talent to ensure that a not-for-profit organizationâ€™s approach to caring for older people responds to local needs. not-for-profit facilities exist for only one reason: to provide high quality services for their residents. they turn any surplus income back into improving facilities or expanding services












the oklahoma association of homes and services for the aging (okahsa)
organized in 1993, represents nearly 100 not-for-profit, private, fraternal, religious, and government-sponsored nursing facilities, assisted living, retirement communities, housing, and adult day service centers.
