friends for a nonviolent world
nonviolence in action since 1981

our mission

fnvw works to promote and create peace and justice in our community by using the principles and practices of nonviolence to transform conflict and to address the root causes of violence.


our programs



alternatives to violence project (avp) provides experiential conflict resolution workshops for youth and adults in schools, prisons, jails and communities. avp empowers people to lead nonviolent lives through affirmation, respect for all, building and enhancing of community, cooperation, and trust.  




people camp is a week-long intergenerational experience of cooperation, community living, peacemaking, and the exploration of ideas and issues. this is a summer camp experience for the whole family and for anyone who enjoys warm, supportive community, challenging workshops and lots of recreation in a camp setting. 

everyday nonviolence is our podcast that highlights people using nonviolence to transform themselves and the world around them. their stories deepen our understanding of the impact of violence and the many ways nonviolence can be used for healing and social change.
advocacy and outreach initiatives include hosting community dialogues, actions and workshops on topics such as public safety, active nonviolence, and protecting and expanding our democracy. we also build power for social change through relational organizing and by working in coalition with other groups.
