		donald duck, miner and ironmaster. 
		the hagley museum, library, and archives in wilmington, delaware, 
		is a gem for tourists and historians alike. 
		they are located at the site of the well-preserved early dupont 
		powder mills along scenic brandywine creek.
		 the museum is a treasure trove 
		for those interested in industrial heritage. 
		the collection of patent models is of particular interest. 
		the mansion and gardens at the home of dupont founder, e. i. 
		dupont, are also open to visitors.

		one of its many collections is the photographs and audiovisual materials 
		of the american iron and steel institute (aisi). while searching online 
		for photos of iron mines and furnaces, the writer came across a video of 
		an aisi promotional film, steel in america, by walt disney productions 
		in 1965.  in an unusual role, 
		donald duck portrays an ironmaster and miner who guides the viewer 
		through the history of ironmaking in america from the charcoal furnaces 
		of the colonial period to the taconite mining and steelmaking technology 
		of the 1960s.  it is well 
		done, entertaining, and worth a viewing. click 
		here to view.
