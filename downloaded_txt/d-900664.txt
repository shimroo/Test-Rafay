summer camp memories





the week of a camper is well-rounded and full of a wide variety of fun, interesting, educational, and useful activities...all taught with an emphasis on fun, kindness, inclusion and teamwork. i am 47 now, and my son is going for the first time, this week. the place is even more beautiful now...and the staff and volunteers are so friendly, warm and helpful. being out at cnd again was so nostalgic...the magic of that place is still in the air. it felt like being home again. if you are looking for a good summer camp, look no further...cnd is your answer!






cnd gave my childhood warm, fond memories that will always hold a special place in my heart. i enjoyed everything we did and wouldnt trade thoes days for anything.






camp notre dame is the most welcoming, accepting, and loving place i've ever been. cnd is a home away from home and a place where i can be free and focus on simply having fun! i can attest that everyone on staff gives 110% to make sure the campers experience a vacation to remember.
