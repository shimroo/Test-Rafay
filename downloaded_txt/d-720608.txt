do you have an adventurous dog? 





do you have an adventurous dog? some dogs are just full of energy, very playful and inquisitive. they can either be fun or a serious hassle. sometimes people think this type of dog needs more exercise, maybe more puzzles and toys. but that doesn't make it better. your entire home has become a playground of puzzles and toys, except those toys are your things, your kids, you, every guest, and the other pets in the home. non-stop. you don't want to crush these dogs. you already know that wouldn't be right. but many trainers are going to walk through the door trying to sell you their electric collar program. please, don't do that.working dogs are just as playful, just as inquisitive, just as energetic, and just as adventurous. maybe even more so. the good trainers work with all of this rather than trying to suppress it all. what seems like a hassle today is actually a very valuable asset if properly worked with. plan accordingly.

dog training and brevity





most dog trainers confuse dogs. many repetitions cause some dogs to figure out a pattern but are not well trained: when the context changes, expected skills don't materialize.training by mistake isn't the same thing as intelligible communication.brevity is the soul of wit. plan accordingly.

dogs and fear





should dogs ever be put in situations that might or do scare them?yes.should dogs purposely be terrorized?no.the real world: there is no world or era that ever existed in which something wasn’t going to scare a dog. that is true for all higher animal species. we cannot, and should not, put dogs in a bubble to prevent all stress and fear: even putting them in a bubble would scare and stress them. if you are wanting to be a bubble-maker, then don’t get a dog. some things are innately scary to a puppy. for example, going down or up stairs for the first time. that challenge is going to be scary. puppies instinctively fear falling. human babies do, as well. experiments have been done with both. put a glass plate over a “cliff” and let the puppy walk forward or baby crawl forward to the perceived “edge”. they will both stop before “falling”. they will experience a feeling of fear and appropriate learning and actions will take place. this is partly why it is hard to load a dog, or even a horse, in or out of a vehicle.there are other stimuli in the environment that are prone to cause fear in animals. for rats, it can be the presence of cat hairs. for birds, something big and dark, shaped like a predatory bird,  “flying” overhead. for dogs, a bigger dog hovering over them is scary. you will see puppies get scared, for example, when first being socialized with other strange dogs. even you sometimes will scare your own puppy such as standing over them, picking them up, trimming nails, baths, setting them down, familiarizing them with your home and yard, and doing normal household chores. since you know some things can be scary, you need to know which scary experiences you want your dog to deal with, and others that would be a setback, and have a plan for both.collars are often scary the first time they are put on. same with leashes. same with the presentation of a new treat, food bowl, water bowl, brush, comb, scissors, new toy, crate, location, drive in a vehicle, meeting with your friends and family, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, air conditioners, and on and on. so, let’s stop with the no fear thing. it isn’t real.when i train dogs and owners, i don’t prevent puppies from experiencing normal things that might appear scary at first. i help them familiarize and adapt to those animals, people, locations, objects and situations. that is your secondary job regarding fear. your primary job is preventing fearful experiences that won’t improve your dog’s welfare. what about training? well, puppies are going to be afraid of pottying the first time in your yard. i am not going to avoid helping a dog learn about their new territory, since i don’t want them to just potty in the home for the rest of their lives. puppies are going to be afraid of all the tools and things we do in training. just because you don’t think it should be scary, that doesn’t mean the puppy perceives it that way. even with treats, they are typically suspicious of a new food until they have seen it isn’t going to grab them, is sniffed and tasted successfully. that is a natural defense from being poisoned. you would do the same if you lived off the land. have you ever researched how to tell if it is safe to eat something in the wild in case you were lost? you don’t just eat a tasty looking berry or mushroom, or touch some plant or animal, like you would from the grocery or pet store.even older dogs are going to get scared of objects, animals and people. look folks, they are living beings. they are going to protect themselves naturally regardless of your good intentions. your job is to supervise these encounters to promote your dog’s welfare.what about “dominance”? what is it and how is it established? rank is taken by force in the animal world, either psychologically or by physical action. that’s why dogs are always alert to their relationship status and rank relative to other dogs and people.“top dog”, human or canine, is threatening by mood, physical size, scent and other natural factors. all dogs notice the mood of the other person or animal. size of others is also factored into how they are going to perceive that other animal or person. loud and low vocalizations by people, as well as other animals, convey a larger size. raise your voice? you are adding threat to the situation. lower your voice? same thing. posture and proximity matter: get closer and stand taller? same thing, it is intimidating. hate to tell you, while dogs aren’t wolves, and it is rare that a pet dog gets in a purely offensive violent fight with a human over status or rank as would a wild or tamed wolf, your dog still perceives your status and rank and responds accordingly. however, it isn’t so rare for dogs to perceive status and rank and fight with another dog in the home. those are often those fights where people say they didn’t see it coming and they can’t figure out what the dogs were fighting over.some of what you perceive as affection are submissive gestures in response to your worrying presence, meant to convey that all is good, i’ll accept you, please accept me, and i don’t want a fight. what about training methods? there is this huge, stupid debate over r+ vs balanced training. it’s like two cults arguing about the best way to get to paradise. yes, i find it best to use positive reinforcement (r+) to teach skills and then clean up the mistakes with either positive or negative punishment. let’s talk real world: you can only go so far with positive reinforcement before you run up against naturally occurring, and sometimes biologically more important, positive reinforcements in the environment and situation that will successfully compete against all your dogs’ r+ trained actions. you then have the choice whether to never let your dog get near those things, animals, people or situations, or you must finish the job to cause them to avoid those encounters… walk away, keep them on leash, never leave the home, only be free in a fenced yard, etc. basically make them a prisoner in a gilded cage.example: i have heard r+ trainers claim they can teach dogs to leave rattlesnake alone purely with r+ training. smell/ see rattlesnake => run to handler => get a treat.that isn’t going to work. even dogs that have been trained with e-collars to leave rattlesnakes, kiwi, ungulates, crocodiles, alligators, rodents, and birds sometimes are still too tempted and will go after those animals. it is well established that skill learning from bad experiences is harder to forget than those learned by good experiences. the brain and body are hardwired to try and not repeat mistakes that were unpleasant. that is why i never sweat it if a student accidentally drops a treat during a lesson and the dog gets it. food training is very forgiving. but i am very cautious before i instruct students on ideas about how to correct unwanted actions. for some novices, once you give them a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. i want the dog to know what to do before we clean up the part about what not to do. none of this is about instilling fear in the dog as a way of terrorizing them. but by the nature of corrections, the brain is going to process every known mistake and consequence as something emotionally unpleasant. what about r+ only? even if someone claims to be a purely r+ trainer, every time they withhold a reward, that is negative punishment and distressing to the dog. otherwise it wouldn’t work. even when free shaping, every mistake is not rewarded and is a negative punishment. so, let’s not say that “purely positive” trainers don’t use punishment. they do. even studies on the physiological effects of negative punishment show increases in stress and hormone markers roughly equivalent as those found when using typical dog training corrections. so, we are more dealing with a marketing strategy than a discussion of animal welfare. competitors are trolling other dog trainers, purposely provoking fights, to gain attention to make money. how can you know? many of the so-called “all positive” trainers will not debate, or demonstrate their skills, alongside the people who train dogs to do real things in the real world. petulant trolling isn’t making it better for the dog world. what about the abusers? there are dog owners, trainers and advocates that do want to make dogs afraid, crushing them on purpose. they glory in it like caligula in ancient rome. normal dog training isn’t abuse. however, it would be easy for some so-called “balanced trainers” which are abusers hiding in the midst of others that are not abusers. fear: is fear a normal response in real life? yes. does it need to be managed when training dogs? yes. can it be avoided completely? no. should it be avoided completely? no. isolation experiments on animals always result in the emotional destruction of the test subjects. you should not train dogs like you are playing with some hot wheels in your living room, and then put them away in a cabinet when you want to do something else. it is just as abusive to purposely terrorize a dog as it is to do some kind of isolation experiment on your dog. there is a balance. find that balance.plan accordingly.

dogs and pack walks





remember a few years ago there were all these dog trainers filming themselves doing “pack walks” with groups of dogs? the trainer was in the lead, and a group of off leash dogs were following them, as if the trainer was some kind of pied piper or “alpha” wolf pack leader on a hunt... (more)

aggressive dogs and money





i regularly see people get on social media platforms, join specific dog groups, and then ask them for advice regarding their aggressive dog. first mistake.they also tend to say, i can’t afford a dog trainer, so can you give me any advice on this or that.second mistake.you are not going to get good advice about safely dealing with dog aggression this way, for free, from novices, trolls, and well-meaning but unqualified people in social media dog groups. plan accordingly.

dogs and gambling with your life





if you have been around dogs long enough, you will see these “dominance” focused trainers, owners, and rescue volunteers end up seriously injured. these stories sometimes make the news. all it takes is one dog that decides it is time to do a rank attack, being from a lower status and deciding that it doesn’t want to be bullied. especially dogs that have, or are developing, the canine version of ptsd. then it is clobbering time...

dogs, muzzles and nooses





i think if your plan to fix your fearful / reactive/ aggressive dog is to muzzle your dog, put on a leash, and hang your dog into helplessness... well... you can figure out the rest.plan accordingly.

dogs and gas





have you ever noticed whenever you are flatulent (the polite word), that it is a result of some type of carbohydrate you have eaten? (i.e. beans) here’s the way i see it…  if your dog is gassy, then something isn’t digesting properly, and it is most likely one of the carbohydrates in the food. my belief is that dog food manufacturers have captured the organizations that test dog foods and have manipulated the labeling requirements of the government in ways to disguise poor quality ingredients.  for example… let’s take a human example. milk. what is the difference between skim, 2% and whole? you can’t really tell by the label. however, most milk is highly processed and manipulated in a factory, and the milk you drink isn’t really “milk” in many ways. they are extracting and manipulating the chemistry of the original milk to turn it into a product that isn’t really milk.  thus, dog food. read the label. it may list these or those ingredients. but if your dog is gassy, then i think one of those ingredients isn’t settling with your dog. it is probably one of the carbohydrates, or some manufactured or artificial carbohydrate analog, that isn’t fermenting properly in your dog’s gut. you are paying for an ingredient that might technically contribute x amount of this or that nutrient, but the food isn’t highly digestible and a portion of that is either ending up on your beautiful yard or in the form of that wonderful aroma, instead of building new and good tissue in your dog’s body.  maybe i’m wrong. i’m not a dog nutritionist. i’d love to hear your opinion or any other evidence. plan accordingly.

dogs and thumping





i find it disturbing that i see so many posts by social media dog trainers advocating giving your dog some kind of thumping if your dog is doing something that you don't like. i mean, seriously, that is your first suggestion for everything? another one i hate... the trainers that suggest using a series of bared teeth displays, growls, hisses, grunts, glares and such to correct your dog to have good manners in the home. or the one that thinks they need to do everything before the dog gets to do it... eat, sleep, go out a door, sit down, move about, play, give affection, etc. do you think that any top trainer in the world uses that "method"? plan accordingly.

dominance and being your dog’s leader





there is ongoing confusion regarding the idea of being a dog’s “leader”, being the “alpha”, and controlling a dog’s dominance. thus… the “dog whisperer” phenomenon, or all those new social media trainers who are telling you that the beginning of fixing your dog’s dominance problems is to sign up for their e-collar program. let me give you a simplified way of diagnosing if you are having a dominance problem with your dog...

high drive service breed dog ownership vs pet ownership





there is a fundamental difference between training pet service dog breeds (malinois, german shepherd, giant schnauzer, airedale, dutch shepherd, etc.) versus those which have been selectively bred for competition or professional work. the top dogs look spectacular when they do the higher-level work. however, if you have a pet version of these dogs, don’t despair. you probably would find these high drive dogs too much to handle and not so much fun. you can get great performance out of pet bred dogs, i know because i do that kind of work every day...

should we get a dog?





before you bring a dog into the home, it would be wise to observe or test to see if the dog will be welcomed by everyone in the family. if someone strongly objects, put it on hold until that is sorted out. there are several clues you can look for to predict whether things are going to work out or not. let’s assume we are questioning whether one person in the family is going to reject the new dog. go meet some dogs together observe the following:does that person1. want to keep the dogs out of their personal space?2. avoid touching the dogs?3. does the person perceive dogs as being “dirty” and “smelly”?4. are they suspicious or afraid of dogs?5. do they tolerate the behavior and presence of the dogs?6. do the dogs elicit affection and care taking behaviors from that person?7. do they act in a threatening manner?8. do they seek to play with the dogs?9. are they overly concerned about the mannerliness of all dogs in their presence?10. do the dogs stress them out?11. do they have past bad experiences with dogs that make them not want the dogs near them?12. are they actively asking “buying signal” questions from the people who own or are fostering those dogs?13. are they overly concerned about limiting and suppressing the freedom of movement and friendly gestures of the dogs, especially if the dogs are puppies which are jumping up, pulling on their shoelaces and biting at their hands?14. are all the comments of a negative variety? 15. when you get home, do they show any signs of being allergic to those dogs?16. where do they expect the dogs to live in the home? any rooms excluded? are they to be banished to the back yard?17. do the dogs accept and like that person?try this out. it is better to not get a dog at all than to get a dog and then make that dog’s life miserable.plan accordingly.

urgent: nj proposes law to regulate dog training methods





on monday, february 10, 2025, the new jersey senate economic growth committee will hold a hearing on a bill to establish the “dog training licensing board” to license and regulate dog trainers.  in addition, the board will establish a training philosophy that must be used for every trainer in the state.this type of legislation is dangerous. this will not turn out well. this has already been tried in europe and is causing considerable damage. politicians have no idea how to train dogs, and the result will be the enforcement of the worst type of methods.share this widely and oppose this legislation.

fixing problem behaviors: jumping upon greeting





why do dogs tend to jump up on people during greetings? i get why people don't like it. but do you get why dogs do it? before you try to fix a problem, it is best to understand why it happens. otherwise your fix either won't work or you'll create a new problem.i'll let you ponder on this one (i don't reward the dog trainers reading this for not putting in any effort and instead doing some research on their own). hint: it isn't all learned.there are plenty of suggested solutions, especially on the internet. many will backfire. plan accordingly.

disturbing dog news





i rarely partake in reading or publishing real, current news stories about dog abuse. while i will sometimes need to use a verbal illustration of a bad event or situation, i stay away from the gory stuff.i see no benefit in wallowing in all the disgusting, horrible and illegal things that dogs experience. sometimes you can know too much, and it becomes too much.besides, from a practical animal welfare standpoint, if the news is too gory, then people will turn away,  tune out, stop volunteering, and stop donating. animal rescue groups and volunteers, take heed.there is a way to learn about what not do with a dog without traumatizing yourself or others. plan accordingly.
