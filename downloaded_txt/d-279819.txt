hurricane ian, but so enjoyed the warmth and sunshine of winters in florida that we decided to rebuild. we investigated a number of companies and finally went with leecorp, based on their reputation and our initial experience with our salesman, charlie bails. we are not disappointed and, in fact, the results are even better than we had hoped for. first, leecorp was masterful in figuring out a home model that would fit on our lot, given that the allowable footprint had shrunk because of modern day enforcement of local zoning regulations. communication between us and leecorp was especially impressive given the fact that we spent all of the time during the construction process in wisconsin. not only did the company go to great pains to make sure that our new house met all the requirements regarding resistance to weather, including hurricanes, but there were design suggestions, for example, enlarging part of the porch and putting a scissors truss over it, that really added to the aesthetics of the house. charlie bails has so much experience in the manufactured home industry, which proved invaluable. he made helpful suggestions with respect to the floorplan, and his eye for design elements is very sophisticated. the quality of the home is outstanding, and we wouldn’t change any of our choices. leecorp has a terrific reputation for honesty and quality, which is very well deserved.john n.   we appreciate the many phone calls, and emails with updates!thank you so much for all of your help to make our house ready for the next stage of our lives. we appreciate the

very impressed with the professional attention they gave to detail, and that they took the time to do it right. i’m talking about paul and his son-in-law daniel. it was a pleasure to watch them work,

the superior quality that goes into each and every home. at the time we did not know how wonderful working with jacobsen and leecorp would be. the way they care about their customers is evident from the moment you walk through their door. they believe in not only building great homes but also great relationships. the kindness they show continues even after you sign the contract. chris lee from leecorp has been an absolute delight to work with. he is knowledgeable and professional and always went above and beyond to accommodate us. chris gained our trust and never once let us down. our home looks incredible thanks to the jacobsen employees and the many contractors leecorp employs to maintain that superior standard. we would like to thank every single person who worked on our homes with such care, from the factory in tampa, to the jacobsen team who went out of their way to make us happy as we toured our home while it was being built. the finishing touches being completed here in estero were so outstanding that we have written several individual thank you cards commending their skilled workmanship. our experience with jacobsen homes and leecorp has been a blessing. building a home could have been a stressful experience, but instead it was a joy. thank you for our beautiful home and thank you even more for treating it as if it were your very own.”mike & barbie stotts   you
