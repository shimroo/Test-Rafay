tomorrow’s music todaymusic at the anthology (mata) was founded in 1996 by philip glass, eleonor sandresky, and lisa bielawa and has become the world’s most sought-after performance opportunity for adventurous emerging music artists experimenting with composition, multimedia, and collaborative performance art. mata presents, supports, and commissions new music by early-career composers at an internationally recognized concert festival each spring in nyc. mata presents funds projects shown throughout ny and hosts mata jr., an evening of music by pre-college composers, mentored by emerging composers, and performed by top performers in new music.
