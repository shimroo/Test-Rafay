"hsin hsin ming by sengtsan, third zen patriarchseptember 1,  2020 dear yoga family,   the breath is our lifeline. not only does it maintain the physical body, it is the most direct connection to our innate spiritual wisdom. slow, even, abdominal breathing — through the nose — calms and quiets the mind so the voice of our heart is perceptible. heart, or spirit, speaks only the language of love; her guidance requires no translation.  once the mind, with its misguided, fear-based anxieties, is dismissed, attention is free to rest in truth. no distraction.   difficulty falling or staying asleep is usually accompanied by a racing mind cluttered with unwanted activity. this same slow breathing offers relief by reining in the pace of thoughts. now mind succumbs to rest.   breath is also a key focus in meditation practices from traditions throughout the world. accompanied by a mantra, counting, or sometimes both, focus on our breath guides attention to the stillness between thoughts, where each breath ends and a new breath begins. with time, our meditation practice extends this stillness beyond a few moments. sustained by regular practice, the quiet mind becomes ours even when we are not sitting intentionally in the stillness.   everyone, dedicated meditator or not, can access this freedom from anxiety and cascading, confusing thoughts by practicing slow, abdominal breathing anytime, anywhere. whatever our capacity for daily meditation, let us remember our breath is a  certain path to being calm and centered in every moment. accessing our innate wisdom in this way, we collectively shift the planetary consciousness. unconditional love prevails.   may universal consciousness embrace each of us now.  janaki  "by expelling and restraining prana*, the mind is pacified."   –yoga sutras i.34 *prana is the vital life force, closely connected to the breath.  the yogis use the breath to control prana.june 12, 2020director's letter namaste yoga enthusiasts, recognizing the essence of humanity—that the heart of each and every  one of us is the same—is the potent significance of the greeting: namaste. in sanskrit:  namaha—to bow by way of saluting or honoring,       together with te—contraction for the word “you,” when spoken, traditionally with palms together, we are saying “i honor you.” since namaha is the same verb used in thousands of mantras saluting or surrendering to aspects of the divine, our higher consciousness or nature, a more comprehensive  understanding of the greeting is: “the divine within me recognizes/honors the divine within you.” thus, each time we greet another person, we remind ourselves of the mutual inter-connectedness of unity consciousness.we are affirming  that we are both one; this one is unconditional love, peace, joy and contentment.  my higher consciousness honors your higher consciousness. on the face of it, this may seem borderline ridiculous; it is all the same awareness, ultimately. consciousness greeting consciousness. yet we still inhabit different physical bodies and tend to think of ourselves, and therefore treat each other, as if we are individual and separate, even fearing one another. consciousness fearing consciousness.  yogas chitta vrtti nirodhaha. (yoga is the stilling of the modifications of consciousness.)   —patanjali’s yoga sutras, chapter 1, verse 2 when the mind, or consciousness is still, (i.e., there are no thoughts arising) there is no fear. consciousness itself is fearless. it is the thoughts, or modifications of the mind, that give rise to fear. in stillness, through meditation or other discipline training the mind to be still, is the fertile field giving rise to unity consciousness.  “namaste” offered with folded palms, is a simple reminder, that we are all connected; that each of us share a common consciousness, a common humanity. let us recognize and honor this truth, even silently within ourselves, as we hear, read about, or greet others. this practice alone serves to strengthen our humanity, our connection to unity consciousness.  the science of yoga is the science of unifying individual consciousness with universal consciousness.  namaste everyone.  with deep love and respect, —janaki  see god in each other. —swami muktananda god dwells with in you as you. —swami muktanandadear yoga family,                                                                             may 15with the inner peace we access though meditation, yoga, other spiritual  practices, or simply our natural state, peace abides within us every moment, under any circumstances.    how do we further anchor ourselves in our innate, ever present, center of calm?  slow, even, abdominal breathing is an old standby for on-the-spot stress management. resorting to it regularly throughout the day is a good strategy.   will this sustain us as we face a daily pervasive onslaught, a constant withering of a familiar, known, order of things? change is the new normal;  adaptation is required. let us try gradually, gently, expanding our comfort zone.  when our comfort zone is too small, we are ill-at-ease, or dis-eased, under many circumstances.  today, almost everything is in a continuous state of flux. it may seem daunting to expand our comfort zone to keep pace with the current  changes enveloping us. still, directing our attention to it a little at a time, as with grief, we gently, slowly, allow ourselves to accept small adjustments  in manageable bits at a time.  simply acknowledging that there is so much change, and it is challenging, is a huge step. this recognition leads to releasing expectations, bearing the fruit of an expanded comfort zone.   resisting, denying, worrying, attempting to control are painful and draining approaches to change. letting go, flowing, and accepting bestow peace of mind;  from this place of stillness, arise new ideas, new potential and the possibility of unexpected joys  and collaborations in community, family and the world. clinging to the past is fruitless. the present is all we really have, ever.  with our attention firmly established in inner peace at this moment, the blueprint for the future is set.  may radiant health, joy, and peace remain yours, janaki  if we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. as a person changes their own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards them.    —m. gandhi   at the moment of inner enlightenmentthere is a going beyond appearance and emptiness.  the changes that appear to occur in the empty world we call real only because of our ignorance.  do not search for the truth; only cease to cherish opinions.   —sengstan, third zen patriarch, ~600ad  present moment awareness                                            may 5welcome to the present moment.   it is only here, now,  that we experience the fullness of our being. away from what we have heard or read moments ago, without fear of what will or will not come next, just staying present with ourselves and whatever is in front of us. what is directly in front of us? a child, a parent, an unsolvable obstacle, grief, things unknown or uncontrollable?  when we are simply present in calmness and contentment with the present moment—without expectation, judgement, the need to control, change or solve—from that stillness comes guidance.  inspiration arises not from the mind, but from the absence of thought. resolution alights when worry and doubt subside. letting go is arriving.  this moment of stillness can expand into always. by recognizing and guarding against a detour clinging  to our attachments or escaping our aversions, we keep our attention in the present.     twenty minutes or more, once or twice a day, sitting in silent meditation, we practice  present moment awareness. daily meditation habituates our mind to slow down and be still, inviting “letting go” into our lives.  here arrives contentment, boundless joy and resolute stamina and confidence.  this is the  antidote for our time. in the stillness with love,  janaki
