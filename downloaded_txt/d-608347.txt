what our members have to say
i've had my personal banking accounts with kern federal credit union, now strata credit union, since back in the 1970s.  also, i maintain accounts with strata credit union as treasurer for a local organization.  i feel very confident and secure dealing with their staff who have always gone above and beyond their duties while taking care of all my banking needs.mary lou b., valued membertell us your story!









what our members have to say
when i walk in everyone says hi (even if they have clients) and when i leave everyone says bye (even if they have clients) writing this i can see how someone could portray this as negative. but it feels good getting greeted when i walk in and it feels good being told goodbye by the whole bank. strata just makes me feel special. yes it's a bank, but the tellers make me feel like i have a million dollars in the bank instead of 20.alex c., valued membertell us your story!









what members have to say
i have had accounts at the big three, as well as a couple credit unions in town (still do). but in a short period of time i have been very impressed with strata, not only with what they offer, but with how friendly the staff is, and personal they make you feel. specifically amber and valerie. thank you for making my family feel at ease.gabriel t., valued membertell us your story!









what members have to say
strata has become a key supporter of wasco high's activities and athletics. strata's partnership and support have allowed us to upgrade athletic equipment and participate in activities which would have otherwise been impossible. strata's commitment to our community is evident in their desire to support all our students. from football to band, soccer to cheer, wrestling to culinary arts, strata consistently looks for new ways to support the students of wasco high. we are excited that strata is joining the business community in wasco and look forward to working with them for years to come.joshua huddleston, athletic director, wasco high school districttell us your story!









what members have to say
