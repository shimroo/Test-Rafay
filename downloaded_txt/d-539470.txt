			consensus is that all the pieces is boingo.  i have to admit,
			i gave up after about 15 seconds thinking it was a depeche mode rip off band, but if you listen longer, you
			can definitely tell it's boingo.  breese says "all to pieces is indeed boingo, from the 1983 sessions for good for your soul, the band was experimenting with synthesizers
			and while the song sounds very different it is 100% boingo."

            got my 
            edward scissorhands dvd.  the commentary was pretty interesting.  it has all of the
            music during the movie, and then danny speaks when there's no music.  it looks like
            there's also a 
            pee-wee's big adventure dvd with a similar commentary.  i guess i have to order
            that one too :-)
