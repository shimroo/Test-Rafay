what are 
    apple polyphenols?
 






apple polyphenols 
    (poly-fee-nols) are phytochemicals concentrated in the skin of unripe 
    apples. 
    these chemical compounds are being studied extensively in labs around the 
    world for their health effects in major diseases, including 
    prevention and treatment of:






colon cancer

heart disease

diabetes

alzheimer's




asthma
allergies
prostate health
fat loss




cholesterol
hair growth
skin cancer
lung cancer






recently,
     apple polyphenol extracts  have been 
    announced to dramatically decrease 
    organ fat 
    and increase muscle strength in laboratory 
    animals. this exciting but preliminary report from researchers in japan has 
    fueled a strong interest in these natural botanical compounds.

polyphenols
extracted from apples are also showing 
    promise in treating 
    
    male pattern baldness, improving skin disorders, and preventing 
    
    allergic reactions. apple polyphenol 
    extracts have been shown to be 2 to 6 times more powerful 
    then vitamin c as antioxidants.

apple polyphenols are naturally 
            occurring plant compounds that act as potent
            antioxidants. they protect cells against 
            free radicals, reactive atoms that contribute to 
            tissue damage in the body. for example, when low-density lipoprotein 
            (ldl, or "bad") 
            cholesterol is 
            oxidized, it can become glued to arteries and cause 
            
            coronary heart disease...

medical research
 








in medical and chemical studies,
        apple polyphenols 
        are also variously referred to as apple condensed tannins, phenolics, 
        phenolic compounds,    antioxidants, flavonoids, apple 
        peel powder,  bioflavonoids,  phytonutrients, and 
        phytochemicals. 


there is an impressive body of research 
                on phytochemicals and 
    polyphenols from fruits, teas, wine and vegetables and 
                their positive effects on human health. this site will focus on 
                the research specific to 
apple polyphenols and
extracts 
                because of their unique potency,
                bioavailability and 
                wide range of benefits studied.
some of the best research in the world is 
                coming out of 
    cornell university 
                here in the u.s. be sure to
                read 
                this review study from cornell- it's an overview of much of 
                the existing research on 
apple polyphenols.  
the widest range of study has focused on 
    apple 
                polyphenols' antioxidant 
                capabilities. their effect on human cancers, especially
    lung cancer and
    prostate cancer, is also well 
                detailed. other scientists are focusing on 
    apple polyphenols as beneficial 
                in heart disease,
                allergies, and
                hair regrowth in male 
                pattern baldness...
