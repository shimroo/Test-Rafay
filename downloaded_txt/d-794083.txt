testimonials















it was really fun doing this class. i think the teachers were really great telling us what to do. i learned how to use a check and how to use my atm and a cool budget app on my phone. thank you for teaching me.

i’m just glad to be able to hang out with you guys as much as i can for the last couple years since my grandmother got me onto here. it has been a wonderful journey for how i’ve been going on throughout my life. even through all the ups and downs, you guys always looked out for me and i couldn’t be happier to be around wonderful friends.

i feel so proud of myself and i’m very happy with all the support i got from strive to get me to where i am now. all these great people like you guys are always on my side and i really appreciate all of you and thank you for helping me to get to where i am today.
