welcome
newnham college is the lively and sociable women’s college at the heart of the university of cambridge. founded in 1871, we are the oldest college run by women, for women.
at its heart, a cambridge college is a community of learning, teaching and research. but at newnham, perhaps more than most, learning and research lend us a quiet determination to change the world (and, maybe, not always so quiet).
