joad























what is joad  
the junior olympic archery development program was developed in order to provide this country's youth with a safe, disciplined
archery training program. this program will not only teach children the fundamentals of archery, but promote fun and enjoyment 
for the entire family. usa archery has structured an achievement program that rewards improvement and stresses participation, so that archers can grow
independently in a group situation. if one qualifies, a joad member could potentially become an olympic and international archery contestant.

why joad 
pelkey's archery is pleased to continue our affiliation with usa archery so that we may host vermont's finest junior archery development club, known as the vermont
junior archers joad. we are both proud and excited to offer this program to the youth of our communities, as it is the driving force
in the development of archery in this nation. our classes are run by usaa certified coaches. classes are limited to
twelve students to ensure safety and personalized instruction. training includes instruction, testing for achievement awards, and "spirit week". club membership also
qualifies students to participate in local and out-of-state tournaments.

how your child can be a part of joad 
a young person age 5 to 20 who is interested in the sport of archery, a member of a joad club and a member of usa archery
can be part of this growing sport.
