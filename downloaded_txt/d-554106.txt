unique in a sea of sameness
the caribiana 23' is completely customizable- if you can dream it, it's possible.
 the high, slender bow; graceful, sheer lapstrake hull; and old world finishes echo a time when utility and craftsmanship shaped beautiful boats. the caribiana sea skiff marries the heritage of caribbean hull design and traditional american craftsmanship. incorporating exquisite wood finishes and the classic lines of a skiff with modern functionality, materials, and techniques, we have created an elegant, heirloom boat.
some of the more popular features of the caribiana sea skiff include custom-colored hulls and newly designed helm and helm seating. the wood rub rail with rope inlay, wood floorboards and aft grate add panache to the overall look, while the wood picnic table is essential for your sunset feast. traditional dry storage compartments, anchor locker, bimini, a built-in 23-gallon aluminum fuel tank are necessities that aren't overlooked. various power selections and trailer options are available. 















our work
grace | craftsmanship | beauty



























what makes a caribiana so visually unique? 

much of its appeal begins with the long, graceful lines that start low at the transom then sweeps forward into a high, proud, distinctive bow. this upward sweep also unveils the classic lapstrake hull designs of old. caribiana skiffs' lapstrake appearance is molded into the fiberglass hull. this maintains the classic look of an old-world skiff while providing the function and durability of a modern boat.



what sets a caribiana apart?

classic lines coupled with high-grade wood finishes are just a few of the attributes that make caribianaâs artfully designed skiff the most eye catching boat on any body of water! 




customize your caribiana.
from bow to stern, your skiff will have your fingerprint design. hull color, wood, and everything in between can be customized. in addition, traditional dry storage compartment, anchor locker, bimini, and a built in 23 gallon aluminum fuel tank are necessities that arenât overlooked. all skiffs come standard with a 70 hp yamaha but various power selections and trailer options are available.
