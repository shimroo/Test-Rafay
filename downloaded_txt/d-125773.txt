former united pentecostal memoirs & books



backsliding into jesus: finding hope after legalism 
 is jennifer brewer's second book, released in late september 2023. she "has personally experienced leaving the united pentecostal church, as well as walked alongside others on their journey to freedom. this book explores the feelings and emotions 
 one will inevitably face when leaving legalism and discovering the freedom of god's grace." free: from legalism to grace breaking out of the united pentecostal church is also still available and has been helpful to many.  


thereâs no such thing as dragons: examining the theology of the united pentecostal church is by jonah mcelhaney. his book covers aspects of the united pentecostal church such as oneness, uncut hair for women, holiness standards,
and their teachings on salvation.
 



well written and captivating, the uncomfortable confessions of a preacher's kid is from 
ronna russell. 
ronna had a childhood filled with fear of being lost, being left behind and of a father's quick temper, never knowing when he might explode.
some might also want to read 
    heretics and politics: theology, power, and perception in the last days of cbc 
by thomas fudge. ronna was interviewed for it and it covers, in part, about her father, former upci minister don fisher. other books by fudge that are upc related are 
christianity without the cross: a history of salvation in oneness pentecostalism & 
c.h. yadon: and the vanishing theological past in oneness pentecostalism. 




just as emotional abuse affects one emotionally, while physical abuse inflicts pain
    and bodily injury on its victim, spiritual abuse affects one spiritually. it is the
    result of a spiritual leader or system that tries to control, manipulate, or dominate
    a person. this control is often in the form of fear. this is considered a major factor
    in mind control/coercive persuasion or thought reform. there are those who feel the
    latter comes into play in cases such as these, while others feel the thinking is
    in error. no matter where one stands, it does not lessen the affects of spiritual
    abuse. (read entire text and watch interview with stephen arterburn, co-author of
    "toxic faith")
