on this site you can learn about a governing  strategy called 'policy governance' and how to employ it.  this information is provided to help you understand the model and decide whether your board-executive team can benefit from it.  you can review selected work we have presented or published on various aspects of the model.  we have resources you can use in developing a governance plan to guide your board in its servant-leadership role and its relationship with staff.  we believe boards of all types can improve their effectiveness as they investigate, adopt, and maintain this model to achieve the goals of their organizations through good governance.


 


we welcome your interest in policy governance® as a governing strategy for your organization.
