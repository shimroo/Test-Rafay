late edition





     breaking news! at 6:55 tonight, kieran gill discovered that on the wiki page space.template.readingandpainting, writing a story, instead of the usual comments, he found only the word, "ssssssssssssstttttttttttttttttguuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddd", note the g. he immediatly notified me for a late edition. i began to investigate immediatly, and uncovered the truth. conversing with kieran, i learned that he was attempting to post his hard done arts and humanities homework, but now couldn't. as we were talking, the "ssssssssssssstttttttttttttttttguuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddd" dissapeared, we were in shock. at that point i took action, after digging through some classified files, i found that at 6:50 a certain maddie weigel deleted all the text on the page, case closed, or was it? the problem was, we still didn't know who posted the "ssssssssssssstttttttttttttttttguuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddd",
so, i dug deeper, and found out that after that, at 7:00, paige pence posted the stupid. but wait! we also discovered that at 7:10, she deleted the stupid. so in conlusion, thats what happened. but that leaves one question, did maddie do this on purpose? did she get hacked? did paige relize that she might get in trouble for the stupid and make a failed attempt to negate the trouble by deleting it? but it didn't work because the damage was done? you decide!
(edit)
at 8:03 that night also, mrs. sears restored the page, and kieran was able to post.

the second post!





     this is the second post of the ever expanding chris blog, remember to tell your friends! today was an intresting day for christopher. today i met the most amazing person i have ever met who is shorter than me. 11 year old donnie reisner, who's mom is in jail and whose dad is dead. if this isn't enough, he also has no vision in one eye and poor vision in the other. this person managed to function normally in society despite this, (during the ksb games he won the 60 meter run, the 200 meter run, and the running long jump, the only events he competed in). in other news, not much has happened. thanks for reading todays post!
