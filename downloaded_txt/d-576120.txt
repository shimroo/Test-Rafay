keep up the fight brothers and sisters!





first, watch the shocking video.



then sign the petition:

http://www.petitionbuzz.com/petitions/tmount

our brothers and sisters are risking their lives in non-violent protest to have equal access to our own holy sites!  watch how the muslims and israeli police treat them!

o enemies of israel, we will win!  with determination.  with heartfelt prayer.  and finally when mashiach tzidkeinu comes, we shall rebuild.

if you want a tragic (yet humorous) insight into the muslim mind, i invite you to read this:  http://tinyurl.com/muslimlies

the truth will set us free!





 
it’s time to come clean.  after using stumble upon to check out other sites, i ran across quite a few conspiracy sites.  most of them had to do with jews.  i felt a huge wave of shame overcome me.  how did the truth get discovered?  i am so distraught, i have decided to come clean.
the jews are responsible for everything bad in the world.  if you read every other word of our holy text the protocols of zion you can clearly see that we jews founded the illuminati alongside bolshevism to cover up the faked moon landing.
now stay with me here.  israel, founded by the rothschilds, was secretly funded by the masons, who, as an anti-christian organization, had jesus crucified for sell retail to the “goyim.”
here’s where it gets scary.  we killed paul mccartney in 1966 and replaced him with an exact duplicate.  why?  he knew that the aliens who landed in roswell were zionist slumlords trying to occupy the navajo nation.  of course, we are not the original jews.  we are khazars who genetically altered our dna to look like the ancient palestinian people whose land we now occupy in order to judaize al aqsa , a place that has no particular connection to us whatsoever.  fact is, the real jews are the british.  particularly the welsh and some of the people in the east side of royal tunbridge wells.
now, as you know, passover is coming.  time to feast on some gentile children’s blood!  in fact, my bubbie’s recipe is as follows:
matzoh 
 six cups flour (all purpose) four cups water (do not take from the wells we poisoned!) two cups gentile blood (preferably child.  it’s more fresh)
(side note:  happy easter to all my catholic friends who will be feasting on the blood and flesh of jew through transubstantiation.  bon appetite!)
back to the truth.  as communists we decided to set up the federal reserve to oppress the poor.  why?  we like to keep you on your toes.  we killed kennedy, lincoln, jesus, buddha, gandhi, mark twain, julius caesar, atlantis, bell bottoms, arafat (well, aids killed him, but we gave him the young infected boy) and finally abel (we traveled back in time for that one).  jimmy hoffa is buried in tel aviv (aka occupied palestine.)
my uncle abe worked at the hospital in hawaii where obama was born.  frequently he would destroy birth certificates just in case they would want to run for office when they were adults.  boy, was he a forward thinker!
we are communists and yet we are greedy capitalists.  we are racist and xenophobic and yet we forced the civil rights movement and desegregation on the south.  we are all of european stock, even our brothers and sisters from yemen and ethiopia.  we are clannish and hate all gentiles though we are masonic an organization that teaches  brotherhood among all men.   
last but not least: we flew all the planes into the twin towers after the secret message was sent out for all jews to stay home on 9/11.  we behead infidels.  we riot in the street.  we openly declare that we want to subject the world to sharia halacha.  we blow up buddha statues.  we destroy hindu temples.  we occupy mecca and medina and refuse to let muslims worship at their holiest site and deny their connection to the land.  we kill our daughters when they date.  we chop off the hands of thieves.  
thanks for listening.  i feel so much better now!

a time to fight!






 i have decided to set up a one stop shop for all the jewish bloggers out there to help with the fight against missionaries.  here are some good links to get started:
be true
yad l'achim
jews for judaism
messiah truth project
being jewish anti-missionary gateway 
outreach judaism
torah life & learning
simple to remember
counter missionary
gavriel sanders 
jews for hashem
pagan origins of the christ myth
26 reasons jews don't believe in jesus
judaism's answer
messianic jewish truth
the truth about moshiach

another take on dealing with missionaries:

be jewish
printouts, materials and online books:
 here
here 

their hollow inheritance (free online book)
the world's sixteen crucified saviors - warning: atheist website 
 and, of course, if you are a jewish blogger and pledge to fight missionary activity on your site i invite you to email me to request my anti-missionary "hechsher" -
i will eventually set up a side bar link area for those who carry the hechsher. 

it's time to fight back brothers and sisters.

my shabbos guests...





in the middle of enjoying my cholent this past shabbos an odd thin occured.  our doorbell rang.  my wife went outside and i heard her shoo some people away.  when she returned i asked her who it was.  she told me that it was missionaries (the "restoration" of israel).  i quickly jumped up and ran outside.

i am not like others.  i don't poo-poo missionaries and other enemies of the jewish people. 

i engage.

i spoke to them for a good fifteen minutes as my family and our shabbos guests looked on.  i made it clear that the reason the jewish people are in exile is because of our sins, especially idol worship.  i recited the passage about hashem blessing those who bless us and cursing those who curse us.  i demonstrated, through logic (something lost on these zombies) that jesus cannot be g-d or the messiah.  i walked them through the logic and then shocked them with this:  by trying to convert the jewish nation away from our torah and our worship of the one true g-d you are effectively trying to introduce us back to idol worship.  since jesus is not g-d, worshiping him would be idol worship.  therefore, the g-d of israel will curse you for trying to lead us astray.  i explained, in their terms, that hellfire awaited them for trying to harm the jewish people.


the conversation pretty much ended there.  it's time for the jewish people to stand up, arm ourselves with knowledge, engage and fight back using the same weapons of our enemies.  we strike back at hamas and hizbollah, why not at missionaries?  if i had more time, i would have tried to convert them to b'nei noach.  but my cholent getting cold.

if you think it's no big deal, i invite you to watch this nauseating video:

my latest dream... "prepare!"





i had a dream last night where my wife's recently deceased grandmother (a"h) came to me and told me (as she pointed to one of her children who was no longer observant) "tell him to prepare!"  bubbie was 108 when she passed away and a genuine tzadeikes.  in all her year of marriage not even her husband saw her hair and he wouldn't eat anything not cooked by his wife.  she was a direct descendant of king david with all the names listed on a family tree.  she was truly a one of a kind.

one of her children who also passed away was no longer as religious as the rest of her family.  to be fair, he was sick and his medication took a huge toll on his body and soul.  it's not that he was anti-religious, he just became lax and the medication made him foggy.  i do not believe that the message was directed to him per se.  i believe that he was merely a symbol for the jewish people at large and the message was to those of us who are not as stringent as we should be in torah learning, mitzvos and emunah and that we should take heed because the time is now to prepare.  moshiach is coming.

a footnote:  i had three dreams subsequent to that dream where i told my wife the message from her grandmother. 



a sweet note:  she blew me a kiss before she gave me the message.  may hashem raise her neshama to the highest heights of heaven and bless her with only good.

rabbi calls for sacrifice on temple mount





jews evading passover mitzvah are risking supernatural punishment, warns safed's chief rabbi shmuel eliyahu. 


read the full article here.
"in order to overcome the greatest obstacle,  beyond the political problem, an altar must be erected, the rabbi said.  he also called for the preparation of "priesthood clothes", which are  the only ones in which kohanim (priests) can perform their work at the  temple."let's do it already!  why do the samaritans get a free pass to practice their religion and we don't?
"may it be your will, o my g-d and g-d of my forefathers, that the beit ha-mikdash be rebuilt speedily in our days, and give us our portion in your torah and there we will worship you with reverence as in ancient days and former years. and may the korban mincha of judah and jerusalem be pleasing to god, as in ancient days and former years."just empty words? 



and now for a little prophecy...

why there will be no peace in our time.





while arabs and muslims are clamoring for human rights and basic dignity against their arab muslim dictators, a common theme seems to be evident...


















lessons: 

1. evil still exists. 
2. history repeats itself.
3. raise yourself up at the expense of the jewish nation.

stop the desecration of the temple mount!





read more about it here.

we need an international outcry!  hoe can the world shed tears for the so-called palestinians while out holiest shrine is being desecrated?  what would the world say if jews or hindus did this to the kaaba?

speak out!  repost!  raise the issue!

i am also looking for a holy brother and sister who lives in the old city to establish a temple cam.  while the kotel cam is wonderful, the world should also have a window on judaism's holiest place!  perhaps shuvu bonim will allow a camera on their roof?  anyone want to help?
