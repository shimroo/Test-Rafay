 “ my children absolutely love bair lake bible camp! we even have to send them for more than one week of summer. they just can't get enough!   “ we are so extremely grateful for the week our son spent at camp. he is still talking non-stop about it! he gave his life to christ last week after a conversation with his cabin leader and that alone makes our hearts rejoice!
