thousands of adult and student groups â churches, high schools, 
middle schools, homeschool co-ops, camps, and community organizations â have embraced these interactive 3-act mystery plays.
 and you can too! 
with 8 or more actors and actresses willing to invest 6-8 weeks, your group can create an impressive and distinctive event that 
highlights a range of talents. if your group is smaller or short on time, mini mysteries are a fantastic alternative requiring 
fewer cast members and a shorter commitment.
 
 guests: mystery dinner theater plays provide a memorable and unique experience. 
not only is the audience drawn to the story acted out on stage, they enjoy mingling with the cast during appetizers, dinner, and dessert. guests are 
also involved in conspiring with others at their table, playing table games, and a few outgoing participants may be called to volunteer on stage.


 mystery: the crowd seeks to find clues to solve a murder, theft, or sabotage. yet, unlike tv crime shows, 
first a funny and intriguing story unfolds. towards the end, a crime occurs. then, as the audience munches on dessert, they
 try to solve the murder or guess who-dun-it on an accusation card. the ending scene brings their &quotaha" moment by revealing the culprit.
 prizes: who doesn't adore winning a prize? not only does the sleuth-of-the-night win, but also an entire table can snag a reward
for solving a thematic table game. and if you wisely offer the &quotclueless award," you'll be amazed at the creative ideas your audience provides.

 cast: scripts give the audience a great story by keeping the cast in mind. characters have intriguing lines, engaging actions, and relevant
situations to portray. parts are composed of roles to involve both novice and experienced actors and actresses. even the smallest character role has meaningful lines likely to become a 
favorite snippet repeated long after your show ends.

 director: creative themes help directors find people to participate. mystery scripts do not contain embarrassing words or scenes to work around.
most plays have additional small parts as an option for new recruits. plus, since every group is different, there is always at least one character that can be played by a male or female. 
scenery changes are limited to keep the staging simple. stage directions are given, but flexible to be changed to meet the various situations of different organizations.
