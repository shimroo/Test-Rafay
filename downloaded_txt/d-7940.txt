what is "finishing" or "metal finishing"?
finishing is vital to a sustainable future!
countless billions of $$ of our modern world simply corrodes away each year -- necessitating endless re-mining of ores, smelting processes, rolling/casting, fabrication of replacements, assembly, waste of packaging materials, selling, and ultimately landfilling, with transportation cost & energy between each step.  why? because things are lasting 2 or 3 years when they can easily last 2 or 3 decades and more! 
corrosion can be controlled by anodizing, electroplating, galvanizing, and powder coating
and it's not just the money: it's the environmental consequences, the loss of functionality, the injuries, the ugliness, the heirlooms lost, the land wasted on landfills, the accidents in transport.
finishing is about creating a surface/skin with the properties you need
finishing is not only corrosion protection, it's low friction for energy efficiency; low electrical resistance to enable complex electronics; resistance to microbial contamination which spreads disease; high wear resistance so things last longer and need fewer repairs; cleanable surfaces for hygiene; artful appearance ... and more.
and on a lighter note ... when chrome was king:

1958 buick - the most chrome plating of any car ever :-)
