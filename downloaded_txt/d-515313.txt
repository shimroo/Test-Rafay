top questions
what is the $5 membership share savings?  is it going to cost me $5.00 to be a member or is greenstate covering that? what if i only have $3 in my account? what happens if i fall below $5? your $5 membership into greenstate has been covered on your behalf by greenstate. this one-time deposit will be placed in your savings share account upon system conversion. you do not owe us any fee for this membership. the $5 must remain in your share savings account in order to have any of the accounts and services provided by greenstate credit union. when you close your accounts and membership, you will receive that $5.00.
i only have a certificate of deposit. will i still have a $5 membership share? yes! to take advantage of any of our deposit or loan products and services, you must have and maintain the membership established through the $5 membership share savings account.
currently midwest bank account statements are free along with images of their checks. after conversion will this remain the same?more details will be released about statements and images of checks as we get closer to the conversion of systems in the first quarter of 2023. for now, your online banking and statements remain the same. once set up on greenstate’s online banking, you will have access to free estatements and digital check images. 
what is the ncua? the ncua (national credit union administration) is one of two federal agencies that provide deposit insurance to banks and credit unions. the fdic insurers banks. ncua also provides regulatory oversight of all greenstate credit union operations. through the ncua, your deposits are guaranteed up to $250,000 per person, per institution, per ownership category.
about the acquisition
why is midwest community bank & being acquired by greenstate credit union? in early 2021, midwest community bank began assessing its strategic options. greenstate credit union was contacted in this process, and it was determined to be a good fit for both midwest and greenstate. as iowa’s largest credit union and one of the largest in the us, we exist to create lasting value for those we serve and have been taking great care of member-owners since we were formed back in 1938. our goal is to return our profits back to those member-owners in the form of better rates on deposits and loans, so we’re always looking for ways to strengthen and provide choice in the marketplace. adding the loans and deposits of midwest community bank fits well with this approach and provides a net benefit to both new and existing members.greenstate members find value in membership benefits even beyond iowa borders. greenstate already has over 33,000 members living in illinois, and once joined with midwest community bank, we plan to serve midwest customers and greenstate members with a combination of branch locations, a full-service call center, and a host of free digital services.
why is this a good fit for both organizations?both greenstate and midwest have developed over many years strikingly similar core values. both organizations have been driven by the strong belief that the only way a financial organization should conduct its business is to emphasize how well it serves its members and customers and supports its employees. such an approach is rare in business. it’s even rarer for two like-minded organizations to come together as one and do more great things in the future.
how large is greenstate credit union and where are they located?greenstate credit union is headquartered 2355 landon road, north liberty, ia 52317. the credit union serves over 454,000 members with assets in excess of $11.1 billion. the credit union operates 32 branches throughout iowa, and illinois and belongs to the co-op atm network, which provides members access to 30,000 surcharge-free atms and 24/7 phone support. for branch locations and hours, visit https://www.greenstate.org/connect/locations/branch-and-atm-finder.html. greenstate is recognized as a leader in commercial, retail and mortgage lending. it offers highly competitive deposit products and checking accounts. it also provides the services of insurance, wealth management, and trust. it is recognized as a top employer by the des moines register, and it is ranked in the top 1% for returning profits to its members (callahan and associates return of member score).
about the people
will there be changes to the staff of midwest community bank?midwest community bank employees will become greenstate employees, sharing a commitment to deliver financial services and expertise to families and small businesses throughout the communities we serve. all midwest community bank locations will remain open to serve you.
who will be the president/ceo?jeff disterhoft is the current president/ceo of greenstate and will continue in that role.
will there be changes to the board of directors?the current board of directors of greenstate will remain unchanged as a result of the transaction. the board of directors of midwest community bank will cease to exist because midwest community bank will dissolve.
about the future
where will the headquarters be located?the headquarters of greenstate are at 2355 landon road, north liberty, ia 52317. greenstate is proud to maintain a strong local and community focus throughout the midwest. we are not only committed to being a top rate employer, but also giving back to the communities we serve through charitable contributions and volunteer support. we are excited to bring this giveback philosophy to the great state of illinois.
when will i see signage begin to change at branch locations?branch signage will change on or around the time of acquisition closing which is scheduled for july 29, 2022.
are you planning to close any branch locations?no, midwest community bank locations in freeport, rockford, st. charles and woodstock along with blue leaf lending locations in chicago, park ridge, skokie, st. charles, naperville and traverse city will be maintained and incorporated with greenstate’s, resulting in a network of 33 service locations throughout iowa and illinois markets. we continually monitor the performance of each branch location to ensure we are meeting the needs of our membership and the markets in which we operate.
about my accounts
what’s the benefit to me related to this acquisition?during the transition from midwest community bank to greenstate and until our core systems are fully integrated in early 2023, you will have access to the existing products and services you enjoy now. once the transition to greenstate is completed, new opportunities will be added to your current products/services including:

better rates on loans and deposit accounts
mortgage and home equity loans and lines of credit
greater selection of personal loans
availability of business and commercial real estate loans
complete selection of checking, savings, money market and certificate of deposit accounts
use of your greenstate debit card at 30,000 locations of the co-op atm network
online and mobile banking services

as a member-owned, not-for-profit financial cooperative where profits cycle back to the members, greenstate is able to offer competitive rates and lower fees and return excess capital to members when the credit union performs well.
will my account number change?yes, in the months ahead, our systems integration will require a change to account number structures. we will work to minimize any changes made to accounts. we understand that this type of change may cause disruption, so our commitment is to make any transition as smooth as possible so that you experience no hiccups in accessing your accounts.
will my consumer loans (home equity, auto, home equity lines of credit, etc.) remain the same?your existing midwest and blue leaf consumer loans will transfer to greenstate at time of purchase transaction close. your loans will retain the same terms and payment calculations. payments will be handled the same until time of conversion which is scheduled for early 2023. you will receive notice at least 30 days in advance of any changes.
when and how will i receive my account statement from greenstate?at month end, greenstate will generate and deliver your account statement using your chosen delivery method (paper or online). if your account has not had any activity in the current month, you will default to a quarterly statement (january, april, july, october) until you have activity which will then be produced monthly.
will my certificate rates change?all certificate products will retain their rate structure and term when converted to greenstate.
will my safety deposit box change?all safety deposit boxes will remain and retain their rate structure when converted to greenstate.
will i need to update my ach (automated clearing house) transactions (social security, payroll, etc.)?
ach transactions (credits and debits) will continue to post without interruption and without any need to update on your part. however, if you prefer, you can contact any business whom you execute ach payments or deposits to provide greenstate’s routing number (273975098) along with your new account number.
how will this affect my rates and service charges/fees?your current rates and services you receive today will continue until we integrate systems. this integration is planned to be in early 2023. as part of our systems integration, we will review all services provided to members, including service charges, to make sure we provide consistent, low-cost access to the most innovative financial services. if any service changes/fees increase or change we will provide at least 30 days prior notice of any changes. to review greenstate’s current service pricing information please visit https://www.greenstate.org/fees-and-disclosures.html
will my deposits continue to be federally insured?greenstate is insured by the ncua (national credit union administration) through the ncusif (national credit union share insurance fund). ncua insurance is structured similar to fdic insurance. your deposits will continue to be federally insured to the maximum amount available, currently, to at least $250,000 per depositor, and backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government. credit union members have never lost a penny of insured savings at a federally insured credit union.
go to ncua's website at www.ncua.gov and fdic's website at www.fdic.gov for more detailed information about deposit insurance. please see a helpful comparison guide at the end of this document for reviewing differences between ncua and fdic insurance.
what happens if i already have both a greenstate credit union account and an midwest community bank account?after the proposed transaction closes, you will continue to have both accounts available for you at greenstate.
will i still be able to use my current checks?yes, you will continue to be able to use your current checks following our acquisition. at the time of our core systems integration, a complimentary box of new checks will be provided to you.
