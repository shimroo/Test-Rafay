listen 
    to podcast of npr/ut live interview discussing coal creek war and history
dialogue: (august) the coal creek war
    the cumberland mountains to the north of knoxville are home to most of the 
    coal mines in east tennessee... and towns like briceville, fraterville, and 
    lake city grew up around the mining industry. lake city was once called coal 
    creek. in the 1890s, coal creek and the surrounding area experienced a major 
    labor uprising involving coal miners, leased convict labor, the tennessee 
    legislature and governor's office and the state militia. on august's 
    dialogue, chrissy keuper speaks with barry thacker and carol moore of the 
    coal creek watershed foundation about that period of east tennessee 
    history...

welcome
to the online home of the coal creek watershed foundation, inc. (ccwf), a
non-profit organization with a mission  to
improve the quality of life in the coal creek watershed. we are
working as volunteers with government agencies and other
partners to effect change by combining the intellectual resources of our 
    engineers/scientists in east tennessee with the common sense of the 
    residents from the coal creek watershed.  


the "cmd" section of this web
site describes one of the tasks underway to achieve our mission: mitigation of
coal mine drainage (cmd) impacts from abandoned sites mined prior to
the development of current regulations. we are working in coordination with the
office of surface mining (osm) through their appalachian clean streams
initiative (www.osmre.gov/acsihome.htm)
and other state and federal agencies to address the cmd problems. 
    (osm water quality sampling)




coal creek deadwood removal day 2000 
    on saturday, june 24, 2000, brought out 137 volunteers to remove deadwood 
    from bridge piers and thereby reduce flooding impacts.  







we are in the process of developing the  coal creek
motor discovery trail to enable others to experience the unique history of 
    the scenic coal creek watershed.  


on august 22, 2000, congressman zach wamp, anderson county executive rex lynch,
tn state rep. william baird, commissioner albert slusher, commissioner jerry
      creasey, and 250 students and volunteers participated in  coal creek discovery day 2000
at briceville elementary school.




barry thacker, p.e. of ccwf, represented the 13-state eastern coal region at the
national watershed forum, as part of the epa's clean water
action plan.  he was also named the tennessee conservation league's water
      conservationist of the year.
people are interested in coal creek as evidenced by the 10,000 visits per week
to this web site.  if you want to join us, we could use your help. there are no monetary dues or
membership fees. instead, you must share our mission to improve the
quality of life in the coal creek watershed and volunteer your time to
our initiative.
