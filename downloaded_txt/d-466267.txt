what our participants say about cisi

"cisi was extremely easy and very affordable. when i found out i would not have insurance coverage
                          for an overseas internship, i panicked. a friend recommended cisi, and i was relieved to find
                          out how easy it was to enroll and that it would be affordable for a student doing an unpaid internship.
                          i thankfully didnât end up having to use it, but it definitely contributed to my peace of mind."
						  
							
 â allison shurilla, student



"cisi was very responsive and helpful as we started our international program. we had tried other
                          insurance companies and were not successful. we had such bad experiences with others that it was
                          hard to believe it could be so easy to work with an organization."
						  
							
 â crossroads community



"we have worked with cisi for many years and they are reliable, cooperative, and helpful. it has
                          been a pleasure being associated with them."

"the service is excellent. everyone is treated as an individual and treated with such respect. cisi
                          professionals know our program and our specific needs. i really appreciate the details such as
                          names of our insured students in an area of danger such as the email we just received regarding
                          the earthquake in chile last night."

"i have had to see cisi in action with students having a medical emergency. i have never received
                          a complaint from students or parents about support or reimbursement problems. i am extremely pleased
                          with cisiâs coverage."
