brewpalace updates:

oct 31, 2024  lots of local cansmaking a strong push towards the end of the year trying to get my #s respectable for the 1st time in several years.  went into salt lake city and loaded up on 35 cans from bewlider and kiitos brewing.  next up is to reorganize the shelves as utah is posed to become my #2 state this week, surpassing oregon's 188.oct 23, 2023 support for cansafter 29 years of bottle only, it is time for brewpalace to support cans.  too many brewers have switched to cans, essentially limiting my bottle choices to practically zero these days.  given this website is primarily for me and my cataloging my beer drinking, there are too many beers now that i just don't recall and can't look them up because they are not in the database.  i really don't want to do this, but feel i have no alternative at this point.  oh well, maybe in a year or so i'll be glad i made the change and stayed with the current times.bottle # 4,000 and 25th anniversarywell, after 25 years of bottle collecting, i finally reached bottle #4,000 this weekend.  i celebrated with some friends with a 6l big boy of st. bernardus 12 in the final moments of august 2019 which marked the month 25 years earlier i started the whole crazy thing with a return business trip to antwerp, belgium.  turns out it took exactly 5 years to the month since #3,000.  thanks to la jolla public house for hosting and allow us to bring the bottle!big year2018 turned out to be one of my biggest years of the bottle collection, clocking in at 210 bottles.  in january when i was putting up the beer shelves i got the bug to go big this year in an effort to get to 4,000 bottles in 2019, which would be the 25th anniversary of the collection.  should be in great shape to get there in the summer time for a big celebration.dogfish head master collectori wanted to make a post about a fellow collector, victor from delaware.  to say he's a big dogfish head fan is a bit of an understatement.  he is a vertical collector, meaning he wants one of every bottle and product they make, including various years where they changed the label.  his collection is 245 bottles strong, plus spirits and schwag.
some pics of his collection:

 my antonias #1 my antonias #2

vic only has two beer bottles (can be empty or just label) that he knows of left in the standard beer collection: the two italian my antonias pictured.  some non-distributed one-offs, like intergalactic bocce tourney; steampunk porter; and quartier rouge are needed,too, but not counted! distillery needs include: tee-keela; fortress; de native spirit; and peche brandy. has some spectacular rarities, if have and want to trade, contact him here.
cheers!
