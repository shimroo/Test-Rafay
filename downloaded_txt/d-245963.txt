the four most important questions:


 why is there something rather than nothing?


 what is the origin of the universe?


 how did life start?


 is there other life elsewhere in the universe?







  "the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and
   far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have
   concocted. nature comes up with surprises that far exceed those that the human imagination
   can generate." - lawrence m. krauss in his book, a universe from nothing, p. xvi






 




purpose:




i know, you may have come to this page for a thousand other reasons than the fate of earth and the eradication of marxism. maybe you're interested in morse
code or appropriate technology (yes, i have some pages devoted to those, too...), or you love travel and 
mountaineering (i've done a lot of that, as well), or you've searched for me on the web because i've made a business proposal, applied for a position/contract 
at your company, or you've read one of my articles, or heard me on the radio.
 
 
whatever the reason i'm really glad you're here - even if you don't agree with me politically, philosophically, or even 
spiritually - it's important that we be able to communicate and have a free flow of information without threat of intimidation or worse (and, yes, i've received 
"worse" - up to and including death threats 
for the simple ideas and suggestions i've authored in various publications or on the internet).
 

so, even though this site has well over 200 pages (and that's not counting the hundreds of pages i've authored on other sites!), covering all kinds of topics (including sciences like biology, 
evolution, and cosmology that i love so much...), i want to make it clear that my lifelong passion has been the protection and preservation of our 
precious little planet and the wonderful array and diversity of life that it harbours. yes, my family, friends, freedom, liberty, country, job, and other 
aspects of regular life are extremely important to me, but the planet, ultimately, deserves our greatest care and consideration.
 

in the secular long run, for that huge stretch of time that will continue after our deaths, there is nothing more important than this planet and the other creatures that inhabit it with us. face 
it, no matter our technological prowess or spiritual certainty, this planet is all we know - there's no religious consensus on an alternative existence or afterlife, and science has confirmed that human-beings will never 
leave the solar system, ever.* each of us has been born on this planet, and with the exception of a few astronauts, each of us will perish here. there is nothing else - this is our home.
 

my concern is not just with the destruction brought about by consumptive asians, north americans and europeans, but by most of humankind all over the planet as well. i've traveled all the continents and can assure 
you that none of the aforementioned peoples have "cornered the market" on habitat destruction and abuse - from china and india, to 
antarctica and japan, human impact on the natural world has been devastating - entire species and bioregions have been decimated by our greed, arrogance, and indifference.
 

oh, and let's be clear, although capitalism has contributed to losses in the natural world, marxism and communism have damaged a lot more - including the quality of life for humans as well.
 

as such, i hope my little website, or occasional magazine articles and radio programs, can raise awareness, thwart totalitarianism, save some habitat, or rescue a species on the brink of extinction. i know - you may 
have come here to read one of my rants against the airlines or the concentration of wealth throughout society - that's fine. just remember that my goal is to save some of 
the natural world - other creatures and systems have an intrinsic value of their own, and a right to be here regardless their "utility" or economic worth to humans. and, it doesn't matter our political system, religious views, or 
economic philosophy, we have no right to halt, slow, or degrade the biological rhythms and relationships that started a few thousand million years before our own appearance just a couple geologic seconds ago. we have no right to wantonly destroy the beautiful, mysterious array of life that also calls this place home. we do not have that right.

quarter change
stuff i change every quarter!


(my apologies to nonnative speakers as this little phrase is yet another
example of the subtle ambiguities that vex the english language...)








quote quiz:
 
 


which famous person said this?
"i want to go when i want. it is tasteless to prolong life artificially. i have done my share, it is time to go. i will do it elegantly.""
(click here for the answer)








quote of the quarter:
 


"capitalism was the only system in history where wealth was not acquired by looting, but by production, not by force, but
by trade, the only system that stood for man's right to his own mind, to his work, to his life, to his happiness, to himself."
 - ayn rand, capitalism: the unknown ideal







real bumper stickers:
 
 
 
 














did you know?
 
 


"annually, over 1.95 billion land animals are killed for cat and dog food within the u.s. and 6.96 billion globally. for humans, this number is 7.8 billion within the u.s. and 71.3 globally"
