al forno restaurant opened on january 2, 1980. chef-owners johanne killeen & george germon bring simple renditions of food rooted in the various regions of italy to their riverfront restaurant kitchen. dishes are re-crafted to reflect the products of new england's farms and waters cooked in blazing hot ovens and on grills over hardwood charcoal fires. their training in the fine arts is evident in the original, creative techniques used for signature dishes such as grilled pizza, high-heat roasted veggie entree, dirty steak with hot fanny sauce, clams al forno, a unique collection of baked pasta, and made-to-order desserts such as hand-churned ice cream, fresh fruit tarts, baby cakes, and the grand cookie finale. the innovative cooking at al forno has produced a trail of george and johanne's dishes all over the world.
