mozart the music processor™ is music notation software for computers 
		    	running microsoft windows.  mozart allows you to type in music notation - as easily as entering text in a word

mozart's in-built knowledge of music 
			    syntax lets you create scores and parts quickly and efficiently. these pages 
			    contain extensive information about mozart: lists of features; illustrated 
			    examples; what you need to run it; how to download the 
				evaluation copy; how 
			    to buy the full virtuoso edition; and how to get support.
