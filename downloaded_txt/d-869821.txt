citizen journalism underscoring online journalism





within hours of news breaking about the worst school shooting in the history of the united states, hundreds of links to blogs, video clips and student-made tribute groups were searchable about the va. tech shootings. hundreds of facebook groups such as “va. tech, you are in our prayers” were created. hundreds of tribute videos, compiled of photos, graphs and music, could be found on youtube. xanga, livejournal and other online blog users updated their blogs about their feelings and own take on the entire situation. all these combined together, gave anyone who came across these sites, a different perspective to the story that the mainstream media could not do.this is the power of citizen journalism. according to the report by shayne bowman and chris willis entitled we media: how audiences are shaping the future of news and information, citizen journalism is defined as the act of citizens “playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing and disseminating news and information” (http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/weblog.php). in other words, the reader has now become the reporter.citizen journalism is the new form of communicating information to others. readers are now hearing a voice from the community. citizen journalism in a way has become a more intimate way of engaging into the news as the way of communicating news has become a bit more personal. guillermo franco, a professor of new media in columbia, conducted an e-mail interview with five authors and journalists about the topic of citizen journalism and blogging. an excerpt from jd lasica: "people are tired of journalism as lecture; they want a conversation. blogs present an opportunity for newspapers to reconnect with their readers and restore a sense of trust and community that was lost a generation ago as papers became more corporate and monolithic( http://www.poynter.org/dg.lts/id.31/aid.79157/column.htm)." let’s take a closer look. on the one hand, traditional journalism offers the facts, the statistics, and the stories, as told to the reporters. citizen .journalism, in a sense, is from the reader’s point-of-view. while it is less structured and informal, the style is more conversational and casual, sometimes making it easier to read. people work together as a whole and collectively give accurate information. wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org), a public online encyclopedia, which allows anyone to write and post a news story and anyone to edit any story, is an example of how citizen journalism works.another aspect of citizen journalism stems from personal experience. often times, citizen journalism entails hearing the news stories that are were missed by mainstream media. in his article as blogs and citizen journalism grow, where’s the news?, rick edmonds, a media business analyst (http://poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=91391), wrote that since citizens are “armed with cell phones or other digit-cams, [they] can be counted on to enrich coverage of events like last winter's tsunami, the london subway bombings and hurricane katrina, with still photos and streaming video.”when all major networks around the nation aired the evening news the night of april 16, 2007, many aired the same shaky video footage of the campus and in the video, shots could be heard. the video was taken by a student on campus with his cell phone. this has become a different form of getting the news. that is not the only new form of citizen journalism. students that were in the very classrooms that the shootings occurred from virginia tech would give a more accurate detail as to what happened than any other reporter for any news story. first-hand experiences being reported on their own terms would not only give a first-hand account of what happened but a definite accurate story in the eyes of one student.the negative side, however, would be the different perspective of the story. the perspective would be greatly different from students who attended the school and students who were in the very classrooms that the shootings occurred. both could reap drastically different opinions and perspectives. however, both stories would be accurate in the eyes of the writer, because it stemmed from their personal experience. journalists are trained to try to be as objective as possible whereas citizens have the freedom to write as they please, vent their true feelings, and have a bias look on the situation. christopher hanson, a journalism professor at the university of maryland (http://poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&aid=79373) states that:“there's no denying that the bloggers are a powerful force in the information world, but too many of them are either too self-absorbed to focus on keeping the public informed or too skewed by ideology to put factual accuracy front and center.”as the rise of citizen journalism continues, a growing tension has begun to form between professional journalists and citizen journalists with issues such as payment and competition. in a live debate in the organ grinder (http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2006/01/the_citizen_journalism_debate.html) section of the guardian website (that was posted into a blog) a selected panel of experts and readers debated their views on the topic of citizen journalism. there were mixed feelings about the entire situation of payment. on the one hand, some such as panelist bill hagerty, editor of the british journalism review commented that when news was used, “you should pay for it, i’m amazed people are doing it [for free]. i think that will change” in the debate, the guardian’s simon waldman responded (http://poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&aid=95660):“my greatest fear is that you are creating a culture of invasion of privacy for profit. i like the idea of people engaging with media; if people see something they should tell other people about it. but i don't like the idea that people can't walk down the street without having a camera phone shoved in their face."despite the growing tension between citizen journalists and professional journalists, all may not be counted as negative. in dan gillmor’s keynote speech on may 30, 2005 at the annual world editors forum in seoul titled: “what a professional and citizen journalists can learn from each other”(http://bayosphere.com/node/444), he stated:“some tension [between pro and citizen journalists] is inevitable, and not an entirely negative thing. competition can make us all better at what we do. ... something important is happening in the world of journalism: it's an evolution from the lecture model, to which we in mass media have become accustomed in the past century, to something closer to a conversation. ... if we lecture citizen reporters, treating them like children, they will ignore us.”given the nature of citizen journalism, it does have its inaccuracies, as does all news. opinion blogs often are found to be bias and reader may not be aware of this fact. readers may be exposed to the wrong information because of a typo or inaccurate information given because of the casual nature of blogs and personal websites.but let’s face it, we may bash on the inaccuracy of citizen journalism but the fact of the matter is, most, if not all, is based on some sort of news, whether it be from online journalism or print journalism. citizen journalism branches from those other forms and without tradiational journalism or even online journalism, citizen journalism would not be able to exist. as edmonds states in his article, “even as unperfected news forms, blogs and citizen journalism are exerting great influence.”

blog #1





you’re late. you’re on the go. breaking news just occurred. someone has the story. they can tell you the story using 500 words or they can cut out all the flowery details and tell you the exact same story in less than 100 words. which appeals to you more? come on now, be honest. on some level, we are all a bit impatient. we want it fast and we want it now. we relish in the idea of online news. it’s easier to access. it’s shorter. it’s faster. it’s easier to follow. it’s instant. for starters, online news is accessible 24 hours, 365 days a year and is constantly being updated. newspapers on the other hand, are only published every morning and it’s not as though the front page will change continuously throughout the day as breaking news occurs. in this growing fast-paced society of ours, we demand more results in less amount of time.hence, the rising popularity in online journalism increases and the fact is, more people are being informed of what is going on around them. journalists are being called to change their writing style online to fit the standard for their readers. "[y]ou will chunk and then write. you can use the hard news style for your latest factual development, then narrative in a separate chunk to 'humanize' the story. this separation allows you to adopt different writing styles tailored to the content" (ward 130-131)[1]. online news becomes easier to understand and is told to us in a shorter amount of time. you can learn a variety of news information in a matter of minutes with a simple click of the mouse. you can search effortlessly and within seconds, hundreds of links will be at your beckon call with more information than you care for. you gain knowledge about things you weren’t even looking to know all because you accidentally clicked the link below the one you meant to click. you can skip all the huge full-page ads in newspapers that simply bore you. you can search for what interests you. that’s the beauty of filtering. and filtering is definitely happens with online news. no longer called a newspaper, online news takes the idea of a newspaper and transforms into an unbelievably huge database of information at the tip of your fingers. “with the click of a mouse, i can move from page to page, follow jump lines, and scan for interesting stories, photos, charts, the ads, even the fine print, whether or not i’m online.”[2]not a big fan of the newspaper to begin with? are you devoted tv watcher? don’t worry because now online broadcasting is also accessible at any given time of the day. miss the 6:00 evening news? don’t worry. you can find clips of news online just by searching the internet for them. ktla.com is a perfect example of the online world of this news station. with a variety of video clips to choose from, one can see the news package report by simply searching for the category that it is looking for. latimes.com also offers the same luxury but is more interaction with an actual news story to go with the video footage. however, what you don’t see on latimes.com that you might in ktla.com are the video footages of car wreckage and fires since online news stories tend to cover the bigger events where video footage may not be accessible.  can’t find it on cnn.com or new york times online? chances are you can find a fuzzier but still accessible version on youtube.  plus, for the environmentalist in you, this version of the news saves a lot of trees from being cut down.more news than you can handle in the blink of an eye? sounds like a dream come true. or does it? for the younger generation this sounds great. myspace and new york times side by side within the confines of your computer screen? sounds like the perfect multitask. or is it?  for the up and coming generation that is already conditioned to fast-paced technology, this is just another source to add to their long list of technology-based products in life. however, for the generation that has long enjoyed holding a newspaper, this online version doesn’t sound so appealing. sure, it’s faster, it’s up-to-date, but it’s not as personal anymore. what happened to the intimate moment you felt as you held the newspaper in one hand and while sipping coffee from a mug in the other hand? the intimate moment as you fell deeper into the mold of the couch as you took all effort to turn the huge newspaper sheets to get to the next story. okay, so maybe this doesn’t run true for every individual but it does sound familiar for many. sure they are only offered limited news but the big stories are still there. and the big breaking news? chances are it’ll show up in the newspaper the next day. because of that limited news, you’re more likely to stumble onto something interesting, something that you would not have otherwise read because you were too busy filtering it out online. for some, while “[r]eading a newspaper, [they] scan virtually every page, often finding gems in out-of-the-way places--letters to the editors, obituaries--or sections such as sports, that [they] wasn't interested in.”[3] let’s not forget the local newspapers that aren’t quite up to par with major newspapers when it comes to the internet. for starters, their staff is remarkably smaller say, compared to the new york times. although there may be online versions, they may be more confusing and thus, more difficult to navigate through. in his own personal experience, mike wendland wrote in his article “life without a newspaper” that “on a computer screen, with just links of a uniform size used to navigate around, there's a lack of perspective about what's important. and it's often hard to distinguish between local and world news on a computer screen.”[4] what about history-making news? for instance, on the september 12, 2001 edition of the new york times, the front page picture said it all. images from the terrorist attack of 9/11 on the two towers brought silence to all who held the newspaper and in the rest of the nation. some even stored this edition because they knew that, 30 years from now, they could pull it out, show their grandchildren what the newspaper reported the day right after, the feelings and information, written down within hours of the attack, forever instilled into the writings of that particular edition. can we still do this with online news? sure we can print out the online version but it isn’t quite the same.this sort of experience cannot be found online. the tiny, minute details of life such as simply reading a newspaper or taking a walk through the park is what really makes life just a bit more enjoyable. if our life means consistently having our eyes glued to the computer screen or television screen, or any sort of screen for that matter, our life will somewhat lose a bit of meaning. not to mention the damage we will do to our eyes with prolonged hours in front of the screen.[1] ward, mike. journalism online. focal press, 2002. 14 may 2007.[2] scanlan, chip.
