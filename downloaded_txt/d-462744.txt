well, it's been a few years since i wrote anything here. so funny to think about. this used to be how i spent a lot of my time. cooking, writing, taking pictures, and then blogging about it. i still do the first three, and that does take up time, but this space has been neglected while i moved on. (a little bit anyway.) maybe i'll come back to this some day. maybe i won't. time will tell.

blueberry-coconut cream cheese schmear



blueberry-coconut cream cheese schmear









so, a few weeks ago, i found myself at a glamorous shin-dig being sponsored by the u.s. highbush blueberry council. one of my favorite people of all time, ms. erika (a woman i can say has showed me more kindness than i deserve and i will forever adore her for it) of in erika's kitchen, designed and cooked an entire thanksgiving meal that included blueberries in every course. needless to say, the food was divine, inspired and just plain delicious. 



i was coming from work that day and therefore a bit late. i tried my best not to be disruptive as i sneaked in. i eased myself in to a chair and found myself sitting next to three incredible blogger gals and interestingly, the two representatives from the u.s. highbush blueberry council. i like nothing more than having the experts at my elbow and these handsome gentlemen knew their stuff. i asked a zillion questions and they cheerfully indulged me with smart, witty and informative answers. (go to their site any time. you'll see. those people aren't just advocating eating blueberries, they are in the know and thrilled you might be as excited as they are.) 



as an avid gardener, consumer and freakishly obsessed blueberry lover, it was heaven. it was then they told me they were asking bloggers to post original recipes using blueberries. it was a no-brainer for me. i had to join in. (and yes, there is a cash prize at stake. what fun, right? right!)



so, the next few posts include my recipes featuring blueberries, or as anyone in the know calls them little blue dynamos. super fruit, super delicious. i hope you like all of them. i really, really, really loved creating (and yes, eating them), and hope you do too. 








and now...a fun story...when i was in school, my boyfriend bought us a pet iguana that we named jethro. turns out that sweet little lizard (who would rush across the room to snatch blueberries out of my hand) was a picky eater. his scaly self lived on a diet of mesculun, tofu and blueberries. as a college student on a budget, i loved that i could justify buying quarts and quarts of those dusky blue gems under the auspices i was feeding them to my sweet green pet. of course he only indulged in two or three a day, but me, i downed them like candy. still do. don't you? yea...you do.



that shared, it's time for an intro to our recipe:



oy, i do love a good bagel.  i came up with this to top it all off. it's sexy and fun and woweewow. you're gonna love it. try it my peaches, and enjoy. xoxo





serves 4 – 6



8 ounces cream cheese

1 cup blueberries, slightly mashed

¼ cup sweetened coconut flake



combine all. let rest 10 minutes for flavors to meld. serve
on plain bagels, or use as a base for your favorite cheesecake recipe. 




keeps, refrigerated for up to 4 days.

 blueberry and corn salsa with grilled chicken



blueberry and corn salsa 









okay, kids. you wanna jazz up dinner? you want salsa but with a bit of showmanship and some free-radical love (hate? free radicals confuse me. i just know the blueberries in this dish fight them. ward them off? whichever is best. that's what blueberries do. they fight the good fight without you even knowing it.)? you want to impress your friends and family? look no further.



this is gonna rock your world and leave you wanting more. (we made 4 cups worth tonight. it's gone. need i say more?) drench some chicken with it. (mom and pops couldn't get enough.) serve it with chips. (bro macked it down.) eat it right from the pan. (guilty as charged.) or...try it over momofuku style corn-flake infused ice-cream. you might think it sounds strange, but it's so good, your head might explode. 



so, i urge you to try this my peaches, and enjoy. xoxo



serves 4 – 6 



1 teaspoon vegetable oil

¼ cup red onion, diced

¼ cup red pepper, diced

¼ cup corn kernels

½ cup fresh or frozen blueberries

2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar

½ tablespoon white sugar

coarse ground black pepper, to taste




in a small sauté pan, heat the oil over medium high heat. add
the onion, peppers and corn and sauté until translucent, stirring often. will
take about 4 minutes. add the blueberries, white balsamic vinegar* and sugar. stir to combine.
taste and add more sugar as needed. finish with black pepper. 



serve with
grilled chicken, or as a salsa with chips. for the photo, i pan seared a chicken breast and topped it with the salsa. gotta say, of the myriad dishes i made with blueberries tonight, this was one of the top contenders. wow is it tasty.



*white balsamic vinegar is available in most grocery stores, or online. white balsamic blends white grape must with white wine vinegar and is cooked at a low temperature to avoid any darkening. you can always subsitute dark balsamic if needed.

blueberry aigre-doux with pork chops



blueberry aigre-doux

sweet and sour blueberries with pork chops







aigre-doux means sweet and sour, which is exactly what this is. or maybe more. dunno. do know it's versatile and easy to love. it's a staple in this house. 

try it my peaches, and enjoy. xoxo



serves 4 – 6



½ onion, minced

1 cup balsamic vinegar

¼ cup water

1 cup white sugar

½ teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon finely minced rosemary

black pepper to taste



in a small saucepan combine all the ingredients. let simmer
gently until the blueberries are soft and the liquid has reduced slightly (it
should thicken up a bit.) remove from the heat, taste and add more sugar or
vinegar as needed. add black pepper to taste. 



serve with grilled or pan-seared pork chops, or on a
cheese platter. it pairs especially well with cheddar cheese. you might also use it in a grilled cheese sandwich. don't be shy!





will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.

blueberry barbecue sauce glazed ribs





blueberry barbecue sauce









um...this is an amazing, incredible, mouth watering recipe. it's got pop, pow and pizzazz. it's super tangy and pairs perfectly with rich meat (such as the ribs in the picture, or over a brisket. that would be supreme.). as a food blogger, i always hope wish and pray the pictures really convey how good a recipe is, because this blueberry bbq sauce deserves to be recreated by you, your friends and everyone out there. it's bomb.com. try it my peaches, and see. xoxo





makes 2 cups



1 onion, minced

4 cloves garlic, rough chop

1 teaspoon vegetable oil

2 teaspoons spicy brown mustard

1 teaspoon prepared horseradish

2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries

pinch each of pepper, allspice and cloves

1 tablespoon molasses

½ cup brown sugar

1 tablespoon rosemary, minced fine

salt as needed




in a medium saucepan, sauté the onion and garlic in the
vegetable oil. when softened, add the mustard, horseradish, blueberries, spices,
molasses, brown sugar and rosemary.



let simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally
so it does not stick to the bottom of the pot. it should be thick and tangy
when ready.



taste and add salt as needed. 



use as a glaze on beef short ribs,
pork or chicken. 









***



for the ribs in the picture, i seasoned the ribs with salt and pepper, then grilled them for 30 minutes. added a thick layer of the sauce and then put them under the broiler for 5 minutes. served with more sauce on the side.

lemon buttermilk cake #2

.apparently, i am somewhat obsessed with making this purdy lil' cake. according to the notes in the margins i have made it nine times since 1999. for me, that's a lot, since i rarely bake and even more rarely eat cake. the funny part is, it's really not my kind of treat. it's quite plain. which might explain why the original (this is adapted) appears in the plain cakes chapter of maida heatter's cakes.  i like my snacks (read: empty calories) closer to a sugar-bomb, so what's with my repeat performances here?well, there is an answer. if you have a thing for jam, this is the cake to put it on. oh my gosh. i serve it with lemon curd, sqirl jams (order some today. trust me. deliciousness.) and when i really go overboard, i melt some butter and toast this lightly in it. uh-huh. i do. it's sinfully fantastic.so try this my peaches, and taste the joy.xoxofinely grated zest of 5 large lemons (more is good, too)3 t lemon juice3 cups flour1/2 t. baking soda1/2 t. sea salt (fine)1/2 lb. butter2 cups sugar3 large eggs1 cup buttermilkglaze1/2 cup lemon juice1/3 cup sugarpreheat oven to 350f. butter an angel food cake pan. if you can, line the bottom with parchment. it's better if you can, but not totally needed. combine the zest and 3 t. lemon juice and set aside.sift the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.in a stand mixer, beat the butter until soft (yes, you can do half and half crisco and butter. i have when in a pinch.), add sugar and beat until mixed. add eggs one at a time and beat well until mixed. add in 1/2 of the dry ingredients, then the buttermilk, then the rest of the dry ingredients. beat until smooth, but not longer. (ever wonder why recipes say this? the more you beat flour the more the gluten develops and toughens the final product. ta-dum!) stir in the lemon  juice/zest. combine the glaze ingredients. stir and set aside.pour in to prepared pan. smooth the top. (the batter is thick.) bake 45 minutes to an hour or until a cake tester inserted in to the middle comes out clean. remove the finished cake from the oven and let stand a few minutes. invert on to a foil lined plate. brush the glaze over the warm cake. let stand until cool.© 2012 fresh approach cooking______________________________________© 2012 rachael at "fresh approach cooking" http://www.freshcatering.blogspot.com follow me on twitter @chickswkniveslabels: dessert, vegetarian

triple truffle mushroom arancini

.to make arancini you first must have left-over risotto.but honestly – who has such a thing? leftover risotto?  ha! but even if one does – who suddenly thinks to fry it instead of re-heating it? oh, wait, i know! i know! (hand shoots up in to air)  me. i had left over risotto and i fried it. that’s sort of what i do. i guess. i cook, i eat, repeat.  anyway… it’s been a long time since i’ve posted on this site. not for lack of cooking, or photographing, but just from lack of…um…posting.  ha! but here i am. posting. i think i was motivated to do so because i am attending something called blogger prom this upcoming week and part of me realized i don’t exactly qualify  to be there unless i am a blogger…so i thought i might as well hop to it. (though in actuality, i’m not even going as a blogger, i’m going as a guest of one of the prom committee members. insert confused snickers here.) so here you go my peaches, my loves… a simple recipe (well, no, that isn’t true at all…it’s a bit complex. not in a top chef kind of way, but still…) for you to make at home. and i do hope you will. so try this my peaches, and taste the joy.   2 cups day old mushroom risotto (porcini mushroom, if you can)3 ounces brie with truffles (or, not, your call)2 eggs1 ounce water1 cup flour3 cups panko breadcrumbs3 cups vegetable oiltruffle salt to taste1 small black truffle, shaved (domestic is realistic.)½ cup mayonnaise (home-made is best!)white truffle buttersilver dust (available from high end pastry supply shops)chivesput the truffle butter on a plate.slice your chives on the bias. form the risotto in to balls with a pinch of the brie in the center. (if you dampen your hands before doing this, it works better.) pour the mayo in to a small squeeze bottle. stir together the eggs and water in a small bowl. place the flour in another bowl and the breadcrumbs in a third bowl. in a deep sauce pan heat the oil over medium high heat to 350f. dip each ball of rice in to the flour, then egg, then panko. fry until crispy. remove from oil and place on a cooling rack. sprinkle with truffle salt immediately. when cool enough to handle, inject the balls with a small squirt of mayo.  rub the mayo insertion point on the truffle butter. top with a slice of black truffle that has also passed over the truffle butter. (this helps it stick) dip a dry paint brush in to the silver dust. position the brush over an arancini and knock gently to coat. top with a slice of chive and serve.>makes about 20 arancini.© 2010 fresh approach cooking______________________________________© 2010 rachael at "fresh approach cooking" http://www.freshcatering.blogspot.com if you are not reading this at the aforementioned url or in your rss feed, the site you are looking at are violating my copyright. and that's rude.arancini means little oranges.i've been bloggin' so long, turns out, i've done something like this before...check it out!follow me on twitter most commercial truffle oils are flavored with synthetic compounds such as 2,4-dithiapentane, one of many molecules that give italian white truffles their distinctive aroma.labels: appetizer, vegetarian
