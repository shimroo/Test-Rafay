best of turkey



                                we just came back from the best of turkey trip.
                                what an amazing experience.
                                
                                    they said they are the biggest museum in the world, and probably they are.
                                    every place we were, we learned about the history behind it,
                                    as our guide, isa was very knowledgeable of his culture and country.
                                    the driver was always helpful and courteous.
                                    the only down part is that it was too short.
                                    definitely going back to build and share more amazing experiences.
