our solutions


 

live sports production

live sports productions are among the most demanding in the media industry. they require a variety of high-quality signal sources, including uhd/hdr and wcg formats, to ensure the main production meets the highest standards. visit the live sports solution page


news production

in news production, the extensive use of led walls in studios and the potential interference from pixel structures impose stringent requirements on camera performance. these cameras must be capable of handling complex lighting and display environments without compromising image quality.visit the news production solutions page


live events

in live event production, the absence of recurring workflows and the ever-changing production conditions present unique challenges. each event comes with its own set of requirements, making it difficult to predict and control lighting conditions and other critical factors.visit the live events solution page


government, corporate and education

for productions by government, corporate, and educational institutions, the production conditions are typically consistent and well-defined. however, shooting conditions, especially scene lighting, are often not optimized for television productions.visit the government, corporate and education solution page


esports
in e-sports productions, a diverse mix of cameras with varying video standards and limited control options creates significant challenges in image alignment. these productions are frequently held in diverse locations where traditional television infrastructure is often lacking.visit the esport solution page


house of worship
how productions frequently face suboptimal lighting conditions and are often managed by personnel who lack professional training. to address these challenges effectively, it is crucial to use cameras designed to perform well under difficult lighting conditions.visit the house of worship solution page


rental and staging
for rental and staging applications, it is crucial that production equipment adapts to the diverse and ever-changing requirements of each rental customer. to optimize investment and maximize flexibility, equipping production gear with easily deployable, user-friendly software options is highly advantageous.visit the rental and staging solution page
