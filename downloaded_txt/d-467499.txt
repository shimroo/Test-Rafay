about us 



in 1956, john sobeck first experienced a totally new process of preparing and cooking chicken. the second he tasted it, he knew he could make something with this new technology. on june 6, 1956, after only 41 days of construction, john and iola opened their first chicken shack in royal oak, michigan. their customers craved the food so much that the sobeck’s couldn’t keep up with demand and had to purchase more equipment just to handle their expanding business!
over sixty years later, and four generations strong, the sobeck family is still working hard to serve to our fans the best tasting food in america and continue john and iola’s legacy of bringing people together one plate at a time.
