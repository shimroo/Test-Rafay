as time goes by….





as time goes by….
we are over half way thru
february already… but at least we finally got some snow.  so i have been shoveling the deck while the
king has been plowing our driveway as well as one of our neighbors.  better than sitting around doing
nothing.  we have only been getting an
inch and half or so.
we have stepped it up in
life… tv wise .. that is .. over the weekend.. our daughter and her other half
came over and installed our new tv.. 
have i said before that i hate electronics..   still fighting it out  trying to figure how to operate the dang
thing.. this one has no numbers on it. so you have to go to the guide. which
that isn’t bad. but the antenna part is a .. pard my french..  a bitch.. i have got the channels down
loaded.. took a while. but i got it done.. 
and got about 34 channels..  some
are repeats. we have air antenna..  but
finding the damn antenna guide has drove me nuts..  and my guru is busy so can’t get her to show
me a step by step  way to get there from
the regular guide.   sunday night i accidentally..
got it..  but couldn’t get back to it
after i had hit the wrong button. 
so i tried monday afternoon..
and after fighting for an hour.  turning
it off in frustration.. and then going back and once again..   i accidentally again.  got it.. 
this time i didn’t hit any other buttons..   got to figure out what to do to find it
again.. in case the king goes to the other guide..  i hate electronics.. i guess i already said
that..  but any way we went from a 45
inch to a 85 inch. got a heck of a buy .. 
but the king loves it.. came
with a free something other..  that gave
him the ulimate western channel.. he is in hog heave with that one and the
other which is outlaw channel..    oh
well, he watches more television than i do. i have a short attention span, as i
can think of other things i could be doing..

 i can’t believe i did that…  the chicken killer 





i
can’t believe i did that…
the
chicken killer  
as
i was laying there thinking..  as i do
from time to time.. when i should be sleeping.. something from the past came up
to mind.  it was how i learn how to kill
chickens..  to eat that is..  not for fun.
my
first chicken i was involved with killing was at the age of about 5 or 6.  i was down at my grandfather’s house, down
the road from us.  he and i got along
great..  he used to hold me up so i could
get grapes from his arbor… he had a huge wooden frame, as you came out of the
back door.  on it was grapes.. the grapes
themselves hung down thru the slates. while the vines were mostly above the
slates.  so grandpa use to hold me up, so
i could get a handful.. don’t know what he and gladys did with the grapes.  don’t remember him making wine.. maybe she
made jam.  but this is getting away from
the story of the lesson on how to kill a chicken for dinner.  
see
he took me out to the chicken pen.. he picked out a rooster.  then we went to the side yard.. he had a
small piece of wood there.. and he leaned the roosters neck across it. but
first he drew a line in the dirt on the other side of the stick.  he said.. now watch this.. so you will know
how to do this when you are older.  as he
drew the line, and laid the rooster neck over the stick and his beak in the
dirt line…  the rooster calmed down and
did not move.  grandpa picked up the
hatchet and came down on the neck.  dead
chicken..  and the shocking part is.. at
the age of 5 or 6, i was not horrified by that.. it was just getting a chicken
for dinner.. wow.. and the other shocking part is ..  i remember this my whole life.. and used it
when i was married and raising chickens 35 years later. 
my
next conquest of chicken killing was when i was about 10. mom use to order baby
chicks.. the post office would call the day before..  so that mom would be ready the next
day..  down in our basement..  dad had built a metal round hoop, that was about
10 feet and about a foot or two high.. it was filled up with wood
shavings.  there was a hood with a light
bulb in the center.. that went over about 3 feet to this hoop.  when the postman drove up.. he would hand mom
a box about 3 foot square and about 6 inches tall..  that you could hear the baby chick
chirping.  i would run ahead of her to
the back door,  opening doors as we went
in the house, and down the stairs to the basement…  and over to the hoop.  i would hold the hood out of the way..  (it was hanging from the rafters with baling
wire.  mom would put the box down on the
shavings, and open it.. and out flowed about 40 or so yellow baby chicks.  she always got leghorns.   it was my brothers and mine job to put feed
it the feeder and water in the water jars that automatically flowed for them to
drink… after about 3 or 4 weeks, they would be big enough to take out side to
the chicken house.  then several weeks
later.. it was k day..  killing the
chickens..  dad would get a fire going in
a pit he would build out of dirt and rocks. with wood inside. after the fire
was going well, he would put a huge pot of water on it..  when the water was close to boil, he would
round up the chickens that we were going to kill.  we killed about 20 of them at a time.. usually
twice in one month.. keeping the others for laying hens.  the routine was.. dad would chop off the
head.. and let them run around until they stopped.  then my brother would grab the chicken and
bring it back to my dad, who held on to the chicken by its legs.. and then dunk
it in to the water..   after a little
bit, he would pull it out and give it to my brother who brought it in to the
shed where my mother and i were .. we had thin rope hanging down from the rafters..  he would hand it to my mother or me, which
ever one of us was ready..  and we would
tie the chicken up by its legs.. with the rope, and then start rubbing off the
feathers that came off easy with the water still hot on them..  then the hard part.. the tiny
pinfeathers..  one after another.. as
soon as one of use was getting close to being done.. we would yell out.. ok..
and dad would do another one.. until we were done with 20 chickens..  our part was to get all the feathers off of
it..  split the body down from neck to
butt..  pull out the guts and throw them
in the pot near by..  mom would boil them
in the pot after we were done and made dog and cat food from them.  then we take them into the kitchen and finish
clean up of them.. taking the feet off and etc.   we did this for years…  so when i had a family .. i knew what to do. 
when
marv and i lived in ellensburg.. we added rabbits to that bunch..  that was not my idea..  but marv figured it was another meat for us..
besides chicken and deer.   marv did the
slaughter part on them..  i did pull the
hide off.. and i process it by washing them in an old wringer wash machine.. i
would put rock salt rub on the inside of the hide and let it dry in the sun..
the plan was to make gloves out of them..  
we had some siamese rabbits that look like the color of a cat..  and they came out nice. don’t know why i
never did anything with them..  i saw a
way to do them in a book series that i owned call foxfire.. it was a book series
that some school teacher had his students interview their parents and grandparents
in the ozarks.  i do remember one of my
son’s taking over the slaughter part…  i
just couldn’t do that..   we had a couple
that were pets, they hung out with the cats.. 
even coming into the house and sleeping with the cats.. and when the
cats went outside to go to the bathroom the two rabbits did too.   rarely ever messing in the house.  i did not tan the hides while we lived in
vay..  don’t know why. guess because i
never used the other ones.  gave them
away to someone else who was going to do gloves. 
but
looking back at that..   it is hard to
believe.. that i did that..  just you do
things you had to do, had to get it done…. 
never figured out that i had any other choice..  i think part of the rabbit deal fell thru
when my youngest daughter figured out it wasn’t chicken she was eating..and
wanted to see the wings first before she ate any. lol..

holy cow, ........it is cold….





holy
cow it is cold…. 
the
rest of the nation has been cold all winter.. and to be honest.. we usually
have it cold as well.  but we have been
getting away with fair temps..  meaning
mostly mid 30’s.. even a couple low 40’s.. 
and usually about the 2nd week of january we have a deep
freeze.  but this year..  we have little snow to go with the mild
temps. 
but
while january went out like a lamb.. february has made up for it.. we have had
snow several times..  up to a foot (while
that too is not much for us) and now we are going to the 0  and hit to below 0 for a couple of days..  i even found my longjohns..  haven’t wore those for years..  in fact i kind of wondered if they were going
to fit.  so it is opening up the
cupboards below the sinks..  turn the
faucets on to a mild drip..   and
snuggling another blanket, please.  i think
even the dog will be under the covers tonight.

another day being just me…





 another day being just me… 
 i looked in the mirror to
see, and  what do i see?
i see an old lady who is me.. 
my father once said as he
left his bathroom..  i am so tired of that old man who keeps hogging the mirror.  i can’t see me any more. as he takes over the
whole mirror. will i ever get to see me anymore?  and we laughed.   dad was 82 at the time.(1994)   and i will be 85 this year.  and now i see what he meant as i, too, have
another person hogging my mirror.  
as i looked at the old lady,
i told her … i don’t recognize you
anymore.   no wonder i don’t look in
the mirror  anymore…
i whisk in and out..   brushing my teeth…. wash my face and look up to see for sure i
got it all washed.   paying little
attention to that old lady called me..

but today.  i stopped and really looked.  i could not believe how old  i looked …who was looking at the me of now. 
as i looked i could see the
real me..  i told god, i didn’t know what his plan was..
but  i sure would like to see my 5th
generation, that is arriving this summer.. 
before i met up with him.  but
what ever his plan is.. is ok with  me. 
i told him a few other things
on my mind.. that is just between he and i.. and thanked him for another
day…  just to be me.

hang on to your hats …





hang
on to your hats ….
we are due
some heavy winds today.. and also some more snow.. then add drop of temps for
us..  add that phase i don’t care for..
wind chill
factor.. making it -0…    see wind chill
factor translate to me….as… damn cold..  
guess
mother nature is running late this year. as we usually have a big snow storms
in january.  and we had little to
nothing.. a few inches here and there.. 
and then warm up and rain.. and back to brown grass again.. 
seems the
rest of the country especially down south.. 
it was been winter since christmas.. 
in fact there were places that had a foot of snow … who had not seen
snow for years..  10 to 20 years… now
they are going to get 70 to 80 degrees.. 
california
who had the huge fire..  actually still
have the fire.. and now warming up, raining.. 
do we hear mud slides? 
talk about
a messed up year for weather..  don’t
know if that is the climate change they are talking about..  or what we older ones call the 20 year
sessions..  that is where a horrible
weather condition shows up every 20 years.. 

so those of
you in this weather pattern..  hang on to
your hat..
guess that
could be said about our government with the changes that are said then taken
back .. temporary.. or what ever..

we are on the count down… 33 days and counting





we
are on the count down… 33 days and counting
well, i am
actually going to do it..   20 years is
enough.. the only thing that scares me is.. if and i will.. quit writing the
blog… will i increase my chances of dementia.. they say the inactive brain
works.. brings it on faster..  now i have
already notice some dumb slip ups.. but i keep telling myself, it is just old
age.. after all the 84 year old brain doesn’t keep up as well as …say the 60
year old.  or even the 70 year old.
i even
thought of ending this one next month.. on schedule that i set.. and start a
new one..  but a one of not
opinions....  when i think of it..   i wanted to call it … this is our america…   i almost put down this is my america.. but
it isn’t just mine.. it is ours..   one
that we all remember.. and there is still some of it out there.   
i would put
in it.. different times and stories about people who don’t get in the news
often..  because out there.. there is
still america..
and real americans..  
they are
the ones who harnessed up their mules and loaded up supplies to take up into
the hills of north america, after the
hurricane..  no one told them to do it..
they just saw a need..  maybe one of
their friends lived up there in that area..  and then they figured they would try to help
out all of the neighbors.   that is our america.. and
thank god it is still alive and well. 
we see it
in all kinds of disasters…  canadians who
drove down to california..
and mexican firefighters who left mexico to help out..and our men and
women went there to help in disasters… 
will they be still wanting to come with our new administration
tarriffing them?  what about all the
different states who sent men and equipment to california and after 3 week are just starting
to head home.?  that is our america..

so you see,
that is what i have in mind..  don’t know
if i can find enough stories..  really
would love to hear about some local..  in
our own little towns…  
but we will
see..  give me a few weeks after i finish
this one.. and i might think about doing it.. 
but got to
tell you..  i am kind of glad that i am
quitting..  as i have used this form, for
my soap box from time to time..  when
ever someone or government gives us the shaft.. 
i put in my two cents worth..  and
with the way our country is going .. i know i would not be able to keep my
mouth shut..  it is killing me that this
government and the man who 62% was (i think that is what it was) voted in to
lead us.. is giving the shaft to our local ally’s..   how can we just in general.. say this to canada?  mexico?   sure there has been the border problems..
mostly from mexico..  but were there no meetings?  just threats.. some say bluffing..  i don’t know.. but i do not like it. these
are the countries that        would have
stood up for us… in the world..  who have
stood by us.. man for man in foreign lands for over 100 years.. to slap them in
the face.. and say you are doing it my way or the highway..  i just can’t hack it.. i believe in
friendship, i believe that you can sit down and talk about differences..  and maybe have to compromise on all
sides.   to split us up..  the americas.. not a good thing.  and how much commerce will be lost if canada decides to sell the oil to russia and a
few others..   what if mexico follows canada..  this is not the time to pee on your friends
shoes….folks.   but that is just my own
opinion..  
see .. what
i mean..  that i won’t be able to keep my
opinion to myself?  yep, it is getting
time to hang up the shoes.  and pick up
my hat.. and bide you all good bye.. 20 years is enough.

this i am finding out is true.. 





this i am finding
out is true.. 
have come to realize that if
you have a facebook page.. you are not in charge of it..   in other words..   my page.. 
my rules..
got accused of not letting
others opinions, that mine are the only ones that i allowed.. i am a real
badass if i say i don’t want them to comment on mine..  seems the only way i can do that…  is if i defriend that person..  but how do you do that.. when it is your own
kid?   who has blown up my page time and
time
i taught my kids to stand up
for what they believe.. just be sure the have your facts correct..   to do the research to make that so, before
you stand up..   never dreaming it would
come back to bite me.  respect for ones
parent goes out the window.. 
had it been one time.. or
even one remark about how that child did not believe as i do..  i could handle.. but to have over 20
remarks.. some other joining in.  on both
sides..  is a bit too much for me.. so i
have deleted post time and time again.. 
at least 20 in the past 9 years..  
in case you haven’t figure it out.. 
and big  disagreement is
politics..   the kid…love trump..   and those who know me, know i have no
respect for that person..  trump.  did not like him, the first time
around..  figured he was history after
the jan. 6 deal..  and then insulting the
black and the port ricans and women.. 
but blown away..  they voted for
him.. why i don’t know..   but the people
have spoken..  so be it..  but i still think i have the right to say as
i believe.. with out being criticized. 
now i know why my
parents..  in the 1940 to 1980’s said two
subject never to discuss..    politic and
religions..  oh god. 
this nation is going to get a
lot worse.. just in the few things he has already started in the first
week..  
i had told my children who
voted for him… that i hope they were right.. that he will be everything they
think he will do and be..  told them i
would be glad to apologize.. if i am wrong.. 
but this week has been a dozy.  
when a minister ask for compassion and kindness to be threaten by his
words and followers..   to have neighbors
encourage to turn in their long time neighbors to ice..  
to talk about how he is going
to fix it so he can run again..  
big sigh…  lord god,, please please watch over our
nation.  
if the can do this much in a
week..  god help us this coming 4 years. 
oh..  and don’t hang up on your kids… they don’t
take that well..

fast moving, slow winter..





fast moving, slow winter..
here we are in the down hill
side of january already.  yet is seems
like day to day, it is moving slowly.. 
but i think most of that is me.  i
find my gait is slower..  even my balance
isn’t 100%. i have not fallen yet..   but
i notice i am not as steady as i use to be. 

if i could find a tia chi
class..  i think i would be interested it
in. i heard it is great for regaining your balance as a senior citizen.  
i have found one plus to
life.. in a conversation about nerve pain and etc.. i learn that if one takes
vit. d-3..it helps..  i thought of the
pain i have had for over 15 years.. getting worse in the past 5. thought
..  yea right..  that sounds too easy..   but i was at walmart getting some of my
vit.. and i looked at the d-3.. and the price was fairly cheap..  i held it in my hand for a few minutes.. and
then tossed it in the cart.. it was less than $10 and for 30 of them. so i
figured that is cheap enough to give it a try.. if after a month, nothing
happens.  no big deal..  i really did not think it was going to
help. 
well, i will tell you..  it does.  
it really does.  it worked the
first day.  and ever day since.  i have been on it for over 2 weeks.. and it
is still working..   
now i am not going to tell
you that it is the cure all for my leg pains. 
but all this time, i knew it was not bone related.  my husband tried to get me to go to the
chiropractor.. but it is not my bones…  i
kept telling him.. it is some what my muscles or what ever and definitely the
nerves in my legs .. big time. i still have the muscle part.. but i have
figured out that.. is only about 1/3 of the problem..  the nerves is 2/3 of the problem.   i am so much more active..  at least i don’t have to sit and relax for 10
minutes before i start off again..  i
just can’t do distance, because the tendons  or what ever it is in the muscle area.. but
this sure beats what i had.  you might
want to try it.. sure cheap enough.

much ado about nothing..





much ado
about nothing..
that about sums it up for yesterday… and this
year with the frost.. even more so..  no
parade..  
his wife wearing black? is that an omen?   to be fair.. most of these are all pomp and
circumstances.. but this one more so, from what i saw on the news.. 
we watched old shows.. most of them mtv westerns..
and i finished my boring book of 900 pages .. 
i had read 200.. but i finished it today..  (skipped a lot of bs of it )a  book called cecelia…. the english, and in the
1920’s?  and it is written in the wording
of that age .. where they talk funny..  even
skipping to the end part by the time i got thru 300…  it still was boring and stupid.. but it did
kill time.  
so to me the last great day of january 20th..
was in the words of ask not what your country can do for you… as what can you
do for your country!... and if  i have to
tell you who said that..   then you are
too young to understand. 
and what did the lip reader say, that obama said
to bush that made bush laugh?

borrowing from fdr’s day of imfamy speech..





 borrowing from fdr’s day of
imfamy speech..
as i borrow a line from franklin d. roosevelt’s…  from his speech…   this date.. january 20, 2025…  will it be  a date which will live in
infamy -- the united states
  of america for the second time..    or will it be a dud…
already has some bad omens to it..   while it isn’t the first inaugural that has
been done inside..  it won’t be the grand
outside in front of god and everyone.. 
for the crowd to see.. as this man would like.  but weather seems to take and make its own
mind up..  
so far.. 
the parade is on hold, unless they come up with something..  again .. 
not what the new pres. would like as he like pomp and
circumstances.  if he had his way, he
would have the military there with all their hardware, as china, north korea
and russia
do..  but it is what it is..   
i won’t be watching.. i have seen enough of these
circuses.. in my 84 years..  so i will
watch it on the nightly news the short verse, 
as they will have it on to watch over the course of the day..  the king 
can stay away from watching them, we have enough channels to pick from
that won’t have it on....   i will be
reading my book of 900 pages..  200 down
and 700 more to go..
the scary part is .. what is done in
private..  or they might have a camera
man or two..  that is the signing of the
presidential pardons and executive orders.. of which there is a report of their
being close to 100 that they say he has to fill out..  he better sign them fast.. as he has the many
balls to go to by 6pm.. 
many americans.. 
waiting for this day to happen. 
it is their greatest joy…   many
americans..  are scared to death of what
will happen for the next 4 years..  and
dread this day… and they aren’t all democrats.. 
most of us older ones.. those 80 and older..  are asking god’s help. and have lived thru
many of un-liked presidents..  some did
not like carter  .. well most
republicans..  some did not like ford,
thought he was a buffoon  and there were
some who thought that kennedy would take his orders from the pope..   and we 80 and more.. made it thru those
time..   and i am sure we will make it
thru this time as well.  the main part is
praying the nut cases who think the only way to solve anything..  is with 
gun, will cool their jets..
so those who meet this day with joy..   i hope it is a good day for you..   for the rest of us..  we hope and pray for peace and
compassion..  and pray for the next 4
years..  the  united states of america…. is still
all in one piece.
with that many billionaires helping trump, it
isn’t going to be good for the under $65,000 a year earners.  
i suspect there is going to be a lot of deaths
before it is over..  those who are coming
across our borders.. those who fight with the other side of the political
party…  and hopefully not with any
country who thinks this is a good time to take advantage of our country when it
seems to be its lowest point. 
for me..  i
will stay in touch with my god.. may god watch over our country and her
people.. all of her people..
