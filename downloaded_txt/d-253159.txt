the team at glass's have been key partners for us in launching our new, innovative motor finance product. they understood our aims and objectives from the outset and their api-led service is incredibly flexible and really chimes with how we operate. the integration process was seamless and the support has been outstanding.

this site is very useful in my line of work, values cars within seconds searches the country (or local if you prefer) for like for like vehicles, all the details you are likely to need about the vehicles can be found on here. 
bob cousins, desktop motor engineer, wns assistance


"we were delighted to link up with glass's to integrate their new repair estimate platform into our eva engineer management software, and to be the first in the uk to do so. the new repair estimate graphical interface allows an estimate to be completed quickly and easily. the feedback from our existing clients has been very positive for the seamless integration and slick estimating.

glass's were very clear and helpful all the way through the process of developing the integration and we look forward to continuing the partnership for years to come.
