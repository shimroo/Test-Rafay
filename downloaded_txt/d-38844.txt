a “broken” role playing game about police community relations



commissioned by usc games
cards, game box, game pieces, table, cardboard boxes,
a 3 player role-playing board game where each player takes a role of someone at a police
stop: a police officer, the community member they stop, and an observer. the officer and
the community member work to earn each other’s trust through the game’s mechanics.
the officer must stay alive, not make a false arrest or brutalize the community member,
and the community member’s goal is to leave the situation alive. the game created in
response to the rise of police brutality in the us, was play tested with law enforcement,
lawyers. karimi coined the concept “broken game” because as he playtested he
discovered that players began telling their stories of their relations with police while trying
to correct the game’s mechanics. the game is kept “broken" to facilitate this conversation.
