since our humble beginnings in 1971, tierra del sol has evolved into a dynamic and vital organization, guided by the aspirations and gifts of those we serve. we have never lost sight of our mission ‘to empower people with developmental disabilities to fulfill their potential and desire to become productive citizens, who are accepted, included and valued for the contributions they make to the economic, civic, and cultural vitality of the community.’ we are proud to share our associates’ successes through workforce development, college to career, and careers in the arts. each and every day, they are changing the way people think about individuals with disabilities. tierra is no longer a campus. we are paid employees, professional volunteers, artists, and students, who are fully recognized as an integral part of the communities where we live, work, and study. we welcome you to become a part of the tierra family and engage in the incredible work that we do to empower people, regardless of disability, to be fully recognized as neighbors, co-workers, and contributors. join us and join a social movement that gives people with disabilities the life of dignity and purpose that each of us deserve.

chief executive officer
