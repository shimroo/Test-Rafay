respectful insolence (a.k.a. "orac knows")



respectful insolence is a repository for the ramblings of the aforementioned pseudonymous surgeon/scientist concerning medicine and quackery, science and pseudoscience, history and pseudohistory, politics, and anything else that interests him (or pushes his buttons). orac's motto: "a statement of fact cannot be insolent." (ok, maybe it can be just a little bit insolent.)

it's aliiiiiive!


yes, everyone, scienceblogs  is back up and running. that means respectful insolence at scienceblogs is up and running again, too. consequently, i'm disabling comments again on this blog and putting it back into mothballs as an archive site. orac's home will be once again at respectful insolence at scienceblogs. it was fun resurrecting the old blog for a couple of days, but it's time to go back to where everyone knows where to find me: http://scienceblogs.com/insolence or http://www.respectfulinsolence.net  (also .com). who knows, if scienceblogs ever goes down again or gets fed up with me and gives me the boot, this blog may live again.

orac



orac is but a humble pseudonymous surgeon/scientist with an ego just big enough to delude himself that someone, somewhere might actually give a rodent's posterior about his miscellaneous verbal meanderings, but just barely small enough to admit to himself that few will. that orac has chosen his pseudonym based on a rather cranky and arrogant computer shaped like a clear box of blinking lights from an old british sf show whose special effects were renowned for their early 1980's bbc/doctor who-style low budget look, but whose stories nonetheless resulted in some of the best, most innovative science fiction for television ever produced, should tell you nearly all that you need to know about orac. (that, and the length of the preceding sentence.) orac tries to keep his insolence respectful, but admittedly sometimes fails in the cases of obvious quackery and pseudoscience, attacks on him, very poor critical thinking skills, bigotry, and just general plain stupidity.
