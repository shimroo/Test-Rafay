i can't even come up with words to thank you enough for organizing this trip to oaxaca for all of us! it was simply amazing. i'll be in "withdrawals" for days to come as the wonderful memories swirl around with all of the feelings and tastes and sounds and visuals of mexico, and of new friends made there. the "finale" dinner was out of this world! you made all of that happen; thank you so much!  ...

my wife and i were at your red chile class with  logan and his wife. i just wanted to say that my wife and i made your bowl of red today from the recipe you sent with us and it was absolutely phenomenal! i just wanted to say thank you once again for a great experience and an amazing dish!   best regards, carl williamsgreen and red chile favorites, january 6, 2022


























i attended the week long class two weeks ago and am still amazed at all i learned, the fun i had, the richness of the history jane shared with us and the amazing delicious, beautiful dishes we made. i had decided to come to the school to celebrate my recent retirement and if all the choices in the world were laid before me, i could not have chosen better! thank you jane for everything!
debbie summers weeklong class - all sessions march 7 - 11, 2022



























oaxaca trip extraordinaire ! we just returned from what will be one of our favorite experiences. jane had everything well organized, with considerate and educated drivers, comfortable hotel, and 3 unique hands-on cooking experiences. we loved going to food markets, learning about masa & chocolate, as well as the culture of the area. oaxaca is a very clean, safe city and jane was a delightful hostess!
