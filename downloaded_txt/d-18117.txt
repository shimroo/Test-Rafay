the fcca is a not-for-profit trade organization composed of 23 member cruise lines operating nearly 200 vessels in floridian, caribbean and latin american waters. created in 1972, the fcca’s mandate is to provide a forum for discussion on  tourism development, ports, safety, security and other cruise industry issues. by fostering an understanding of the cruise industry and its operating practices, the fcca seeks to build cooperative relationships with its partner destinations and to develop productive bilateral partnerships with every sector. the fcca works with governments, ports and all private/public sector representatives to maximize cruise passenger, cruise line and cruise line employee spending, as well as enhancing the destination experience and the amount of cruise passengers returning as stay-over visitors.
