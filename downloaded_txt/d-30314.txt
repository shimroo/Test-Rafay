while there are many fine 
accommodations for vacation lodging you may want 
to consider

timeshare resales as they offer more 
exclusive places to stay. it is also much easier 
to

sell timeshare you buy on the resale market 
verses ones bought from resorts directly that 
carry a much higher entry cost.

cabin rentals, real estate, home builders, automobile dealers
