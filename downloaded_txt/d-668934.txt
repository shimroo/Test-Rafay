reply to...  mjengo story .  yes... those flat chapos with no salt or sugar.  those big hard hands callous and rough.  those sweaty breasts; that money that smells like breasts and god forbid! ass!!.  that dad that was crashed to smithereens when coming drunk and blind from waragi/methanol/ethanol mix.  the other dad who died of cholera and other who just ran to shags, his last words... "fuck it".   those shoes ... sole-less and usually gaping.... and those dusty faces exposed to the unforgiving brunt of the african sun ..  those parched lips... holding those gaps of missing teeth.... those guys, are what? happy with their lives? really? this is not just ironic! it is evil.  as you caress the maasai-beaded steering of your old-school limited edition e class and massage your nuts in your gucci underpants... picking out the bits of nyama choma from kenyatta market with wooden tooth picks. and as the remaining strands of your balding head dance to the beat of your a/c in that ja...

life goes on...







by




cosmic leap







april 10, 2006









the rain pours on and i stare at the ceiling in the house, trying to forget yet another stupid heart break… years have gone by as fast as minutes and over time. dreams have turned into memories, some good; some bad, other dreams have just been shelved away and forgotten. time flies by ever so faithfully and consistently. if only we were like time… doing what we are meant to do instead of getting lost in frivolous activity. if only we were so reliable… but then life will be boring, wouldn’t it? it is the risks and uncertainties that make us laugh, cry, hope and strive. i look at the rain against the window. i feel like my tears are flowing at the same pace, but nothing matters now… if only i... (sniff)... no more regrets ... it is over… again… it is over again. i just don't seem to learn... in fact, the world seems to promises yet another string of misadventures. i look at the screen of the phone and i envy it… so unemotional… just buzzing away. i must have pressed the speed dial on...

and paul comes aboard







by

april 02, 2006









after all the controversy from paul's last  post,  i've spent the whole evening trying to convince him to grow a pair and post for himself. his excuse was that he's too busy writing his own books and working on some "indie" movies.  i told him that this blog will be the perfect way for him to sell himself to a new group of people. well.. a few beers later and after promising him five young kenyan virgins as gifts,  he's agreed to join us. so let's all welcome paul "the contrarian".  he's sure to inject a lot more spice  into this blog ( god knows i can't do it! ) for a taste of the controversy from the last post,  you'll want to check out the following: au lait:  so you want a slut in bed? sexoteric: how to make a woman do anything in bed digg personally,  i've noticed a rather 50-50 reaction though women seem to be more open minded, in general, than guys.  i found it sad to see that so many married folk absolutely cannot imagine ...

how to please a man in bed







by




cosmic leap







march 29, 2006









it is very simple to make a man happy in bed. forward-fast to the time you are actually getting down. 1. be vulgar - this is not an opportune time to use terms like "appendages". profanity is encouraged and you even have a chance to order and command without any worries. 2. inflate his ego - every 2 seconds mentions 2 words. these words have to contain the words "big" and  "very".  this can only be interrupted with loud gasps of air, moaning and groaning. 3. do not engage in distracting discussion. e.g. do not ask questions like "when do you think you will get that promotion?" at this time. and don't get tempted to do "when do we get married?" even if the going is good. 4. have all the toys and gadgets at arms length. this is a time for removing what's left( if any...) of the lingerie not putting it on. 5. feel and act sexy. be proud, confident and sure of yourself. 6. look jovial and excited. keen and like you are having the be...

diy abortions







by


nicholas ochiel






march 26, 2006









i'm not quite sure where i stand with regards to abortion. i'm still trying to figure out  why the thought or mention of it forces chills down my spine, a lump into my throat and painful tears into my eyes. my father has often stated  that once a woman decides to have an abortion,  she will do anything and everything  to get rid of the child prior to birth.  he therefore advocated for legal and safe abortions to be made available. initially,  i didn't quite understand his argument.  today,  however,  i agree with him.  i was pushed over the cliff by the situation  in south dakota that has prompted women to start considering do-it-yourself abortions !  the potential dangers of this are obvious.  a man can easily identify with the horrors of self-circumcision  which pale in comparison to self-executed abortions. one thing is certain:  women need to be protected whatever they decide. filed under:  serious things

men who cheat sucessfully and repeatedly







by




cosmic leap







march 24, 2006









are smoother and their discourse is finer because it has been tried, tested and stamped a bill of good health their sex is obviously better; they get ideas from various women which they are only too eager to share with their spouses they do not waste trying to gratify their unquenchable need for sex from just their women; their spouses are free and happier. they present a more exciting package since they come with new surprises of tricks and tips they learn and keep learning from various other women. they keep themselves in hot form, physically, mentally or/and otherwise. since there are many judges who are continuously assessing and grading them. they are not jealous since they understand the boredom monotony generates, and in the event their spouses cheat on them in return... they understand. they will not leave their spouses for such an understandable act based on the circumstances. their spouses are free to explore sexual adventures and still know that there is someone to do the se...

yin, yang







by


nicholas ochiel






march 21, 2006









it is a mistake to consider man and woman two separate beings. they are no more than two halves of a single form, two converse hemispheres that fit tightly together to make a perfect whole. they are heaven and earth encapsulated in flesh and blood. it is only that on its way to enter this world, this sphere was shattered apart. what was once the infinity of a perfect globe became two finite surfaces. what was once a duet of sublime harmony became two bizarre solos of unfinished motions, of unresolved discord. so much so, that each one hears in itself only half a melody, and so too it hears in the other. each sees the other and says, "that is broken." feigning wholeness, the two halves wander aimlessly in space alone. until each fragment allows itself to surrender, to admit that it too is broken. only then can it search for the warmth it is missing. for the depth of its own self that was ripped away. for the harmony that will make sense of its song. and in perfect union, two f...
