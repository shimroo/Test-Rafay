divining...tried crowley's divination method for the first time tonight. results were very interesting. i learned a lot, and in reflection, see even more than i did while engaged in the reading. will continue to ponder. i was reading for myself. in the first deal, the ihvh cut, i found the significator in the trouble/loss stack instead of the money stack. however, it was the bottom card in the stack, and i thought perhaps it was due to a hasty cut. i scanned the money stack and found it full of disks, and some specific cards such as cruelty, the prince of cups and particularly the 2 of disks. i re-dealt. this time the significator was in the love/relationships stack. i thought my question was about finances, but i realized that it had as much or more to do with my partner's and my relationship to each other and to our money. i scanned the money stack again, and found it full of wands this time. so i picked up the love/relationships stack, and found, much to my surprise and delight that it was full of disks, and some specific cards such as cruelty, the prince of cups and particularly the 2 of disks. the prince of cups is the taranos card to me, and the 2 of disks card is my partner's card. i dealt twice more into the astrological stacks, finding the significator the first time in the house of leo (creativity/fertility) and the second time in the house of gemini (communication). both of these stacks dealt with the issue of my partner's and my relationship to each other and to money.the last deal was according to the tree of life. i looked for my significator under chokmah, which has seemed to me for sometime to represent me, and there it was, the 2 of swords. of course there was also the prince of cups again, and this time the queen of disks (the court card ruling my partner's card). this draw had an excellent procession of cards, ending with the success of the sun and a reversal of certain obstacles.all in all an interesting read and, more importantly, learning experience. i intend to continue these readings for myself and others on a daily basis until i feel i can use it publicly. i already see how it will aid in psychic development as well.

monsoon updateit has been 11 weeks now, and they are touting this monsoon season as the second most productive on record. the most recent article that i read said it would be really great if this was followed by a productive winter snowfall in the mountains, producing abundant spring runoff. seems like an excellent "order of the day" for our jül ritual in december with snows to commence in january.

i heard autumn enterleaves rattling at my window. autumn entering this 2nd of september. a startling, welcome sound that i have not heard for many years. it has been said that here in oracle we get all four seasons. i'm a believer. desert though it may be, autumn has truly arrived. the wind blows chill this morning. 3 a.m. brought taranos energy surrounding me, waking me, provoking me to thought and action. "...i have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with its mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me."

looking back at midsummerevery year at midsummer, we do a magick working  to taranos  to bring on the summer monsoons.  in the past, we've  tried different strategies but always with  the same results: monsoon starts about three weeks  after the ritual and peters out in a couple of weeks with only sporadic storms after that.  our drought has continued.in the past, some of the things we've tried were 1) appealing to celtic hospitality by making huge offerings to taranos; 2) using sympathetic magick in the form of an anthropomorphic symbology, acting out the part of the god quenching fires and bringing rain, 3) telling the story of taranos' coming to arizona. as i said, the results with these methods were a bit disappointing.this year, i really put my head into it, instead of just my heart. i've been studying magick in a scientific way over the past year and a half or so. this year i was inspired by two of aleister crowley's recommendations -- that of surrounding yourself with correspondences, and that of the formula of invocation being inherent in the god's name.the entire ritual was focused on the magickal end, and became a means to that end through invocation, litany, chants, lore, and correspondences. weeks before the ritual, i created formulae with anagrams of his name, found him a wife with whom to join, and invoked her as well. i discovered many synchronicities, not the least of which was the auspices of the summer triangle and the rare jupiter trine which appeared the night of the ritual.we also employed our own version of the ancient gaulish tradition of rolling a burning wheel downhill into the river to release the summer rains. we passed our "taranos wheel" and everyone put their energy into it. there were 107 people in attendance!the lore was striking -- the story itself was excellent, but with the energy brought by the actors, especially with ben as taranos -- it took on its own magickal energy.the desired outcome singular -- that of overcoming the cosmic determinism in order to exercise our own will -- but the exercise of it was two-fold: the people choosing to overcome fate in order to set forth their own magickal wills, and  the overcoming of the weather status-quo to produce an effective monsoon season.  we became the taranoi, the children of the union of taranos and artaion (the gaulish bear goddess), and we called the storms.the results? it began to rain that very night, and rained every single day for the next two weeks. it gathered strength at that point and returned, storm after storm after storm for more than 6 weeks now. the mountains are covered with green growth, the hillsides glow with new green. everywhere the sonoran has returned to its lush habitat and flora and fauna not seen for many years have surfaced. we have had more rain this year so far than in 23 years. and it continues.we specifically asked also that it not cause damage. i was thinking particularly in the realm of microbursts and windstorms. we have had none of those which are usual for the monsoons here. the wind has remained quiet. there was flood damage, but only the in parts that are overpopulated and underplanned -- go figure.i believe all this is a testament to magick in the new millennium -- magick in the face of unbridled religious fundamentalism and religious war -- magick in a quantum age, where science breaks anew, no longer satisfied with the material answers of the past. i would love to know what has gone through the minds of 70 first timers who attended our midsummer ritual as the rains have poured and poured, and they remember their participation as they cried, "we are the taranoi. we call the storms!"

our own starry skyit was lovely to have the lughnasadh games and ritual on our own property. having a house big enough to accommodate everyone. by the time we get the solarium and the arizona room done, we'll be able to accommodate 60!it will be great to have moon rituals and our own special rituals there. kirk said as they were hallowing the land for its first ritual, he had a vision of hundreds of little nature spirits, wide-eyed, asking, "what is this? who are these people?"hmmm...very interesting in light of what we saw when we first moved in. it was almost as if we were in a spirit crossing; nightly we would see dozens of spirits moving through the house. it has calmed down considerably since we've moved in completely, but kirk's vision gives me pause for thought. it would be interesting to do some psychic research and see what's going on there.having the ritual in the clearing, under such a gorgeous night sky, was very gratifying. twenty-five of the dearest people to me, sharing, honoring the kindreds, hallowing our land.blessings to all who shared in that lovely moment in the otherworld.

rain & other random thoughtswow! it's been 2 months since i posted here -- how time flies when we're havin' fun! the monsoon has been great so far this year; interestingly enough it began on june 24th -- on the same day as our midsummer ritual where the magick working was to produce a more effective monsoon. thus far it is far more productive than in recent years. hmmm...coincidence? i think not! i think that every single one of those 70 new people who joined us at midsummer, many of them brand new to even the concept of magick have to be pondering all of this.i heard someone say today that the night rains are unusual; many times over the past month it has rained all night long. monsoon rains are usually hard, fast rains, coming and going within an hour or two, and usually during the day. the same person went on to stay that there is apparently a low pressure system in new mexico that has stood in place for a week now causing this particular portion of the rain. good to know for future thaumaturgy.it's been lovely to watch our wash fill up and rush like a river, down steppes that look like waterfalls when it's running. beautiful! and, oh, the greening it's bringing. i can almost forget that i'm in the desert. i'll put up a pic that cassie took of our wash during the heavy rains last weekend.::contented sigh::

all in the pantheonhmmmmm...simply amazing! for the last three years, i have been pursued by a little house spirit who calls himself gobiu (gobniu?), and by a bear goddess that i thought till now was artemis. i laughed about mixing pantheons (my primary patrons are gallic). yesterday when i celebrated at the grove, i used all gallic gods, except for artemis. then today, i discover this: "there is a statue of a seated goddess with a bear, artio, found in muri near berne, with a latin inscription deae artioni livinia sabillina, suggesting a gaulish artiyon- bear goddess."in the same article it says, "the most notable inscription found in helvetic parts is the berne zinc tablet, inscribed and apparently dedicated to gobannus, the gallo-roman god of smithcraft." who, i might add, is equated in other sources with celtic gobniu.very interesting -- since smithing has been of more than mild interest to me lately. more on that later. so, it's all coming together in the same pantheon. i'm terribly pleased.

the 24th aethyrmy attempt to scry the 24th aethyr was not successful because i was too tired. instead of waiting and repeating the experiment like i did last time, i went ahead and read crowley's vision, hoping that some of the random images i had received would suffice. it did succeed, perhaps in one strange way which i will record below, but crowley's images were very rich and colorful, and i'm sure i would have been able to tap into them if i had been in a better frame of mind. lesson learned: don't attempt when tired.results:i wrote the names of the aethyr (nia) and the governors (orcamir, chialps, soageel), and had two impressions before i banished or called: one of puffs of incense smoke, and one of a dark metallic blue alligator.i did the star ruby and did the call of the thirty aethyrs; then i laid back. all throughout, i really didn't get any scenarios such as i usually do, just impressions. i can't begin to remember them all, but i will put down what i can recall. the first image was of a large, ornate stone wheel with spokes and a hub. the hub was decorated with a seed and floral pattern. as i began to call the name of the first governor, i saw a woman's face with flying, wavy blonde hair, but she turned into something else that i can not now recall.i called the second governor, and i saw quite distinctly something like the infant of prague figure of christ, with long gown and crown, turning back and forth. as i continued to call its name and move toward it, i could see it was like a puppet on someone's arm.these are the only images i can recall and thus all that i can record.the only interesting synchronicity with crowley's vision is that the voice said to him, "close up the book of the recorder...for i am arisen, o my fair one, and there is no more need of all these things."i shall ponder this as a message for myself. there were certain portions of crowley's vision which seemed to speak directly to something in my life, but not as a part of my scrying. i will record that part later in a comment to this entry.

gnostici feel the need to clarify my use of the word gnostic because i really don't fit into the classic definition of a gnostic which is usually very dualistic, black and white, good and evil oriented. i use the words "gnostic druid" to describe the fusion of my religious, philosophical, and magickal paths. it's the synthesis of my understanding, the sum total of my being, yet words are so very limiting because they mean different things to different people.i use gnostic because i'm a baptised, confirmed member of the egc -- the ecclesia gnostica catholica. one can glean something of my use of the word gnostic from my early livejournal entries on gnosis. many gnostics practice a religion which is simply a heretical form of christianity. while the egc is the formal religious vehicle of the magickal order to which i belong, it is anything but "church." what it truly is must be discovered by the participant.      i love the way the experiences of both druidry and cm/egc have complemented each other in my experience, making each one richer. frequently i have "aha!" encounters because one experience informs the other, thus making my comprehension of both more lavish and fruitful.am i gnostic or am i druid? i stand between the worlds: i am both/and; neither/nor.

the cry of the 25th aethyr called vtii scryed on my own for the first time tonight. it went rather strangely, yet i had success in more ways than one. i think of how the exercise has changed me from that first night six weeks ago until now. the first couple of sessions were like, "oh, this is a cool exercise," but i didn't really see where we were going with it. by the third week i started seeing some synchronicity; then the fourth and fifth weeks brought forth some more profound discoveries.but tonight really changed things; i started seeing a personal lesson in the session. before tonight, i was all gung-ho, thinking that the benefit from the exercises must come upon completing all 30 aethyrs; so i thought i'd start doing at least one a day, maybe two or three a day on the days when i had time. but tonight was an epiphany; it was almost like an initiatory experience, and i realized that each one must be savored -- the depths must be plumbed with each one. i must take the time to process each fully before moving on to the next one.i had to try twice tonight. the first time was early in the evening. i banished, using the star ruby and the lbrp, and then read the enochian call. i set my timer for 20 minutes and lay back on the futon. after a couple of minutes, i started seeing an ocean wave. i watched it for a few seconds, but then it disappeared. my thoughts kept wandering. i felt so distracted. random images came, but nothing seemingly coherent. after a while, i became restless. by the time the timer went off and i rang the bell, i was feeling positively desultory. all i could remember at that moment was a green spiral design i had seen earlier in the day on a minoan vessel in one of mark's books which had floated in and out of the meditation. i decided i was just too tired, so i slept.i woke up a little after midnight. i felt the aura of the room, and decided the banishing was still holding, so i decided to read the call in english this time, and to proceed with the meditation. then i began to chant the name of the first governor: mirzind. it was much different this time. i immediately was drawn to look at a small black square with a reverse negative of a tree, like a world-tree, framed in fuschia. the tree grew, and i was immediately drawn into a scene where a man was hobbling a bull to the tree with a rope. it was an image i had seen earlier in the day, while looking through mark's books on knossos and mycenae. at first i wanted to reject that scene, thinking it was memory instead of vision, but then i remembered much synchronicity from before, and knew i could have been drawn to that image because it had something to do with crowley's vision. so i relaxed and continued to watch. the man, dressed all in black, detached himself from the scene as i continued to chant the name; then he was sitting cross-legged in a shaft of light, surrounded by darkness, and playing a lap harp or a lyre.suddenly, inside the frame of the instrument, it became a screen which i looked into and saw the hordes which he commands as governor of vti. i stood then, and said, "these are the hordes of my own mind which i can command." at that the young man stood, tucking his harp under his arm and walked off into the darkness. not much more seemed to happen after that. more random images, one of a sower, one of a wolf with dripping fangs in a challenging stance.after the time was up and i started to write everything down, more images from the first session that evening, as well as other images from the second time came to me. i remembered seeing something that looked like woven straw, dyed indigo and olive. i could not see the object, just a close up of the weave.  i also remembered more detail about the sower, that he was the same young man dressed in all black, walking backwards, casting black seed before him. i remember the words coming to my mind, "and some seed fell on good soil and sprang up, and some fell on rocky soil and some on sandy soil..." but i suddenly became aware that i was trying to sort of lead the scene with my words. when i forced myself to relax and let it flow, the sower disappeared.after i finished recording everything, i read crowley's vision. at first i thought that it wasn't terribly significant because the only things i had seen the same as crowley was the olive color, the bull, and the sower, with the sower probably the most significant. but as i wrote down what crowley had seen that matched up with mine, i began to see more and more significance, and kept going back further and further to catch the drift of his vision. this seems to be the significant passage: "why are thou there that art here? hast thou not the sign of the number, and the seal of the name, and the ring of the eye? thou wilt not." to which crowley replies, "i am a creature of earth and ye would have me swim."to which the voice replies, "thy fear is known, thy ignorance is known, but thou art nothing in this matter. "shall the grain which is cast into the earth by the hand of the sower debate within itself, say, i am oats or barley? bond-slave of the curse, we give nothing; we take all. be thou content. that which thou art, thou art. be content."i believe here, crowley was coming to understand that he had been chosen, by fate, perhaps, as a major cog in a giant wheel, given great gifts, but that he needed to relax, to trust, and not to fear, that his purpose would be met out in him without his interference. that brought me to think of the portion of my vision where i stood up after peering into the lyre and seeing the hordes, where i said, "these are the hordes of my own mind which i can command." i remembered how, after the first call, i had felt my heart chakra completely opened, ready to receive. i believe this is a message to me, first for myself, and then to pass on to others as they embrace death or approach the end of their lives, that there are purposes met out in each of us that we do not control, nor possibly even see or sense. we need simply to know that those purposes were met out in us by the very act of living.
