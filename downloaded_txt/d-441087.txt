the public space for the 
		environmental library fund collection, the
		
aquarium 
		steampunk reading room in norwalk, connecticut closed. there has been some thin out, 
		but the most important material for the continuation of our work has returned to my home in weston. 
		visitors are welcome by appointment. 
for many years, all the 
      separate projects hosted on this website were promoted as individual, 
      unconnected (some would claim disconnected) entities. it has taken time to bring them all together so that the sum of their parts may 
      synergize to be understood as elements of a singular vision.
rather than putting 
		everything on this portal, in the past we opted instead to market each 
		topic 
		on its own merit, to different communities. today it has 
		morphed into a much more ubiquitous entry 
      point to all things hosted on this website. we now provide description of their no longer mutually exclusive functions to 
      merge the target audiences.
until recently, the prime focus of our work was shutting down the indian point nuclear 
		power plant on the hudson river in new york. in light of ny's dec revoking their water permit, the nrc cannot relicence 
		ip's two remaining reactors, in effect starting the long decommissioning process. this will give an immense 
		boost to the local renewable energy industry, especially in light of all the recent commercial building led incentives.
you can now see the 
		entire no nukes 1979 - the muse concerts for a non-nuclear future on 
youtube. 
in partnership 
		with the greenloop, lü magazine sponsored the world's first green model 
		competition, 
project green search. finals were held in los angeles. with conscious decisions, greenburbs hosted the
		green market exposition at the barnum museum in bridgeport, 
		ct. other projects include transforming beauticians into revolutionaries with
		greenmua.
		

i blog on
		green nuclear 
		butterfly &
		greenburbs. you can 
		also find me 
		on winafish, model 
		mayhem, 
soundcloud,
		facebook 
		and twitter.












"i've seen things you people 
      wouldn't believe. attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion. i 
      watched c-beams glitter 
		in the dark near the tannhauser gate. all those 
      moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain..."(rutger hauer, 
      improvising as roy batty, blade runner, 
  1982)
