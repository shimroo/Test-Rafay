testimonial from phil sandlin“for myself and my company being able to participate even at a small level gives me information about the current situations in the industry. finding out all of the possibilities and or land mines that might exist is a tremendous help for us when trying to plan and as well to predict what is coming down the road. as well as speaking with the other owners and participants who have some of the same struggles that i have is a valuable resource to me.”
phil sandlin, leading respiratory services (oh)

i feel like i am working to help improve the standards of our industry as a member of aahomecare. i also like the first-hand knowledge about the work being done and the networking opportunities.
laura berrysoundview medical supply (wa)

we support aahomecare for many reasons. it is not only a smart business decision based on the timely information and networking opportunities it provides with other industry leaders and key government policymakers, but it often more than pays for itself based on the outcomes that result from the industry’s legislative or regulatory achievements. as an industry manufacturer we believe it is part of our duty and responsibility to support our industry and work on the front lines to advance solutions to the many challenges and opportunities that exist.

aahomecare membership allows us to easily stay on top of policy and payer issues impacting the hme industry, and they keep us up to date on their team’s regular interactions with key cms and hill staff to help us hone our advocacy efforts. they are a great partner to help us deliver a coordinated message to policy-makers and are always on call to provide counsel. tremendous value!

our aahomecare membership has allowed trace medical the ability to lock arms with the providers to support the industry and the patients we collectively serve. through the lobbying efforts, we have gained a deeper understanding of the numerous working pieces, and the collaboration required to ensure a concise message to washington, dc. the experience gained has been invaluable.
elliot campbelltrace medical (mi)










close dialog












the insights from aahomecare provider members is invaluable, especially when they discuss issues they are facing. ultimately, it makes us as manufacturers better business partners if we can adapt and help solve those issues.

the one thing that stands out for me regarding our aahomecare membership is having a seat at the table with some of the most brilliant minds in our industry. it’s a collaborative effort of everyone working toward common goals with a united voice.

the aahomecare council meetings are a highly valuable benefit to the hme industry and my company. we can meet with fellow industry leaders who have the same concerns and challenges and work together to make a change in how we serve our customers and community. it has been very satisfying! also, aahomecare has a strong staff who keep us informed of important issues and are our advocates on the hill.
roxanne venard, rrtascent respiratory care (co)










close dialog












one of the things i really appreciate about aahomecare is their effort to be involved in state medicaid plans, mcos, and tpas. this helps combat the low reimbursement our customers are facing when states outsource their medicaid to mcos and the rates are drastically cut.
beau alfordcure medical (ca)










close dialog












aahomecare allows the industry a platform to voice issues and concerns on behalf of all suppliers collectively. they make it easy to participate in lobbying efforts with turnkey references that allow us to tailor our message to key legislators. aahomecare provides us with the resources we need, which are very helpful to us when we send out our internal calls to action. we can also raise concerns within the aahomecare councils to address with cms, working together toward change as an industry rather than individual companies. through aahomecare, we impact policy!

being an aahomecare member helps me find out about all of the possibilities and/ or land mines that might exist, which is a tremendous help when trying to plan and predict what is coming down the road. it has also been a valuable resource in enabling me to speak with other owners and participants who have some of the same struggles we face.
phil sandlinleading respiratory service (oh)

i have always been an advocate for association membership at the local and national levels because it’s the best way to keep up with industry trends and is the most cost-effective way to keep plugged in on a regular basis. there is no way an individual company or person can stay on top of our industry’s rapidly changing landscape by themselves without dedicating time and personnel to do it.
