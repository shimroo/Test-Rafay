zen budokai jujitsu


























zen budokai jujitsu is a modern self-defense system based on japanese jujutsu. our techniques include throws, joint locks, chokes, submission holds, strikes, ground defenses, and non-lethal control techniques. we differ from many brazilian jiu-jitsu & mma schools in that we focus more on self-defense from a standing position as opposed to competition ground fighting. students learn not only how to defend themselves, but how to control threats (including weapons) and protect others. we are a diverse group with a long history in san francisco and a respectful culture free of hype and commercialization. students of other martial arts are welcome, however, no previous experience is required.
