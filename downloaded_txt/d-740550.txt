tripadvisor comments








about 10 minke whales over 30+ sightings with elding whale watching
our first booking was postponed due to bad whether, but elding were really helpful rescheduling for when the forecast improved. result was a cold but beautifully calm sunny day where we saw our first whales. amazing! all minkes. guide was very helpful and taught us about their behaviour and what to expect from the morning. [...] elding even take a few pictures too which were free to download.
