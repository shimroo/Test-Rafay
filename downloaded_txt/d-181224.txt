everything about this rental was great! the location of this rental is just about everything you could ask for. right across the bridge and not in a heavy traffic area. easy to get in the car and drive back over the bridge for dining and shopping. our teens enjoyed the master suite while hubby and i took a smaller bedroom and later my son, his wife and my granddaughter stayed in the third bedroom. the best part of the arrangements were that everyone had their own en suite bathroom. the location is right on the boardwalk close to the amusement park and a great beach area just across the boardwalk. linens and towels were provided and cooking utensils were stocked. we all really had a great, relaxed vacation and look forward to booking here again.

the property is perfect for families. it's within walking distance to the beach and next to many places to eat, even ice cream is right next door. 3 bedrooms with a private master bath was perfect. the half bath on the main floor was wonderful for those entry potty breaks for the younger kids. the check-in and out was the easiest process i have ever had. we would definitely stay here again.

this place was one of our favorites after many years visiting ocmd and staying at various condos. we will definitely be booking again in the future! the access to the beach was perfect and the little sandpit at the place was perfect for the kids to play after a long day at the ocean! the balcony is amazing and the music from hooters was great for hanging out at night! 100% recommend! also, super clean!!

we really enjoyed this spacious and tastefully decorated condo. the location is close to everything with a lot in walking distance. the neighbors were friendly and respectful to our group. the elevator was very handy during the rest of our stay but greatly missed on our day one move in day it was down for a few hours we had to use the stairs. otherwise great place and we definitely would love to return!

awesome oceanfront view, property was great! excellent ocean front view. overall, condo was pretty clean. sea terrace front desk could have done a better job communicating to first timers; all doors to access the elevators being locked (including what time) and the need to carry all keys to unlock them. other than that, we would stay here again!

we absolutely loved staying at this property. the location is perfect. it's not too close to the amusement area, but close enough to walk there. the view of the ocean and boardwalk is perfect. the kitchen is big and has everything needed. the bathrooms has big tubs and the beds were comfy. we weren't sure about being next to hooter's, but it turned out great. they close around 9 or10pm, and it was convenient to hop over there for dinner when we didn't feel like venturing out. we will definitely stay there in the future!

this was our family’s first bayside stay in ocean city, md. sunset island was an incredible property, located in our favorite part of oc (coastal & 67th). loved the security of a gated community with wonderful scenic stops along a great walkways. def enjoyed the indoor and outdoor pools, gym, clubhouse, and market staffed and maintained by the nicest people. our unit was wonderful, clean, spacious, and quiet! very smart bolting down the furnishings and having a smart tv in each bedroom, esp with little ones in tow. highly recommend this property and unit!!

“we have rented a different condo from shoreline every year for about 6 years, and have never had an issue. once when we came, the washer wouldn't work - i called, and within literally 2 hours, a guy showed up and switched out the washer for a brand new one! all the condos we've rented have been exactly as described and always clean. i've never had to wait more than 5 minutes upon arrival to get my keys and get to the condo - and a couple times we had to show up late (after 8pm), and it was an absolute breeze to get the keys from a lockbox. one year my toddler knocked a lamp over and broke it, and the woman at the office said, "oh, that's ok - it's what the damage deposit is for." she never made us feel bad and was so nice about it.”
