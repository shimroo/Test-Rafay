welcome to pettigru place bed & breakfast!




nestled in the heart of downtown greenville, south carolina, the pettigru place bed and breakfast is surrounded by the beautiful homes of the pettigru historic district.  the brick federal style home, on the national register of historic homes, features six luxurious guest rooms (three with private balconies), private ensuite bathrooms, and a blooming  english garden with a gazebo, firepit, and multiple seating areas.
enjoy a tour of the inn decorated for christmas!
this beautiful home, like greenville itself, is where historic charm meets modern luxury.  from the gourmet multi-course breakfast in the candlelit dining room to the guest rooms with original wood floors, antiques, and updated private bathrooms, the pettigru place bed and breakfast is southern hospitality at its finest.  a short walk down shady tree-lined streets brings you to the middle of main street with its many restaurants, theaters, bustling streets, and the reedy river falls park with its waterfalls and gardens.
whether you are looking for a romantic getaway (great romantic packages) or a relaxing vacation from your “ to do list”,  we will pamper you and give you insider tips on things to see and do during your stay with us.  all of the b&b staff have lived in greenville for over twenty years and enjoy sharing the many fun sights and activities the downtown greenville and surrounding areas have to offer.  more than just typical hotel lodging, the inn will immediately make you feel right at home as the innkeeper greets you with a smile and homemade chocolate chip cookies.

greenville’s award winning main street is a half a mile through the pettigru historic district from the bed and breakfast. falls park on the reedy river, featuring the liberty bridge and waterfalls is located steps from main street. enjoy the unique and eclectic offerings from mast general store, browse the latest fashions at augusta twenty, or splurge on something sweet from kilwins chocolate shop  or the cream shack.  when you’re ready for a break from shopping stop by spill the beans and try one of their many delicious ice cream flavors. rent bikes for the day to experience the swamp rabbit trail with access via cleveland park just 1/4 mile from the inn or at several points downtown. the beautiful, tree-lined main street area features shopping, dining at over 100  restaurants and several performing arts venues including the bon secours wellness arena, just one block from the inn. downtown also boasts several galleries and museums. allow our inn to be your retreat as you explore greenville from the unmatched comfort and grace of a true southern bed and breakfast.
when your day’s activities are done, return to the inn for a glass of wine and a plate of cheese and crackers as you relax in the garden in the adirondack chairs, in one of our common areas, or your own beautiful room.
each morning, wake to the enticing aroma of a full gourmet breakfast such as peaches and cream french toast.  two pieces of french bread griddled to golden, and topped with fresh sc peaches, and a french vanilla caramel sauce served with crisp bacon or, indulge in basil eggs, a toasted croissant with sliced tomatoes, ham, and scrambled eggs topped with a parmesan basil cream sauce.  we promise you won’t leave hungry!
if you are looking for outdoor adventure, greenville is the doorway to the blue ridge parkway and the upstate area of south carolina includes some of the most beautiful areas of the state for rest and recreation.  you will find hiking and biking trails, minor league baseball, and golf all within 15 minutes of the house. let us give you directions to one of the 20 waterfalls in the area.  or visit a state park and watch the eagles flying below you.  visit one of the area farms such as happy cow creamery for a tour (and ask them why their cows are happier) or drop by one of our local microbreweries, yee haw brewing company or fire forge brewery, and try one of their small batch creations. we are minutes away from furman and bob jones universities, as well as thirty miles to clemson university.
pettigru place bed & breakfast is the perfect place to begin your south carolina adventure, and we look forward to welcoming you to greenville!
