at e-conolight, every lighting project matters no matter the size.led ("light emitting diode") lighting has revolutionized industrial, commercial, and residential lighting with its energy efficiency, easy maintenance and long, reliable product life. at e-conolight, we're out to revolutionize how electrical contractors, builders, and homeowners buy led fixtures, bulbs, and accessories by making it easy to get the exact lighting product they need, fast. our goal is to offer the very best selection of led lighting at the very best prices with world-class customer service, fast shipping, easy returns and a can-do attitude.our customers are our number one priority. we don't think you should have to pay an arm, leg, or any other body part for quality lighting that simply works the way it’s promised to. that’s why we’ve cut out the middleman and sell led products directly to you, at what some would consider wholesale prices. whether you’re working as a contractor or a homeowner looking to upgrade your bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen, we’ve got you covered with our full selection. need electrical supplies to go with your order? we carry those, too, by the names you trust, so you don’t have to shop anywhere else for your next install.not convinced yet? led lighting has major advantages over more traditional technologies. compared to fluorescent lighting, led can last longer - more than 100,000 hours of maintenance-free operation for many products -- and they don’t require constant re-lamping. compare this to standard incandescent bulbs, or cfl ("compact fluorescent") bulbs, which may last you around only 1,000 hours. energy-efficient led lighting will also help your clients save hundreds. which means they’ll have more money left over each month for more important business initiatives, like improving customer experience or enhancing the learning environment in schools.bright and even lighting benefits countless applications. in the case of retail, it can help improve the appearance of goods by illuminating shelves evenly from top to bottom. outdoors, it can help increase security by brightening parking lots and walkways.the moral of this story? throw your old, inefficient standard bulbs where they belong: in the nearest trash can.new to e-conolight?what makes us different30-day returnsno restocking feeswithin 30-days of original purchase dateoffers & updatesget exclusive deals, new product info and news. your inbox and your accountant will thank you.sign me up for text alerts, too message and data rates may applysign upprefer a paper catalog?we have one of those too!request a catalog or manage subscription >download current catalog >
