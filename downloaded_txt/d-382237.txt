eight money saving tips for a nationwide move



a cross-country move is a bold statement that requires the pockets to back it up. for a sizeable household, it can be quite expensive. however, with the right tips moving out doesn’t have to be costly. below are eight tips for cutting down the costs of moving across the nation.
1. declutter unnecessary items to avoid excess luggage costs
when moving out, carrying all your items will prove to be strenuous and costly. however, you can make a huge difference by decluttering. start by labeling and assorting all the items you need to carry versus those you don’t need. according to aarp, an organized decluttering system can save you time, space, and money as you’ll have fewer items to pack.
2. purge and sell items you don’t need
selling the stuff you won’t carry after a thorough decluttering session can generate valuable coins to cater for your move’s costs. there are several ways you can sell your items.
yard sales
the most common method is hosting a yard or garage sale. it helps save up on time and money as you don’t need to advertise your products.
word of mouth
let your friends, neighbors, and family know that you plan to move. chances are they know someone interested in purchasing your items at a friendly price.
online retailers
if you have plenty of time before your move, consider advertising your products on websites like ebay or craigslist to generate a decent amount of money.
3. move when the season is right
plan your move according to the changes and inflation within the economy. for example, it’s expensive to move during the summer due to an abundance of people moving out as their leases expire or because the school year is about to commence. aim to move out when it’s less congested, and if the season facilitates it.
4. seek cost-effective movers
before deciding to move, you need to scout around the market and make a list of moving companies that offer a decent rate that fits well within your budget. a nationwide move can be quite financially taxing, so you need to also inquire about the long-distance prices and any additional charges that you may incur. don’t go with the first nationwide moving service you find; be sure to compare rates from multiple moving companies to ensure you’re getting a good deal.
5. utilize discounts and promotional offers
during low seasons of productivity, such as winter, many companies tend to dish out discounts to attract customers. be among the few that opt for special offers and make the most of it. more so, if you or any member of your family has served in the army, then you are instantly qualified for a military discount. these promotional offers can significantly reduce the expenses of moving out.
6. utilize your packing equipment
hiring packages and foam from your mover can be slightly overpriced and costly, especially if your packing is in excess. consider buying recyclable boxes and cheap packing material to cut down on unnecessary costs. you’ll end up unwrapping your items once you’ve successfully relocated, so there is no need to spend on expensive packaging from your mover.
7. consider moving yourself
handling your moving process can reduce costs and give you plenty of breathing room to pack and assort your items at your discretion. according to u.s moving, 34% of american households opted for a rented truck instead of professional movers in the year 2019. services like u-haul offer cost-effective truck rentals and are cheaper alternatives to moving than a professional mover.
8. rent a portable moving container
if renting a truck isn’t much to your style, consider hiring a moving container instead. portable containers services, such as pods, provide a cheap alternative to storing and transporting your valuables. all you need to do is deposit your items before you move, and it will be delivered to your required destination, allowing you to unload at your convenience.
in summary
moving across the nation doesn’t have to ruin your financial plans. remember to stick to a consistent budget, and always take advantage of offers and discounts.

moving from los angeles to nyc – what to know



there isn’t much difference between la and nyc, right? you would be wrong. although there are many big buildings and lots of people in both cities, the similarities end there. as with any other two places, history, location, and population significantly affect a city’s attitude, culture, and experience. be excited to move, be happy to move, but don’t expect the two cities to be the same. here are some west coast to east coast moving tips from these movers in greenwich village.
weather
one of the most apparent differences between new york and los angeles is the weather. los angeles is significantly warmer than new york, and if you’ve been living in la for a while, the cold, snowy winters might catch you by surprise. you will need to change your wardrobe to stay warm during the winter significantly. in la, shorts and tanks are a need year-round, but you will need to pack layers, winter coats, gloves, hats, and warm socks in new york. especially if you’re looking at smaller or older houses, heating can be expensive and not efficient.
that isn’t to say the winter isn’t beautiful. seeing the leaves change color in central park is something you’ll never forget. any inconvenience of the winter is soon forgotten with a pretty layer of snow. it’s certainly an opportunity to practice layering in a cool, stylish way.
housing
if everything’s bigger in texas, everything is more expensive in new york. from food to clothes to housing, be prepared to spend a little more when you move to new york. housing is probably the most significant thing you will spend your money on when living in any place, and that’s also the case in the big apple. when you first visit in the hopes of finding the perfect apartment for you to settle down in, it may be pretty depressing how little space you can get for what you pay to live in los angeles. keep this in mind and remember to pack light, this might even save you a few bucks on the move if you are looking to rent a truck. apartment hunting is also very competitive. if you want to live in new york, be prepared to find a house you like, decide on the spot to live there, and put your money down right away. proper housing goes fast, so you have to be ready to put your money where your mouth is.
transportation
transportation is also a huge difference. if you’ve lived in los angeles for a time, you probably have or want a car. in los angeles, a car is pretty much mandatory for travel. since la is so spread out, although there is a public transit system, it takes a long time to get anywhere using it in la. if that’s what you’re used to, get ready for a significant change. while the car might be valuable during the 3,000-mile trip, it might be better to get a ride or use another travel mode if you can get rid of the car early. if you do opt for the car, practice stopping in small towns to fuel up on your trip and make sure to change the oil in your car before heading out.
in new york, there are frankly no parking spots but there is great public transportation. the city is small enough that you can get nearly anywhere in 45 minutes or less. also, parking is so limited that it would take longer to drive somewhere and find a parking spot than just to take public transportation. if you’re making the move cross country, it might be a good idea to drop the car for the extra cash.
conclusion
while new york city and los angeles are great cities, they are excellent in very different ways. it won’t be an effortless switch, there will be some significant and exciting changes that you will have to get used to, but if you’re set on it and have these differences in mind, you will have a good experience in the city.
