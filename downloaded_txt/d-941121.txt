for 20 years we've been helping people stop jealousyand create the love they want









hi, we're susie and otto collins, the creators of no more jealousy, and we're here to help you overcome jealousy and have the love and relationship you've always wanted.
we're trained jealousy coaches but our biggest credential is that we conquered jealousy early in our relationship and have been passionately and happily together and married for 21 years.
but it wasn't always that way. when we were first together and had our "soul mate" experience, we thought that would last forever.
but when jealousy started creeping in and disrupting our beautiful relationship, we knew we had to learn the secrets and tools to stopping jealousy and keeping our love alive before it killed it.
today, jealousy is no longer an issue for us and our marriage is closer and more loving than either of us ever dreamed was possible and that's what we want to share with you.
if we can do it, and our clients can do it, you can do it too!
