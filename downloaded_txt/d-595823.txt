do i really need to calibrate my devices? if you are producing a product that has to meet certain tolerances, you have to measure those tolerances with some device. that device has to maintain it’s accuracy, so you can maintain your required tolerances. many measurement devices age overtime and their accuracies drift. therefore, they require to be recalibrated in order to meet their manufacturer specifications. older instruments tend to drift more, due to their early manufacturing, resulting in a more frequent calibration cycle; where newer ones hold their accuracy longer.
