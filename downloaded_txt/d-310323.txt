artist's statement
i've always been attracted to paper and pens and paint. the endless combination of things you can create with them is intoxicating. it's only natural this fascination would culminate in a variety of art. 

my aunt bought me a watercolor set when i was a child, and i've been putting color on things ever since. it has taken many, many forms over the years from textiles to walls to paper. i am continually expanding the repertoire of art forms in which i work. 

my work has grown in the last three years. that's when i made the decision that a studio space was an essential. working on a side table in my dining room was limiting my work. since i've had a place where the floors can be splattered with paint my work has become more expansive.

one of my dear friends says, "one of the things i love about you patsy is that you know no excess." my art reflects this. they are still making paint and paper - i can use all i want - and i use it liberally. i love the texture you get when acrylic paint is thick and layered, and i continue to find new techniques for monoprints that enhance this effect. i work extensively with paint application techniques that are not typical art methodology. my tools are as likely to come from the hardware store or the makeup aisle as they are from the art store. everything has potential.

i work in a variety of mediums, from acrylics to watercolor to pastel. any and all of them might find their way into a mixed media piece, or on more "practical" objects like journals. 

the world of creativity is inclusive and open to anyone who wants to join in. "studio play dates," where i create with other people, are a regular occurrence for me. the energy of creating with other people is inspiring. art engenders no competition with other artists because the ability to create is infinite.

	 quote of the day 
	 
         

the divide is not between the servants and the served, between the leisured and the workers, but between those who are interested in the world and its multiplicity of forms and forces, and those who merely subsist, worrying or yawning . . . . the world is full of light and life, and the true crime is not to be interested in it.a. s. byatt in "elementals: stories of fire and ice"
