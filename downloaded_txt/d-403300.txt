science books & films



























 


science books & films (sb&f) was a global critical review journal devoted exclusively to print and non-print science materials for all age groups. since 1965, sb&f was the authoritative guide to science resources, bringing librarians and other educators expert information to make the best decisions when choosing science materials for their libraries, classrooms, or institutions. sb&f offered thousands of book, dvd, website, and software package reviews, designed to help librarians and science educators efficiently navigate the modern information landscape.
