dreams and reality. 

recent nights have been plagued with dreams of every kind and nature. take last night for example. i had 5 different dreams in one night. and guess who kept appearing in my dreams? they ranged from premonition-like dreams to real-life-reflecting dreams to alternate-past-and-future dreams... what's happening to me? i don't know. i just know that i woke up after every dream...5 times in a night... the strangest was the first...almost getting something i want in the dream n then waking up. =.=ll sigh.life's feeling lonely...and it's shit feeling like this. is this how depression starts? when one is with one's friends and etc yet one feels ignored and lonely? how and where to draw the line between crazy delusions and intuitive cognitions? i shall go to my sleep now and hope for a better day. life is really shitty right now...nothing to live for. nothing worthy to die for even...except maybe to end the sensation of rotting and fading away.

“a feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain, and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain.” 

sigh...after taking leave from blogging for so long...i am back again. i don't know if it is a longing for the past and an expression of the desire to improve the present or simply a simple egoistic move to make myself known to the world...nonetheless, i am back again. some quotes i happened upon while surfing:      “love is the expression of simplicity in emotion, the unattainable longing that comes so unexpectedly, with great subtlety and bliss”      “three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.”      “some people never say the words 'i love you'. it's not their style to be so bold. some people never say those words: 'i love you' but, like a child, they're longing to be told.”      “all lovers live by longing, and endure; summon a vision and declare it pure”      “at great periods you have always felt, deep within you, the temptation to commit suicide. you gave yourself to it, breached your own defenses. you were a child. the idea of suicide was a protest against life; by dying, you would escape this longing for death.”sigh...am i an incorrigible pessimist? am i a craven attention seeker? i don't know how to see myself anymore. those propaganda posters are right...army does change your life. it did mine. i think i grew up so much here that now i am old and tired and cannot bring myself to believe in life again.had a terrible nightmare last night at around 3am and i've failed to sleep well since then. i dreamt of terrible hauntings in cat high and even the exorcism of a cadet by a friend and senior of mine. -.- but the truly terrible part of the nightmare was when the hauntings got worse and then my family members started to be murdered by the ghosts and someone very important to me as well...and i witnessed most of the deaths and yet was helpless in stopping them... i totally broke down in the dream and woke up with such a terrible sinking feeling and overwhelming despair that i can well imagine how it feels like to be near a dementor from the harry potter universe.

life. 

now i can only cling on to the dreams of the night...cling on to the illusion world where happiness can be found.and yet, now i've come to avoid sleep...and the ecstatic happiness and unity to be found in the dreams of the night, but what mortal man can stand the torment of terrible loss when he wakes and finds that it was all just, dreams.yet, everyday i long for the time of sleep and the drifting into dreams, for then i can for a while taste that which would make me most happy and fulfiled, and finally, feel like i mean the world to somebody when i actually don't. and never did. sigh.been spending my salary on games, comics and clothing. a new pair of shoes as well, but i bought an indoor shoe, which has totally no grip on wet surfaces. curse my stupidity -___-nothing feels like it's ever gonna be all right again.the reckoning. this wednesday.

sadness. disappointment. sinking heart. 

sigh.helpless.i can only sigh.it seems heaven does conspire against me.tears won't even come to me no more.it appears that i may have cried my eyes dry in the past over this issue now.nothing can make me cry now...sigh.yu ying said i am like hannibal (who appeared outwardly a perfect gentleman but was actually a psychotic mass killer). should i be happy that many shall fear me or should i be sad that i am perceived as evil?it seems that people in my class identify me with things like mystery, deception, ruthlessness, hidden anger, secretly dangerous, etc. not exactly the gallant, honourable and chivalrous knight huh?so, if i can't cry anymore and i'm associated closely with the promise of death to anyone who crosses my path, then i am now "tearless death" or "uncrying death"?sigh...i wonder if it's true. maybe someone else more important than i am have agreed to go out. speculations and theories are now ruining my peace. i shall say no more and trust blindly. though hurt more deeply i will be if the truth be as i surmised, but yet, trust i will.feeling so faithless.. hollow inside. sigh. working so hard for something you will never get? why are you so foolish? and you'll answer, "if we never try, we would not fail, yes, but we would not succeed as well. it's the doing and not the done that makes something worth treasuring." and i'll reply, "though that may be true, but pushing down a dead end hurts so much...you push and push to break down the wall until you are all bloody and tired, punishing yourself and leaving nothing on the wall but the stains of your blood, uncaringly washed away by the next downpour"life goes on. pain goes on. love goes on. hope dies. hope rekindles. hope dies. love dies. heart dies. man die.

as time passes, 

you realise that some things do not bear holding on too tightly to. all you can do, if you wish to retain it, is to let go. let go. let go. let go.and though sometimes you may see something denied to you for so long so flippantly and easily given to others, you can only sigh and resign yourself to acceptance.you can only wish that, perhaps, in the future, it may finally be your turn. or never. what will never do is to force it to be given to you.crap. feeling crappy. crap crap crap crap crapquote of the day: shit happened.quote of the night: you don't get what matters to you, others get them, especially when it don't matter to them.advice of the day: forget everything you see here when you leave this blog. it's not likely that it will matter to you. and no, you don't have to do anything.what will come, will come. what won't come would never come.

sigh. so hard to be a better man. 

i read my previous post, notice how extreme it sounds. it may have been written at the spur of the moment, but it does reflect what i truly always feel every single time i am faced with something negative that you throw at me, by intention or by accident. seriously, i try to be understanding and believe in everything you say and making logical excuses for such treatment from you, but that entry just reflects the other side of the argument that rages in me. you have to know what i am feeling, no matter if you care or do not care.i don't know anymore. is being a better man for your sake going to be about giving up my sense of self-respect? is being a better man for you going to be about taking whatever coarse treatment you throw at me and swallow it and continue to smile? or things like these? i can't...i am trying hard to...but i can't. would you ever fall in love with a man who is not a man anymore? i think not... but of course, i do not presume to know what you are thinking or feeling. sigh. and i can feel tangibly that there is no romance or anything in our outings and interaction...as if we are just friends, casual friends. i did not try to better that situation, almost as if i'm sitting helpless watching what i desire most in life pass me by, and you pushing me away also prevetns anything more from happening.sigh. enough about this. no matter your reaction, i have vented and i have vented. sigh. really wondering if this is all worth it. (now, don't you try to use this as another booster to your argument)anyway, i was really bored today...dead bored at home. my computer kept restarting so i can't even play a game in peace...decided to meet qin xue for dinner at thomson. prata again, this time at another prata house. ate until i was bloated. saw him home, but i was still bored, so i went to town. went to suntec to walk around and explore the place, then i decided to go find aiping at watson's (her workplace) but she wasn't there! haha, i found out that she was transferred to another watson's at wisma, so i went over there to find her. chatted with her and then took the train home together, haha she was so grateful to me for escorting her home but then i was just finding something to do to keep from feeling bored :p haha, nevermind, she knows lar =) now, back home, back to dark thoughts and boredom. to bed i shall go. soon.i wonder if you even visit my blog anymore.

ever been treated like thin air? like whether you exist or not don't matter? 

ha. can only laugh derisively at myself. foolishness of the foolish. to swallow pride and ego, and basic level of a human being's respect for himself and need for recognition from others just simply to be treated by someone as if i do not even exist. or rather, conditional existence.never do you message me unless i do you, only as short, curt replies. now, it has degenerated to not deigning to reply at all.never a call or anything. well, can't expect it of you...but still...no visible attempt to maintain what you term as a close friendship.whatever we have ever shared seems to have disappeared since the time when you decided for yourself that we can never be and you only want him. isn't that ironic then, that a friendship supposedly so close was based simply on the propensity of its evolution into something more?juxtapose these with the galling evidence of how you go after him and how much you care for him and message him. seems like it is indeed true that people only do things in their own interests. and you, are clearly not interested. not even as a friend.truly disappointed by what i see, or rather, what i do not see. or perhaps i am over-exaggerating things as usual. any blind person can see the giant difference in the way you treat me between then and now.please, if you do not even want to be friends, just say so. if you are using this as a method to stop me from ever pursuing you or courting you or trying, please try something else. something more direct. more painful certainly, but less uncertain. just know that the treatment of me as mere thin air now is certainly more degrading than anything you can throw at me, short of publicly embarassing me or tricking me into doing something stupid in front of people, which you have not done so far.just as you have problems with having people other than yuor parents seeking to know about your life and in your perspective, "control" it, i too cannot stand to be treated as though i don't exist, or to be hung in the air, being neither here or there. either pull me up, or cut me loose."if you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that."

understanding more and more 

shi qu guo cai neng zhen zheng dong de qu zhen xi he yong you...many a times it takes loss to teach valuable lessons to a person. and we often find that in matters close to our hearts, holding on tighter actually causes us to lose our grip on what we deem most precious, where freedom and mutual trust and respect ie letting go, yields much better returns.many long nights have past since that fateful night, many tormented days when i debated the worthiness of my soul and the value of my cause and the blemishes of my character. indeed, much have changed in this period of much internal strife, changes that should have came about much earlier than this...changes that should have come about before the disaster and not after.i have looked within myself and i have scrutinised the past, and found all the things that are wanting in me. though i can't say that i have eliminated all my past faults, i have tried very hard. very hard to drive myself in changing for the better. now, what remains, and this the most important of all, is for there to be another chance... to redeem myself, to fix all the things i've done or said, and to win over once again that which was lost to me.all that i ask of you...is an open mind and another chance. that's all i ask of you... and all i ask of myself is everything else. despite everything that has ever happened and everything that never did happen, i have searched long and hard inside myself and i come to the final conclusion which is the unescapable truth... and on christmas, we always tell the truth, and this truth of mine is that i love you. with all my heart and my every breath, and it is an affection that has matured, borned of friendship and tampered in the fires of distress and strife. and my wasted heart will always love you, no matter what may happen or may never happen. i no longer fear confession of my feelings for now i know them to be true.

played basketball 4 times this holiday, and injured myself all 4 times. grrr. and the form i'm showing now is so bad i don't even want to tell others that i play basketball... =_="sigh, lost wallet still not found, seems like bad things all start happening to me once my wallet's gone, or maybe it could be more accurately dated to 17th november 2005 ba... oh well. still gritting my teeth and hoping this shitty run of bad luck will end soon.and i continue to busy myself, finding things to do so that i do not have to face my dark thoughts. sigh. such a difficult time to be alive in. dark eye rings are growing, on the verge of collapse. manage to reduce some fats but the spare tyre around the waist is still there. so many things to improve about myself, yet totally lacking in motivation and strength. i'm a wreck.and so i continute to wander about, half despair half hope, knowing so much yet so little, lying to myself yet brutally slapping myself in the face with the truth. just can't let you go.

illogical feelings and thoughts. 

thoughts of the lies and the half-truths, the saying-one-thing-and-doing-another, the self-before-others attitude and everything else negative filled my mind.yet, it seems that a sense of betrayal and a self-righteous sense of having been on the receiving end of ill treatment cannot triumph over the power of the other emotion. the 4 letter word, let it not be named here lest it hurts... illogical it seems, to have the heart countermand the mind so...to hold on to that which hurts your hand holding...i guess, this is, the power of ****. deluded and misguided though it may seem to the discerning third party. ah well, man was never made to completely master his feelings but to grow by acheiving an understanding and a semblance of control over them.

"一月的萧邦,伴随十一月的雨夜.琴韵入耳,心甚暖但孤单." 

missing you and missing all the things that we could do together or did together that have slowly dwindled out after you put up that distince wall between us. a wall that you continually develop yet seem to wish to mask the construction of... perhaps i am thinking too much into things again

my angst tastes like...cherryalluring and sexy, your angst seems to be coming from a desire to, well, get laid. you want love, romance, seduction, and a night you'll never forget. yet while every person wants that to some degree, you seem especially desperate and troubled over it. what you probably truly need, and you know this, is a good, healthy, and romantic relationship. you simply get caught up in passion and always skip straight to the steamy ending. your fiery affection will no doubt make your future lover very happy, but try to fan the flames now for your own health so you don't overheat and also for others so you don't burn off any prospects.  lol...someone help me prove this wrong! :p haha can't believe i got this result...

dreaming. dreamt. 

i couldn't sleep...not with so many thoughts in my mind, and the continuing battle of the two equally strong emotions and stances...thus, here, i write in my blog, the last post that i would possibly address to you, my mysterious object of affection. after tonight, you would no longer exist; replaced by a wide and bottomless void. now, i have...a friend. a very good friend, but yes, simply a friend.indeed, the sole dream that i entertained up to this point and the sole ambition in my directionless life was to be with you. but now, it seems it will never come to be. haiz, i can only sigh and accept what is merely the bare facts.but then, it will take a very long time for me to relinguish these feelings, though now the ones more at the forefront are those of strong friendship...for i guess i put too much of myself into the love and got too little back. it may be many years before i may let go enough to love again. sigh.though it pleases me not to know that you like him, i must still say that i hope you succeed...for i guess making you happy is what a friend is for, right? mayhaps i may be right that you desire him because he is the only one who came close to you and did not desire you. wanting what you cannot get has always been a human nature. i could be wrong. i could be right. i do not know.knowing me, being a split person and all...it is very hard for me to take a firm stand...very hard. a big part of me, a part that you may not know about but you may not change, is still hoping for a miracle and hoping for a change of heart. maybe one day in the distant future, you may return and find open arms waiting for you, or maybe you will find that i have left. whichever the case, i plea with you to judge me not, and do not let it affect our friendship...for even if i leave in the future i will still be your friend. most importantly...i am not continuing to be your friend because i am waiting for you to fail and then seize the opportunity to strike. true to my words, i truly wish that, now that love has forever failed, you can become my best friend...for everything.thus, anon, anon...this is the final good bye. good bye my heart, my dream... let the broken pieces of this battered heart float on the stream of time and perhaps, slowly, come to be whole again. good bye love. and welcome friendship.bleeding will naturally stop when there is no more blood to bleed. time will tell.shin (xing yue tuan) songs still best reflect my feelings now. half of it. an ran xiao hun.now the only love i have left in the world is my love for family and love for basketball. i'm gonna become a ball maniac...

for your eyes... 

sometimes, things said in anger may not be meant, and yes, once said, they can't be taken back.but sometimes, i do say things when i'm pissed or upset and i really do mean them, most times i don't want to take them back. i apologies not for the words but for another reason. my apologies and making-up are not used to take back what i say...it's just that assuming that i'm dealing with someone who's used to being right and who is more stubborn than i am, i apologise and try to make up first because i fear for the relationship. it's not because i'm in two minds about everything, just that i said those angry words hoping that you might really hear what i was saying, because sometimes i'm really trying to point out your weaknesses or point out things that i am uncomfortable with. but when there is no reply from you, or what i perceive as stony silence, i get nervous, and become all apologetic and reconciliatory because i fear that it would spoil the relationship. i seriously dunno, at those times, if you absorbed anything i said and whether they might help in anyway, but to me, i guess apologies is a form of stepping down and capitulation, perhaps i have the wrong mentality of letting you win all the time. i guess, though my words spoken when i'm in a foul mood are meant to make you see more about yourself and also about me, my mind and my heart would rather all the supposed lessons be cancelled out with my apologies, for always i fear distancing.of course, now i know that you hear and remember all that i said, and the lack of reaction is just your way of dealing with things. different people have different degrees of physical reaction and etc to anohter person's words or actions, i guess being with my expressive class too long has garbled my mind and make me think that everyone else in the world should be just as open as them. well, i'm glad for that phone conversation last evening, helped to clear up my misconceptions and allow me to, in future, deal with things properly. this entry, i guess, is jst to clarify what i was thinking at every point of time in the past when i lost control and then later made reconciliatory actions. =) peace...study hard and smart! let's both excel in our a levels! take care!

a very long courtship (ripped off a very long engagement) 

a gentle, patient love on the whole. just that recently it has been plagued by stormy moods and unpredictable emotions on my part. mayhap it is, as i speculated earlier, due to the influence of mars, but now i can sense it passing, and we may again pursue the state of apparent stasis that is tempered with nearly imperceptible movements.many, or perhaps all, who have come before or may come after have raced to the ending point to find, well, only an ending place for them. perhaps, with luck and with care, i may be the one who will find a new beginning at the ending. until that day happens, i will try to do all that i can to not overstep my bounds and try to make you happy in anyway i can. somehow, as has never happened before, this love has a 'right' feeling to it... *shrugs* =)

where is the love? 

examine a primitive model of society, the tribal village. in conditions where basic survival was the primary concern of everyone in the village, we see the roots of man-woman relationships, which is commonly known as love today. then, the gender roles are well-defined and man and woman play distinct roles that complement each other. in an uncomplicated society like that, love between husband and wife grows from their ability to complement each other to ensure survival, and possibly some entertainment for each other too. a woman's love for her husband grows with his ability to protect her and their children from harm, and from his ability to provide food. ergo, love grows when a woman feel protected and taken care of. on the other hand, a woman makes her husband loves her more and more with her ability to nurture and her propensity for tenderness. the woman tends the dwelling and tends her husband after he has hunted or farmed, nurturing that fragile soul and personality under the tough facade of the exterior that is meant to scare away danger. so love grows between them with mutual protection and nurturing, where the man faces external dangers while the woman protects internally. thus, love grows with their ability to complement each other and feel contented together.now, we look at modern society, where most every man is an island...as gender roles are blurred and the need to survive shifted focus to economic rather than basic, it would seem that the basic foundations for love have cease to be relevant. now, it's every man/woman for himself/herself when it comes to economic survival, and the man's role to protect and provide don't seem to be as crucial as it used to be. added to this is the evolution of today's woman, who refuse to marry or give birth or to nurture, preferring to compete with man in every arena possible. in this world of dog-eat-dog and self-before-others people, one can't help but wonder, 'where is the love?'where is the love? where is the love?

my reply 

to that, is that i was never in misery since july 30th. the joy and the happy moments far outweigh the bad ones, though the bad seems more intense due to them being fewer in number. you bring more joy into my life than sadness...and i never want to lose you. =) even if it is possible to spend but one day with you before you leave for taiwan, it would be enough for me. for we should treasure what we have and not spend all our time being obssessed with what we don't... every happy moment with you is a deeply treasured one...it is here that i learn that happiness comes from making you happier, though admittedly if it makes me happier in the process, all the better. =p

sometimes leaving from the door of the room of misery isn't a form of escape. it's just that you know that you can't take it anymore and it's time to 

let go.and that's what you said to me.

resolve 

it gets to me more and more with each passing day...until i was sorely tempted to carry out drastic inaction to force something out. now, though, in the end...i've given up on that plan before it even initiated. sigh. following my principles, it will always be me taking the extra step, going the extra mile for anyone, much less the most important one. win-win situation where i lose a little has always been what i engineer in my life. furthermore, i love you more than you do me, perhaps you do not at all, so how can i ever take the backseat if i want to go anywhere in this relationship? and, it's me doing the chasing after all...so i guess it'll be me doing all the initiating and showing all the interest ba. resolved to put this issue aside for good...cos it does me no good in the long run...sigh...i''m used to this way of things and life.i was telling a friend the other day about absolute trust in what you told me about qt...and yet all the time i was thinking of the half-truths you've told in the past and the variousthings you tell me about, where whatever you say on the same issue changes with time.can't help having fears that this issue will still turn out like all those in the past. yet,i still resolved to trust in your words and trust in my trust...believing that heaven can'tbe this cruel to me. and yes, i know you will probably tell me this, and i will go ahead and doit before you feel you must take time to tell me to do so: concentrate on the a levels.nothing seem to go right for me today...so many things gone wrong, so many things gone awry...was on the verge of losing control of pent-up emotions...what a terrible way to spend my last official school day with lessons. gah.

too hasty... 

been feeling quite disappointed recently due to the constancy of a trend in our relationship...being the one to always be the first to act--to sms, to initiate calls, to ask you out...and never an sms or a call or anything initiated by you...only reactionary smses and calls. it gives me a very down in the dumps feeling and leave me hanging in mid air again...i know, i know, i'm expecting too much too early...and expecting so much when there is no reason for you to do any of those things. too hasty...seeking the more ideal situation that can only exist in the future...knowing also your personality. sigh. though knowing these feelings and thoughts to be unjustifiable and also perhaps unreasonable, i still can't help having them... think of it this way... a exerts a force on b and b bounce back a reactionary force that is equal or reduced. b never exert any force by itself back on a. and a wonders if b is just being a person in a mirror and not a real person. argh, i'm not making sense here...shall cease this pointless discussion. just know my own hastiness and chide myself for it. case closed.can't help feeling guilty whenever i see him, because he has lost what he almost attained last time...and the look in his eyes, he blames it on me. he blames it on her, but more on the external force which he believes to be the true motivator behind the rife between them. guilty though i feel, i can't help feeling happier that he has stopped sticking to her like a leech, yet at the same time, feeling even guiltier at feeling happy at someone else's loss, even if it may be his own fault. sigh.

some thoughts 

mostly people obey the laws of their respective lands for one simple reason. if they break them they will suffer from it. the thought of suffering deters them from wrongdoing. it is an age-old principle. kill someone, and you yourself will be killed. rob someone and you will be punished. you might lose a hand, or be branded upon the brow, or indeed hanged. the question is, what happens when you are the law, when your action actions are unchallenged, your decisions final and beyond appeal? when you are surrounded by people who agree with your every word and ever deed? you become like a god. it is  a small step from that to tyranny.we like to believe there is something special, even alien, about evil. we like to think that tyrants are different from the rest of us. that they are somehow inhuman. they are not. they are merely unchained, unfettered; free to do as they please. how often do ordinary people grow angry at neighbors, and, for a moment only, consider causing them harm? it happens all the time. what stop them from carrying out an attack? usually it is the fear of repercussion, punishment, or imprisonment. what repercussions do the powerful face for their evils? none. the more terrifying they become, the more powerful they appear.

despite... 

all the gossip mongers and their speculations, their hurtful words and skewed predictions, i remain true. they plant the seeds of doubt in my mind, and sow discord in our inter-personal relationships, they tell me again and again that you will choose him over me until i am almost swayed by their repetitive comments. however, i remember that i once promised you that i will give you my absolute trust, if you should make something clear to me. since you told me before that he has already lost all hope of succeeding, i told myself to stop worrying and place my trust in your words. i trust you, and now, finally, this issue is no longer the source of bothers and worry and self-doubt for me anymore.

http://www.colorgenics.com/sps/index.cfm 

first time taking the test:at this time you are feeling 'uptight' and you are urgently in need of rest and relaxation; but perhaps even more than that you need to overcome that feeling that you have been 'hard done by' and treated with a complete lack of consideration. maybe you have, but whatever may have been the cause of your inherent anxiety, you regard the situation as intolerable. you are, however, sufficiently competent to turn that situation around - you have overcome similar problems in the past, and really this one isn't too different.you are experiencing considerable difficulty trying to achieve your goals. as a consequence of this you are becoming more and more irritable. your friends and acquaintances are finding it increasingly more difficult to appease or to reason with you. you are the cause of your own problems. don't be so impulsive. it is your vacillation that can lead to problems and uncertainties. ease up a little.you honestly believe that your hopes and ideas are realistic, but there seems to be no one around to give you the necessary reassurance and encouragement. you are egocentric. you believe that you are always 'right' - well maybe you are but you have a short fuse and are likely to take offense for the slightest reason.you are trying to prove yourself - not only to yourself but also to everyone around you. there is much that you would like to say and do but the situation warrants self-restraint and that is the last thing that you have on your mind. it would seem that you have an unsatisfied need to ally yourself with others whose standards are as high as your own. you want to be different - to stand out from the crowd. this is subjecting you to considerable stress but you tend to stick to your attitudes despite lack of appreciation. of course, you are finding the situation uncomfortable and would like nothing better but to break away from it but you don't like the idea of compromise. your main problem is that you are unable to resolve the situation because you continually postpone making the necessary decisions. you feel that if you make the wrong choice this would lead to such opposition that you would not be able to command the esteem of others. it is essential that those around you are prepared to comply with your wishes.you would like to be respected and valued for yourself and this can only be achieved from within a close and harmonious relationship.second time:enough is enough - you feel frustrated and rejected. you are fighting back and the going is tough. it would be just wonderful if you could be left in peace.rejection is what you fear the most and it is this fear that makes you unapproachable. you are looking for acknowledgement and above all looking for people who can appreciate you for who and what you are.your confidence has been shattered. there are so many things that you would like to do with your life, so many dreams to be fulfilled - and you know that your hopes and dreams are not just figments of your imagination, they are real and you are looking for reassurance from someone. basically your fears are such that you may be prevented in attaining your hopes and dreams. even now you would like to broaden your fields of endeavor but in order to develop your 'inner- self' you need peace and solace. you are distressed by the fear that you may be prevented from attaining your goals. what you really need at this particular moment in time is quiet reassurance from someone close to you to restore your confidence.you are presently experiencing excessive stress as a result of self-restraint. you act and think differently from the common herd and you want to be liked and admired for yourself and to associate with people who feel and act as you do. because of this need to be self-reliant and to break away from mediocrity, you are finding this situation most uncomfortable and you are experiencing considerable anxiety - perhaps even more than you feel the capacity to cope with. you need to find a 'soul mate', someone whose standards are as high as your own - but where? keep on searching... the situation is uncomfortable and you would like to break away from it, but you refuse to compromise with your opinions. you are unable to resolve the situation because you are continually postponing the making of necessary decisions. you are stubborn but this is no deterrent to a happy life, so why drop your standards. think positively, everything will work out. it has worked out successfully for you in the past and it will again in the future.the tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are beyond your capabilities, or your reserves of strength, have led to considerable anxiety and a sense of personal inadequacy. your inability to take control of the situation causes you to over-react in stubborn defiance blaming everyone but yourself for your own failures.third time:you are the sort of person that needs a peaceful environment. you seek release from stress and freedom from conflicts and disagreements, of which you seem to have had more than your fair share. but you are taking pains to control the situation by proceeding cautiously and you are right in doing so as you are a very sensitive person.now there are many things in life that you require as essential to your well-being but, try as you may, something always seems to be getting in your way. a word of advice - 'keep trying' and you may be pleasantly surprised to see just how matters turn out.you honestly believe that your hopes and ideas are realistic, but there seems to be no one around to give you the necessary reassurance and encouragement. you are egocentric. you believe that you are always 'right' - well maybe you are but you have a short fuse and are likely to take offense for the slightest reason.you are holding back. you need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. the existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. this is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. you feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. you want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. in essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.you would like to be respected and valued for yourself and this can only be achieved from within a close and harmonious relationship.verdict: quite true.

my views on physical contact for young couples 

disclaimer: my view means my view. m-y. any offence to anyone is purely unintended and probably the side-effects of a demented mind.first off, let's clarify, physical contact here do not lead up to sexual contact, nor does physical intimacy equate sexual intimacy. the accomplishment of one may not lead to the other, and vice versa.physical contact between couples, as i see it, is a very, very important tool for the closing of distance between the two individuals, and it is one of the indispensible parts of a relationship.it can be just a touch, a light brush of the fingers, a simple shoulder-to-shoulder walk or even simply a very natural tap or touch. the simple, simple little gestures that passes between them. the contact with each other, when there is feeling between them, is enough to send little jolts of electricity through them, even for the most seasoned couples who have been together for a long time, such gestures are a confirmation of love and affection for each other that goes beyond the conscious into the subconscious. human relationships is after all only 5% verbal, 95% everything else, and physical communication with contact and body language take upa good 50% of that 95.taking physical contact up the next step, we talk about holding hands, linking fingers, draping an arm over the shoulders of your partner, holding waists, hugs and chaste kisses. such contact, the simplest of all, holding hands, eleviate the relationship to an almost magical level when motivated by mutual feelings for each other. they create warmth, a cosy feeling in your stomach, a quickening of the heart, a sudden surge of endophines... they are the most ideal contact between a couple, nicely placed on a scale in my list above =d most ideal indeed, at least for me, a perfect show of love and also the glue in a relationship. however, if such contact are geared towards a sexual end, or if they are engaged with sexual intentions in mind, they can be detrimental to a relationship in the long term, unless done prior to an official engagement or marriage.so many young people nowadays cannot clearly differentiate for themselves the difference between sexual contact and physical contact. where one is an affirmation and strengthening of exisitng emotions, the other is a more primal form of lead-up to sexual intimacy and responsiblities and consequences they are not ready for. life and love can't be about sex, sex, sex, sex, sex all the time... immaturity and curiosity are poor excuse for degenerating something as wonderful and inexplicable as a love relationship between man and woman to a simple excuse for a free rut in a comfortable place.losing focus due to sleepiness, cutting to the chase, i think this entry is comprehensive enough as it is. though few may believe it, i strictly believe in physical contact, not sexual contact, in a relationship. sex is best left to after marriage. sometimes, reaching out to someone physically stretches beyond that, becoming a manifestation of a spiritual desire to get closer to the person... gonna fall asleep soon...think i better stop now, maybe after i get a wake-up booster then come back n add on

i guess talking about feelings, we also have to be watchful for the feelings of others as well. can't be me, me, me, me all the time right? : well, i realised upon re-reading my previous entry that some words are put too harshly and likely hurt her in the process as well...sigh...an effect that i deeply regret...when one blogs or writes down one's feelings, it is a natural tendency to let the words reflect one's mood at that point in time, especially with the intensity of extreme emotions such as anger or despair that one experiences at the point in time to make the matter seem important enough to blog down. thus, sometimes, what is written may be more than what actually exists, and the emotions reflected in those emotional moments may have been exaggerated...sigh...yet, the words are written down...they can't be taken back...whatever damage is done, is done. what can one do to reverse the process? nothing. one can only seek to undo the damage through reparative actions...sigh...the damaging nature of blogging. mayhap one should not blog anymore, or should not blog in moments of extreme emotions, or perhaps one should learn to blog about things that make other people happy...yes, indeed, one needs to learn how to blog about the happy moments with her, and about how happy she makes him feel most of the time. happiness should be shared. not misery.-==never seek to take back what is said or done, it can't be done. instead, try to make amends, lamenting about the past would not help the future. it is the action of the present that will avert the disaster of the past in the future.==-

feelings... 

why does she act so ashamed of his company? why does she go out of her way to show the world a non-chalance and an unfamiliarity with him? why act as though letting people know of her close acquaintance with him is the most unwanted thing in the world? ashamed of him then? embarassed of being associated with him then? then what for maintain the relationship if it is so "detrimental" to her reputation? why? why? he can only ask why...and he knows he can never confront her about this matter, being neither here nor there with her...plus knowing how easily she can excuse her actions and explain away the case studies he can cite, dismissing it as another case of overwrought nerves and over-sensitivity that characterises him. how can he ever tell her how much it hurts him, be it intentional or unintentional, to be treated like a shameful accessory. to be pretended into non-existance and to be avoided at all costs when in the eyes of the public, rather, the people of the institution they receive education in. makes him feel so bad, so unwanted, perhaps she may never understand how he feels at being treated as such, or perhaps she will deny everything and believe truly that she did nothing of that sort. well, it's just bloody obvious. bloody. obvious. to most everyone who knows the inside story. why treat him so...why...and then be totally different when away from the eyes of those people??? it is hurtful...it hurts, oh how it hurts.

just letting all the poison i have harboured out...since now i've either received the antidote or have been vaccinated 

1) today's point about feeling like the unwanted third party: just an addition to that, i just feel that my presence in your life and increasing significance(platonically speaking)has applied much unwanted pressures on you two. it seems that all the problems in your almost successful relationship begin when i truly stepped in...it just makes one feels kind of guilty...plus the pity i feel for him, especially from a third-person and neutral point of view, the desperation i see and the mistakes he continue to make...sometimes i feel apologetic for it and felt the urge to swallow my own passion and walk away. but as georgia and joanne counselled in the past (they may not rmbr now), i should stop feeling apologetic and having the "blame-me blame-me" attitude in my life anymore, and i should stop feeling guilt for if i truly do then it probably isn't a real passion n etc... can't say their words had much impact on me then...they could perhaps convince one side of me but not the others--probably the reason why i continually feel so then. well...at least it is much toned down now...what with what you said today...2) i don't hold any or much expectations of something more due to someone else being so-called "out of the running": can't bring myself to zhi zuo duo qing too much...have to see it to believe it...though i remain hopeful. will try not to overstep my bounds and not become a nuisance in your life. hope that perhaps one day i may be the one singing "a whole new world" to you...and truly doing as the song says. (the last point is one of my darkest and most unforgivable thought...please do not read on if you have a weak stomach or if you have a strong judgemental personality. must say that it was a thought that spawned in a moment of an almost complete loss of optimism and hope and that it has lurked in the darkest corners of my consciousness eversince.3) in my darkest hours, i entertained the thought that perhaps all these were simply a toying with my feelings (please let me finish...try to know me before you judge me) and simply the workings of an extremely cold person. another version of this dark untruth and manifestation of the deepest insecurity is that i am simply being used as a tool to make another person jealous and somehow in the long run, get their relationship even better. of course, i no longer believe in such theories now, but i guess i feel that i must talk about them...so you may perhaps have a deeper understanding of how come i become so irrational sometimes---because i was entertaining such absurd and extreme thoughts. forgive me.

long time no blog... 

well...nothing much to talk about...watched the news today on tv mobile...two bloggers charged for posting racist comments on their blogs and online forums...sheesh...fancy doing something like that in singapore where the racial harmony of society is fragile and easily broken...however, i think the government can't pretend that racism don't exist by simply ignoring it...we must cure the roots of the illness...not jus the symptoms...not that i'm racist of course...i may seem so but i'm not...i simply disapprove of certain actions and behavior of certain groups of people.ah well...think i'm gonna be chased out of the free-access room...i'll continue at home then

havent blogged for quite some time... 

since i'm still awake at this hour, i might as well blog a bit =) ah...today was a good day...in terms of enjoyment, but not, definitely not, in terms of study progress. damn...i really must get those gears kicked in and mug!!! someone motivate me...by studying with me!!! t_ton to another matter. tian ming's right...i really should learn to defend myself verbally. as he said, though i may believe firmly that i am right and whoever is maligning or have misunderstood me are mistaken and thus not worthy of contention from me. perhaps i feel that a retort is beneath me. whichever the case, as he cautioned, it can't be helped that some individuals would take silence or non-retaliatory action as a sign of admittance to whatever names or traits they may tag to me, harming my reputation with others as these people spread their delusions and lowering my standing for those who persist in their most mistaken course. tian ming told me that it will cause a disruption to my effectiveness in tasks and duties that involve cooperation with such people, for if they have a set and albeit mistaken view of my abilities and weaknesses, they may operate in a particular way to "compensate" for the "flaw". the low opinion of me plus the wrong assessment of my abilities would surely impede me in many things...especially so if those people are head-strong and narcissistic people who think themselves the best in the world.sigh...though it goes against my established habit, i guess it's time to start defending myself whenever i feel that an accusation, claim, assessment or anything said that concerns me is unfounded, letting people know the truth instead of secretly taking them for fools for being too stupid to see the truth. ignorance must be cured, though admittedly, stupidity is forever. for some, there is no cure for looking down on others or putting others down, it is simply, them. hate confrontations and aggression...dislike being directly competitive as well...will just have to morph myself to fit the requirements of today's superficial society that is rooted in the belief that "what you see is what you get". fools indeed.

i've been feeling down for the past few days due to some things, been thinking a lot lately, yet at the same time, feelings of irk and disappointment and anger and resignedness and neutrality reflect that i'm not using my mind enough..letting instincts take hold. what else can i do? unlike jieyi, i don't have a mark tan to come and tell me to be happy or to make me smile and cheer up...never had to depend on anyone to cheer me up cos i guess no one have ever tried to do that. sigh...gone are all the negative feelings...just too tired to let pig-headedness continue the reign of dark thoughts and feelings. just feel like throwing everything aside and then go sleep...if only i could...resigned...so resigned. resigned to accepting things as they come...following my life philosophy...i can never expect others to change to suit me, so i will mould myself to fit others. it's the only way...and i guess i'm quite used to it, compromising with other people, making a so-called "win-win" situation by losing out a little.i'm so tired of doing this. trying and trying... always taking the inititiative...could it then be taken to be fact that if the other side do not initiate, they are connoting beyond doubt their disinterest and irritation? just keep things plain enough for me to understand...a simple person like me needs things in black and white. heaven or hell...no waiting list...no empty promises. please.dunno why i'm so confrontational and provocative recently...maybe it's because of the nearness of mars to the earth...stirring all the basic war-like instincts...stirring them into a storm. things i would usually shrug off in the past i dally over now...digging my feet in and fighting teeth and claw...or resisting the urge to. argh. and being so very very...un-nice. every word or sentence said seems to be for picking a fight...everything potentially damaging in terms of propensity to stir up negative emotions. sigh. and being so very very sensitive now...everything under scrutiny. every single action. everything matters more...everything have to go my way or i feel bad tempered...sigh. a part of me wish to stop, yet another part is convincing the whole of me that if i don't assert myself now i never will...but it's going overboard..i need to switch mode...need to be in touch with nature...i cannot take this anymore...hating myself yet at the same time a sadistic glee at finally being more willing or uncontrollable in acting on negative emotions than penting them in

a storm of thoughts 

before this, before coming online...many, many different blogging approaches went through his mind as he showered...the water washing over him and the different envisioned blog entries washing over his mind...narratives, rants, bloody rows, self-piteous moaning, blame-placing, points of view, etc etc. so many things ran through his mind, so many ways to broach this subject...none quite hitting the point. finally, he has decided to be blunt. to cut to the chase and leave nothing more to guesswork and inference.first of all, he's sick of all these pretense and facades, all these halfway-theres and hanging in mid air...he loves her, and he wants to be with her. period. nothing else matters, not all the petty grievances, the imagined slights, the bouts of self-despair at losing out to another, the moments of great hurt and blame-placing...all over now. he knows not how to explain his actions today...know not how to explain how a person who is so good at acting and at concealing feelings and self-control can lapse so badly and in doing so, hurt her and push her further and further away from him into the other's embrace. how to avoid not feeling wretched? he tries, oh how he tried in the past, pretending non-chalance and pretending to be oblivious to things... he realises how wrong and damaging it can be as he sat there in stony silence and repelling her...yet he could not help himself until finally it is too late and the damage is done. the damage is done. and him, feeling so stupid and useless for allowing himself to fall into the spiral of such actions...has fled into a little confined world of his own...showing the rest of the world his smiles and his laughs, his clairvoyance and his wanton manner...when all the time, his mind was on her, and his soul filled with guilt and self-loathing. now...he dares but hope for forgiveness...knowing himself undeserving of such...wanting so much to call her and confess everything, yet afraid of what he may find on the other end of the line... wondering lost now...hoping against hope that she is not lost to him...hating himself for his insecurities and his flaws and his stubborness...wishing by some great miracle that she may understand and forgive...yet all the time telling himself that he deserve none. the only salvation for him, her...if such boorish behavior has not yet hardened her heart against him or turned her back forever, and if he could ever muster enough courage to overrule his guilt and ask her...and he still loves her...never wanting her to leave him...afraid, so afraid, that he has driven her from him forever.

licence for empathy 

ever heard of that? well...that's my newest conception now...a so-called right to understanding and appreciation and a feeling on another party's part of the heart going out to one...so when one feels one have no right to empathy...or rather no right to ask for empathy. no right to explanations...answers or anything. an ambiguous position also renders one ineffectual in terms of holding another responsible for actions n etc...okay...decided to stop le...after all...i did say that i want to let go of it all right?okay!!!! now i've let go.

words left unsaid 

how can one explain to someone the profound and utterly irrational connodrum of feelings of momentary anger, despair, hatred, despondency, betrayal, forgiveness, shock, self-pity and self-loathing, that, for want of a better word, is commonly called 'jealousy'? especially when that someone has never tasted love, never held anyone other than family to be of significant value, never wanted anyone else, never felt the pangs of heartache or delirious joy btoh as reactions to the object of affection? onem sut say that one would hardly be able to believe that this person can possibly understand what one may be going through. it's not the destructive passions that the negative, negative word 'jealousy' connotes, but just a simple, perhaps automatic reaction to certain acts one witness. less of the hot emotions as above-mentioned but more of the despair and pessimism that form the other side of the coin...and then one thinks, what right have one to be jealous? furthermore, what right does one hold that may actually allow one to explain such an emotion and reaction, when one is in no position to actually feel this way? you cannot justify a sense of loss over something you never had... and how do you expect to explain something when you're working on the pretext that such a thing is not supposed to happen anymore? don't worry if you do not understand what i write at first glance, just pay a little more attention, read between the lines and see the details not the general picture. everything is there if you just open your eyes... for the messages too...but it's likely that they must have been deleted. ah well.well, it' still no excuse for my unpredictable mood swing just now. do not expect any forgiveness or understanding from you. just hoping that one day, perhaps there will be someone who may truly understand and empathize with me and be able to rationalise my seemingly irrational actions and behavior...someone to share my happiness and sadness...someone who will be with me for my ups and downs...and me with hers. don't worry...i'm not blaming anything on you and not currying for any concessions from you...don't tkae anything to heart. the fault's all mine.so many things i can't do because certain things are not supposed to exist anymore...argh.

why are you so different in school and outside? so cold and distant and non-committal in school while you are so warm and endearing out of? is it such a bad thing for other people to know that you and i are, at the very least, good friends? the change in attitude inside and outside school is so glaring and obvious...sigh...just don't understand why there must be a change like this.the queen of so many hearts....so many people hold you secretly or openly in their hearts or are making plans to woo you...most of all...him.

wishing it were true... 

if it be a dream...let me never wake from it...if it be real, let it last forever, and improve and improve again and again...wishing so hard that it is not simply a dose of dreams and lots of wishful thinking...hoping against hope that, as prospectors might say, this time, i've struck gold. real gold.wishing it would last...that it would finally be proven true...aeyah...if ever it was proven that all my thinking and observations are true...that sensation...it would be like the moment of clouds and rain...a finer glimpse of heaven as i've yet to ever see...sigh...if only...if only. well, time will tell.as albus dumbledore said, "it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live"hopefully, some time down the road, this greatest dream of mine may become one with my life...making me possibly the happiest man alive in singapore... =)

i've reasoned it out..there's no reason to hurry...take things as they are now...hope for the best later...when we are better disposed to seriously consider such matters. happy where i am now =)seems a lot of people have been falling sick recently due to excessive stress or excessive muggerism...well, as i said, it's all in the mind...in whatever you do, you must practice the doctrine of being able to put down what you can/are carrying. not saying that you let go of the burden of studying, but that you let go of the strain you feel from carrying the burden. it's all about thinking in a different perspective about things...try it. also remember that the best way for avoiding getting too pressured while mugging is to try to mug effectively, and inject an element of fun into it. instead of memorising verbatim or trying to cram all the knowledge into your head...perhaps you might want to re-organise your information, by re-writing it in point, doing mind maps, drawing venn diagrams, etc. try to keep your mind active by devising more graphic ways of studying, instead of letting yourself sink into the endless drone of repetitive action. you can also take breaks in between mugging sessions and try to do some exercise, you'll be surprised at how energized you'll feel after about 5 minutes of exercising as a break from mugging. just remember the general rule, "inject fun and keep yourself on your toes, don't ever let yourself sink into a monotonous pattern of learning."

argh... 

why then, did you say 'thank you'? i dunno about you, but for me, sometimes a polite and distant answer to any explanation i gave actually hurts. a lot. it seems to say that the person is not hearing what i am saying, and is simply patronising me...haiz...nevermind. forget the incident...if you didn't understand me then, you won't understand me now...and if i misunderstood you then, i'm sorry.next time, please, don't feel obligated to do anything for me. no matter what the other party may be feeling, i always tend to think that he/she is making himself/herself worse off by obliging me, and thus will not enjoy doing whatever activity they are doing to oblige me. unless it is strongly proven from the start that any action is motivated by the person's own agenda, or that the person is in fact enjoying it, it would mean, to me, that he/she is doing things against his/her will...making me wander further into the lands of pessimism by thinking that, "if so, wouldn't any emotions or feelings or expressions or actions or what not thereafter in the activity be so-called 'fake'?" don't mind me...a paranoid person who have been deceived too many times by others will always suffer from paranoid thoughts. that's why i have such a strong need for affirmation or confirmation, because if not i will hu shi ruan xiang until i go crazy or i drive the person away from me.so unhappy at turning you off...it hurts me more to hurt you or make you angry or pissed or annoyed than it does with any perceived slights or trepasses against me.

... 

sometimes, one wishes to keep one's own company and be alone in one's thoughts yet other times one wishes so for companionship and a sense of belonging, to be loved and held, and to know that one's being loved and appreciated. the greatest gift for such a tormented and contradictory person would be another person, who can understand his needs minutely and gauge his moods and wishes...someone to understand. someone to have a heart. someone, to share his life with, simply because it is someone he will learn to love and will or already loves him deeply in return. all he needs and could wish for is for such a perfect person who can fathom his changes and understand and accept them, and not call him weird.

sometimes i just want to scream!!!...if only there is a song of great volume and power that reflects what i always feel sometimes...then i can sing my heart out... scream!!!! masquerade! hide your face so the world will never find you! so many faces to face the world...so many layers of thoughts and heart...while what faces the world smiles and laugh the most secret heart bleeds and suffers...getting across the little that i ask of you...seems a great impossible task...one piece of info for whoever is interested out there, it takes two hands to clap...and there's normally more than one contributing factor th the cuddling of the soup or milk...sigh...a lorn soul...a lorn soul...ice and fire...hot and cold...boiling hot and cold...elegance of mind and sweetness of manner...strength of mind and sweetness of manner......how you suffered for your sanity...they would not listen, they're not listening still...perhaps they never will.one central question: why!!why can't anyone see without him saying that a person who have been lonely all his life craves company...company who seeks him out rather than the other way round...or company that bothers to stick by him...for in the meer act of having people approach him to offer company he may feel accepted and perhaps more into the world. no longer the lone wolf or the outcast.

more thoughts... 

a true liking for another person should be a liking for the person's insides, not just mannerisms and way of life, but also his/her personality and life philosophy and values. don't people realise that good looks don't last forever, figures get worse with time, and passion is most fickle and impermanent? i once read a book on relationships, where the author dubs love as a house that a couple comes together to build. trust is its foundation, friendship its walls and passion its roof. without trust, the house would be unstable and eventually topple at the slightest storm. without friendship, a house without walls is no house at all. without passion, the inhabitants will be drenched with any storm. in fact, according to the author, love is 80% friendship, 15% trust and 5% passion. yet, we see so many misguided people nowadays apparently obssessed with the 5% of passion, the smallest component of love, only to find themselves in fast-deteriorating and filled with regret at making irrevocable committments due to a youthful infatuation. in fact, passion is the most impermanent component of love, bound to diminish and disappear within the span of a few years, even months, or weeks. the truth fount of continual strength and success in a love relationship lies in the building up of a great friendship and trust, from which passion can be easily created. the approach to relationship in the first place must be a genuine interest in friendship; an interest to uderstand and appreciate the person for who he/she is, followed by an establishment of trust between them so that the relationship is unshakable. passion comes in last, being the glue that sticks the relationship together. however, an approach to love simply due to passion and the establishment of friendship only because of the need to fulfil a sexual desire for the person hardly ever works out. it is the totally wrong motive for love, and any relationship where one side base his whole committment on passion is doom to failure.in the end, stripped of all the hugs and kisses and holding hands and moonlight walks; of all the conversations and the teases and the jokes and the laughter and the tears, love is simply, at its barest, a shared desire between two individuals to stay together and be with each other. as the famouse christian marraige oath says, "i, y, take you, x, to be my lawfully wedded wife. i promise to be true to you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health till death do us part,"  where it is a decision to stay together as a conscious decision. a conscious will to stay together. well, love may be felt in differing intensities by different people, some people feel passion strongly and thus love is an unmistakable feeling for them as they feel passion whenever they are near their intended. others, find it harder to identify love in their own feelings, having no significant biological reactions to such a feelings at its budding stage. such individuals may turn to instead examine their psychological reaction to certain people, maybe feeling exceptionally glad to see the person, be in his company or spend time with him. some feel a sense of nervousness in such situations while others seem to let down their guard more and reveal more of themselves than normal. in most cases, girls tend to be more girlish or shy while guys try to act more manly or mature. in time, most fall into a comfortable reaction to each other, presenting (so rarely in casual society) their true selves to each other.how could someone actually proclaims "love" for another person based on her "sex appeal" and "figure"?? though some girls might find this type of reasons for liking to be flattering, but any person with depth of thought and real understanding would see the claim to be a superficial and perhaps even disturbing one. further so if the person sought to cover up such a flaw by mentioning, as an after thought, how much he likes her "other traits", finishing with a lame example that is not unique at all, to say the least. gods! such superficilaity and such a poor attempt to conceal what is clearly and simply a case of over-wrought hormones and a vast tendency to think with the head down there and not the head on the shoulders...sex appeal is after all a phrase full of sexual connotations, and before one gets one's mind clouded with romantic misinterpretation, please consider the true meaning, it means simply that you are good enough to bed; to fornicate with; to arouse him by. further more, the person's comparison of you to other females purely in terms of figure and sex appeal shows how much regard he has for anything else, again the famous immature mistake of going for looks and appearance. ergo, thinking with the head down there. worst thing would be the attempt to cover up with a lame excuse for an actual liking. okay, shall cease my tirade here, seeing as i have lapse uncharacteristically into undiplomatic speech...

my sister (real blood sister) was stalked by this guy in an army uniform yesterday, big size and wear black horn-rimmed specs...all the way from the bus stop to the provision shop to our void deck and all the way up to the 12th floor (one floor below ours). she only noticed him under our void deck when she was opening letter box...then she took another lift up, which will require her to walk along the 12th floor corridor and then up one flight of stairs to our house, when she board she saw him walked away so she thought she was safe. then, he appeared at the flight of stairs she had to take at the 12th floor!! she called me while in the lfit lar so i came out n "rescued" her, she shouted into the phone upon seeing him for me to quickly open the door...and i did lar...then the guy ran off. now she's really paranoid and wants me to escort her home from the busstop every single day...i don't mind lar, but yar lar. her boyfriend's bying her a fang lang qi (directly trasnlated as wolf warding machine...haha) asap...so anyway, i gotta watch out for her. as to that guy, since he even knows to wait for her at the 12th floor means he must have "researched" her before...thus the greater the danger. if he lets me catch him, he'll have a taste of what i used to give those malay or chinese ah bengs...so all girls out there, beware!!! make sure you try to get some form of self-defense for yourself, cos you never know when such a stalker may just pounce on you! take care!anyway, today...dint go to chs cos i got my time table wrong and i couldn't actually make it for the meeting there, which was at 3pm...oh well. ran 10 rounds with vanessa and then went for a spat of basketballing...find that i can only use less than 50% of my usual skills when playing with my class...perhaps the atmostphere isn't there or maybe just cos like i said before, the stronger the opponents, the stronger i am. and, it continues.

ah well, on to happier things.. 

storm clouds can't crowd my skies all the time, dark hours won't last past dawn, and blah blah blah and yadda yadda yadda...so, oh well, pick myself up again eh? don't expect anyone to understand what i'm going through or been through, don't think anyone would take the effort to crack this hard nut anyway. hrumph.i just feel like being selfish now...really really self-centered and etc...just to see what it's like. spoil myself utterly...haiz~throw off the burdens of al other people...please, no more...consultation closed till further notice. on holiday from myself, so to speak.--the strongest and proudest fall the hardest--

stonewalling tactics...ah well... 

most times when met with a stone wall, i'll patiently try to knock it down, bit by bit, perhaps using a chisel? but not today, sigh, just feeling too...too worn out to really care about prudence and being nice and endurance and anything...so tonight, one of few times, i meet a stone wall with a bigger stone wall of my own. for once, let the other side break the silence. it's one of those days when i ask, "why me?" why always me to be the first to back down, first to initiate, first to speak, first to do anything? sigh

sometimes you just don't feel like smiling... 

but then, one has found that it is far better for the world around you if you just keep on smiling. don't want to cause negative externalities now, do we? so, even when one's down and out and really really feels like one's at the bottom of the deepest bottomless pit available, one would keep smiling. no use affecting others with your bad mood right, and causing others concern...one person suffering is enough. sigh. though sometimes one may feel like showing one's feelings just to get attention and probably comfort, where in life's weakest moments, it's company that will help one to stand up again...but sometimes things don't happen the way one wants them to. better then to subscribe to the theory that "misery loves company" and thus avoid ever showing one's troubles or unhappiness to others. maybe, also because, they would never understand or empathise. sympathy is not what one wants, but empathy.

my pet peeves 

1) people who are so selfish and self-centered, and cannot even spare a little time in their self-consumed world to help other people. (eg gnsy)2) people who are irresponsible in their words and actions, and careless in their promises. they don't deliver what they promise, nor do they have enough sense of appropriateness by being proactive in the completion of their task.3) people who adopt double standards; who preach one thing and do another. (eg cis who drill their cadets to be punctual while they themselves cannot be early)4) people who are so full of themselves and keep thinking that they're so cool.5) anyone who pisses me off.6) smoke. cigaretter smoke. especially irritating when concentrated in an area...grr...hate it...and i'm a person who don't hate easily, so you can imagine the extent of dislike for smoke.7) getting angry. i don't like being angry or pissed or outraged...and you won't like it too. it destroys my harmony.sigh. felt so irritable just now...towards the end of the night...yucks...hate that feeling. hating the feeling of being irritable rendered me even more irritable...almost wanted to beat up those #$#%$%$%@# smokers at the food centre...if they want to kill themselves, fair enough. just don't try to kill others too!!! almost lost control...and some stupid idiot pai kias dared to stare at me...at least they knew to back off at the last minute. sigh...my fiery temper coming back to haunt me...if i were a girl i would say that it's my time of the month perhaps, but alas, i am not. if not for my iron control something would have happened just now. argh. at least now i'm much better after a cold shower. *shrugs* maybe like my friend said, i'm "emitting too much heat" due to lack of sleep...better go sleep then. was kinda hoping to see you online but then...oh well.--ren yi shi, feng ping lang jing. tui yi bu, hai kuo tian kong--

haha...don't think anyone will ever really understand me, no matter how well they think they do. =) they may know my personalities, know my qualms and nuances and my likes, but no one will be able to grasp n thus pre-empt how i think. =) haha...though i secretly seek to be understood...think this is too great a task even for me to accomplish...thinking pattern just too hard to describe to another person le =pto my number two special person...don't keep seeing through my mask lehz...force me to keep buying thicker ones...very bad lehz...make me even more broke...anyway, k lar, i promise you to try to do what you ask of me k? =) and, truly, you have my respect (maybe not for those things that you can't match up to me, though i still do respect you for your achievements in said areas or your differing style) for many, many things...haha treat me to lunch and i'll tell you :p

happy birthday singapore!!! 

nationaly day...the 40th40th anniversary of our independence...such celebrations always move me...dunno why, i put a lot of stock by these values of nationhood and identity and loyalty to country and people sort of things...wild sense of national pride rife in me...woohooo...hehehat the same time, a certain group of people comes to mind...those who feels no sense of belonging to singapore, who feels that other places are better, or those who worship the ang mos or those who fervently wish to be one of them and not one of us...etc, the sort of people who would rather migrate than stay, who would leave singapore if ever we are threatened with war...those who always praise other places except singapore and etc etc...these people...haiz~ too bad that i know so many of such...for every singaporean who feel he/she belongs to singapore, there exist half a person who don't...it's really sad...and those 'bananas' especially irk me...sigh.haha seems like i'm not such a nice person after all...i do dislike and i do have strong opinions against certain people...oh well, that's life, ain't it?long live singapore...my country, my home.

random thoughts... 

...hope the nuances of language that i attach so much value to are not totally lost on certain people. learn to pay attention to the details and not the whole picture, the vjc prelim passages were indeed meaningful. people nowadays don't pay enough attention to things...the details of things to be exact. they see the whole picture and then they move on...sigh....some people just cannot understand certain things. it's a fact of life. deal with it....over-reaction is a flaw of mine. certain things are misread or read too deeply....if taken in faith that a wrong impression is simply that, well, then i never had one. if you didn't expect something to happen, you won't have the impression that something was happening....appreciation and understanding don't come together. the latter is harder than the former, and more often disregarded. or unachieved....an increasing number of people today operate on interest, not loyalty....this world is coming to an idealist's end, idealistic people who still believe in outdated concepts of honour and chivalry that are so scorned at today will suffer greatly in this new world order of pragmatism and individual interest...."you have to feel it to know it" is an inaccurate expression. if you never knew it, you don't know that it is what it is when you feel it. inability to identify the presence of something that you never knew means you likely pretend it don't exist or do so unconsciously....some people cannot bring themselves to listen to and considerthe opinions of others, for they start from the position that they are right. all the time....some people may guarantee one thing, yet in reality, do another. a guarantee or promise of constancy may just be shown to be the farce or over-confident boast that it is with an anticipated change....other people should stop lying to themselves....some have tears for others' plight. none for their own. eyes forever dry for themselves...it seems their tears were never theirs to shed. perhaps, both a blessing, and a curse....why do we fall? to learn to pick ourselves up again... why do we fall...why do we fall...why......some things never change....some people think that pity is best assuaged through affirmative action. it simply delays the impact of the truth on the poor deluded soul....well, some people like to stay deluded. a world of their own; a personal fantasy....understand what i am not saying. not many will....next time, do not bother to read through an article if you harbour any pre-suppositions and prejudices. it is a waste of your time, for you are simply re-affirming the misconceptions that you already hold....misunderstood. and alone. loneliness comes from not being understood. not being accepted unconditionally.
