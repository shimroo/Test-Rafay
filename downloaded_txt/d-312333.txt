history and family lore of our walker family 
our goal in creating this website is to pass on to our children and grandchildren a legacy of our family history that might well have been lost. i wish to acknowledge and give thanks to all the people who have shared their walker and related families information so it could be placed here to help other researchers.
in memorial: duck, francis earl - suddenly on february 21st, 2014 at the norfolk general hospital in his 79th year. loving and best friend of his wife, marjorie (nee utman). devoted father of sons bill and bob (christa) and daughter lori. grandfather of emily and bradley. he will be missed by his brother danny (camilla) and predeceased by his brother gordon. also predeceased by his father gordon and by his mother mary beeley (ed). brother-in-law of john and eileen chesney. he will be sadly missed by his many nieces, nephews, aunts and uncles.
personal note: francis duck, who worked tirelessly to help locate sources in canada passed away in february 2014. we had developed a close albeit distant relationship with frank and his wife marjorie. the majority of the ontario walker information in ontario is due to his hard work. fortunately we had traveled to ontario the previous october to research at yet another source frank had found, but it was still a sad shock to hear of his death so soon after our visit. frank you will be missed.
the transcriptions of conversations, from books and maps that are listed on this site are copies from the original works by the authors and should be viewed as such. all information concerning deceased individual(s) names are public record and as such will be posted. any individual(s), still living, will not have their addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses posted unless they have given their consent. it has always been our goal to provide all this information freely to any of the family members who are interested. unfortunately, i have been informed that portions of the information here are being posted, out of context, on "for profit" sites and being attributed to me and this website as the source. therefore, any reproduction of the information on this website for profit, or other then private use only, is prohibited.
note: if you have any corrections or additions to any of these families please email me directly at the address shown on the bottom of each page. i have received quite a few emails from people asking for additional information about our family. however, when i try to respond to their email it is blocked from getting return mail. make sure the email address you send your request from can be replied to. thank you.

eldest ancestor
william walker family
researcher note: possible father of william w. walker the 2nd is william w. walker the 1st from clones, monaghan, ireland.
dna participant contact: w.r. walker - wrwalkerll@yahoo.com
historic note: alamance county, nc was originally part of orange county, nc, the county immediately to the east. alamance county was officially proclaimed a county in april of 1849. the boundary to the north finds caswell county, south is chatham county, and west is guilford county. there is little information on william walker. he owned property on hogans creek. hogans creek is in rockingham county, nc, and flows in a northeasterly direction through that county and caswell county until it empties into the dan river. that area is on the far western edge of orange county as it existed in 1769. walker also named, as his executor, john robertson, whose name matches that of a man known to have lived on country line creek since 1761. what this means is that the walkers lived in an area that today is the southeastern corner of rockingham county.
family and dna note: i wish to thank david walker davwal@netease.net for sharing his family history which was written down by his father, william pinckney walker jr. in 1961. some time after 1869, aaron h. walker wrote in his biography: "my ancestors as far back as i can learn came from ireland and settled in maryland in or about what year, i have never been able to learn - only that it was before the war for independence. my great grandfather was named john, and in company with one of his brothers, philip, moved and settled in orange county, n.c., about 10 miles north west of hillsborough before the revolutionary war and as a soldier took part in it on the side of the colonies, and for independence. my great grandfather john married a miss ashford and they had eleven sons, but no daughters. my (aaron) parents raised three sons and four daughters.
