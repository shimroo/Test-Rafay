endless stories: manuscripts, knowledge and translation in the 17th century
 in 1632, cambridge university library was transformed by an extraordinary collection of manuscripts in a dazzling array of languages. collected by a visionary thinker, thomas van erpe, and on display for the first time, these unique items and the stories they tell shine a light on a 400-year-old quest for knowledge through the languages of the world.
