the society for barefoot living

we come from all walks of life, across the globe, and simply prefer to go barefoot.
we value the comfort, health benefits and sensory pleasures of barefoot living.

going barefoot is the gentlest way of walking and can symbolise a way of living — being authentic, vulnerable, sensitive to our surroundings. it’s the feeling of enjoying warm sand beneath our toes, or carefully making our way over sharp rocks in the darkness. it’s a way of living that has the lightest impact, removing the barrier between us and nature.
— adele coombs, “barefoot dreaming”

the society for barefoot living (sbl) has, since 1994, advocated for barefoot freedom.  we offer three officially endorsed entities: this website, an sbl member email group, and facebook.
