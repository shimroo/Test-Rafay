lindbergh does it! to paris in 33 1/2 hours; flies 1,000 miles through snow and sleet; cheering french carry him off field
new york times, may 21, 1927
early in the morning on may 20, 1927 charles a. lindbergh took off in the spirit of st. louis from roosevelt field near new york city. flying northeast along the coast, he was sighted later in the day flying over nova scotia and newfoundland. from st. johns, newfoundland, he headed out over the atlantic, using only a magnetic compass, his airspeed indicator, and luck to navigate toward ireland. the flight had captured the imagination of the american public like few events in history. citizens waited nervously by their radios, listening for news of the flight. when lindbergh was seen crossing the irish coast, the world cheered and eagerly anticipated his arrival in paris. a frenzied crowd of more than 100,000 people gathered at le bourget field to greet him. when he landed, less than 34 hours after his departure from new york, lindbergh became the first person to fly solo across the atlantic ocean. more
