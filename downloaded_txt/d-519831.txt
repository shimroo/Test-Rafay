tulpa is a fascinating retrospective of twenty-two years of curtis k. hughes’s creative work, ranging from a brief marimba solo to a major work for large ensemble. elegant in form, restless, and expressively rich, these seven works performed by some of boston’s most outstanding artists, reveal hughes to be an imaginative and deeply talented composer.
