new beginnings, happy ending
once we were on a path of death. this path was traveled often with many signs warning us to exit immediately, but we ignore them. we met others on this path of death and although we witness them meet the destination that this path led to, we continued as if we were blind. some of us at times met those that by human or divine intervention took to heart the warning signs and exited the path. even though we heard these folks the warnings, we continued. even when we saw with our own eyes that once they exited the path they had a new beginning, we continued. we continued until in desperation we sought help. in doing so we too, had a new beginning and our path now leads to a happy ending.
