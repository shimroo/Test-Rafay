who we are
for more than 25 years, mapping solutions has guided businesses, government agencies and organizations – helping them harness the power of geographic information to transform decision-making, operations, and ultimately…the lives of the people they serve.

how we help
mapping and geographic information visualization makes a difference. imagine selecting a site for a new bank branch in an up and coming area. what if you could spot demographic trends before property prices go up…and before the competition even has a clue? what if you could improve customer satisfaction by 5%…and reduce customer churn by 10%? help chart a new strategic territory for the sales team to mine? geographic information makes it possible, and mapping solutions is there to guide you through the process.
