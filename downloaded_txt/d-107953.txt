tam's old race car
site
it's 1961, the scarabs have been sold
to new owners in the midwest and the cobra project is still fulminating
in the mind of carroll shelby.  in the interim, california
road courses
are dominated by maserati type 61 "birdcages" and jurassic-era v8
powered
specials.  the photos on this site document an age when the
power
source was still in front, and giants like bill krause, bob drake, ken
miles and others ruled west coast racing.  at least they
seemed like
giants to me, at 13. 





who's that goofy-looking kid (me at 13)
standing
by ed leslie's lotus 20 in front of the old leslie motors in
monterey? 
i'd received a voigtlander bessa i medium
format camera for my birthday and i used it to take photos at
california
sports car races between july, 1961, and april, 1962.  i've
carefully
saved these treasured possessions over the decades.
in july, 2000, old friend and 427 cobra
racer mac archer
convinced me to create a website to share  these photos with the world.. over
the years, other photographers have contributed
their work to the site, seen below in the sections for "1950s racing" and
"1960s racing".  
"my photos..." below includes my
recent photography
from today's historic racing events.

race site is loaded with cool pics of some of the most classic cars
