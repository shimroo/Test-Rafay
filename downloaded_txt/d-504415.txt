public bathing notice
no soap, shampoo or bio-soap/shampoo 
								allowed in hot springs! avoid being fined!
public hot springs are not bathing facilities 
								and do not have 'plumbing' like that of 
								commercial, improved hot springs. soap and 
								shampoo (including biodegradable soap and 
								shampoo) do not completely breakdown naturally. 
								this pollutes our water systems (ingested by 
								fish, animals, humans) at or near the source. 
								this is also illegal in most wilderness and 
								public lands areas.
