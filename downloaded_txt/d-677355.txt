about us

              noia provides subspecialty spine and musculoskeletal expertise through its national teleradiology network
              to over 65 hospitals and imaging centers in 12 states. all studies referred to noia are interpreted by fellowship
              trained spine or msk radiologists with years of experience working together to provide a best in class
              level of expertise at all times.
            


the noia team

                although located in three different time zones, noia radiologists work together from a common work list,
                allowing timely readings on all cases, including stat reads and cases referred on weekends. the common
                work list also allows multiple subspecialists to immediately review complicated cases. the radiologists
                are available for direct consultation by centers and referring physicians on protocols and results. the
                reports are concise, complete and accurate.
              



partner support
noia works with its imaging center partners in the identification and purchase of technical equipment, training
                and support of technical staff, and providing access to noiaâs national purchasing contracts for imaging center supplies. noia
                radiologists actively work with the network sites to leverage their expertise in helping the centers market in their communities to
                enhance musculoskeletal and spine referrals.
