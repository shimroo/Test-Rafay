care for complex conditions

patients come to our hospitals with serious conditions such as respiratory failure, complex wounds, sepsis, stroke, congestive heart failure, or even a combination of these. their diagnoses are often complicated by existing health problems like diabetes or copd. many of our patients require treatments such as mechanical ventilators, dialysis, or iv therapy.
