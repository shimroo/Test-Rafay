about us








            who we are
          










created in 1974, akpirg is a non-profit, non-partisan, citizen-oriented statewide membership organization, researching, educating and advocating on behalf of the public interest. akpirg advances the public interest by providing individuals with the opportunity and the information to participate equally in and be treated equally by our economic, social and political systems.








            what we do
          










from consumer protection, identity theft and fraud, to voting rights, ethical government and clean energy, akpirg has been pursuing policies that give ordinary alaskans a voice that can be heard.we are working towards a world of self-determined, thriving communities governed by people, not corporations.








            how we organize
          










on october 11, 2019, akpirg officially adopted the jemez principles, an agreement for democratic organizing created in 1996. these principles include:be inclusiveemphasis on bottom-up organizinglet people speak for themselveswork together in solidarity and mutualitybuild just relationships among ourselvescommitment to self-transformation you can read these principles in full here.


















land acknowledgmentakpirg recognizes the indigenous land on which all alaskans live. akpirg works to ensure the rights of people who are often sidelined, and to create healthy and thriving communities. our work is done with the understanding that corporations should not have undue influence in our systems of government, especially as corporations are recent constructs and many different types of government have existed on this land for tens of thousands of years. alaska is an indigenous place, comprised of 227 federally recognized tribes, and our work takes place on unceded sovereign land. this fact informs our work and our lives. akpirg staff and board live on and are stewards of sugpiaq, dena’ina, auk kwáan, taku kwáan, lower tanana dene, gwichyaa zhee gwich’in, denaakk’e, and yup’ik lands and nations.
