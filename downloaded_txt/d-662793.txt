new carol ayotte show 
on display until february 2024
all our shows are free, open to the public
my work has gone through many stages.  this show of red, white and black stems from my love of jigsaw puzzles.  i decided to start with a pile of fabric scraps that i could cut up into pieces and make a design.  once i had the basic design plan, i then filled areas that needed color with primary colors to complete the design.  at this point i liked adding a 3-d effect to some areas.  these pieces are really serendipity - but keeping with the rules of design.

 colorful pre-cut strip fabric quilts made in our classes are on display in our gallery through september, 2023.  due to space limitations, the display will rotate.   all these quilts are beautiful and well made.   see a few below.
