a lifelong passion
jacqueline hairston 


  jacqueline hairston is an accomplished pianist and composer and
  continues living out her dreams to this day. she has been
  passionate about music for as long as she can remember and as a
  young girl,  would drum her fingers along the kitchen table,
  pretending to play the piano. her parents quickly noticed and she
  began piano lessons. her passion never waned and her impressive
  talents earned her an invitation to perform at world-renowned
  carnegie hall.
