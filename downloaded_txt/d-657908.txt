areas of practice 



family law

 

family law includes everything  that matters:  your children, your spouse, and potentially everything you own.  we have extensive experience helping individuals from  simple modifications and enforcements to complex cases involving multi-million dollar marital estates with multiple businesses.  we work with our clients to develop and execute a litigation strategy to resolve their case.  



business law

 

each business faces unique challenges it must address to continue to thrive and avoid risk.  we work with businesses to address those risk before problems arise, and then through the litigation process to enforce their rights and protect the businesses they worked so hard to build.  



torts

 

when a person or business causes you or your business damage, we have the experience to help you recover the damages you are owed.
