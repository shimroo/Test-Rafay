the schmohz brewing company
schmohz is home to one of the oldest breweries in grand rapids.  originally opened as robert thomas in 1997, schmohz purchased the brewery in 2004 and has been making beer there ever since.
we have 16 taps which allows us to offer a variety of styles, flavors and colors.  the tap room has a pool table, ping pong table (which sits on the pool table), pin ball, ms pacman and darts.   we have a variety of board games and many decks of cards.  if your looking for someone to play euchre or cribbage with, just ask at the bar, there is usually a few people that would be happy to sit in on a game or two.
check out our daily specials, especially brewers choice on  wednesday where we offer special pricing on a different beer each week.
we are a family owned business and appreciate your support in keeping the craft brewing tradition alive.
