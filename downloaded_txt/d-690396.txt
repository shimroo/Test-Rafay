electoral legislation passes parliament
electoral reforms recently passed parliament. changes in the electoral legislation amendment (electoral reform) bill 2024 cover:

the commonwealth funding and disclosure schememodernisation of some election processes.
the aec will provide further information when the bill receives royal assent.












redrawing boundaries: nsw, vic, wa & nt
this electoral cycle, federal boundary redistributions are
                                    occurring in new south
                                        wales, victoria,
                                    western
                                        australia and the northern territory.
                                
a redistribution is an independent, highly consultative and
                                    data-driven process that runs over the course of
                                    approximately one year. once completed, any new names and boundaries apply at the
                                    next federal election.
go to the dedicated
                                        redistributions website to view
                                    public input, proposals and final boundaries for each redistribution when
                                    they’re available.













preferential voting 
the preferential voting system used for the house of
                                    representatives means that multiple counts of ballot papers occur to determine who
                                    has acquired an absolute majority of the total votes (more than 50% of formal
                                    votes). it is a similar process for the senate however, each senate contest will
                                    elect multiple representatives where multiple counts of ballot papers occur to
                                    determine which candidates have achieved the required quota of formal votes to be
                                    elected. 
during the counting process, votes are transferred between
                                    candidates or parties according to the preferences marked by voters. in the house
                                    for example, if your first preference of candidate isnât elected, your vote moves to
                                    your next preference and so on.
