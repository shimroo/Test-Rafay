the arizona water well association was formed in 1957 and reorganized in 1977 to become an effective voice for the state’s water well industry, continuously assisting members of the arizona water well industry.
our objectives are to assist, promote and support the interests and welfare of all phases of the water well industry. to achieve these, we work to advance well construction and development methods and to advance the science of ground water hydrology. harmony and cooperation are sought among contractors, suppliers, technical personnel and government agencies.
to help meet these objectives, the arizona water well association offers members a quarterly newsletter (the” well said”), a membership directory, meetings, and educational seminars throughout the state. it has also created a state-wide public relations program.
the arizona water well association also assists in developing state licensing requirements and work on ground water and drilling controls.
