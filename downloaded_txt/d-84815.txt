i must say that the level of customer service that we have consistently received from southern shores realty after three consecutive years of renting the same condo has been outstanding. in particular, troy, vanessa and suzanne were all wonderful to deal with, and their level of concern for our stay certainly made us feel like family! wonderful folks who truly understand that a vacation isn't just about getting there, it's about your experience after you're already there. thanks for another great trip!

my family and i just celebrated our 53rd year at southern shores and in that time have exclusively used southern shores realty for all of our rentals. simply put they are the best. never had one problem and can't say enough about their very friendly staff. they go out of their way to make your rental and your vacation a very enjoyable experience. also their service department responds very quickly to any requests to fix any problems that may occur during your stay. highly recommended you contact them.
