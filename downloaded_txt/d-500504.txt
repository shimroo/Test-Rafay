the portage county cultural festival is genuinely fun for the entire family.  the kids corner has hands on activities like bracelet making, story telling, arts and crafts, origami animals, buddha rubbings, rainbow necklaces and so much more.  throughout the festival there are literally thousands of new ways to learn about the many cultures of portage county.  visitors can take lessons on how to speak japanese, learn about kenyan arts and crafts, taste food from vietnam, india, poland and many more.



maybe the best part, it's free to attend.  there is a cost for the food, but all music, dance, arts and crafts demonstrations, language lessons, kids activities, and so much more are free to enjoy all day long.  thank you to our sponsors for helping us keep this event free.the portage county cultural festival is fortunate to be organized 100% by the volunteer efforts of portage county.  there is not a single paid employee of the festival.  when you think of the scope of this event, it's truly a testament to our community that we're able to support the festival year after year.
