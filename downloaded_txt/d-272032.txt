	 this town needs an enema!!
	 
    


      i gotta get out of here.  but first, let me deal with how i left yesterday's post.--i'm fine.  it was only a joke to mention that i was hoping it was food poisoning.  meaning, that when one takes toxic medications -as i do- and has to throw up first thing in the morning (or any other time of day now that i think of it!!) one hopes that it isn't a bad reaction to the drugs that one is taking to stay alive.after all, i've mentioned before how many different drugs that i've been on - many of which are no longer even used.  yes, they were that bad.  i've also mentioned how one of the drugs has twice (!!) put me in the hospital.  oh... and then there were the shots.  ugh.but, since i've been on this current regimen, i've been pretty okay.  my scores are getting better each time, and i should be seeing the doctor again soon.  i'll admit, i've been putting it off, but only because it is so hard to make it to that side of town (where the va clinic is) and not miss very much work.it is either a failing in me or an asset: i don't like to miss work.  ever.  so the spell of vomiting passed, just as quickly as it showed up.  i'm fine, haven't tossed my cookies since.  nor felt like it.  i appreciate you all asking, though.--i'm moving soon.  the colors just aren't doing it for me.  the decoration?  the pits.labels: fucking blogger, hiv, life, meds

	 no sleep...
	 
    


      well, some, just not enough.thehusband and i met some friends for dinner last night.  a great time was had by all, and i'll leave you all to figure that out on your own.  you are probably getting tired of hearing about the orlando bloggers and their food functions by now.thehusband went to bed earlier than me, unusual i should point out.  typically this means he had too much to drink the day before (which, btw, he did not) or he isn't feeling well, and doesn't know it yet.  so as i went in there, i noticed he was already asleep, with the bitch cat next to him, as she normally is.  the bed and the bedroom are hers, don't you know.after i got in, something unusual happend.  thehusband's favorite cat came in the room, got on the bed -on my side- and started purring and making a little pocket nest next to me.  i should also point out that this cat's favorite daddy is not me...so not only did i have to sleep lightly so that i wouldn't roll over and crush him (he stayed there all night), i couldn't turn over and fall into a deep sleep, because  if i did, the bitch cat would probably wake up in the middle of the night, realize he was there and attack!!!  how's that for an arousal?  you laugh, but it has been known to happen.thehusband woke up at 0200 and was awake until 0400.  i finally got out of bed at 0500, and in the midst of making coffee, realized that i needed to throw up.  i barely made it back to the sink before the vile concocction of last nights pills errupted from the pit of my stomach.  then, the sweating, stuffy nose, and shaking started.how sad am i that i'm hoping it was food poisoning?labels: hiv, life, meds

	 danger!!  danger!!!
	 
    


      if you receive an email entitled "bedtimes" delete it immediately.  do not  open it.   apparently this one is pretty nasty.   it will not only erase everything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your computer. it demagnetizes the stripes on all of your credit cards. it reprograms your atm access code, screws up the tracking on your vcr, and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any cd's you attempt to play. it will program your phone auto dial to call only 0898 numbers.  this virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank.it will cause your toilet to flush while you are showering.  it will drink all your beer.  for god's sake, are you listening??  it will leave dirty underwear on the coffee table when you are expecting company.  it will replace your shampoo with nair and your nair with rogaine.   if the "bedtimes" message opened in a windows 95/98 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub. it will not only remove the forbidden tags from your mattresses and pillows, it will  also refill your skim milk with whole milk.*** warn as many people as you can. ***and if you don't send this to 5000 people in 20 seconds, you'll fart so hard that your right leg will spasm and shoot straight out in front of you, sending sparks that will ignite the person nearest you. send this warning to everyone!!! there's a lot of sadness in the world!  right now, as you read this, 17 million people are having sex!!! and look at you - you're on the computer!!!!(p.s. i'd like to take credit for this, but i can't.  it was in an email from my eldest brother.  except the picture, i found that somewhere else.)labels: humor

	 i forgot to mention...
	 
    


      ... in this morning's post:on the walk back to spider's cottage, as we passed the restaurant we'd eaten at a few hours ago, i noticed one of our local celebrities... lauren rowe.  lauren sat at my table a few months ago at the poker tourney.she had that same look on her face: "i know you."  of course, this time she was right, but she couldn't place me, i could tell.  i stopped, said "hey!!", and asked if i could see the baby (since she was sitting right there, in a stroller).  cute - as if i'd be surprised.  lauren is a damned hottie, as is her husband.  all kinds of the typical baby fat that one is supposed to have at five months old.  the baby was not enjoying the heat, was my impression, but she was giggling and/or smiling.  or she could have been passing gas... it is so hard to tell at that age.  i'm sure lauren's hottie husband was inside ordering they're food.  it was tempting to go in and look.i wish i'd asked about her co-anchor jacquie.  i wanted to know when jacquie was going to announce that she was pregnant again.  i giggle every morning when she tugs at her clothes to hide the impending baby-weight she's been putting on.  and that one day she worked the morning news from 0500 to 0630 and then suddenly disappeared, and the "traffic" reporter had to finish the last half-hour of news.i just want conformation that it was morning sickness that made her leave that day.labels: life

      saturday, thehusband started clearing out the garage, to make room for the freezer we bought a few weeks ago.  now i figure you might be wondering if i helped him, aren't you?  well, in a word, no.  it wasn't my shit.  he took two loads to a storage unit, and one to the landfill.  i would have taken it all to the landfill.besides, knowing that we had plans for brunch on sunday, i had to get some of my sunday chores (tm) done.  so i started on laundry.  until i got bored with it and stopped.  funny how the interest i have in doing laundry lasts about as long as it takes to get my laundry clean... as once i start on thehusband's, i pick up a book, put in a dvd, or just flip through the 74 channels on this cable system.  note to self: get a cable box for more options.sunday, thehusband and i met spider and sorted for brunch.  we sat outside this week, but so did some young couple with four, count 'em, four, stair step little girls.  obviously, they've been using the rhythm method of birth control.  after a walk around lake eola, and more conversation, thehusband and i headed back to the house.  he went back out to the garage (i have no idea what he was doing) and i took a nap.  about two hours later, i began dinner.  i made some cuban black bean soup (mikell's version), beef bbq ribs, and corn-on-the-cob.  it was the first time i'd made the soup, and the reason it was "my" version is because thehusband has pilfered some of the ingredients over the last week, so i had to make substitutions.  it was still quite yummy.how's this for extremes?  yesterday we hit record highs in the 90's.  tomorrow, we'll hit record lows in the 40's.labels: bloggers, life, thehusband

	 an explanation...
	 
    


      ... about yesterday.a week ago, i would have had no second thoughts about putting up yesterday's post.  but i almost didn't.  not because it didn't happen (from my point of view), because it did... but because now people know who it is i am referring to in the post, and i don't want them to get the wrong idea about him.  let me try to explain with a bit of a story.this weekend, as has been blogged about completely about, i made a few statements before anything was said.example 1: when i broached thehusband about meeting spider, sorted, et al for dinner saturday night, i told him that he might hear about things i said here, and if he had any questions, to ask.   this wasn't necessary (it turns out), but i also prepared him by showing him my first post.yes.  it was a preemptive strike.  i know.  i was weak.  i really wanted to go out to dinner with these people.  i wanted to see if i (we) could make some new friends and have some new experiences, so that we could get past this homebody rut we've gotten into.  and i wanted him to understand that i don't post negative/bitchy things about him, and he wasn't walking into an ambush of people who would hate him.  especially since i'd asked him not to read my blog.example 2: when i introduced thehusband to all of the other bloggers, i quickly said to them "he doesn't read my blog, and he's never seen yours, either (as far as i know)."in other words, don't talk about the time i mentioned that he was stretching his foreskin, or i posted pictures of his face after having some cancerous skin cells removed, or... you get the point.someone asked me why i had asked thehusband not to read my blog.  i told him the same thing i told thehusband that one time he had, "if i know he's reading it, i might not be as honest when posting something."  if i have to pick my words carefully, then what is the point?which brings me to last night's post.i almost didn't write it.  when i decided to, i chose my words carefully.  i left out parts of the conversation.  i finally hit "publish", and then changed it to "edit".  then i made a few changes, removed the option to comment, and hit "publish" again.all because people who read this blog know who i am talking about.labels: bloggers, thehusband

"it’s a funny thing about being a perfectionist: on the plus side you tend to work harder. but on the downside all that self-criticism can prove very self-destructive. in striving for what is humanly impossible, you run the risk of losing yourself. now all i have to do is convince myself of that."boy, can i relate to this.labels: life
