just released!



now available from mongrel intl., a imprint from mongrel international inc. 




mongrel intl. is now the imprint for new editiions of several of xu's out-of-print titles, published as e books and paperbacks. currently available from all ebook retailers: (click link for further book information and to purchase directly)
 
chinese walls novel, 2nd e book edition, january 2025
daughters of hui novella & three stories, 2nd e book edition, january 2025
  
when her debut novel chinese walls first appeared in 1994, xu was praised by the far eastern economic review as "a welcome new voice in the field of asian fiction writers (who) rides the waves beautifully.”  through the seven stories in this novel-in-stories, readers were brought behind the walls of a hong kong family, exploding all its secrets.  the controversial sexual content was startling at the time, but xu's spare prose and quiet style impressed the eastern express who said it was “. . . like listening to a close friend talking about her life, her family, her love and her frustrations.” the novel is a close look at the way intimacy draws people together and pushes them apart, as echoed in the epigraph from a confucius analect:
 
the master said, "men are close to one another by nature. they diverge as a result of repeated practice."
the analects book iv (translation d.c. lau)
 
daughters of hui, her sophomore title comprises a novella danny's snake and three short stories, featuring four unrelated chinese women surnamed hui è¨±, which is the author's own name.  it was extremely well received and named an asiaweek 1996 best book on asia.   the international examiner commended xu's ”impressive ability to create believable characters that are fully human in their inner contradictions and complexity” and window magazine said “(she) tackles taboo subject matter for chinese women, like sexuality, adultery and seduction as an art form.”  the epigraph from lao tzu poses the question:
 
your name or your person / which is dearer?
tao te ching chapter xliv book two (translated by d.c. lau)
  
after the first print editions from asia 2000 lapsed out of print, chameleon press re-issued a second compendium print edition with both titles in 2002. this included a preface by the scholar of asian literature in english, michael ingham of lingnan university who observed “whilst it may not be particularly politically correct in post-handover hong kong to assert the values of linguistic and cultural pluralism among ethnically chinese denizens of this hybrid chinese city, the fact remains that it is often possible to tackle taboo subjects and employ a critical idiiom in a literary lingua franca without the deep cultural connections, inhibitions and linguistic hierarchies consonant with the use of standard chinese.”
 
these reissued e books allow readers a backwards glimpse to a hong kong that was, and reconfirms, once again, how, as asiaweek said, that there's ”no question (xu) gets to the heart of the matter.”
