        though i am now retired, here are the websites for the churches i 
        served:


first baptist church of west lafayette, 
          ohio (1982-1989)

first baptist church of 
          ledgewood, new jersey (1989-2018)
          i am currently an elder at boothbay baptist church, maine, and 
          available for pulpit supply in lincoln county, maine.
 
a collection of all
  
my sermons 
  (1,600+) 
online 
  or in a downloadable (and searchable) 
archive.

my downloadable
  

  mega-databases 
  with 37,500 illustrations and 27,300 sermons in two versions (both are big 
  downloads):



    sid for 2024


    kerux2010 for 2024    [a glitch in this file has been fixed, i hope.  please report any issues to me.]



    new (december 2023) annual supplements 
 are available for each version.  if you already have a mega-database installed, don't bother downloading a new one - just download and install the small supplement file.  use the "import" feature contained in each version.

  databases around the world.  updated on january 23, 2021.

  assessment of each one.
