us savings bond update to update

the i-bonds dropped at mentioned by "anonymous" in the comments section.  i read from professionals that now is the better time to buy i bonds than several months ago.  the reason for their argument on this notion is that the fixed component in the calculation for interest rates for the i bonds went from 1.0% to 1.4%.  i must agree that would be the better pick, but i would want an even higher fixed component as i got back in 2000/2001/2002.the 6/2000 i bond did drop to 4.62%, so that is the current rate i am earning on these bonds, and not the 2.41% that "anonymous" had mentioned.  so, i am not kicking myself too much!  but, i am upset that uncle ben bernanke (fed chairman) is so determined to fight interest - otherwise we could have been heading for double digit returns.  that just means that we are "more than likely" heading for a recession over the next 1-2 years.
