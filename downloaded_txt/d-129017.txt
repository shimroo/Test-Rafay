happy students says:





my name is jeremias fleger and i am from germany. i attended embassy ces in sf and sara ny homestay placed me with ismael gamboa. i stayed there for 2 weeks and was very happy about my homestay. it was very well located because i only had to take one bus to school which takes about 20 minutes. the house was very clean and my room was very spacious and clean too. there were 2 other students at that homestay, we also had our own floor with bathroom and kitchen. so it was very fun because i wasn't alone and can make some activities with them. ismael was a very opened and kind person who liked to met new people. the food was very good and fresh cooked. especially the steaks, they were like in a steakhouse!!! he also taught me how to cook. so all in all i was very lucky with my homestay and can just recommend to every student who wants to stay in sf.
