introduction


thank you for visiting my web site.  this site is an 
        online poetry anthology, with an emphasis on metered poetry, both 
        traditional and modern.  some excellent free verse is also 
        included.  after a century in which free verse dominated, 
        metered poetry is making a comeback (although many poets never abandoned 
        it).  the purpose of this anthology is to present to the public the 
        many excellent formalist poets who are now publishing, and also to 
        popularize the genre.  unfortunately, some of the best 20th-century 
        poetry is still under copyright and cannot be printed because of the 
        expense of reprint fees.
 

in addition to poetry, i seek articles and essays on all aspects of poetry and 
the writing process.  the suggestions and comments of readers will 
be useful in helping me to construct a better site, so please don't hesitate to 
write.
