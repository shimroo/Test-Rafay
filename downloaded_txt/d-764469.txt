keeping a successful franchise going.that’s been the reality of hollywood for decades, and we’ve seen the results with the utter lack of creativity with respect to new titles.so, when matt damon didn’t want to continue the bourne franchise after three monster hits, the producers had to improvise.enter jeremy renner and a new character, aaron cross. renner was an ascending star at the time, so casting him in the lead role made sense. but while the film did fairly well at the box office, it suffered a significant drop off from the previous installment.the movie isn’t bad, and it delivers the frenetic actions sequences we’ve come to expect from the bourne films. the movie takes place concurrently with the events of “the bourne ultimatum” and follows cross, a member of operation outcome, an offshoot of the cia’s black ops program treadstone which created jason bourne. the writers add a new wrinkle to the story, as outcome agents are genetically enhanced through a series of pills known as “chems” that improve their physical and mental abilities. continue reading » actors, actresses, directors, moviesbourne moviescorey stolldonna murphyedward nortonjeremy rennermichael chernusmovie flashbackrachel weiszscott glennstacy keachthe bourne legacythe bourne ultimatumtony gilroy    david corenswet and rachel brosnahan cast as clark kent and lois lane july 1, 2023  /  john feverdc studios has bet the farm on james gunn and rebooting the dc universe. gunn will write and direct “superman: legacy” to kick things off, and a ton is riding on that film.naturally, the casting of this film is critical. many dc fans aren’t happy that gunn decided to move on from henry cavill as superman.we now have the highly anticipated announcement of the new clark kent and lois lane with david corenswet and rachel brosnahan playing these iconic characters in james gunn’s film.brosnahan is a brilliant choice. she’s beautiful and has the look that makes her an easy fit for the role. just take a look at the photo above. she was brilliant in “the marvelous mrs. maisel,” showing off her comedic skills and boundless charisma. she’ll be a perfect lois lane.as for david corenswet, we’ll see if he has the gravitas to pull of superman, but he certainly has the look. just go to his imdb page and check out the photos. he’s a dead ringer for a stereotypical superman, just like henry cavill and christopher reeve.we’ll see what happens with “superman: legacy,” but dc and gunn seem to be off to a good start. actors, actresses, moviescastingchristopher reeveclark kentdavid corenswetdc comicshenry cavilljames gunnlois lanerachel brosnahansupermansuperman: legacy    staff pick: “the bourne ultimatum” (2007) june 25, 2023  /  john fever“the bourne ultimatum” is the third installment in the bourne film series with matt damon returning as jason bourne and paul greengrass returning as director. the film picks up from where “the bourne supremacy” (2004) left off and further delves into bourne’s quest to uncover the truth about his past and the secretive government program, treadstone.the film begins with bourne evading capture in moscow and subsequently recovering from his injuries. he is haunted by fragmented memories of his past and remains determined to uncover the truth about his identity. while pamela landy (joan allen) has decided to help bourne, the cia, led by deputy director noah vosen (david strathairn), is still determined to neutralize him.the role of nicky parsons (julia stiles) is expanded in this film, as she decides to help bourne uncover the truth about his past. the duo uncovers more about blackbriar, a more aggressive and lethal program than treadstone. but by helping bourne, parsons also becomes a target, leading to the type of epic chase seen we’ve come to expect from this franchise. continue reading » action movies, actors, actresses, directors, moviesbourne moviesdavid strathairnjoan allenjulia stilesmatt damonmovie flashbackpaul greengrassscott glennstaff pickthe bourne supremacythe bourne ultimatum « older posts   search for:  follow us!  categorieshomemoviestvcelebritiesdirectorsactorsactresses  with tips, comments or questions.pagesaboutprivacy policy © 2024 premium hollywood theme by anders noren — up ↑
