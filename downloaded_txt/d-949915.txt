the konstantino spanoudis ikon collection



the ikon collection is one of the largest in private hands, and like any private collection it says as much about the collector as what is being collected.   anyone can post their list of film favorites on the internet, sharing their personal likes and dislikes with the world.  the ikon collection is konstantino’s list, and its treasures line his walls.  in 2024 many of those treasures can be found right here on our walls.now open at the bfc museum  & always free!
