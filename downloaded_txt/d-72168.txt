great ecological legacy of the zoroastrian religion

balancing body-mind-spirit the zoroastrian way
meditation the zoroastrian way















"zoroastrianism is the oldest of the revealed world-religions,
and it has probably had more influence on mankind, directly and indirectly,
than any other single faith." - boyce, zoroastrians, 1979, p. 1.

"zoroaster was thus the first to teach the doctrines of an individual 
judgment, heaven and hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general last judgment, 
and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body. these doctrines were to become familiar 
articles of faith to much of mankind, through borrowings by judaism, christianity and islam; 
yet it is in zoroastrianism itself that they have their fullest logical coherence.... 
- boyce, op. cit. p. 29.



we provide the complete text of the extant avesta, the most ancient
scriptures of zoroastrianism, as well as many middle persian scriptures.
it also includes information about the avestan
language, and other useful information for students of zoroastrian
religion. most of the texts in these archives are extremely rare.
