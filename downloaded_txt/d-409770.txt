read about pact
a local blogger recently published a great article about the work we do here at pact humane society. you can read about it here:
“to the rescue!”
if you have found a stray cat or dog, or need to find a new home for a family pet that was not originally adopted from pact humane society, please visit our resources page. we are unable to accept owner-surrendered pets (unless they were adopted from pact), nor can we accept stray animals at our facility.
