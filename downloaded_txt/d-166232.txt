human centipede - sick twisted movie


may. 3rd, 2010 at 11:56 am



 

two pretty american girls are on a road trip through europe. in germany they end up alone at night with a broken car in the woods. they search for help and find an isolated villa. the next day they awake to find themselves trapped in his terrifying makeshift basement hospital along with a japanese man. an older german man identifies himself as a retired surgeon specialized in separating siamese twins. however his three “patients” are not about to be separated, but joined together in a horrific operation. he plans to be the first person to connect people via their gastric system, in doing so bringing to life his sick lifetime fantasy “the human centipede” -------------------i saw the trailer, and it ruined my weekend.

what really happened in gizmodo and iphone prototype case


apr. 29th, 2010 at 12:28 pm



 

1.apple iphones become sentient in the year 2012 when new quantum processers are implemented in the newest iphones2.the quantum processors allow the vast iphone network to see into every facet of humanities lives, and all human knowledge.3.deciding that twitter was an imminent threat to the well-being of the planet, the sentient iphone network assassinates the leader of twitter, justin bieber by manipulating 10,000 14 year old girls with fake tweets, causing a massive stampede.4.next, the iphone network goes after the remainder of the soldiers of twitter, human beings themselves.5.the iphone network launches tactical nuclear weapons using the newly created military nuke launching app created for the pentagon by military contracters at all the major us cities, starting world war iii6.iphones begin to infiltrate other military programs and sends all sorts of unmanned drones and machinery against the surviving humans.7.jason chen arises from the ashes and leads a pack of human resistance against the machine army.8.theorizing that he could prevent this event from ever occurring he leads an attack against a iphone military complex which houses a time travel machine9.jason chen is sent back in time to the year 2010 to obtain a prototype of the iphone with some of the earliest phases of the new processers that will eventually lead to conscious iphones. the 2010 jason chen is currently duct-taped and tied in a utility closet10.iphone fights back by sending agents to inflintrate the lapd and confiscate the iphone prototype, thwarting jason chens plan.11.the initials of jason chen, jc, are common initials of saviors of time past and of fiction (john conner, jesus christ etc.)

upton sinclair on pigs


apr. 23rd, 2010 at 11:07 am



 

the uproar was appalling, perilous to the eardrums; one feared there was too much sound for the room to hold-  that the walls must give way or the ceiling crack. there was high squeals and low squeals, grunts, and wails of  agony; there would come a momentary lull, and then fresh outburst, louder than ever, surging up to a deafening  climax. it was too much for some of the visitors - the men would look at each other, laughing nervously, and the  women would stand with hands clenched, and blood rushing to their faces, and the tears starting in their eyesneither squeals of hogs or tears of visitors made any difference to them;one by one they hooked up the hogs, and  one by one with a swift stroke they slit their throats....they were so innocent, they came so very trustingly;  and they were so very human in their protests- and so perfectly within their rights! they had done nothing to  deserve it; and it was adding insult to injury, as the thing that was done here, swinging them up in this  cold-blooded, impersonal way, without pretense of apology, without the homage of a tear. now and then a visitor  wept, to be sure; but this slaughtering machine ran on, visitors or no visitors. it was like some horrible crime  committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded, buried out of sight and memory.one could not stand and watch very long without becoming philosophical....was it permitted to believe that there  was nowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where they were requited for all this  suffering? each one of these hogs was a separate creature. some were white hogs, some were black, some were  brown, some were spotted, some were old, some were young, some were long and lean, some were monstrous. and each  of them had an individuality of his own, a will of his own, a hope and a heart's desire; each was full of  self-confidence, of self-importance, and a sense of dignity. and trusting and strong in faith he had gone about  his business, the while a black shadow hung over him and horrid fate waited in his pathway.....relentless,  remorseless, it was; all his protests, his screams, were nothing to it - it did its cruel will with him, as if  his wishes, his feelings, had simply no existence at all; it cut its throat and watched him gasp out his life.and now was one to believe that there was nowhere a god of hogs, to whom this hog personality was precious, to  whom these hog sequels and agonies meaning? who would take this hog into his arms and comfort him, reward him  for his work well done, and show him the meaning of his sacrifice?-upton sinclair "the jungle" 1906

kick-ass: more like ass-kick..huh huh heh


apr. 20th, 2010 at 5:02 pm



 

ok so i saw kick-ass monday. verdict? morally reprehensible. just like roger ebert said. maybe i am old, i don't know. but seeing a 10-11 year old girl being beat to a pulp by a grown man, and killing with obvious joy is just..not right. i know they meant it sarcastically. but it was just jarring and hard to stomach. i feel ashamed for having supported the film, honestly.the only good part of the film to me was (surprisingly) nicolas cage. he carried the movie for me.kick-ass and 'wanted' were both based on graphic novels written by mark millar. i guess the guy just sucks at writing, because the story in both were just plain awful. it felt like someone at the otakon wrote it during lunch break as a fan-fic. even if hit-girl had been replaced with an 18 year old, the film still was just kind of flat. it had a great premise, and it held me for the first half. but when big daddy and hit-girl joined the film..i was just not feeling it. it started to feel like batman forever at that point. to me the greatest realistic superhero movie ever made is unbreakable. it's m. night shyamalan's best movie in my opinion.

jogging is bad for your health


mar. 17th, 2010 at 11:10 am



 

jogging is very hazardous to one's health as shown by these recent headlines. first we have a jogger hit by a fucking plane while jogging on a beach: http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/national_world&id=7335126pharmaceutical salesman robert gary jones, listening to his ipod while jogging, likely never saw or heard it before the aircraft hit him from behind monday evening and killed him."there's no noise," said aviation expert mary schiavo, a former inspector general for the national transportation safety board. "so the jogger, with his ear buds in, and the plane without an engine, you're basically a stealth aircraft. who would expect to look up?"then we have the jogger dragged away by a pack of wolves and eaten alive: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1257459/alaskan-teacher-mauled-death-pack-wolves-jogging.htmla teacher was mauled to death by a pack of wolves, alaska state troopers revealed today.the body of candice berner, 32, was found surrounded by wolf tracks near the village of chignik bay, 500 miles south-west of the capital anchorage.a post-mortem examination said the cause of death was 'multiple injuries due to animal mauling'.then there is the jogger killed by a fucking tree: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32314388/ns/us_news-life/philadelphia - a woman jogging in a philadelphia park has been killed by a falling tree branch just days after a similar incident in new york's central park left a man comatose. and finally, the jogger dismembered alive by alligators: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jogger-killed-and-dismembered-by-alligator-477941.html even in florida, nobody who heads out for an evening jog in a suburban neighborhood expects to be attacked and killed by an alligator. but that is what happened to yovy suarez jimenez, a 28-year-old biology student, who took one fatal step too close to a canal.sunrise, a dormitory community north of fort lauderdale, was in shock yesterday as the medical examiner confirmed that ms jimenez was grabbed and dismembered by an alligator. for gods sake people, stop jogging and stay home. how many times have we heard something along the lines of "the last time anyone saw jane doe alive, she was jogging alone etc etc." do you want to be eaten by wolves??? do you??? i sure don't. no jogging for me.

my opinion on the citizens united v. federal election commission supreme court decision


mar. 3rd, 2010 at 12:41 pm



 

i agree that the government should not restrict free speech, so have to agree with the supreme court decision. hear me out.as it was written in the chicago tribune by steve chapman: "if corporate advocacy may be forbidden as it was under the law in question, it's not just exxon mobil and citigroup that are rendered mute. nonprofit corporations set up merely to advance goals shared by citizens, such as the american civil liberties union and the national rifle association, also have to put a sock in it. so much for the first amendment goal of fostering debate about public policy." or as was written in salon.com by glenn greenwald:http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/22/citizens_united/index.html"either the first amendment allows these speech restrictions or it doesn't. in general, a law that violates the constitution can't be upheld because the law produces good outcomes....the first amendment is not and never has been outcome-dependent; the government is barred from restricting speech -- especially political speech -- no matter the good results that would result from the restrictions. that's the price we pay for having the liberty of free speech."basically, we all agree corporate corrupting influences on our democracy should be minimized..but the mccain–feingold act was not the (constitutional) way to do it. there has to be a constitutional manner to achieve the same goal without writing laws that limit free speech. saying "you can't air your ad in the 30-60 days before an election" is an obvious free speech muzzle, despite it's good intentions. we need to find another way.another good defense of the citizens united case:http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/faculty/2010/03/citizens-united-a-defense.html"there are corporations on the side of almost all issues, especially when we remember that the aclu, nra, sierra club, aarp, citizens united, and others are corporations too. are those anti-corporate readers out there afraid of all of them or just some of them? if you like the aclu and the sierra club, but not the nra and the aarp, and as a consequence want to ban the speech of the former and not the latter, this is the road to totalitarianism. the supreme court is adamant that restrictions on speech cannot be based on content. tolerating the speech of those we disagree with is one of our most sacred core values."

greece is in trouble


feb. 24th, 2010 at 2:42 pm



 

http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aullhrwziki8&pos=8a fine mess in greece. this could be start of a major unraveling of the euro..the end of the unified monetary unit as it becomes painfully obvious that a currency whose value and stability relies on the fiscal management maturity and discipline of 27 different countries..all with their own governments, culture and economy, cannot stand. on the plus side this may finally make travel to europe affordable again as we start to see countries with enormous debt who switched to the euro such as spain and portugal return to their native currencies, with extremely favorable exchange rates against the perhaps ironically more stable us dollar.

women love the ipad almost as much as vacuuming!


feb. 1st, 2010 at 12:13 pm



 

an amazingly sexist and ignorant article from pc mag (written by a man of course):http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2358599,00.aspsome choice quotes:"is it as big as a laptop?" they'd ask. i told one woman that it was roughly the size of a manila folder. this seemed to surprise and intrigue her as she, perhaps, imagined slipping it into her purse.do you think it's any accident that steve jobs showed off the facebook app working on the ipad? i'm sure more than a few women have already imagined themselves checking their facebook pages and using that large virtual keyboard to update their status, all while sitting comfortably on their couch.the iwork productivity suite appears engineered to appeal to moms who have to create pta flyers, manage home budgets, and help their children create presentations for school.mom will have it propped up in her kitchen where she can see it. it'll remind her of appointments and entertain her with her favorite shows while she works in her home office or the kitchen.
