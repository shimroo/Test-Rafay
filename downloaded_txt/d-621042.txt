what promises does your college make to students?





college students have both expectations and goals when they enter college. they put their trust in the colleges they attend and the leaders who operate those colleges. in return for student commitments, colleges make promises both actual and implied.important promises include:a great education - colleges promise to provide students with a great education in their fields of study. that is important. students want to be assured that they will receive the information, tools and experiences that lead to jobs in their areas of interest.concerned and active college leaders - students and parents alike expect college leaders to look out for the best interests of students. that can only happen when college leaders are truly concerned about their students and are out there fighting to serve their best interests.dedicated professors - when professors want students to be successful, they go the extra mile to make certain that students understand the most important and complicated information, concepts and procedures. the best professors tell stories, facilitate discussions, provide examples, use classroom demonstrations, bring in guest speakers and take students on tours, in order to maximize the learning experience. importantly, these professors create an environment where students want to learn.a supportive learning environment - since some students will face learning difficulties, a supportive learning environment is essential. concerned counselors, electronic classrooms, learning laboratories, modern library facilities, study groups and tutors are all helpful and often necessary for student success. when instructors are willing to stay after class to clarify a concept hold a discussion or invite students to lectures, seminars and professional association meetings, learning becomes easier and a supportive learning environment is created.individual attention - nearly every student will need and appreciate some individual attention when problems arise. students do not want to feel that they are just one of a million. that's why some colleges promise individual attention when their students face difficulties and challenges. with individual attention, more students can be successful.a safe campus - students and parents want and expect college campuses to be safe. they can find few reasons to attend a college where students do not feel safe. college leaders are expected to assure us that student safety is at the top of their priority list.an enjoyable college experience - college students want and need a place to learn and grow that can be fun and interesting, a place where friendships can be formed. students need a place where there are a variety of organizations, activities, clubs, athletic programs, as well as cultural, artistic and musical forms of entertainment. they all need ways to reduce the stress and rest their minds and bodies.comprehensive help in preparing for the senior year job search - students are not natural born job hunters. they need help in learning what to do, how to di it and when to do it. because all of that cannot effectively be done in the senior year, students greatly benefit from the information, tools, experiences and strategies that are acquired as they move through the college years. without ongoing and quality assistance from college leaders, counselors and professors, many graduates will be unprepared to compete for the best jobs.a college where graduates attract interest from the best employers - students and their parents expect that the reputation of the college, the quality of the education and the performance of good students will work together to attract interest from the best employers. college leaders are expected to work hard to make this happen. without a good job, most graduates get off to a slow start and have difficulty launching their careers.not all colleges make these promises. others make the promises, but do not keep them. therefore, high school students and their parents should carefully evaluate the colleges that are being considered by asking questions of college administrators, professors and current students. asking for examples, statistics and proof is not out of bounds. students need that information, so they can make good decisions. why not ask each college, "what promises does this college make to students?"bob roth, a former campus recruiter, is the author of five books, including: a successful senior year job search begins in the freshman year. known as the "college & career success" coach, bob writes articles for college career services offices, campus newspapers, parent associations and employment web sites. bob has created the job search preparation systemâ„¢ for colleges to use to help students find greater success in the job market. visit bob's web site http://www.the4realities.com "

why you should go away for college





in the past decade, an undergraduate degree or some other form of advanced training has become more vital than ever, to successfully enter meaningful employment. today, an undergraduate degree has the same employment obtainment power as the high school diploma did for former generations. however, college is more than just getting a degree. more than ever college is about obtaining real world experience, creating life-long connections, and developing into a well-rounded individual. there are so many questions to think about when going to college. what do i want my major to be? what do i want to do when i graduate? etc. however, the most important question might be, where do i want to go to school? there are two important considerations unrelated to major: stay at or close to home? move far away from home?some of the most vital reasons to go away to college are recounted here, as lived by me, a real live college senior.1. it gives you greater independence.it allows you to thrive in a way you cannot if mom and dad are a 5 minute to 1 hour drive away, or in the next room. if you're still living at home you never get the chance to meet challenges without the crutch of a parent coming through the door momentarily.you have always relied on your parents.the closer they are, the fewer the opportunities to break that pattern.when you don't live at home there is no one to wake you up in the morning to make sure you go to your 8am class, you simply have to be self-motivated to succeed. going away to college allows you to cut the tie and learn to do things for yourself, whether it be setting up a dentist appointment, or in more advanced years, paying your electric bill.2. it's a chance to discover who you arethe average college student is still discovering who they are while they are in college. going to a new place for college can open you up to experiences and people you would never meet in your hometown. this can help shape your life and become who you want to be. not who your parents want you to be. not whom your childhood friends and peers see you as. something more, something still changing and still growing. can you grow and change closer to your parents. of course, you can. however, people often say college is a time for experimentation. being away at university helps you figure out, in an unfamiliar environment, what you like, what you do not like, and what you want to do with your life.if you stay at home you are more likely to keep doing what you have always done. this may not be a bad thing. however, moving somewhere new could help you discover a completely different side of yourself. micro-cultures are a fact. going away to school increases your opportunities to discover other ideas, and ways of living, rather than sticking with the familiar and comfortable.3. it pushes you out of your comfort zonestarting over in a new place can be scary, especially when you do not know anyone. it is a very valuable skill to have and one you will probably need after university.the average individual needs to experience new people at some point in their life, rather than be surrounded by familiar faces. in order to learn how to handle people and grow culturally as a person, one must place themselves in a new environment with faces that are anything but familiar.people who are successful in the real world know how to handle people in different situations.they need to adapt to being more outgoing and social even if they are an introvert.these skills can be obtained by going to college away from home.high school graduates wanting to go to college should give serious consideration to moving away from home. going away for college provides additional opportunities for a student to develop priceless real world skills, ahead of the peer who remains closer to the home. it will improve their odds of meeting their full potential, provided they understand self-discipline when it comes to class attendance and homework.while getting a degree is the main focal point in going to college, one should not underestimate the many other benefits of attending a university. especially one miles away from home.

exposed, the student loan trap





in today's fast paced world of high finance where profits are all that matter it is not surprising that institutions of higher learning have now joined the rank and file wall street consortium. the surge of for profit universities has more than doubled just within the past few years and with it student loan debt has reached the highest level in the history of the us. never before have institutions of higher learning been so profit oriented. just imagine tuition at harvard university 100 years ago cost a whopping $150 and many state schools charged nothing at all. now, when we look at the consumer price index from the past 100 years there has been a 2,263% rise since 1915 in the cost of everything we buy. college tuition on the other hand, the price index has risen by over 43,000% since 1915. that alone should be a real wake up call for all educators, the public and all elected officials. this increase is just tuition costs never mind room and board, books, and all the other incidentals associated with campus living.one of the most concerning facts about the ever increasing amount of student loan debt are the many smaller more specialized for profit universities that have taken over the tv adds lately. it is pretty obvious when so many of these for profit schools emphatically state in their recruitment practices that they offer students a much better chance and practically guarantee employment upon successful completion of course requirements. with the us economy still in an economic quandary what employment opportunities there are too many times these students will not land a qualified job with the salary to match their ability to repay all the student loans that have been added just to complete their course requirements. it is as though these schools are deceiving students, their parents, and even grandparents by offering incentives attached to degrees in specialized fields using their own financial network knowing full well that there is still a very little chance these students will ever be able to repay all the costs incurred.one of the most influential factors in college recruitment practices especially among career advisors, guidance counselors, school officials, and college recruiters today claim that by going to college it is an investment in your future. today, it is more like speculation of a future that really isn't that secure. what they don't tell even though tuition may seem high today the student loans incurred by going to their school may never be fully be paid off. with so little actual good paying jobs in these specialized fields that future is marred by enormous debt from all the student loans that have piled up. it is just like the housing crisis when financial institutions coerced people to take on the seemingly unimaginable costs in mortgages in the hopes that they will in the future be able to pay the balance on their mortgage. but, in reality those future costs became insurmountable. the same thing is happening with student loan practices today.never before in american history has this nation been so immersed in debt. whether it is auto loans, home mortgages, credit cards and now student loans have all amassed trillions of dollars of debt that too many will never be able to repay. with this holiday season already upon us credit card debt is already sky high and is getting higher all the time. just this past week on cyber monday 93% of sales were all debt transactions. credit or debt financing has taken hold of our whole economy. when we add student loan debt combined with all the mortgage foreclosures that have befallen millions of americans since 2008 the united states is being crushed by the massive weight of colossal debt. yet, there are unscrupulous institutions, and individuals who continue to reap billions of dollars capitalizing on others indebtedness. just this past year the federal government reaped over $42 billion in profit from all the student loans that they issued..it has been known for quite some time now, thought grossly under reported that college students have been inundated with massive student loan debt. for years now that debt has only set the stage for an economic and financial disaster. all too often it is the for profit universities that have lured prospective students using false pretenses into thinking that by attending their school you will in fact be better prepared to actually get hired by businesses that would utilize your specific educational background. today, what these for profit schools do is unconscionable. they purposely are luring students into large student loans knowing full well they have no intention of following through on what they advertise. it is a fact that the more a student gets in loans whether it is through a financial institution or from the school itself like devry, which uses it's own financial management company that underwrites their students loans, these institutions continue to make huge profits.call it what you will private for profit institutions of higher learning continue fleecing students and parents alike by the sheer volume of loans offered by the universities in conjunction with the federal government. today, the total amount of student loan debt in the united states is over $1.3 trillion. to think that a college education had always been a gateway to an occupation to ones chosen field and the promise that their occupation would provide the means for a standard of living much better had they not attended and got that degree. sad to say those days are long gone.there maybe a bright spot on the horizon where student loan debtors may very well be on the verge with a new ability to have these loans discharged. the biggest reason today is the fact that students all over the country are being duped. for years now students and their parents have been literally on the hook for massive student loan debt. without some sort of ability to discharge these loans students and parents will never be able to pay them back. as it stands today thousands are immersed not only in massive debt but their entire lives continue to be adversely affected. instead of contributing to a growing economy too many will in fact be a burden upon society. and, that will do absolutely nothing to generate economic growth, stability and prosperity for our communities and our country.the biggest problem today with the enormous debt associated with student loans is that financial institutions that provide these loans are now bundling them together and then selling them just like the they did and continue to do with home mortgages. like 2008 when the housing bubble broke the same thing is going to happen with student loan debt. what is so tragic is that these financial institutions as well as the federal government continue to reap billions of dollars in profits every year. the best way to address this growing crisis is with legislation that is being proposed by senator bernie sanders. and if it comes to pass that free college tuition for anyone who qualifies to attend it just maybe the best way to advert a financial disaster. by dr. tim g williams

poverty and media





man is curious by nature and always remains busy in new and novel things.  poverty has many dimensions and quenches the thirst of man in this regard. he always comes by odd, weird and strange happenings due to poverty. mother killed her babies, a father slaughtered his family, a brother ate to his fill while his little sisters and brother died due to famine.  all these headlines are the offspring of obnoxious poverty. hunger is the worst thing in this world.  if one is hungry, he can sell his honor, his homeland and even his loved ones. it is a curse and an 'anaconda' that gnaws at the very roots of the humanity. it is not only shown on the media but also discussed in the meetings and seminars.  the un has included it in its millennium development goals. it is ever hot issue of the world.  the most powerful nations of the world are not devoid of this anathema.a lot of people die due to hunger and unavailability of eatables in the advanced countries.  according to the facts and figures of the un about 25000 deaths occur daily due to non availability of food. it means that one person is dying in every four seconds. the children are the worst prey to poverty all over the world.irony of the situation is that there is plenty of food present in the reservoirs of the world.  in spite of the stock piles of the food,the same is not available to the hungry and the poor. the poor have no money to buy this food and are not able to live.  constant starvation makes them weak and they did not remain able to work.  this unemployment breaks their neck and they fell down and down in the abyss of poverty and hunger.this vicious circle ends in unfortunate deaths of these pitiable people.  the world watches these hapless human beings dying only due to lack of few dollars.  not only the one man dies but also his family is famished and constrained to disappear from the face of the earth.  world media and world organizations forget them after making their deaths headline on the face of their periodicals.  nobody comes out to disburse food or money.  only word jugglery is performed in the meetings and seminars for keeping oneself in the news and promoting one's image as a humanitarian.poverty is ridiculed instead of redeemed.  the poor are punned and are shown with the naked feet and deprived souls on the media.  it is done in the name of good faith but there is not even simple faith except shenanigans.the un is trapped by the profiteers and pseudo-non governmental organizations whose sole aim is to grab and pile up money by hook or by crook.  such persons and organizations try their best to remain in limelight.  their aim is to pretend humanism. they want people and governments of the world to praise their work.  they influence the common folk by their false image. this is one of the reasons that poverty becomes the important news. few organizations try sincerely and work out plans to save the starved people.  such programs need advertisement and publicity.  this also makes poverty an important news item. to conclude it can be said that overt and covert aims of being publicized and remain in the news are the causes that include poverty in the major news items and discussions on all the forums.self observation

how banks rip off college students and the government.





if you know anything at all about the federal student loan program, you will not have been surprised by the scandal of recent months. the only amazing thing is that it has taken so long to arrive. here's how the program works: banks and other private companies lend money to students. the federal government pays part or all of the interestâ€”currently 7 percent or 8 percent. the government also guarantees the loans.what is wrong with this picture? well, the government itself borrows the odd nickel to finance the national debt. this borrowing, obviously, is also guaranteed by the government. for that reason, it carries an interest rate of only 3 percent or 4 percent. if the government can borrow money at 3 percent or 4 percent, why should it be paying 7 percent or 8 percent for the privilege of guaranteeing loans to someone else? wouldn't it make more sense for the government to loan out the money itself?that is the $4 billion question (the approximate annual cost of the interest subsidy). and the answer is: of course that would make more sense. it is what any levelheaded businessperson would do. and what is stopping the government from behaving like a levelheaded businessperson? not those head-in-the-clouds democrats. it's republicans, who adopted the student loan "industry" in its infancy, like a stray cat, and have nurtured it and protected it ever since. there actually is a parallel student loan program that does use government funds. it was started in the early days of the clinton administration. it costs less to operate, and it has not been tainted by scandal. but when the republicans regained control of congress in 1994, they pushed through a law forbidding the education department to encourage the use of this program. as a result, direct federal loans account for only 25 percent of all student loans.there is plenty of other encouragement going on. new york attorney general andrew cuomo has extracted fines of more than $1 million each from prestigious institutions like columbia and johns hopkinsâ€”and, for that matter, nearly as prestigious institutions like citibank, jp morgan chase, and bank of america. it seems that kickbacks were being paid to university financial aid officers who delivered customers. some of them even got stock in some of the more specialized, and dubious, student loan companies. when the government is giving away free moneyâ€”which is what the program amounts to (and i mean giving it away to the banks, not to the students)â€”it's worth a good deal to get cut in on such a good deal.when the student loan abuse story broke, fingers were pointed at the education department, which is supposed to supervise the program. the government accountability office minced no words. it called on the department to "develop a protocol to determine the appropriate level of response for cases of non-compliance and assess the effectiveness of these actions to inform and improve this protocol." wow. while the education department quaked in its boots over that one, congress more usefully passed a bill substantially reforming the student loan program and cutting the subsidy to banks and other loan providers by 80 percent. president bush, to his credit, will sign these reforms into law. in fact, he actually proposed some of them in his budget from february of this year. but this puts him at odds with his party.the student loan "industry," as it is comically referred to in the newspapers, is an interesting case study in politics and business. to start, it is hardly an industry. there are no factories. the only things it "makes" are loans. furthermore, it exists only because of a government program. yet in the four decades since the federal government started it, the student loan business has evolved into a pretty good imitation of an industry, with trade associations, lobbyists, and support from politicians, mostly republican. this "industry" is so dependent on the good will of politicians, in fact, that the reform bill alone may be enough to queer the deal in which its biggest player, sallie mae, is supposed to be bought by a private-equity firm for $25 billion. even before taking over, the private-equity firm booted sallie mae's ceo on the explicit grounds that he did not have good relations with democrats. to run this so-called company, in other words, you don't need to know how to make widgets or even how to make loans. you just need to know how to make nice. but don't feel too bad for this ceo who suddenly found his rolodex obsolete: he made $40 million last year and will get millions more if the deal does go through.but why do republicans love student loans? oh, in part the usual reasons: lobbyists and campaign contributions. there is almost sure to be at least one of these firms in your districtâ€”the local bank, if no one else. but there is more. student loans are the clearest example of the common republican confusion between free-market capitalism and business. capitalism is an economic system that is held, with some justification, to be the best guarantor of prosperity. business can be capitalism in action, or it can be something entirely different. there is very little about the student loan program that has anything to do with free-market capitalism. yet whenever the student loan system comes under criticism, lobbyists, "industry" leaders, and supportive politicians haul out the same old clichÃ©s as if they were defending adam smith's famous pin factory itself.during the recent reform bill debate in the house, for example, a republican from texas, jeb hensarling, declared that the very notion of reducing the subsidy to private companies was "all part of a democratic tax-and-spend program." rep. virginia foxx, republican of north carolina, declared that "we should call this the new democratic welfare bill," because it was "taking away personal responsibility from people and giving them out and out payments for loans that they take out." this may be referring to a part of the bill that would forgive loans after many years for people who devote their lives to public service. or it may just be nuts.a so-called "analysis" by an industry expert, which (according to the washington post) circulated on capitol hill during the debate, worried that the big boys would survive, but the subsidy reductions "may leave smaller lenders unprofitable." concern for "small lenders" was a common theme, as if a loan from a ma-and-pa bank, if such an institution exists, would be warmer and cuddlier than a loan from citibank. another common theme was that the subsidy cut was part of a covert democratic effort to drive people into the direct federal loan programâ€”or, as one lender ceo described it, the "one-size-fits-all direct loan program." this would be no bad thing, but it doesn't seem to have been the case. i'm not sure what "one size fits all" means here, but if it refers to the interest rate that students and their families have to pay, it's true that there is only one rate in the government program, compared with many in the private oneâ€”all of them higher, but maybe there are people for whom the variety is worth it.by michael kinsley via www.slate.com
