this campus is super diverse and there are so many people and experiences you can
                                          engage with.maleah woodleyclass of 2018





i remember coming here for the first time and specifically seeing the trans day of
                                          remembrance and black lives matter art installation and knowing there was a community
                                          here that would have my back.azeb tujiclass of 2017





don’t be afraid of help. if you feel like you need counseling or something then you
                                          are right and don’t let anyone make you feel otherwise. go to office hours as often
                                          as possible, even if it’s just to say hi. and last but not least don’t give up. no
                                          matter what, keep pushing.travis tribbleclass of 2020
