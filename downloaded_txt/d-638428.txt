granite 



granite is a very popular stone choice for residential and commercial projects. granite is a great choice for kitchen countertops, floors, stairs, tables, and other high use areas. granite is naturally a very hard and durable material. 









 









marble 



									marble can be great choice for residential and commercial projects. although marble is not as hard as granite and can be vulnerable to abrasion or harsh chemicals; this material is highly sought after due to its natural beauty. please see our care guide for more information on this delicate material.								









 








quartz 



due to its wide range of applications and durability, quartz is one of the most highly sought after material for homes and businesses. quartz is a man made material with an endless color range from various manufacturers that makes it a great choice for any project. 








 










large format porcelain 




due to it’s durability and resistance from scratches and stains, this material can be used in any setting without the chance of losing its finish from the weather or discoloring from the sun. large format porcelain is recommended for outdoor use as well as flooring and cladding applications due to its durability and beauty.

						we had granite world out at the vf world headquarters handling some seriously unique finishes that no other contractors were even willing to touch. from the one-of-a-kind rammed earth walls to the insane angles of the custom concrete countertops, these guys went above and beyond to help us figure out how to create the textures, colors and finishes the design team had in mind. ultimately, it all added up to a building that the owners absolutely love. would recommend working with this company to anyone.

						granite world was great to work with. they took all the worry and frustration out of the equation of my kitchen remodel. i had personalized service from start to finish and everyone was extremely professional and polite to deal with. they even assigned me a project manager who managed everything from start to finish! i would highly recommend this company to anyone contemplating a remodel.

in commercial construction, our trade partners can make or break a project. when i’ve worked with the team at granite world, that hasn’t been a concern. from proposal to execution, the entire team at granite world follows through to make sure you (and the client) are completely satisfied.
