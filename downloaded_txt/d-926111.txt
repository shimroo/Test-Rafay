food insecurity in your county







from feeding america 
the above map shows the levels of food insecurity in america. the darkest areas on the map mean that at least 30 percent of that area's population is food insecure. while the lightest areas are between 4 and 14 percent.

while a light area might look good acording to this map, keep in mind what the general population might look like. for example, notice that los angeles is one of lighter areas of the map. because of the large population of los angeles however, over 650,000 children are still in danger of going hungry.

philippine delegate breaks down and cries at u.n. climate change talks







a delegate from the philippines
broke down and cried yesterday during the united nations climate change talks.
naderev sano is negotiating with the world on how to combat climate change while his nation
recovers from another severe storm. typhoon bopha killed hundreds of  philippine residents and thousands more are now left homeless. locals say it was a storm that was stronger than usual and traveled farther south than
usual. the philippines loses five percent of their annual gdp to storm
damage and recovery. 



from the guardian, writer john vidal
has this excerpt
of the speech that led sano to tears.


madam chair, we have never had a typhoon like bopha, which 
has wreaked havoc in a part of the country that has never seen a storm 
like this in half a century. and heartbreaking tragedies like this are 
not unique to the philippines, because the whole world, especially 
developing countries struggling to address poverty and achieve social 
and human development, confront these same realities."madam 
chair, i speak on behalf of 100 million filipinos, a quarter of a 
million of whom are eeking out a living working here in qatar [as migrant labourers]. and i am making an urgent appeal, not as a negotiator, not as a leader of my delegation, but as a filipino …"
at this point he broke down.

"i
 appeal to the whole world, i appeal to leaders from all over the world,
 to open our eyes to the stark reality that we face. i appeal to 
ministers. the outcome of our work is not about what our political 
masters want. it is about what is demanded of us by 7 billion people."i
 appeal to all, please, no more delays, no more excuses. please, let 
doha be remembered as the place where we found the political will to 
turn things around. please, let 2012 be remembered as the year the world
 found the courage to find the will to take responsibility for the 
future we want. i ask of all of us here, if not us, then who? if not 
now, then when? if not here, then where?""thank you madam chair."
the hall rose and applauded.

typhoon death toll in the philippines reaches 283





the death toll continues to rise in the philippines
after the biggest typhoon to hit the island nation in a year. officials say 283
people are dead from typhoon bopha. the rains were strong enough to cause
mudslides traveling down the country’s mountains. in some areas, the rain and
mudslides caused water reservoirs to collapse, further adding to the strength
of the water.





last year, typhoon washi killed 1,500 people in the philippines.  

from reuters alert net, reporter eric de castro gives us the latest update.


hardest hit was the southern island of mindanao, where bopha made 
landfall on tuesday. it triggered landslides and floods along the coast 
and in farming and mining towns inland.

interior minister manuel roxas said 300 people were missing.

"entire families were washed away," roxas, who inspected the disaster zone, told reporters.
most affected areas were cut off by destroyed roads and collapsed 
bridges and army search-and-rescue teams were being flown in by 
helicopter.

power was cut and communications were down.

according to tallies provided by the military and disaster agency officials, 283 people were killed.

thousands of people were in shelters and officials appealed for food,
 water and clothing. dozens of domestic flights were suspended on 
wednesday.

the governor of the worst-hit province, compostela valley, in 
mindanao said waves of water and mud came crashing down mountains and 
swept through schools, town halls and clinics where huddled residents 
had sought shelter.

the death toll in the province stood at 160. in nearby davao oriental
 province, where bopha made landfall, 110 people were killed.

the flawed ngo; zoe's ark







sometimes an act of charity can be a bad idea and cause more harm than is
intended. people who are moved to do something about poverty can do the wrong
thing if careful planning is not done first. they need to talk with the people
who would be the recipients of this help and make sure it is something they
really need. spending some time in the far flung places they have only seen in the
media can go a long way to making sure the help is effective.



we have heard the stories about free t-shirts and shoes, what follows is a
story about a bad idea surrounding orphans. from the guardian writer simon allison details
the flawed ngo called zoe's ark.


my personal favourite terrible international aid idea comes courtesy of french ngo zoe's ark, whose founders saw a terrible problem and an easy solution. in 2007, with war raging in darfur,
 they realised that the orphans left stranded by the conflict would need
 a new home. they also realised that there were plenty of french 
families who wanted to adopt, but were struggling due to france's 
complicated adoption system. so they hired a plane, flew to chad
 and rounded up some orphans from a refugee camp near the sudanese 
border, the costs covered by the cash advances paid by eager potential 
parents. 

this is where the problems began. before the plane could return to france, the zoe's ark crew were arrested by unhappy chadian authorities,
 who quite rightly pointed out that the ngo should have complied with 
chad's own adoption laws. also, the chadians noted, most of these 
sudanese orphans were neither orphans nor were they from sudan;
 they were local kids lured in by zoe's ark's false promises of a trip 
to the clinic or a better school (this was subsequently confirmed by un 
agencies and the red cross). blinded by their ignorance, moral 
righteousness and end-justifies-the-means mentality, zoe's ark was only 
just prevented from kidnapping dozens of children, all in the name of 
doing good. 

they didn't escape unpunished. a court in chad 
sentenced members of the group to eight years in prison, and ordered 
them to pay €6.3 million in damages to parents of the children. shortly 
afterwards, they were transferred home and pardoned by chad's president,
 idriss deby, probably thanks to extreme diplomatic pressure from 
france. the damages have yet to be paid. 

this was not the end of 
the affair. in france, 103 expectant parents, all of whom had forked out
 between r25,000 and r50,000 (about £1,750 to £3,500) to zoe's ark, did 
not receive the little sudanese orphan that had been promised them. this
 amounts to fraud, some claimed, and french authorities launched an 
investigation. on monday in paris the trial began of six members of the 
ngo, who have been charged with illegal involvement in adoption 
procedures, attempting to bring minors into the country illegally, and 
fraud. with its sensational, noxious mix of international intrigue and 
naïve idealism, the trial is receiving huge attention in france.

typhoon bopha the strongest to hit the philippines in a year





the latest typhoon to hit the philippines is
the strongest to hit the island in a year. typhoon bopha is said to have killed
40 philippine residents. early evacuation efforts are being credited for
keeping the death toll low. agriculture experts expect that recently planted
rice and corn crops should not be affected by the typhoon. 



from reuters alert net, we get more details on the latest weather emergency.  

about 40 people were killed or missing in flash floods and landslides
 near a mining area on mindanao, abs-cbn television reported, saying 
waters and soil had swept through an army post.

a television reporter said she saw numerous bodies lined up near the 
army base. a military spokesman earlier said about 20 people, including 
six soldiers, were missing.

disaster official liza mazo, said more casualties were expected to be discovered as search and rescue teams fanned out.

media said dozens of people were injured by flying debris, falling trees and swept away by swollen rivers and flash floods. 

but the relatively low death toll was due in part to an early 
evacuation. more than 155,000 people were in shelters late on tuesday.

 farm minister proceso alcala said on monday he expected minimal damage 
to rice and corn crops as they had only recently been planted and could 
be replaced quickly if damaged.

the new female leader of the african union





the african union is celebrating the appointment of its
first female leader in the organization’s fifty year history.  nkosazana
dlamini-zuma rose to the title after years of cleaning up south africa's
home affairs department. dlamini-zuma is credited with cleaning up the crime
and corruption that have long plagued the department. she now moves on to the
au which has its own share of mismanagement that needs to be cleaned up.



from the guardian, writer elissa johnson interviews dlamini-zuma. 

dlamini-zuma says the biggest challenges facing the continent are 
underdevelopment, poverty and the inequitable distribution of wealth. 
since taking over as chairwoman in october, she has repeatedly stressed 
the need to ensure that peace and security issues – which she believes 
take "a lot of time, a lot of energy and a lot of resources" – are 
balanced with development. 

"it's important to understand 
that development is not a 'nice to have', it's essential for peace, for 
stability and for progress in the world," she says. "to me those are two
 sides of the same coin – if you don't develop your country, if people 
don't feel [there is] an equitable distribution of wealth, you are 
actually threatening peace." 

"if you look at africa today," she says, "we have more than a billion people, and more than 60% of those are young people;
 that has certain implications." those "implications" were clear on the 
streets of tunisia and egypt almost two years ago – the high level of 
youth unemployment was chief among the triggers of the arab spring. 
africa's population growth means that 1m new jobs are needed every month
 and, like many of the leaders she now serves, dlamini-zuma is conscious
 of the problems that could lie ahead if the continent's youth don't 
have access to education and the skills necessary to earn a decent 
living. 

infrastructure is another priority. "we have to get
 roads, rail … our transport on the high seas [and] we have to get 
telecommunications infrastructure – everybody's going broadband and africa should not be left behind,"
 dlamini-zuma insists. this, she believes, will enable african states to
 trade among themselves and develop inter-continental tourism. 

at
 the same time, she'd like to see the continent explore ways of 
accelerating the process of industrialisation. "our gdp is growing but 
its growing mainly on raw materials – and that's not sustainable 
growth," she says, adding that africa needs to export more processed 
goods "so that we can get more value for our products".

money for neglected disease research up by half a billion dollars





a new study looks into funding research on neglected
diseases and finds some changing patterns in how the money is given and spent.
the amount of money being contributed has increased over the last five
years by half a billion dollars. seventy percent of all the money
contributed is made by only a few organizations; including the national
institutes of health, and the bill & melinda gates foundation. the fact
that a few groups from the united
  states make a vast majority of research
funding is worrying to the authors of this report. 



from the inter press service, writer carey biron looks into the research.   

although overall funding for neglected diseases has gone up by 443.7 
million dollars, to about 2.9 billion dollars, since 2007, both public 
and philanthropic shares have gone down substantially. this is worrisome
 given that the public sector continues to make up around two-thirds of 
international funding for such research, almost all from high-income 
countries, and more than half of the top 20 governments cut their 
funding for such research in 2011 alone. 

while the u.s. government remains the single largest public funder of
 research into neglected diseases (following only the gates foundation),
 washington too cut its outlay in 2011, down 2.2 percent to around 30.6 
million dollars. 

“some governments now appear to be in it for the long haul, which is 
great,” dr. mary moran, one of the report’s authors and the executive 
director of policy cures, a london-based research group that published 
the g-finder, said monday in unveiling the report. 

“but we’re worried that their investment model seems to be shifting 
back to the ‘bad old days’, where the public sector funded basic 
research leaving product development to industry or philanthropy – and 
consequently almost no medicines, vaccines or diagnostics for neglected 
diseases were developed. this model doesn’t and can’t work for truly 
neglected non-commercial diseases.” 

according to findings by policy cures, over the past five years, 
public money for basic research has increased by more than a quarter, to
 around 124 million dollars, and currently makes up about a third of all
 public investment in neglected diseases. meanwhile, public investment 
in the costly and uncertain product development has actually gone down 
slightly.
moran compares this model to putting a man on the moon, for which one
 needs both scientists to do the research and someone to actually build 
the physical rocket. 

“governments need to bite the bullet,” she says. “if they want 
products for neglected diseases, they need to fund product development 
as well as basic research, and their funding needs to be linked to 
what’s happening in product pipelines and to be prioritised based on 
need.”

gross national happiness







most of the world uses gross domestic product as a measure of development.
the tiny country of bhutan
uses a completely different measure called gross national happiness. bhutan measures
happiness through how healthy, educated and environmentally conscious their
citizens are.



the world is meeting now in doha
for united nations climate change talks. bhutan's approach is getting some
serious consideration as a way to combat global warming. still, the happy tiny
country still has mounting challenges with poverty and climate change.

from the guardian, writer annie kelly explains bhutan's gnh. 

since 1971, the country has rejected gdp as the only way to measure 
progress. in its place, it has championed a new approach to development,
  which measures prosperity through formal principles of gross national 
happiness (gnh) and the spiritual, physical, social and environmental 
health of its citizens and natural environment. 

for the past three
 decades, this belief that wellbeing should take preference over 
material growth has remained a global oddity. now, in a world beset by 
collapsing financial systems, gross inequity and wide-scale 
environmental destruction, this tiny buddhist state's approach is 
attracting a lot of interest. 

as world leaders prepare to meet in doha on monday for the second week of the un climate change
 conference, bhutan's stark warning that the rest of the world is on an 
environmental and economical suicide path is starting to gain traction. 
last year the un adopted bhutan's call for a holistic approach to 
development, a move endorsed by 68 countries. a un panel is now 
considering ways that bhutan's gnh model can be replicated across the 
globe. 

as representatives in doha struggle to find ways of 
reaching a consensus on global emissions, bhutan is also being held up 
as an example of a developing country that has put environmental 
conservation and sustainability at the heart of its political agenda. in
 the last 20 years bhutan has doubled life expectancy, enrolled almost 
100% of its children in primary school and overhauled its 
infrastructure. 

at the same time, placing the natural world at the
 heart of public policy has led to environmental protection being 
enshrined in the  constitution. the country has pledged to remain carbon
 neutral and to ensure that at least 60% of its landmass will remain 
under forest cover in perpetuity. it has banned export logging and has 
even instigated a monthly pedestrian day that bans all private vehicles 
from its roads. 

"it's easy to mine the land and fish the seas and 
get rich," says thakur singh powdyel, bhutan's minister of education, 
who has become one of the most eloquent spokespeople for gnh. "yet we 
believe you cannot have a prosperous nation in the long run that does 
not conserve its natural environment or take care of the wellbeing of 
its people, which is being borne out by what is happening to the outside
 world." 

powdyel believes the world has  misinterpreted bhutan's 
quest. "people always ask how can you possibly have a nation of happy 
people? but this is missing the point," he says. "gnh is an aspiration, a
 set of guiding principles through which we are navigating our  path 
towards a sustainable and equitable society. we believe the world needs 
to do the same before it is too late."

barclays bank to stop participating in food price specualtion







there are three things that contribute to high food prices that should be
stopped. land grabs, speculation and using food for bio-fuels. we often report
on land grabs and bio-fuels, but he have a hard time finding the issue of
speculation in the news. that could be the speculation is done behind the doors of big institutions that secure their inner workings tightly.

today, a major player in food price speculation has
announced that they will stop doing it.  barclays bank is the latest bank
to swear off food speculation following a few other major european banks. we
hope that the banks in the u.s.
will begin to follow this trend.

from reuters alert net, writer astrid zweynert relays the announcement. 



the financial times website reported that the british bank is looking into withdrawing from agricultural commodities trading as part of its drive to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals. 

the ft said such a possible retreat was part of a strategic overhaul 
by the bank’s new chief executive, antony jenkins, who is screening the 
reputational impact of every business line barclays operates in. 

“if i decided to stop trading soft agricultural products it is not 
driven by regulation,” the ft quoted rich ricci, chief executive of 
corporate and investment banking, as saying. 

“it is because it doesn’t sit socially well with the large 
constituent of our customers,” ricci said at the parliamentary 
commission on banking standards on wednesday. 

financial speculation in staple foods, such as wheat, maize and corn,
 fuels dramatic spikes in food prices, pushing food beyond the reach of 
the world’s poorest people, campaigners say.
 “barclays appears to be relying on the police force of public 
opinion to tell it that speculating on food prices is wrong, rather than
 acknowledging its own moral responsibility,” said deborah doane, chief 
executive of the world development movement.

big pharma improves access to medicine







the big pharmaceutical companies are slowly improving access of drugs for
everyone. after decades of accusations of looking after profits more than the
public's health, big pharma has taken some positive steps. some companies are
introducing tiered pricing systems that give discounts to poorer nations. they
have also been taking steps to give the discounts for a wider range of
products.



an annual survey rates how well each pharmaceutical company is doing, and
the latest edition has just been released. the access to medicine index rakes
each company on a range of access issues. glaxco smith kline, johnson and
johnson and sanofi rank at the top. you can download the entire report from this
link.

guardian reporter sarah boseley has
this introduction
to the report.    

while british drugmaker glaxosmithkline (gsk), whose chief executive 
sir andrew witty has announced moves to increase access to medicines in 
the developing world, continues to top the league table, its lead on the
 rest has shrunk. two other major pharmaceutical companies, johnson 
& johnson and the vaccine manufacturer sanofi, are now close behind. 

the
 index ranks 20 leading pharmaceutical companies and is published every 
two years by the netherlands-based non-profit access to medicines 
foundation. it has become an authoritative guide, with input from the 
world health organisation, governments, universities, ngos and 
institutional investors. 

drug companies are scored on a 
range of measures, from their willingness to discount prices in poor 
countries, to research on neglected diseases of poor people to lobbying,
 transparency and conduct in clinical trials. 

this is the 
third index and it finds a much greater focus on drug access within drug
 companies – where it is now often an issue for the board. 

"this
 year's index shows that companies are becoming more organised 
internally in their approach to access to medicine and that those who do
 this best tend to perform well across the other aspects we measure. the
 leaders are really raising the bar," said wim leereveld, founder of the
 index. "it's also clear that companies that do not continue to step up 
their efforts tend to be overtaken by their peers."

corruption in mozambique’s public health service







corruption in mozambique
occurs at the last place that it should happen… in the health sector. sick
people wait for hours upon hours outside of public health centers because they
don't have enough money for bribes. the people that have money or connections
are treated right away. the low wages earned by nurses and receptionists is
believed to be the cause of the corruption.



from irin, this story looks into how the corruption effects the health of the public.  

eulalia laichela caressed her six-year-old son, leosio, who lay on the 
pavement, coughing from beneath a blanket. they had been waiting in the 
park outside josé macamo, one of the largest hospitals in mozambique's 
capital maputo, since early morning. 

laichela hoped her sister-in-law, who works at the hospital, would help 
find a doctor to attend to leosio before the end of the day. waiting in 
the queue at the hospital's reception area was not an option, she said. 

"if you don't have extra money to pay the doctor, there is no point in 
doing that. there are many people outside waiting, and they sit there 
hour after hour without being attended to," she told irin. 

ansina was among the patients waiting in the queue. she feared she had 
malaria but lacked family connections or money for a bribe. "something 
is wrong. i have number 142, and they are calling 188. i have been 
waiting here since this morning," she complained to the man next to her.
 he told her that it is patients’ money that determines who goes first, 
not their medical conditions. 

"that´s why we are still here," he said. ansina agreed. 

corruption is rife in mozambique's public health sector. according to a 2006 study
 by the centre for public integrity (cip) in maputo, corruption is 
present at all levels in the system: from the reception to the 
laboratory, during appointments with doctors, and even at the morgue. 

a 2011 regional household survey
 by transparency international found that nearly 40 percent of 
mozambican respondents had paid bribes for medical services in the past 
year - the highest such figure in the region. in mozambique, it was 
second only to the percentage that had paid bribes to the police. 

poor pay 

the cip study identified low salaries as one of the main causes of 
health sector corruption. a doctor identified as cossa*, who has worked 
at hospitals in maputo over the last 18 years, agreed. doctors earn 
between us$700 and $1,000 per month, and the lowest paid nurses earn 
just over $100 - no more than a domestic worker. 

cossa maintained that most bribes are paid to the nurses and other 
workers who see patients before they reach a doctor. but he added that 
doctors earn additional income in other ways. for example, most 
public-sector doctors also work at private clinics; according to the cip
 study, this makes them chronically tired. the study links the 
deterioration of public sector health care to a 1998 government decision
 to allow public-sector doctors to also work in the private sector. 

cossa noted that by 10am, the majority of doctors have already left the city's public hospitals for their private-sector jobs.

the warring factions in global development





more and more we see two maybe three different sets of methods of global development waring against each other. china, the west, and sometimes brazil fight to prove who is doing the most good.

china will help countries develop as long as they get something in return. the west demands changes to other countries so their markets will soon see something in return. while brazil seems intent on showing other nations what has worked for them. they are new to this process, so we have yet to see what they will get in return.

we see this contrast in a big way in the country of angola. china develops fast, yet few 
angolans are pleased with their work. brazil cooperates with the angolan people on development, yet it makes it harder for them to do it on their own. inter press service writer mario osava gives us this on the ground viewpoint.  

today, 35 years later, it is the excesses and glaring contrasts
 that shock the visitor to this city in southwestern africa. shiny new 
cars on brand-new roads and highways lined by thousands of still-empty 
or half-built office buildings, apartment blocks and residential towers 
stand in sharp contrast to the sprawling slums around the city. 

signs on construction sites written in chinese clearly reflect the asian giant’s high level of participation in the construction of today’s new angola. 

the most ambitious project carried out by companies from china is the
 nova cidade de kilamba (kilamba new city), a huge development designed 
to house half a million people, 20 km south of downtown luanda. 

when it is completed, the new neighbourhood will have more than 
80,000 apartments built for large families – the norm in angola – in 
buildings five to 13 storeys high. the development is also to be fitted 
out with dozens of schools, child care centres, health clinics and 
shops. 

nearly one-quarter of the buildings have been completed. but almost 
all of them are empty, even though more than 3,000 apartments were 
already available when the development was inaugurated in july 2011. 

also involved in building the new city are brazilian firms, 
especially construction giant odebrecht, which is in charge of key 
projects like electricity and water grids and the construction of roads. 

the foreign presence in the massive new developments “is not 
something to be admired, because it shows that there are no national 
companies with the capacity to build them,” said one of angola’s most 
prominent writers, artur pestana, better known as pepetela, who is also a professor of sociology. 

“the chinese build faster, they work round-the-clock shifts, and they
 offer almost interest-free long-term loans,” he said. but they employ 
few angolan workers and “there are many complaints about the quality of 
their construction work,” he added. 

meanwhile, brazilian companies “apparently learned their lesson from a
 few initial fiascos which made them the butt of national jokes, and 
they now stand out for the quality of their work,” which enables them to
 compete with the chinese, said the author, who has published many 
historical novels that are critical of the government of josé eduardo dos santos, president since 1979.
...

it was the first non-oil company from brazil to begin to operate in 
angola with a “long-term outlook,” said victor fontes, director general 
of the angolan company elektra, which specialises in power and water 
grids. he said this had the positive effect of attracting other firms 
also interested in the long haul, instead of just short-term 
opportunities. 

the director of institutional relations at odebrecht angola, 
alexandre assaf, told ips that the consortium is committed to 
“continuity” in angola, above and beyond the effects of wars or the 
global economic crisis. 

five years ago, only nine percent of the “strategic posts” in the 
company were held by angolans – a proportion that has risen to 41 
percent, he noted, to illustrate the company’s commitment to local 
development.

new aids cases worldwide still too high says one





the one organization has released a new study that looks into new aids cases worldwide. the charity says that new cases of aids are still to high to meet the millennium development goal of 2015. the study says that there were 2.5 million new cases of aids in 2011. that is more than double the amount needed to meet the mdg.

from reuters alert net, writer anna yukhananov gives us more on the study's content. 

progress over the past decade has cut the death toll for the disease,
 mainly due to better access to drugs that can both treat and prevent 
the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) which causes aids, the united 
nations said in its annual report last week. 

but while access to treatment has improved, in 2011 there were 2.5 
million new cases of hiv. that is more than double the target of having 
only 1.1 million people newly infected each year, said one, a charity 
co-founded by irish rock star bono, that is dedicated to fighting 
poverty and preventable disease. 

there were 34 million people living with aids at the end of last year. 

at current rates, the world will not reach targets to reverse the 
spread of aids until 2022, seven years behind schedule, according to 
one. 

"we recognize the world has done wonders in (fighting aids) in the 
last 10 years. but 2015 is around the corner," said michael elliott, 
one's chief executive. 

"here's a moment to put your pedal to the metal and go for it." 

much of the gap is due to funding cuts in major donor countries. the 
un estimates there is about a $6 billion aids funding gap each year. 
countries also have not coordinated a global strategy to tackle the aids
 epidemic, such as targeting treatment to groups at highest risk.

war and corruption in the congo







the future for africa does look bright
except for a couple of trouble spots. one of the most troubling is the republic of congo. war has plagued the nation for
many years, and there is some suspicion that neighboring countries are
contributing to the fighting.



also creating trouble in congo
is the terribly corrupt government that is supported by western aid
money.



a couple of stories today help explain what is going on in the congo. first,
we look at how western aid has failed the country, then a story on how corruption
has kept the population of congo
hungry.

for the western aid angle, we turn to the guardian and this commentary by richard dowden.


the knee-jerk reaction of britain and other western countries is therefore to give congo aid.
 and the only way of spending 0.7%  of our gdp on aid is to give it to 
governments. but has congo got a government? in 1997 the remnants of the
 mobutu regime were pushed out by the armies of rwanda and uganda.
 they replaced him with laurent kabila, a former revolutionary and cafe 
owner, living in exile. when he rejected the rwandans' tutelage, they 
had him murdered and replaced him with his son, joseph. 

to 
legitimise joseph kabila the aid donors paid for and organised two 
elections, each costing more than a billion dollars. in 2011 that came 
out of a national budget of £4.6 billion ($7.3 billion). the elections 
satisfied the western political need to give kabila international 
legitimacy so he could now receive aid. but the elections in congo 
divided rather than united. the losers saw them as fraudulent. 

after
 the election supporters were rewarded, opponents shunned but they live 
in different parts of the country so a small war broke out. at the very 
moment when the country needed to come together, the western solution 
deepened the divisions. it also handed total political and economic 
power to a greedy elite incapable of constructing a viable state – even,
 as one congolese academic said, in their own narrow interests. 

what
 has wrecked the congo is not lack of aid. it is politics. aid has 
probably made things worse by offering development which may never be 
delivered. there is no state capable of delivering it. if ever there was
 a case for a country to be under a un mandate, it is congo. the united 
nations' current half-baked, ill-thought-out mandate was cruelly exposed
 last week as un troops stood back to allow rebels to take the city of goma in eastern congo. 

but
 there was a second, even more catastrophic contradiction in western 
policy. after the rwandan genocide, western governments, ridden with 
guilt, supported the incoming rwandan regime, a rebel group led by the 
charismatic paul kagame. he now runs a capable state – perhaps too 
capable. rwanda is a tightly controlled dictatorship, with almost no 
press or political freedom. but it uses aid well, it is not stolen. a 
succession of british aid ministers from clare short to andrew mitchell 
see kagame as the saviour of africa. they gave him money – currently 
£83m a year, knowing it will be spent on education, health and other 
good things.
next, a story on how corruption within the congo government is causing inflation and hunger from irin.  

the republic of congo, which imports over us$240 million worth of food a
 year, has seen sharply rising staple food and fuel prices since the 
beginning of 2012, according to the un food and agriculture organization
 (fao) and a local consumer rights body.

a 25-litre tin of vegetable oil which sold in january 2012 for the 
equivalent of $32, is now going for $50, while less than 5kg of cassava 
has gone up from $1 to $2.6, according to dieudonné moussala, chairman 
of the consumer rights association.

he also said the price of a litre of kerosene had risen from 70 us cents to $2.6 on the black market in the same period.

"i now buy a kilo of meat from the slaughterhouse for 3,500 cfa francs 
[$7], whereas it used to cost less than 2,000 [$4],” carine moutombo, 
32, a mother of three, told irin.

"it is difficult to get by and eat one’s fill. the cooking money is no longer enough," said moutombo.

"all the prices of imported frozen products have increased because of 
corruption in the supply chain [from entry at the port of pointe-noire 
to small retailers]," said moussala.

"there are too many unofficial taxes and too many checkpoints in the 
supply chain. retailers and other importers are corrupt at all levels. 
in the end, they pass on any losses to poor consumers - hence the surge 
in commodity prices," said moussala.

"while we have not found the solution to all the problems [related to 
imports]… we still have a long way to go. that is why our country’s 
struggle against food insecurity is key in terms of public policy," said
 minister of agriculture and livestock rigobert maboundou in april. 
according to him the congo is a "food-deficit country".

to limit imports and ensure food security, congo launched in 2010 a us$26 million project
 to build "new agricultural villages". with this project, "we have 
halved the import bill for eggs. we produced 6.6 million eggs in 2011, 
while imports are estimated at 13 million eggs per year," said 
maboundou.

in 2011, congo also leased 180,000 hectares of arable land to a group of
 south african farmers who have managed to plant 1,200 hectares of 
maize.

"the congo imports almost half of the essential commodities it needs. 
you need to know this to understand current soaring prices. imported 
products contain imported inflation,” andré kamba, chief of staff at the
 ministry of trade and supply, told irin.

saving newborns in burundi





a country that once suffered a long civil war has surpassed a milestone in health.

burundi had a long civil war that lasted over a decade. even though the war ended in 2006, many people still have untreated injuries from the war. medicines sans frontiers set up a hospital in burundi's capital to help treat these injuries, but found that more women were showing up than former soldiers. msf then decided to turn the clinic into a maternal health ward.



the hospital's work has helped to contribute to burundi's improving record on
maternal health. the country has now surpassed the millennium development goal
on maternal health, cutting mortality rates by 75%.

from the guardian, writer clar ni chonghaile tells us more about the hospital. 

in a report
 (pdf) released last week, msf said the €1.8m (£1.5m) project in kabezi,
 just outside bujumbura, and a similar programme in sierra leone, had 
cut maternal deaths by up to 74% by providing free access to emergency 
obstetric care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

in 2011, 
maternal mortality in kabezi fell to 208 per 100,000 live births, 
compared with a national average of 800 per 100,000 live births. in bo, 
sierra leone, the rate declined to 351 per 100,000 compared with 890 per
 100,0000 in the rest of the country – a 61% decrease. 

this means that in kabezi, the millennium development goal – of reducing maternal mortality by 75% from national rates in 1990
 – has already been achieved. msf is confident it can replicate that 
success in bo. "you do not need state-of-the-art facilities or equipment
 to save many women's lives," says vincent lambert, msf's medical 
adviser for projects in burundi. 

in kabezi, msf provides an 
ambulance referral service for women suffering complications during 
labour or pregnant women at risk. the women used to be brought to the 
msf curgo clinic in kabezi but since floods threatened the facility in 
november, the team has been based in cmck. they hope to move back to 
kabezi in a few weeks. 

the cost works out at just over €3 per 
person in the kabezi area, which is home to around 600,000 people. the 
curgo clinic registers about 3,000 births per year, with 50% coming from
 caesareans.

urban agriculture in dakar





even in the midst of supercities agriculture is thriving. in senegal's dakar over 6,000 people work in agriculture and the harvests are growing each year. agriculture within urban areas does have its own set of unique challenges. farmers are unable to expand their operations with more land. loans are hard to come by for the farmers as some are working on land they do not own.

from the inter press service, koffigan abigbli looks at one thriving farm.  

watering cans in hand, men and women move back and forth between the 
wells and water storage tanks and the crops they’re watering: carrots, 
onions, tomatoes, cabbage, and potatoes, as well as fruit trees like 
palm, coconut, papaya and banana trees.
growers like ahmadou sene are working tirelessly to produce 
vegetables in and around the senegalese capital. 

sene, in his forties, 
has a one-hectare plot. for three months of the year, he has a dozen 
young people to hoe and weed the garden, and for four months a group of 
20 women work to harvest and sell his produce. 

“vegetables make up more than 80 percent of my crops,” he said, 
gesturing towards his garden. he cultivates his field year round, and 
harvests nearly 12 tonnes of vegetables each quarter.
...


but while urban farming
 is growing, farmers are facing difficulties linked to access to land, 
the marketing of vegetables, the recycling of water for irrigation, and 
access to financing.
even as the cultivated area is growing, some farmers are struggling to find land to expand their operations. 

“in 2010, i had an 800 square metre field. i was able to turn a 
profit of 600,000 cfa (about 1,200 dollars). but this year, i’ve only 
got 350 square metres to farm, because the government has taken over a 
large portion of my land for a dam to hold water,” said cheikh mor 
ndiaye, a grower at cambérène, one of the sprawling suburbs on the 
outskirts of the capital. 

the president of the administrative council of the federated 
cooperative of horticulturalists of senegal (cfahs), cheikh ngane, told 
ips that while garden farming provides livelihoods for a good number of 
senegalese, it is undermined by the recurring problem of access to land. 

“most horticulturalists are working with land that belongs to the 
state. to develop horticulture, it’s important to resolve the problem of
 land,” he said, adding that the problem is aggravated by competing 
claims from developers working on residential housing developments. 

the issue of land ownership can also lead to problems obtaining 
credit. “for example, if someone has their own plot, assigned to them by
 the rural community, bankers are not confident when they ask for a 
loan,” said cheikh ngane.

big business, meet small farmer





 for most small farmers in the under-developed world the only maket they had access to was local. the fair trade movement began a process that helped small farmers gain access to worldwide markets. when it works right, it is supposed to be a win-win for the farmer and the market. the farmer should be able to sell more, and the world has another source for food.

what many are wondering is what this relationship would look like when big agri-businees begins to invest in the small farms of the under-developed world. would the small farmer impove financailly, or would they be exploited? from the guardian, writer matthew newsome attended a conference that covered this subject. 

this month more than 500 private-sector representatives, government 
officials, donors, civil society representatives, farmer organisations 
and academics met in ethiopia for a conference
 organised by the technical centre for agricultural and rural 
co-operation. they discussed the role of the private sector in upgrading
 smallholder agriculture to meet demand from foreign and emerging 
markets in developing countries. investment interest is underscored by 
the imf's forecast of 5.7% economic growth in 2013 for sub-saharan 
africa, which is being driven by rising commodity prices. 

rising food prices
 suggest global demand is still outpacing farmers' productivity, and 
resource-constrained smallholders need greater market access, training 
and technology to increase their agricultural production, according to 
the experts at the meeting in ethiopia. 

development 
organisations are promoting the merits of a mutual partnership between 
large corporations and small farmers. john moffett, director of policy 
and strategy for self help africa,
 has been working with small-scale cashew nut farmers and those who 
commodify the nut in benin, with support from pepsico, to supply 
europe's markets. "strengthening smallholder value chains is really 
about helping farmers to move from being subsistence based to enabling 
them to make a better profit," says moffett.

moffett says 
the role of ngos is starting to change: he sees them playing more of a 
temporary role in facilitating trade between small-scale producers and 
the private sector. once the supply chain links are in place he says, 
"the ngo will shift to being a watchdog". 

"development is 
now really focused on the economic development of africa through trade,"
 moffat adds. "it is moving away from the constant injection of aid 
funding into africa and focusing on something which, over time, should 
be more sustainable." africa's population is expected to reach 2 billion
 by 2050, so some argue it cannot afford to be short-sighted when 
dealing with investors.

the western world is on both sides of the corruption battle







the west talks a good game in wanting the corruption in poorer countries to  stop. our leaders often use their pulpits to bully
the poorer nations into cleaning up their act. the leaders of the poor nations
that score some victories gain our respect and aid money. still there are many
systems in the western world that support the corruption.



paul collier's latest opinion piece for the guardian points out that those
perpetrators of corruption often turn to the western world for help. the
thieves hire lawyers and public relations firms from new
 york, paris or london. their dirty money often flows thru
the western world without anyone stopping it. collier is calling on western
leaders to do more to stop helping the thieves. in this snippet, he mentions guinea leader
aissatou boiro who was gunned down last friday by supporters of the very
thieves he was trying to catch. 


with the us election out of the way, it is time for american companies to face this reality. to date, their response to the cardin-lugar amendment
 requiring transparency in their transactions has been to mount a legal 
challenge. rather than this doomed and demeaning strategy of pushing 
back, they would be well advised to push forward. cardin-lugar is being 
imitated: this month the european parliament is likely to adopt it 
across europe. canada, home to the world's main financial market for 
second-tier resource extraction companies, is about to become an 
aberrant laggard that is surely not beyond the reach of influence. 

the
 success of decent african governments in their struggle against 
corruption is not only in our interest, it is partly our responsibility.
 inadvertently, we are currently providing much of the capacity needed 
for corruption to fight back. we are not, of course, complicit in the 
murder of boiro, though her blood should remind us that brave people are
 putting their lives on the line. but the sharp lawyers and slick public
 relations consultants who counter the effort for clean governance are 
not based in countries such as guinea: they are in london, paris and new
 york. 

similarly, the clandestine flows of dirty money essential 
for corruption, which boiro was trying to trace, depend on an army of 
facilitating lawyers, accountants and bankers. they are the people who 
establish shell companies and nominee bank accounts to conceal true 
beneficial ownership, and whip money across borders far faster than the 
lumbering process of inter-governmental legal co-operation. governments 
such as guinea's bear the brunt of these ethically wretched activities, 
but they are beyond their capacities to address. 

they are not, however, beyond our own capacities. we could turn the system of mutual legal assistance,
 whereby governments are supposed to co-operate to prise information out
 of suspected criminals and witnesses, from a sham into a reality. we 
could require the documents that establish shell companies and bank 
accounts to carry the names of the lawyers and bankers who executed 
them. these people could then face legal liability to ensure that the 
authorities could readily establish beneficial ownership. our 
governments and our associations have an obligation to rein in the 
unscrupulous tail of our professions.

ebola continues to spread in uganda







a month ago, uganda
declared itself free of their latest ebola outbreak. since then, three people
have died of ebola virus. two of the three were from the same family. all of
these new fatalities occurred near the capital of kampala.



from reuters alert net, we find out more
about the continued spread of the virus. 

the first case involved a driver of a boda boda - motorcycle taxis 
common in uganda - who died on oct. 25 while the second victim, a 
25-year old woman who nursed the driver, died on nov. 10. lab tests have
 not yet been completed on the third case. 

ebola and marbug are both highly infectious, spread mostly through contact with body fluids, and have high case fatalities. 

symptoms include bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting and while there is 
no cure for both diseases, some patients survive through treatment of 
symptoms. 

a total of 16 people died from the last ebola outbreak and the frequency of infections has been rising in recent years. 

uganda has managed to avoid a repeat of its worst episode of ebola, 
in 2000, when 425 people were infected and more than half died.
