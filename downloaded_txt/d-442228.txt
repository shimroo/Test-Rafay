in 2015 we warned you that the new miami springs pool was going to be much smaller than the grand olympic sized pool we had for over 50 years.  we also informed you that much of the money was going into creating more buildings.  in other words, more building space.  less pool space.  now you can see the construction of the new pool with your own eyes.  total construction cost:  $5 million.
