                                            with close to 200 courses in the area and great golf weather (including little chance of rainouts) throughout the year, the phoenix-scottsdale market is one of the most popular golf destinations in the world. the peak season is winter and spring since temperatures are cooler and courses are generally heavily overseeded, but summer and fall are the best times to find deals.
