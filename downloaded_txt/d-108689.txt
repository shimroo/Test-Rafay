about rocking horse ranch 















 

 
 






















the therapeutic riding program at rocking horse ranch has been life changing for me. it has given me confidence in myself, brought me through personal difficulties in daily life and helped me to see there's hope.

rocking horse ranch - greenville, has provided a phenomenal experience for our daughter and our family. out daughter with autism is very calm and focused when working with her horse and trainers. our daughter looks going every week. rhr has provided for at least some peace during our stress filled week because when our daughter is calm, we are in turn able to be calm.

this is [my daughter's] 3rd year with rhr. she loves riding, doing tricks, and enjoys being around the horses. [she] communicates with midnight by using simple commands and by picking up on their body cues. riding therapy has been good for her trunk support, stretching her muscles, and working on her balance.

in my time of being blessed to be a participant at rocking horse ranch, the many challenges i have faced in my health included anxiety, depression, cptsd, migraines, and healing from greater than twelve years of chemotherapy treatments resulting in peripheral neuropathy... my life has been and continues to be forever changed by the rocking horse ranch family including trainers, administration staff and volunteers, and the amazing stars of the ranch: the horses.
