	what should be the role of scientists in relation to issues such as climate change?

comment on the great debate: 
	"fun is not usually a word that complements intelligent discussion, but 
	without wishing to devalue the serious nature of the enterprise that's 
	exactly what the great debates are. for more than three years i have 
	been going to the debates on all sorts of subjects and never been 
	disappointed.  the speakers are always willing to engage with the 
	audience even if what they have to say is a little off the wall.  
	attendance is usually free, which means all my poor friends can come along 
	as well. the atmosphere is friendly and inclusive, during intervals 
	there is the possibility of free flowing intellectual engagement."

  recent history



	in 2023, the great debate celebrated its twenty fifth anniversary and 
	after a long break following the covid epidemic we were delighted to team up 
	with the national 
politics in pubs
	initiative to facilitate a 
	series of 
	 discussions under the banner 
	politics in pubs newcastle 
	held in the telegraph pub, newcastle, between 
	march and
	december on 
	topics ranging from 
	the monarchy to
	nudge policy. 
	this successful partnership continued throughout 2024, begining in january with a 
	lighthearted look at
	"reasons to be cheerful", 
	and continuing throughout the year with discussions including 
	education 
	or indoctrination - what is happening in uk schools? in march,
	proportional representation
	in july,
	what about the menz?
	 in october, and
	trump's victory: what to 
	expect from maga 2.0 in december.
	we were also excited to begin to bring in special guest speakers, with 
	sessions on
	north east devolution 
	with conservative mayoral candidate, guy renner-thompson (february), 
	britain's trade problem and 
	why it matters, introduced by william clouston, leader of the 
	social democratic party (april), 
	the politics of climate 
	change, introduced by dr alistair ford  (june), 
	in light of labour's 
	 election victory, has woke won? in september with 
	joanna williams, author 
	how woke won: 
	   the elitist movement that threatens democracy, tolerance and reason, and
	panic on a plate, 
	introduced by rob lyons, author, 
	panic on a plate: 
	  how society developed an eating disorder.
	we plan to bring many more debates in 2025 - watch this space for information on 
	what is coming up and to read more about our previous discussions.	
   








	between 2017 and 2020, the great debate teamed up with 
	institution of civil engineers to deliver
	the 
ice breaking dialogues. this series of seven public debates 
	held at the mining institute, newcastle, was 
	very well attended and well received, covering a wide range of topics 
	including:
	devolution;
	who 
	should pay for education;
	hs2;
	brexit;
	and 
	climate 
	 change adaption vs mitigation. while the covid 19 pandemic put a stop to
	this series, we hope to resume them in 2024.
   







	in september 2018 the great debate held its 20th anniversary
	event "the art of reason: 
	curiosity, creativity, mystery" at the black swan 
	in newcastle upon tyne.
	organised in partnership with 
	bigg books,
	north-east humanists,
	newcastle philosophical society
	 and
	philosophical society of england,
	this one day event explored the uniquely human gift of reason and rationality 
	in all its various forms. speakers included 
	raymond tallis,
	old friend of the great debate who discussed his latest book,
	
logos: the mystery of how we make sense of things; 
	  
	timothy 
	 williamson, oxford university, author, 
	doing philosophy: 
		from common curiosity to logical reasoning; 
	  
	nigel 
	 collins,
	newcastle philosophical society; 
	hisham 
		el edrissi, a-level student, heaton manor school;  
	edward 
		gibney,
		north-east humanists;  
	david large, 
		the great debate; 
	amanda 
	 	mcbride,
	 	newcastle philosophical society; 
	and
	andrés 
		saenz de sicilia, newcastle university.

	in april 2018, the great debate was back at european geosciences union 
	(egu) general assembly in vienna with 
	'the great debate: 
	hands on or hands off?', a debate looking at the
	   growing distrust of experts in the public imagination and the implications
	   that has for the role of scientists in policy making and the political sphere.
   

	in february 2017, the great debate launched the 
	
ice breaking dialogues, a series of public debates organised in
	association with institution of civil engineers (ice) north east. so far, the series
	has included debates on devolution, flooding, who should pay for education and hs2.
	watch this space for future debates in the series.
   

	in october 2016, the great debate's director, caspar hewett, spoke
	on the panel of a debate entitled 'humanity's big challenge: water wars'
	at the battle of ideas festival in london. 
	view the video here.
   

	in april 2016, the great debate co-convened a debate at 
	european geosciences union (egu) general assembly in vienna.
	'plan it earth:
	is there enough resource for all?' critically examined the 
	controversies surrounding management of resources and challenged
	the geosciences community to apply its knowledge to solve problems
	(click here for video of the debate).
	this event followed on from successful debates held at egu in 2015 
	and 2015: 'the 
	thirsty 10 billion: are we managing?' 
	(click here for video) and
	'geoengineering the climate:
	 the way forward?' 
	(click here for video).
   

the great debate was delighted to announce that in late 2014 our 
	
great northern youth voices
 
	project won an outstanding flagship project award from 
	united nations university institute for the advanced study of sustainability 
	(unu-ias). special thanks are due to jackie scollen for all her hard work, 
	to charlie winstanley for his valued contribution to the project, 
	to mo lovatt for her role in getting us started on this road and 
	jon bryan without whose support the great debate
	simply would not have kept going the last few years. 
   

	in 2014, we ran a series of events 
	as part of etude:
	engineering transmission using deliberative events in
	partnership with durham, newcastle and northumbria universities
	and institution of civil engineers. the
	etude
	project engaged engineers in dialogue with the general 
	public in order to improve understanding the intersection of technology with 
	human values and behaviour. building on the success of our 
	2011/2012 project
	sustained engagement,
	etude used a variety of formats to develop dialogues between 
	participating engineers and our general audiences with events running throughout
	2014. etude was funded by
	royal 
	academy of engineering under their ingenious
	grant scheme. 	
	more ...


	in 2013 the great debate celebrated its fifteenth year
	of providing a space for public debate in the north east.
	we had a fitting start to the year with a nod to where it all started
	with a seven week evening course on 
	
	the science of humanity. this was followed in april with the
	first of our great north festival debates which
	ran throughout the year.
	one highlight of the year was 
	
	media, culture, voice: tackling inequality and marginalisation
	in july with vinod pavarala of university of hyderabad.
   

	we were also pleased to anounce that we won two other grants in our 
	fifteenth year which kept us busy throughout 2013-14:
   


	 economic and social research council supported us for the 
	 seventh year running to contribute to their
	festival of social science in november 2013.
	
	decline and fool: changing ideas in the twenty teens 
	looked at the declining influence of ideas that have dominated 
	politics, philosophy and the arts for decades and asked what, if anything,
	is taking their place. this day of active debate and documentary-making 
	included two panel debates: environmental retreat, examining how 
	environmentalism 
	has become less central in the popular imagination since the economic downturn; and 
	after the fall?, looking at postmodernism, asking what people think it is,
	whether it has any relevance to the general population and what we would we like to see 
	replace it. more ...   	in previous years, the great debate's
	esrc festival of social science events included
	whatever 
	happened to equality? (2012), 
	facing the 
	future (2011), 
	
	getting real about climate change (2010)
	
	dont shout at the telly, change what's on it! (2009)
	
	the credit crunch: consequences for uk households (2009)
	developing 
	world challenges (2008) and
	the 3rd workshop on 
	development, sustainability and environment (2007).
   



	big lottery fund's awards for all scheme is now offering follow-on
	funding for existing projects, and we were extremely pleased and proud that
	they awarded us £10,000 to resume
	
	great northern youth voices, 
	our venture into
	documentary-making training for young people not in employment, education or training.
	in 2011 a £10,000 startup grant from big lottery fund enabled us both to buy 
	the minimum of kit needed to make this aspect of our 
	work sustainable and provided the funds to run a set of pilot workshops. 
	this was followed up by £5000 from dulverton trust which enabled us to continue 
	running workshops into 2012. the latest grant 
	allowed us to continue this work throughout 2014.
	more ...


the great debate rolled out a programme of debate workshops for schools
	throughout the north east in the 2011/12 academic year. this included
	a series of workshops in schools and a school debating 
	competition sponsored by newcastle university.

whatever happened to equality?











whatever happened to equality? was a day of active
    debate and documentary-making
    held as part of esrc festival of social science 2012.
    the event took a critical look at how the ideal of
