we have reopened with winter hours - please visit our hours page for more information
we are accepting orders with featured designs as well as simple custom designs for pickup on tuesday 2/18 through saturday 2/22
we are accepting orders with custom designs for pickup tuesday 2/25 (after 2pm) and onwards
 
if you prefer to place an order in-person, saturdays are the busiest day for the counter with order pickups. it is best to place an order in-person tuesdays through fridays during operating hours (10am to 6pm). if you email with an inquiry, or have been put on a call back list, this does not guarantee you a spot in our order capacity. we try our best to acommodate as many order requests as we can, but our kitchen staff tells us when they can not take on any custom or high-detail orders in respect to those who have placed orders in advance. without a deposit, orders are not considered confirmed, nor are sent to the kitchen to be prepared. please make sure to confirm your orders and make a payment for your order to be locked in.
