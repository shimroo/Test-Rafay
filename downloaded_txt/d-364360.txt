actuallyby anna zieglernovember 2nd, 2:00 p.m.directed by sara bickweat pennerthis play contains flashbacks to scenes of sex and underage alcohol use, questions surrounding consent, and issues of race, ethnicity, and white supremacy.amber and tom, finding their way as freshmen at princeton, spend a night together that alters the course of their lives. they agree on the drinking, they agree on the attraction, but consent is foggy, and if unspoken, can it really be called consent? with lyricism and wit, actually investigates gender and race politics, our crippling desire to fit in, and the idea that there are three sides to every story.click here to view the digital playbill!

permanent collectionby thomas gibbonsfebruary 8th, 2:00 p.m.directed by reuben tappsterling north is the new director of the morris foundation. when he discovers that this world-famous art collection includes several significant african sculptures, he proposes to add them to the public galleries … and is met with resistance. the clash quickly escalates to public accusations of racism and a bitter struggle for control of the collection. this searing examination of racial politics ultimately asks how much space -- literally and figuratively -- the white world gives to african-americans.click here to view the digital playbill!

birds of north americaby anna ouyang moenchapril 5th, 2:00 p.m.directed by matt amesjohn and his daughter caitlyn are birders. as they scan the skies over their backyard in suburban maryland looking for elusive birds, years go by; relationships begin and end; children grow up and parents age; the climate and the world change in small and vast ways. birds of north america takes a close look at the relationship of a father and daughter over the course of a decade as they struggle to accept the parts of one another that defy understanding.

dream hou$eby eliana pipesjune 7thth, 2:00 p.m.directed by mary mendez rizzotwo latina sisters are appearing on an hgtv-style reality show to sell their family home, hoping to capitalize on the gentrification in their “changing neighborhood.” as they perform for the camera the show starts to slip into the surreal: one sister grapples with turmoil in the family’s ancestral past and the other learns how much she’s willing to sacrifice for the family’s future. dream hou$e, which earned both the kendeda award and steinberg playwriting award in 2021, is a crowd-pleasing comedy with a twist that asks: what is the cultural cost of progress in america? and is cashing in always selling out?
