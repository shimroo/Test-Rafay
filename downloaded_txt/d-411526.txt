we love our community


community event calendar




we do love our communities—understanding we are much more than a financial institution.  beyond the x’s and o’s of banking, our energy and our focus is to support our serving communities in el paso, fort bliss, and las cruces that includes our local schools, universities, and trade schools.  moreover, small business, not-for-profits, and other feel-good community projects to strengthen individual and family wellness. 
our team members serve on local boards—the chamber of commerce, uso, ymca, boy scouts of america, bridges academy, the boys and girls club, and so many more—involved in organizations to simply make a difference. we too have scores of staff who donate their time and energy to other community-minded causes, inclusive of the el paso diabetes association, children's miracle network, and the alzheimer’s association.
whether facilitating financial wellness initiatives, raising scholarship funds to support graduating seniors through our community foundation or championing the effort to marginalize food insecurity through our firstlight giving program, our team and volunteers are focused on being a valuable neighbor and friend.


more than a financial institution
improve lives. achieve dreams.
