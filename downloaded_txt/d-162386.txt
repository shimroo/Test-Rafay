		our cousin, steve reynolds
		talks about his american bulldog, "bj"



		1975



		"he was the kindest, toughest, gentlest, 
		strongest dog i ever saw.    he was around 
		for 15 years or more, and though he has been gone
		for many years, he left a big hole down on the farm."




        
			

      
			





			pictured above is an antique print

			we found one day while having lunch at cracker barrel. 
			the restaurant would not sell us the framed print
			but allowed us to take a photo with our cell phone.




			sure enough, when we compared the print copy

			with photos of our "amos" pup,
			the resemblance was striking!
			amos is out of malachi and sadie.





















see what
		the pups look like

		now that they are grown!

i want to be a champion like my american bulldog
courageous enough to face danger with the confidence of who i am
driven enough to pursue those things that i was created to run after
tenacious enough to never give up
kind enough to consider those around me
forgiving enough not to hold grudges
and
loyal enough to never forsake those who depend on me
help me god, to be a champion !!
