 hmm...

believe it or not i'm failing my spanish even though we only have 3 grades in there... i have a 20/30, a 30/30, and a 0/30.... so that all adds up to 50/90.... so basically i suck. my dad was upset and my mom was upset, and i'm angry because i didn't turn something in on time so she may not grade it... but i'll just havta do it this weekend and try to turn it in on monday.... but i should have turned it in yesterday... but, being me, i didn't do it....i wonder how i keep as and bs when i practically never do my homework or study.... if i did study and do my homework, would that mean i'd get straight as? and havta take higher grade classes? yeah thats what my parents were trying to make me do. my mom said that i barely work hard on it and i still get good grades and my dad says i should study more and then i'd not havta worry about getting bad grades.... but either way, they want me to do more to do better... don't u hate parents?yeah so i'mma gonna go and finally look at my myspace thing since, after all, i did make it to be able to comment on and look at other people's myspaces...nevermind... the bell just rang....

ahhhh i'm so bored outta my entire life...... agahgahgahgah....... yeah.... i'm dying from boredom.... and yet i still am typing.... even though i'm close to death right now..... yes..... no..... poolshark? maybe, but then again maybe not.... i'm not dure, u would havta ask kim..... but i need to do something u guys.... i need to get out of here and do something..... but we can't because i would want to go to the coffee house or the kava hut and the only way we would go is if my mom went and there is no chance of that..... because she told me last night when i asked her if she could do something with me she said too bad and that i'd find out why today..... so now upon my 'boredom' i have slapped a nice ripe slice of the ol 'wtf!!!'.... yearsh so now i need to get a thing to do... so i'mma gonna post the only 2 pictures of my that i can post.... because they are on shelby's photobucket and i don't want to overtake her photobucket because that would be really mean (kim i'll tell u my master plan later) and that would also be rude... so i guess i shall put them here now.... right.... here..... crap! they are gone........... not there...... i guess i never put them there huh? yeah so the first bell rang so i'm supposing that the lady will now run around in circles saying 'ok time to go to class don't be late go to class don't be late you don't want to be late!'..... i hate that woman and her high pitched noises that excape that hole in her face..... she is pure evil.... well not pure but she has some evil in her..... so yeah i'm getting off but kim needs to come to school today so that we can talk about our band names in drama!..... so please come kim? i'm outty....
