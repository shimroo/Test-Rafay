where can i find the chinese dub of the legend of korra?

	i swear i've looked everywhere, and i can't find it. i know it exists---i saw clips of it way back when i first started learning chinese. 



	 



	i'm open to pirating or buying, but if i end up having to pay money for it, i'd want a digital copy, not a physical one (don't have a region-unlocked dvd player)

	it was a comedic wuxia movie, and all i remember was the main character told the (i think) bad guy, if you eat/drink whatever food/drink, it will cause your uh, appendage to shrivel and fall off, haha.  i still remember the tape lent to me had full contact (chow yun-fat) movie right after, so it had to be probably early 90's.  any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.

	it was a cantonese song, the only things i remember was it was a male singer, and the english lyrics "sunday, monday", i'm not sure if he sang each day in english in the lyrics.  thank you.



	 



	edit: found it!



	 



	randomly found it!  remembered the sunday part, and remembered it was deric wan.  luckily this popped up:

trying to find a early 90's hk songs casette tape


by 


duo21 
started february 6, 2025 at 10:40  am



 
	it is not so much the cassette tape, but the song titles i have been searching for.  i remember the cover of the cassette tape was various singers like jacky cheung, aaron kwok, and andy lau.  the cover was kind of bright if memory serves me correct.  i remember the first song on the cassette was sung by jacky cheung, a song that began with whistling i still remember.  the second song i specifically remember was happy birthday by andy lau.  on the cassette cover, i remember aaron kwok still had his hair parted in the middle, and i believe the cover said '93.  i could be wrong on that, though.  if anyone recalls the cassette tape i am talking about, i would greatly appreciate it.  thank you so much.



	 



	edit: someone found the cd version for me!

dictionary pens for chinese (词典笔)


by 


liqi 
started february 5, 2025 at 11:38  am



 
	anyone has any experience with those kind of devices? i was thinking of buying one because i honestly kinda hate how i have to use my phone for everything. i don't enjoy much reading on the phone, and having to pull it out to look up on the dictionary is annoying as i sometimes get distracted by other stuff (thanks adhd!). so, instead of going nuclear and buying an actual dictionary heh, i looked up those 词典笔 on taobao. they don't seem too bad actually, but they're obviously marketed towards chinese speakers leaning english, not the other way around, so idk if it would work very well for what i want (mostly just single word lookups). has anyone ever tried one? i have my eyes on 有道 because i like their website (even though idk how related they are) and it seems to be the best reviewed one (some of these can even solve math apparently😂)

			hi everyone! 👋
		

		
			i’m yauheniya, the author of chinese for beginners: practice workbook. this book is designed for kids (6+) and adults taking their first steps into learning chinese. it focuses on 50 of the simplest and most essential chinese characters, complete with step-by-step stroke order guides, pinyin pronunciation, english meanings, and plenty of practice grids.
		

		
			to make learning fun and memorable, each character is paired with fascinating cultural facts and cute illustrations that act as visual mnemonics. the book is organized into 10 thematic sections to keep learning structured, and interactive exercises at the end of each section reinforce what you’ve learned.
		

		
			you can take a sneak peek at the content and layout by clicking the "read sample" button on the book’s page here: chinese for beginners: practice workbook on amazon.
		

		
			i’d love to hear your thoughts! does the book meet your needs as a beginner? is there anything you’d like to see improved or added? your feedback would mean so much to me as i work to make learning chinese even more enjoyable for everyone. 😊
