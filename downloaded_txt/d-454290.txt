  "feel good choose wood"


  we believe wood as a heating fuel is environmentally appropriate and economically beneficial. a fireplace or wood burning stove is warm and cozy on a cold winter evening but can soon become a frighting experience with a chimney fire!! we sometimes forget why our forfathers changed to central heating systems. wood burning appliances always require regular maintanence to be safe and reliable.

  wood burning tips
 
   

   burn good quality dry wood!
 for high efficiency appliances, that can maintain a very slow burning fire, try to have a good rip roaring fire regularly to prevent the continual creation of creosote if you use your wood burning appliance regularly it is important to have your chimney inspected and cleaned regularly by a qualified and certified chimney sweep.like any activity we engage in, there is a right and wrong way to use wood heating. wood can be harvested and dried incorrectly, which results in dirty creosote producing burn and inefficient heat. endeavour to be well informed about the wood you burn and the maintenance of your wood burning appliance.
