patients testimonials


third time to e.r. over a one year period.each time the check was quick and easy and i have never had to wait longer than 15 min before being seen.every time the nurse and doctor have been very good at listening and explaining what treatment was needed.blake butler  even with how strained this hospital is due to covid-19 and not enough staff and room (at the time i was there) the care i received in the er was great. it took longer than i liked, but that‚Äôs understandable. the nurses and dr were friendly, attentive, and answered any questions we had. i‚Äôm very thankful for the care i received. üôèrenee mckean  kindness & compassion were shown by all regarding my care. time spent in the lobby was extensive, during which the receptionist came out & apologized to all. once i arrived in a room, care was offered quickly & compassionately. i hated having to be there but your employees made it so much better than it could‚Äôve been. although all care was outstanding, your lab tech is exceptional.christina ward
