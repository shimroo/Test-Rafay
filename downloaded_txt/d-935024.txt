i'm indebted to indiana bible college. i gained valuable exposure and experience. my four years there prepared me and my spirit to plant a church the week after graduation at age 22. don't delay any longer, if you have a "yes" from god and a "yes" from your pastor.

mark brown, class of 2006





there is no experience in my life that shaped my identity as an apostolic more than indiana bible college. at indiana bible college my talents were developed, my grasp on apostolic doctrine was strengthened, and my passion for the kingdom was established. as a student, my ministry became a reality, and now my reality is ministry.

abigail haworth, class of 2021





my understanding and knowledge of the bible was enhanced while at ibc. the lessons i learned in student government and ministeral student association prepared me for leadership roles in my church, section, and district.

justin reinking, class of 2003





when i came to indiana bible college all i had was a call from god. indiana bible college equipped me with a burden, a passion and the tools to take that call of god and enter the ministry better prepared.

alex spooner, class of 2018





god led me to ibc where i gained experiences and wisdom for phases of ministry i could not have imagined and continue to glean from today.

kimberly reinking, class of 2003





chapels, prayer meetings, classes, and socials; just a few of the things that will forever be at the top of a long list of reasons i am glad god led me to the missiology program of indiana bible college. as i begin my life in ministry, i am so thankful for the core values of leadership, excellence, vision, and integrity i have been surrounded by and instilled in me the last four years. as a result, i now strive to apply these values in my daily life as i continue to pursue the call of god.

alex perry, class of 2020
