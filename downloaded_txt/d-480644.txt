as a tasty byproduct of the spanish conquest, yucatan peninsula cooking combines european style and mayan flavor. favored dishes range from suckling pig baked in banana leaves to tortillas with fried black beans, spiced chicken and pickled onions. yet with more than 1,200 restaurants in the tourism stronghold of cancun, both the hotel zone and downtown have extensive menus stretching way beyond mexican fare. steak and seafood abound, and globally trained chefs at most cancun resorts and hotels prepare both excellent international classics along with whatever is trendy. hotel zone restaurants cater toward middle-of-the-road tourist tastes, while downtown restaurants are the best bet for adventurers seeking authentic, often spicy local specialties. avenida tulum has an abundance of outdoor-café tables for taking in the bustle of vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
