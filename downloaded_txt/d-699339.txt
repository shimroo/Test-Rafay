              deutsche stiftung musikleben
            




classical music is something very special. from chamber music to an oratorio, from a sonata to a beautiful symphony – music enrichens our lives in a very essential way.
that’s why dsm supports our highly skilled offspring in the long term. they are doing this for more than 40 years now and they support their stipendiaries and awardees individually regarding to age and situation. dsm helps our musicians with long-term studentships or financial support. they are also organizing concerts or tours in germany, europe or america to give them stage experience. and dsm even provides instruments for the best of their students.
compared to other supporting charities which have a capital based program, the deutsche stiftung musikleben has to attract funding for their program yearly. that’s why they depend on donations.
support the program on http://www.deutsche-stiftung-musikleben.de/
