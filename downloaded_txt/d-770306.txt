[current mood
|pensive]since this place is a mostly deadzone... i doubt anyone even knows i still post here.. maybe i should start using this as a place to vent off my more darker thoughts. i like to think i have a firm grasp on my suicidal tendencies but who knows. i mean last time i posted my mom was still alive, girl was out of the picture and i was planning on being alive in 2013. things change.

not much to say at the moment but i've been considering putting my thoughts down here. i haven't fully decided yet but i'm sure a lot has happened since i last updated my lj. technically i'm kinda dying now and i'm sure that's new. anyway just echoing to see what's up.about.me/wolfkin

my shirt is ruined
[jun. 24th, 2009|07:58 pm]
the wolfkin




i just realized that the reason my shirt has been 'sticking' to the back of my chair is gum. i got gum on the back of my shirt. now my alpha geek shirt one of five that i have here in canada is ruined. everything i've tried to do today has failed. this day is just full of failure. i went to buy a jug of water and they were out. i went to a govt office and they were closed due to some strike?. ugh. this day is really pissing me off

on almost catching up
[jun. 11th, 2009|02:39 am]
the wolfkin




it's 3:30 in the morning. i'm approaching delirium. 2-4am is always the hardest part. i've given up trying to do real work, but i still have enough sense of self to catch up on my personal stuff. i haven't been to cag(http://www.cheapassgamer.com) in weeks and there's a new contest plus i just got a beta key. oh speaking of contests i have a whole folder of daily contests i haven't had time to enter. now's a good time for it no? i might as well finish the cell (very colorful so far. not quite at that fifth element level but not bad). then i can find the cell 2 (http://www.fastpasstv.com/the-cell-2-2009) and figure out how they botched it. my voicemail is full and i need to empty some of those messages. i have to meet my new fourth client on tuesday and another on saturday. plus i have to call back one who didn't call for a meet on monday. i write this down not so much because i think anyone reading this cares but so that i will remember. one of the things i need to do is find a sync for my calendar so i can keep this stuff down myself.i was so very close to being caught up but looks like that's not gonna happen any time soon. it's not really fair of me to complain about my 'problems' not because of starving kids in africa but because my problems are pretty good.if this isn't making sense i might remind you about the semi-delirious state-- wait a sec-- ok that was the last set. week three (http://hundredpushups.com/week3.html) is, well actually it's not as bad as i feared. i'm averaging 5 over the set 5 mins.i really need to call my neurosurgeon see if he can tell me when they're going to crack my skull open and remove this bloody tumor. this waiting is .. well actually it's not too bad but everyone keeps asking me.my father's day card this year will include a note about how good my father is at giving directions. i never thought it was all that special until i experienced someone else trying to give me directions in an area where i'm going blind. alright my push-ups are done, my tv shows are queued up. i'm .. well not going to bed but this has to end sometime. order of operations: tv, cag, movie.p.s. interesting fact 80% of the worlds glitter finds it's way in my bed or on my chair somehow.

on tonights link hopping activities
[jun. 4th, 2009|11:49 pm]
the wolfkin




alright how did i get here (http://ping.fm/26bfo)ok i saw the trailer at apple trailers for new movie surrogates (http://ping.fm/vtjvq). it actually reminds me of something rather asimovian.. but then pretty much anything with robots can do that right. but it reminds me more specifically of the elijah baley series(http://ping.fm/fveh4). anyway i noticed in the trailer it was based not on a novel like i thought at first but a graphic novel(http://ping.fm/6kfwv). so i figured why not check it out. off to the pirate bay (http://ping.fm/krzuv) and searching led me to a bunch of sorprono's eps, the comics, and a dvd rip of 'a perfect fake'. clicking the link shows what appears to be a little girl. so now i'm confused as to why child porn appears to be in an imdb movie. i click the imdb link(http://ping.fm/9szwz) and it's unhelpful. i google perfect fake. i get a disturbing review (http://ping.fm/fpv6u) but it sounds like most porn reviews done by women. that sounds sexist and while i don't mean to imply that women hate porn it's the only way i can describe the disgustedly dismissive tone of the review. as i think this it occurs to me that maybe i'm being presumptuous and the author doesn't hate porn and maybe it's the tone of the documentary that puts the subject matter in a creepy light. so i check out the veoh link(http://ping.fm/asdjd). i'm familiar with veoh and video quality can be very good there. turns out not only is the quality excellent it appears you can get the entire documentary there for free if you install their widget. you only get a five minute preview without it. so while i'm watching the preview, i go thru the steps. i thought i had signed up for a veoh account long ago but maybe not.. anyway my username is taken and rather than go to my alt (which i hate doing) i try to do a password recovery on the off chance i did sign up and forgot the password. since i'm impatient i go back to the search results and click the youtube video(http://ping.fm/upyzx). it mentioned an 'original blog post' and i thought i'd check it out to see if maybe there was a review or something that might indicate this video isn't just an overly disgusting sex-a-thon like the first review says. turns out though there's nothing really of merit there just the video embedded. so that's what i did for the past 45 minutes or so instead of watching the unusuals. whew that's so many links in this it feels like an 800x600 formatted blog. remember when you couldn't find a layout that wasn't formatted for these mythical 800x600 screen resolutions that noone was using. ugh those were horrible times.
