gathered around god’s word and sacraments, we proclaim the gospel of jesus christ to the world.
three characteristics have described the american association of lutheran churches:  confessing, caring, and calling.

come join us! let’s walk together!
here we stand: we believe we are saved by grace through faith in jesus christ. we believe the holy bible is god’s infallible, inerrant word. we accept the lutheran confessions because they are the right interpretation of the holy scripture. we are a church body that counts every pastor and congregation as precious. we believe god has called us to reach people in our communities and around the world.

a christmas message from the presiding pastor
 ﻿ greetings in the name of our lord and savior, jesus christ! “…behold, an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ‘joseph, son of david, do not be afraid to take to you mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit. and she will bring forth a son, and you shall call his name jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.’” (matthew 1:20b-21).  despite the lights, the secular seasonal programs, and the gift-giving, we christians know the reason why christmas is such a joyful season; we are reminded once again of the father’s love begotten, who, assuming our flesh and blood, in order that through christ jesus, we might be restored into communion with god and once again becomes heirs of his kingdom, eternal life, and salvation. when an angel of the lord came to joseph in a dream and told him that the baby in mary’s womb shall be named jesus, we know this was ordained by our heavenly father as that name above all names is to be interpreted as “he will save his people from their sins.” this same promise is also reflected in the spirit inspired teachings of st. paul, who wrote, “christ jesus came into the world to save sinners.” (1 timothy 1:15). what does the work of salvation, which involves saving sinners, look like? it's important to understand this because only then can we grasp why the angel told the shepherds, “do not be afraid, for behold, i bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people” (luke 2:10). this understanding ensures that our christmas joy is founded on solid ground. according to god's inerrant and infallible word, his curse is upon every sin, and all sins stem from original sin. this curse is felt in the conscience of every man, woman, boy, and girl. we see the effects of this curse in the painful consequences of sin, including suffering, illness, misery, and ultimately, death (romans 6:23). as stated in psalm 90:7, "for we have been consumed by your anger, and by your wrath we are terrified." if we attempt to satisfy this divine wrath by our own manipulations, schemes, and devices, it becomes clear that all our efforts are in vain. we might experience a fleeting sense of relief, but lurking beneath the surface is the undeniable truth: the ultimate consequence, death, is inescapable, and none of us are exempt from its reach.
the message is clear through the word of god: there is only one helper and deliverer, the only-begotten son of god. he was sent into the world specifically to redeem and liberate sinful humanity from sin and its terrible consequence. in no uncertain terms, christ jesus alone brought about our salvation. he assumed our human nature and flesh in order to suffer and die for us, earning, through his vicarious death on calvary's cross, our freedom and liberty from the tyranny of sin. by giving himself as a ransom for our sin, he is the living proof of his love—the father's love shown through his son. beginning with his incarnation, which we celebrate as christmas, he redeems sin-sick hearts through the means of water and the word, presenting them as holy before his heavenly father. through christ jesus, god and sinner are reconciled (2 corinthians 5:19)! christmas reminds us that this celebration is not observing a single event in human history but rather the ongoing work of christ jesus until that great and glorious day. whenever the love of god, expressed through the gospel of his son, is preached and his sacrament is properly administered, the holy spirit creates, sustains, and matures a genuine and vibrant faith. this faith finds true joy in its creator, redeemer, and sanctifier, overwhelmingly affecting the conscience and soul, allowing the christian to join in the praise of god’s indescribable gift of love.
this authentic joy shines brightly when, alongside mary, the mother of our lord christ jesus, we keep all these things and ponder them in our hearts. with the shepherds, we embrace our daily vocations, glorifying and praising god for all that we have heard and seen regarding the miraculous birth of the savior. merry christmas!  rev. dr. cary g. larson presiding pastor the american association of lutheran churches
