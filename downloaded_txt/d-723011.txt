authentic salsasfrom thegreatsouthwestavailable online-   and   -on a shelf near you

 



















desert pepper trading company was born and raised on the border of texas, mexico, and new mexico. this amazing crux of bright flavors, sunlight, and the desert southwest inspires us in every way.our flavors come from a sun swept fusion of the southwest, the open air markets of mexico, and our own kitchens. we look backwards into the culinary traditions of the border regions and forward to global new flavors and ideas. this is a multi-generational family run business… that’s right, real people running a real company. over 25 years now (where did that time go?) and more than a few margaritas later… we are still at it. desert pepper continues to thrill, delight and scare the hell out of us!sincere, authentic, and original… that's what we are all about.
