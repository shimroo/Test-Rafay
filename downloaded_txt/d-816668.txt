once in a lifetime! 
							land acquisition
opportunity 
							
protect gmha’s future — act now!
gmha has a rare chance to purchase 35 acres of land we've used for years, expanding our footprint by over 60%. this land is crucial for our cross country courses, trail access, and flood protection.  if we don’t buy it, someone else will,  putting our programs at risk. this is the cornerstone of our centennial campaign—your support is vital.
