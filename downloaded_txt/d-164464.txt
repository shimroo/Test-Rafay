welcome to north star mutual insurance
since the 1920s, north star mutual has provided property and casualty insurance to protect families and small business owners from financial disaster. we’re a midwest mutual insurance company that specializes in farm, home, auto, and small business insurance sold exclusively through local, independent insurance agents. although we’ve grown substantially over the years, our company holds firmly to rural values and is committed to serving our policyholders, agents, employees, and community with pride.
