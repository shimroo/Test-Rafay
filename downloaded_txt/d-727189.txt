program objectives
the core component of the public sociology program is community engagement. our program
                        aims to develop the professional skills that compliment the sociological imagination;
                        skills that take into account the ability to understand how individual and group behavior
                        is shaped by society's historical development, how personal problems are connected
                        to public issues of social structure, and how to work with others to improve social
                        conditions.
the program also encourages the practice of public sociology, which applies the sociological
                        imagination to public affairs in the form of community engagement that develops citizenship
                        skills. to align with missouri state's public affairs mission, the sociology program develops
                        cultural competency through examining how social categories and social systemsâsuch
                        as race, gender, sexuality, class, age, and citizenship statusâinteract to structure
                        social action and create human diversity. finally, it promotes ethical leadership
                        by demonstrating how responsible citizenship is informed by issues of social justice.
