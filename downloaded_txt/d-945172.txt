off. line.



there are so many reasons why i have stopped writing... but the biggest and simplest reason is that i've changed. in so many ways.i want to keep this little tiny corner of cyberspace - it has been a defining chapter in my life. there have been posts where i bared my heart, shared intimate details of my life, made you laugh, perhaps made you cry, forced details of undesirable bodily functions upon you, helped you while away a lazy sunday afternoon and even some regrettable posts which demonstrated that i have much room to grow...but change is upon us always. and for now, i'm going offline. thank you for all the engagement.love,lmd
