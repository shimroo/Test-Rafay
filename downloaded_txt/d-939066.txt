our park

dade battlefield historic state park, acquired by the state of florida in 1921, is the second oldest site in the state whose protection and preservation is designated as being in the best interests of its citizens. although for two generations its main use was a recreational spot for nearby residents, it's main focus was never lost: a memorial to the brave men, both soldiers and native americans, whose 1835 battle marked the beginning of the second seminole war, the longest armed conflict in the first 195 years of american history. in the mid-1950's the state moved to more formally embrace the 80-acre property into its official park system, making improvements and other steps to bring the actual battlefield's appearance back to what it was when major francis l. dade's command had been defeated by a greatly superior seminole force.

who we are

in 1987, the dade battlefield society, formed with support from both the local community and others interested in preserving our natural and cultural heritage, became the park's citizen support organization. our society is concerned with increasing public awareness of dade battlefield and its significance through living history events, nature programs, social functions, educational and recreational activities, festivals, and our highly authentic annual reenactment of dade’s battle is held each january. we are a diverse group of like-minded volunteers who proudly operate the non-profit dade battlefield society exclusively for charitable purposes.
