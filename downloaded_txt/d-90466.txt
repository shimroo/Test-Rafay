lynyrd skynyrd presents hell house american whiskey


itâs poured into âi ainât the oneâ, âsimple manâ, and every record since. because before the first record deal, before the first studio session; there was the hell house.
a small cabin for rent, down on the creek became the foundation of americaâs southern rock band. from the first lines scribbled down, to the last note played, we see the hell house as the bedrock of lynyrd skynyrd.
rich with a story. smooth as a memory. simple, and for all.
