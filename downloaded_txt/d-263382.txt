about



raul malo is the incomparable frontman of genre-defying, grammy award-winning band the mavericks, and the sole writer of many of their songs. his free-wheeling, swaggering style seamlessly blends neotraditional country, rock ’n roll, and latin rhythmic fervor, and prominently features his lush, soaring baritone. his compositional craftsmanship includes progressive and timeless hits like “here comes the rain,” “what a crying shame”, “dance the night away”, “back in your arms again”, and “all you ever do is bring me down.” from his earliest days, when his raucous sound broke ground at the punk clubs on miami beach, to fronting the mavericks over three decades of acclaimed touring and recording, malo has demonstrated an unfailing skill for getting people to groove.
