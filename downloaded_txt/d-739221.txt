testimonialsmultiple artworks sold via diva art groupi have sold multiple pieces with sandy and found her a gem! i have spent years looking for a trustworthy vendor to help me sell my collection. after vetting out many physical and online galleries, i have concluded that thereâs only one trustworthy vendor and that is diva art group! not only is sandy honest, but sheâs also extremely knowledgeable about the art and the many aspects of the process. she guided me through the entire process with a level of attention that is rare from any vendor. she helped me with the listing, advising me on how to describe and price the pieces; she helped me with finding a buyer and sales negotiations; she helped me with the packing and shipping process; she even helped me find the certificate of authenticity for the pieces. most of all she provided me with the peace of mind that comes with knowing that the buyerâs funds cleared before shipping out the art. she also provided the buyer with the peace of mind that comes from knowing their purchase is, as described before paying the seller. where else can you find this level of service?
