pragmatic development and random digressions















                    record locators considered useful
                

you know what record locators are, right?  those little 6-8 character random strings that you get with your plane ticket? have you ever thought about how they're generated and what they mean?

                    your first hpde - getting on track
                

i started track driving about 5 years ago. it's expensive, noisy, and non-productive. its also one of the absolute purest joys of my life.  if you're interested - even if you don't think you could ever do it - read on!

                    overly complex sdks
                

good sdks make writing service code easy.  why do so many of them stop just short of where they should?

chex mix should be yours. use this recipe as a starting point - or not - but adjust it until you can't stop making it.  then back off one notch.

                    disposability
                

normalize not knowing where - or to some extent why - your processes are.  and never, ever, name a server (sorry saruman37)

sometimes its okay to be a monolith.  or at least one monolith amongst many.

hanging on to the back of the reasonably decent racers may not be a winning strategy, but it doesn't seem like a losing one either.

                    boilerplate is just tech debt waiting to happen
                

our goal as developers should be to write as much business logic as possible, and spend as little time as possible on anything else. here's why that matters.

                    package based development
                

thanks a pervasive culture of sharing, almost everything that we write can be thought of as refinements, gluing existing components together and adding only the parts of the code that are truly unique to whatever we're trying to build.

it's a great time to be a software developer.

keeping track of what's going on in your remotely running stateless servers can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be a chore.

everything must be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. but why?

                    ask for actions but deliver on intent
                

when building a ui, a small change in the way that you think about the user's requests can significantly change the way that you communicate about exceptional conditions.

> strictly separate build and run stages
what problem are we solving?
builds should be repeatable, trivial, and boring. if you can build your
application twice in a row on different servers and get different results than
you have a problem.

additionally, the build should be hands-off.  if your build

dates are invisible and obvious, until they're not.  luckily a little thought and a few common strategies will keep them as boring as they seem.

how should you incorporate 3rd party services, and their configurations, into your saas app?  are they just another dependency or something more?

                    don't forget the v
                

when it comes to mvps, everyone loves to focus on the m for minimal.  especially when working in a b2b environment, the viable portion is all too often neglected.

good test data helps you see problems that bad test data obscures.  thankfully there's an easy way to get large amounts of it.

its easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees and get so caught up in solving a technical problem that we don't stop to consider how we could take a shortcut and work around it instead.
