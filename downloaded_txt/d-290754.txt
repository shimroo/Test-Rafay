we had a fantastic experience with red oak transportation! from start to finish they always were on top of communicating clearly and were very organized with the timeline. they were punctual, professional, and the vehicles were spotless. our driver was super friendly and made sure we were comfortable throughout the day. they handled all the logistics seamlessly, which took a huge weight off our shoulders. i would highly recommend for anyone needing wedding transportation!

as a wedding planner, i had the pleasure of partnering with red oak transportation, and they exceeded my expectations. their communication leading up to the event was seamless and highly organized, making the planning process stress-free. on the wedding day, their drivers, dyer and gurdip, arrived early, ensuring everything ran smoothly. both the suv and 55-passenger coach bus were spotless and offered a comfortable, luxurious experience for all passengers. my clients were extremely pleased with the service, and i can’t wait to collaborate with red oak transportation again in the future!

hired red oak to get to and from a wedding the week before last. we had different cars (suvs to be more precise) each way. the drivers were excellent and the vehicles were very clean and clearly very well maintained.  red oak is my go to company when i need this type of transportation and they should be yours as well.

red oak transportation was the best decision we made for the day of our wedding! we booked through ed and nicole and together they helped map out everything! we struggled because we had two hotels and a ton of guests needing transportation between our venue and hotel. ed and nicole were very patient and very honest on exactly what we needed to do. the drivers were prompt, professional and extremely kind. i highly suggest using red oak transportation for all of your upcoming events!
