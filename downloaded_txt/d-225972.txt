	 return of the enigk
	 
    


in honour of his upcoming show at the el mocambo, i've decided to share some of my favourite jeremy enigk songs.  the former sunny day real estate and the fire theft frontman is expected to release his second solo album later this year, and judging from the two new songs posted on his myspace page, it's unlikely to dissapoint.  >>>>jeremy enigkabegail anne from 1996's return of the frog queenreturn of the frog queen from 1996's return of the frog queen>>>>sunny day real estateseven from 1994's diarypillars from 1998's how it feels to be something on>>>>the fire theftheaven from 2003's the fire theft

	 mystery white boy - the movie
	 
    


below i've posted the frustrating news that arrived just recently to my inbox via the jeff buckley international newsletter.  despite the rationalization of mary's reasons for greenlighting the movie, it is to me nothing more than another case of "if somebody's going to make money off of my son's legacy, it might as well be me".  somewhere, principles do still count for something.from:newsletter@jeffbuckley.comsubject: jb biopic - mystery white boy - the movieit has now been nine full years since jeff's passing and not a single one has passed without someone approaching me on the subject of making a feature-length film based on jeff's life and music. from the beginning i was adamantly opposed. i had many good reasons: 1) it was hard to point to any hollywood biopics that weren't sappy, oversimplified, and glamorized the subject's life to the point that it only bore a passing resemblance to reality; 2) no matter how good the screenwriter is, reducing anyone's life to under two hours of screen time is fraught with pitfalls; 3) none of us (my family and jeff's closest friends) wanted to see our characters and lives portrayed through someone else's eyes on the big screen; 4) last, but by no means least, is the fact that i know for sure that jeff would have had nothing to do with a feature film made about his life - were he alive, today. and, that's the catch. the fact that jeff is no longer with us means that anyone can make a film or write a book about him without anyone's permission or our participation, which nearly became reality last year. that fact really got me to the point of re-thinking my stand on the subject. nine years later, when i looked around, i saw films like "ray", "the aviator", "walk the line", and "finding neverland" making it to the screen. also, i had to come to the realization that i did not want someone else to be in control of how the script was written and on what information that script was based. even david browne admits that no-one could write a proper screenplay simply by adapting his book for the screen. i want jeff's bandmates and the people who were really a part of his life to be able to convey in person what it was like to work with and be around jeff. the bottom line is - i changed my mind and started looking for a producer and a screenwriter - in that order. my first jackpot was in contacting michelle sy (executive producer of "finding neverland"). we met several months ago, and she agreed to cast about for a screenwriter who would have the right take on what we wanted to accomplish, and she up with an amazing young film-maker. his name is brian jun. his most recent film "steel city" was screened at sundance, last year, and you can see his bio and reviews of the film on the sundance website. he's currently in negotiations to secure a distributor, so you will be able to see it in theaters and buy it on dvd in the near future. in the mean time, suffice it to say that brian has eagerly plunged deep into my jeff buckley archives and will be spending the next few months interviewing jeff's friends and associates, and absorbing everything we have saved of jeff's personal effects in preparation for submitting a first draft by the end of the summer. having had a chance to speak with him at length over the past two weeks, i feel absolutely confident in my choice. i will be doing everything to make his work easy and to open any door he needs to walk through to do his job well. i would not have chosen him if i wasn't ready to give him every kind of support he needs. even if it means putting him together with people i feel were less than positive influences in jeff's life. i can tell jeff's fans with complete confidence that brian is not the sort of fellow to sugar-coat or manipulate the facts. i've looked into his eyes and i know that he's a straight shooter. there's a depth of character to brian, surprising in someone so young, and i have seen from his film-making that he has the courage and the skill to do this the way it should be done.so, now, my friends, you can swing on the chandeliers speculating about which actors will play which parts - but, don't ask me! (read my lips, you actors, out there!) we will not be making any decisions about casting a film we don't yet have a script for. as soon as the word gets out to the media that we are moving forward, i won't be able to walk the streets of hollywood! talent agents will be jamming michelle sy's voicemail. however, all of that will be to no avail until we have a finished script, which should be some time in the fall of this year.as usual, i will do my best to keep you all posted as this project finds its way (hopefully) to a theater near you. jeff buckley - the way young lovers do (live at sin-e)

	 if you don't call my name, i'm leaving on a midnight train
	 
    


first update in a long time, but to be fair i wrote a lengthy post about 6 weeks ago that got swallowed by a faulty internet connection and have been abstaining since then out of spite.danny michel - midnight train>>>>last week danny michel held the cd release party/concert for his new album valhalla at the mod club theatre.  as one of the best performers this country has to offer, danny never dissapoints in concert.  his band was as tight as ever, and the addition of the excessively hot emm gryner on bass only improved the night.  "midnight train" is the first single of valhalla.  check out danny's website and myspace for more sounds, including a demo of danny and danmheit doyle covering bob marley for her upcoming release.> website > myspace > allmusickris roe - 747 (kent cover)kent - 747>>>>a couple months ago atari's frontman kris roe began circulating an ep of him and his guitar floating through some very interesting cover songs.  far from your standard cover fare, it was this cover of kent's brilliant 747 that i was prepared to thoroughly hate.  fortunately though, kris didn't bastardize my favourite song from the underrated swedish rockers, and so i'll share both his version and the original here.========================================below are a bunch of songs that i had uploaded previously, but don't want to re-write blurbs about them. i highly suggest using them as a starting point for each artist.  enjoy:the pipettes - pull shapesregina spektor - fidelitysambassadeur - katesunset rubdown - three colours iimuse - supermassive black holeamos lee - keep it loose, keep it tightlastly, pitchfork has recently uploaded a great new feature, 100 awesome music videos.  although they didn't rank them in order, they wisely included blur's flawless "coffee & tv" on the first page.  if you've never seen the milky mccarton-staring clip, click the link above as they've included youtube versions of all the videos.

i returned from the brian byrne show tonight to find that their was a new tool single to worship.  originally scheduled to hit the radio airwaves next monday, a record company mistake (gasp!) has brought millions of tool fans an early easter feast.  tool has called their new album (10,000 days, released on may 2) their heaviest recording to date.  the first single "vicarious", and the few early album reviews that were permitted to be published, indicate the band was not kidding with that statement.

	 chaos tastes minty
	 
    


despite not getting over the fact that thursday had to drop off the tour earlier in the week, the taste of chaos show yesterday turned out to be worth the horrific bus ride it took to get to the venue.  although the deftones also put on a great performance, the show was all about thrice to me, and they did not dissapoint. things that i learned, i am: (a) still too tall for the mosh pit, as the bruise on the side of my head will attest(b) far too old for the mosh pit, as my sore body will also attest(c) dissapointed in myself for actually paying $6.25 to drink molson canadian(s)thrice - deadbolt>>>>as great as all of the new material from vheissu sounded live, it turned out that the highlight of the night for me was when they unexpectedly closed the set with an outstanding version of "deadbolt" from 2002's the illusion of safety. download the album version above.> website > myspace > allmusickanye west/josé gonzález - get 'em high/lovestain>>>>i'm usually not much of a fan of mash-ups, and it's very rare that i come across one where i think it's improved on the original tracks.  however, when i guess i'm floating posted this track last week i had to briefly jump the mash-up fence.  it seems that los angeles dj/producer dert has taken josé gonzález's brilliant veneer album and "...reworked and blended with verses from some of today’s most elite underground and mainstream emcees..." to create the album sometimes i rhyme slow.  since in its original form, "get 'em high" was likely my least favourite track on kanye's debut album, i recommend checking out this more laid back version that dert has crafted using the backbone of gonzález's "lovestain".  to learn more about, and hear other songs from sometimes i rhyme slow check out dert's myspace page.i mother earth - 0157:h7>>>>i have two reasons for posting this track: 1) this blog severly lacks in ime content, and that just will not do; and 2) tonight i will be checking out the first of brian byrne's bookstore performances.  the former frontman for ime, byrne will be performing at a series of chapters/indigo stores for free around toronto in april, and then other parts of canada next month.  check out his recently renovated website for more details, and check my earlier post to hear some of his solo work.> website > myspace > allmusic (i mother earth)

head automatica - god>>>>in 2004, daryl palumbo and dan the automator came together under the guise of head automatica to release the inspired dance-punk album decadence.  two years later, the guys appear to have dropped off the dance-punk train and are riding much poppier rails.  check out "god" from the recently released pop rocks ep, the song will also appear on the new lp popaganda when it is released later this year.  > website > myspace > allmusicthrice - of dust and nations (live)>>>>from the recently released red sky ep, this live version of a track from last year's vheissu improves on the already powerful song.  check out thrice's myspace page to hear the original, and other tracks from vheissu. > website > myspace > allmusicclap your hands say yeah - satan said dance (live)>>>>for my friends at the cyhsy concert last night, a live version of the "satan song" to enjoy.

for the last 2 years, ex-i mother earth singer brian byrne has been playing local shows and working on his first solo album.  as an obsessive ime fan, its safe to say that i've been anxiously awaiting the result.  well, the results will finally be released on april 11th with the album tuesdays, thursdays, and if it rains.  luckily though, the wait is over to hear it as brian has posted the majority of the songs on his official website.  the music is a strong mix of rock, folk, and country, while brian's eastern canadian roots shine through.i've posted direct links to a few of my favourites, and you can download the rest at his website.brian byrne - long way from saturdaybrian byrne - paper girlbrian byrne - nova dashboard

	 i get up in the evening, and i ain't got nothing to say
	 
    


a little of this, a little of that.  a few covers and a few new songs to share.the streets - when you wasn't famous (radio edit)>>>>new single from the best band in the uk.  their next album, the hardest way to make an easy living may be the album i am looking forward the most to in the next few months.  it's scheduled to be released on april 10th.  this song doesn't dissapoint, and i can honestly say that mike skinner is the only man i would listen to sing about how he cannot get himself a celebrity girlfriend.  priceless.  official site.the new amsterdams - turn the light out>>>>since we'll never get another get up kids album, we have to make due with matt pryor's offshoot the new amsterdams (even if the last two newams albums have been weak).  "turn out the light" is the first single from the upcoming newams album story like a scar which will be released next month.  the song gives me a little hope that the new album will be a solid one, returning to the strengths of their early releases.  check out the newams official site for more info, and more downloads including their entire "killed or cured" lp from last year which can be downloaded for free.guns n' roses - i.r.s. (demo)>>>>seriously.  this leak hit the 'net last night and reading the responses of the die hard salivating gn'r fans was amusing.  i have no comment on the song.  however, i do think that if i were to spend more than a decade, and 10 million dollars making an album, i would be damn sure to be keeping better control over my demos.petra haden - god only knows>>>>as wrong as it seems to cover this song, everyone seems to do it anyway.  so, i will publicize petra haden because her rendition is faithful to the song.  listen to the song, and naturally think to yourself, "i wonder what it would sound like if she covered michael jackson's thriller?"...then  go find out.pete yorn - dancin in the dark/murray (live)>>>>pet yorn prefaces one of his best songs with a cover of the springsteen classic.  not sure what pete's been up to lately, but check out his myspace page for more music.the russian futurists - paul simon>>>>no real reason to share this song, other than the fact that it's been stuck in my head all day for no reason, and its a nice upbeat way to end the post.  visit the official site for more from the russian futurists.

according to his official bio, half-swedish, half-spanish singer/songwriter daniel cirera is a legend in his homeland of sweden.  after listening to his soon to be first north american single "motherfucker fake vegetarian ex-girlfriend" i was surprised to find out that he was both a) from sweden and b) legendary.  it's not that his music isn't good enough to garner rave reviews, but i was surprised that so many people would appreciate his philosphy of straight forward lyrical content, no matter how abrasive it may sound.  in his own words: "for me, words are like spices – you use them to enhance the flavor. this is exactly what i do. why even bother looking for a synonym of what you want to say just because the word you have in your head is politically incorrect – it’s just a waste of time…and flavor."recently signed to tommy boy records in north america, it'll be interesting to see how he's received here.  >>>daniel cirera - motherfucker fake vegetarian ex-girlfriendclick here to listen to a few more of songs, "roadtrippin'" has single potential, and the cover of "anarcy in the uk" is interesting.bonus-can't-get-it-out-of-my-head-song:>>>>animal collective - the purple bottle
