latest featured sighting reports





      april, 2003 - camp pendleton, california, united states

me and about 40 other marines witnessed a small rounded pyramid type ufo taking off on marine corps base camp pendleton in california, while i was in marine combat training, out in "the field". 




      july, 1970 - bhakkar, punjab, pakistan

i saw a strange silver saucer in the air, spinning and traversing along the surface of earth at an altitude of about 100 meters. it kept traversing at same altitude at a speed of about 100 kilo meters an hour and gradually disappeared after about 30 seconds.




      june, 2005 - fort mill, south carolina, united states

three large clear "tubes" dropped down from the sky on major highway and remained there, motionless for several minutes. 




      march, 18, 2012 - estero/ft myers, fl area, florida, united states

two rather bright objects in the northern sky at 10pm, one farther away and somewhat dimmer. the objects were about 10,000 feet above the ground. each object had 3 bright lights horizontally without a beam. there was a reflection and refracted light like a rainbow around the 3 lights on both objects. we watched with binoculars and eventually the objects moved slowly northward and disappeared.
