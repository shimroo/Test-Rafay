                          contest 
wanna 
                          earn a quick $300 bones? we've 
                          set up a design 
                          contest over at 99designs.com. it's simple. submit 
                          a new logo for bike addict, get $300, plus full recognition 
                          over here (meaning we'll tout the heck out of your design 
                          skills, and give you a lot of web love).
let's 
                          face it, bike addict needs a face lift (among other 
                          things) and the logo will kick off a shiny brand new 
                          site with all kinds of new features.






line 
                          rider 
ok, 
                          line rider isn't a bike game, and has nothing to do 
                          with bikes, but it's dang fun, incredibly addicting 
                          and amazingly simple. the closest thing it has to biking 
                          is the realistic physics in the jumps.
you 
                          simply draw lines for your "line rider" to 
                          ride, and then if you want, draw a world around those 
                          lines. there is no limit to the size of the space (to 
                          my knowledge), and everything works off of gravity (although 
                          there are some "accelerator" lines i haven't 
                          played with yet).

jenson 
                        usa just doesn't need coupons or price codes to sell mountain 
                        bikes, components, or accessories. they do well because 
                        their standard pricing is already discounted, and then 
                        on top of that, they are always having huge specials.

it's 
                        that time of year again. for biking addicts, it's better 
                        than christmas, hanukkah, quanza, and festivus combined. 
                        september 25th through the 29th here in 2006, the mountain 
                        biking, road biking, bmx, and every other sector of the 
                        cycling and bicycling industry will meet in boulder city

 thomas 
                          edison bike tricks
bike 
                        videos just don't get any older than this. although the 
                        rider is not actually thomas edison, this video was filmed 
                        by edison in 1899!! the rider, named 
                        "neibert", was aparently famous and had a circus 
                        background. the footage was shot on a stage with a painted 
                        "city" background.


 


 $40 
                          downhill helmet!!!
i 
                        thought it was a misprint when i saw this downhill mountain 
                        biking helmet for $40 over at jensonusa. 
                        i found it in their closeout section. after reading the 
                        description on the azonic t-55 and thinking, 
                        yes, i hate small helmets that don't fit my 7 and 1/4 
                        hat sized head, and yes, i hate how my chin is exposed 
                        on other full faced helmets, and yes, i hate paying $200+ 
                        for a downhill bike helmet . . . i wasted no time in ordering.

                        around the globe there are companies selling vacation

 bye 
                          bye, dual slalom, hello, mountain cross
 brian 
                          lopes and melissa buhl became the first mountain cross 
                          national champions on the slopes of mount snow in west 
                          dover, vermont this last weekend. usa cycling replaced 
                          dual slalom with mountain cross this year. the new format 
                          goes to a down to a single track/course, where 4 riders 
                          compete head to head over turns and jumps. the top 2 
                          from each heat advance.
in 
                          downhill, eric carter and lisa sher retained their series 
                          leads despite problems along the way. todd wells and 
                          allison dunlap with their own difficulties also won 
                          the national title. roland green smoked the competition 
                          in x-country, but we only give titles to u.s. nationals 
                          you canuck!


  


 crash 
                          prevention 
 according 
                          to "bikerfox" there are 3 basic moves to prevent 
                          crash and injury. in my opinion all of them would result 
                          in more, not less damage to myself and my bike, but 
                          hey, i'm no expert. although i have a hard time viewing 
                          the photos on his site without laughing, i'm sure there's 
                          probably some thing to the techniques he teaches. it's 
                          most likely just another example of eastern u.s. style 
                          riding that i'm not familiar with.


  


 cedric 
                          gracia website
 p.i.m.p. 
                          seems to be doing more than making biking videos these 
                          days. seems like they have sole responsibility for the 
                          slick design behind cedric gracia's new website. "better 
                          have broadband" as they'd say, cause the content 
                          is as almost as intense as cedric's riding. best of 
                          luck to cedric with his newly extended 2 year contract 
                          with team cannondale. lopes better watch his back for 
                          the 4x title.


  


 freewheel 
                          burning from freeride
 looks 
                          like you'll have to wait till interbike in las vegas 
                          this october to see freeride entertainments most recent 
                          film release "freewheel burning". as usual, 
                          they just keep producing good film. 
the 
                          teaser of course is great, with bigger jumps, drops, 
                          gaps and of course all the big names. i just keep wondering 
                          when mountain bike videos will start being released 
                          at the beginning of the season like ski films rather 
                          then at the end.

                          i had done so sooner. already taken a few nasty falls 
                          that would have ripped up any other pair of pants i 
                          have.

                          mountain recalls edge and slayer
 rocky 
                          mountain bicycles is recalling about 660 slayer and 
                          edge full-suspension mountain bikes, due to reported 
                          chainstay failures. rocky 
                          mountain received one report of an incident where the 
                          rear wheel separated from the bicycle.
the 
                          recall involves 16.5, 18 and 19-inch slayer and edge 
                          bikes sold through specialty retailers from january 
                          2001 through february 2002. the slayer is black with 
                          red slayer and rocky mountain decals on the toptube 
                          and downtube. the edge is royal blue with yellow decals 
                          on the toptube and downtube. bicycles with the letter 
                          "s" stamped on the chainstay yoke are not 
                          involved in this recall.
for 
                          information contact rocky mountain bicycles at (800)

ingredients 
  for the perfect trail
i used to 
  think i knew what the perfect trail was. it was behind my house, easy access, 
  had lot's of rollers and then ended with a big drop called "death hill", 
  followed by a huge jump. of course i was 10 at the time, living in pleasant 
  hill, california, and my world had a 15 mile radius. 
over 20 
  years later, i still look for "rollers", "big drops" and 
  "huge jumps", but i don't think that's all it takes to be the perfect 
  trail .

 descending

it 
                          would seem that descending would be one of the easiest 
                          skills to pick up quickly. and for many, it is. for 
                          others they never seem to improve. number one reason 
                          . . . fear. this is not always easy to overcome. quickest 
                          way to reduce some of that fear and gain confidence 
                          is a nice set of protective clothing. i ride with azonic 
                          knee/shin and elbow guards and a giro switchblade helmet. 
                          bell, core rat, roach and fox also make good stuff. 
                          once you've fallen and don't feel anything, you lose 
                          some of that tentativeness.
pads 
                          aren't gonna make you a better descender though . . 
                          .
