the hobbit trilogy





i watched the three peter jackson hobbit movies in the last few days on amazon prime. it is just one unmemorable action sequence after another, chase scene after chase scene. there is no artistry, nor gravitas nor drama. disappointing.and he has made the simple tale very bloated, the additions are unnecessary.his favourite cinematic trick? the panning panorama with the camera. the entire thing is edited like a music video with fast edits, anything beautiful is just lost as one shot after another is piled on the viewer. i guess the commercial success of them means that there will be more of these kind of movies and that most people liked them. the backgrounds, whether painted or computer generated or digitally painted were mostly like that of a computer game though there were a few nice backdrops. a few.what a mess.an unexpected journey - 5/10the desolation of smaug - 5/10the battle of the five armies - 5/10at the battle of the five armies, the ridiculous combat scenes and the toy sets out of a computer game were unconvincing. the fact that thorin's company of dwarves could now decimate the orcs whereas they spent the first two movies running from a mere orc warband, in other words the lack of consistency. it is entertaining enough to an extent i guess. i watched them like how i would watch a cartoon. there is no magic in the movies. i get a sense of magic and wonder when i read the book.

is the bbc biased?





does the bbc seem to have institutional bias? i was wondering if the bbc's seeming anti-israel bias would show in their coverage of the current israel-hamas war and i noticed that despite the bbc's attempts to be balanced, the bbc tried by showing only a bit on the hamas atrocities and hostage taking, the bbc simply cannot shake off what seems to be their institutional anti-semitism. it continues to mainly focus on the palestinian civilians while giving lip service to the hamas terror.this was written in november 2023. i didn't put it up as i wanted to monitor the coverage further. bbc's coverage seems slanted. in any case, most media corporations have institutional bias of their own kind. i think this would be that of the bbc, at least, it seems so.

initial impressions of diablo iv





this was something i wrote a year ago. i wonder why i didn't publish it.from 12th june 2023 my initial impressions of diablo iv:drab drab drab. everything is decrepit and run down, faded colours. ugh. extreme poverty. i am still in act 1. it will change.gameplay. i have five characters of all the classes up to level 20. it remains faithful to d3, d2, etc. the necromancer has many of the same skills. yet, there are differences. the skill tree is now a matrix.the game seemingly has a very strong catholic feel about it. exorcism, reverend mothers, priests, burnings of heretics, penance, confession and more.monsters. so far, i see the same monsters as in previous instalments.so far so good, i am enjoying it.

travails with poor connection from an isp





i have used starhub broadband for two decades now, the speed and quality have been poor since day one but i didn't change it as it is tied to the tv subscription which my father used to watch.right now, the connection is intermittent. it is unusable unless one uses it to surf, for other activities like gaming, teleconferencing, trading, and anything that requires a constant connection, it is impossible, it has been a week now and starhub has been unable to resolve it. the service staff is polite and apologetic. what can i do?

 i have uninstalled war thunder a week or so ago. i have spent a staggering 5100 hours over the last four or five years and i enjoyed myself greatly. i am taking a break from it for a few months. afterwards, i will log back in and do a few things. i don't know if i want to play anymore.

uninstalling diablo iv





 i played the campaign and enjoyed levelling my necromancer to level 51. after which i stopped, i could not bear to continue to level 100. the story was silly, the campaign tedious and i could not imagine myself playing more. i did play my druid, barbarian, rogue and sorcerer to level 31-32. i have uninstalled last week. it was just enough.

diablo iv uninstalled





diablo iv uninstalled. a decent game, well-crafted but visually dull. the content is just boring and the story is silly. i will say more about it later.enough of it for now, maybe, i will play more when the expansion is released.i have a level 51 necromancer, level 31 rogue, level 33 druid, level 33 barbarian and a level 32 sorcerer. i realise that i was bored.

pixel 7a





i ordered a pixel 7a from amazon over the weekend to place my five year old samsung s9+.the pixel 7a, first impressions:it runs hot, very hot as compared to my old samsung s9+.it is a mid-range phone and it feels like one too whereas, the s9+ was state of the art and a first class mobile. anyway, the pixel 7a is just what i am expected, a generic, bland, mid-range but functional device that should serve me for 2-5 years hopefully.interface. the pixel 7a is somewhat clumsy in its interface design, it lacks a back button which the s9+ has thoughtfully provided which made it for a friendlier and faster use. going back to the previous page or menu is dependent on back and every app in how it is written.the lack of an audio jack. well, i don't use it for music.the lack of a sd card slot.it is manufactured by foxconn (hon hai precision), the folks who make stuff for apple, hp, and many other companies.it is impossible to get by through life without any mobile apps today. mobile apps are needed for government services, banking and much much more.
