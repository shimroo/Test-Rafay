	 the future of this blog
	 
    


since we have lost several contributors from the blog since its beginning in january of 2006, including blog moderator werdevos, i am seriously thinking about not continuing our blog any more, since it no longer is thriving like it was when we had more contributors.orlando pinstriped post provides the best magic coverage on the internet, and is the best magic blog without question,  and members there are free to comment on any of the posts or even make posts themselves.  matt, i know you read opp on a regular basis; big figure, you should check it out if you haven't already.  i've been a member for over two years.matt and big figure, i appreciate you guys still reading and contributing to this blog, and if you have any comments about this, i'd be interested in hearing (or anyone else for that matter) what you think.

	 the upcoming draft for the magic
	 
    


here is an article from bleacherreport.com correspondent wil bradley on what the magic might be looking for in the 2010 draft coming up in a few weeks.some excerpts:orlando magic general manager otis smith believes his team needs only an “eighth of an inch” improvement to be an nba champion. he told fans finding ball handlers, and adding one or two pieces to the “puzzle” would be the priority.orlando's lack of cap space, and multiple high-dollar contracts limit what can be accomplished via free-agency. the magic do have a trade-exception and mid-level exception, giving them some slack.the draft will provide the only other means of improving the team. again smith says he's looking for the best player available. at the 29th position, most draft analysts predict quite a few guards available.

	 will the magic keep j.j. redick?
	 
    


columnist wil bradley of bleacherreport.com examines the question in this article.  here are excerpts:orlando magic shooting guard j.j. redick enters restricted free agency on july 1.many think redick will play elsewhere next season. those same analysts believe redick will command too high a salary for the magic to match.others foresee redick staying with orlando, maybe even for a smaller salary, to remain on a contending team. redick has stated that winning meant more than money. if other front offices value redick more than the magic, orlando possesses options. they could trade him by july 8, or they could just let him walk.based upon forecasts that redick will be highly sought after, the magic could already be thinking trade.could orlando replace what he brings?no player on the magic, maybe even in the nba, works harder than j.j. he brings a competitiveness that many of his teammates clearly lacked.the argument could be made that trading jj for an additional first round draft pick could be more valuable than keeping redick.whether the magic want to replace him remains to be seen.

	 magic players under contract for next season
	 
    


here's a listing of magic players under contract for the 2010-11 season, and how much they will earn.  all salary information is from hoopshype.com.rashard lewis... $20,514,000vince carter... $17,300,000dwight howard... $16,509,600jameer nelson... $6,722,222marcin gortat... $6,322,220mickael pietrus... $5,300,000brandon bass... $4,000,000ryan anderson... $1,409,040j.j. redick will be a restricted free agent and has a qualifying offer of $3,887,150.  the magic can match any other offer he receives from another team.matt barnes will probably become an unrestricted free agent, as he has a player option next season of $1,600,000.this leaves the magic with a payroll for next season currently at around $74.2 million, and if the magic re-sign redick, this figure probably goes to around $80 million, with the magic having nine players under contract (assuming they can re-sign redick).  that leaves four to five players that will need to be signed to fill out the roster.  how far over the salary cap would the magic be willing to go for next season to fill out their roster.jason williams, anthony johnson, and adonal foyle all will be unrestricted free agents.

	 magic gm smith answers fans' burning questions
	 
    


here are some excerpts from an article from correspondent wil bradley of the bleacher report about what otis smith may do this off-season to improve the magic:magic general manager otis smith described the season as a "failure." as an organization, the bar has been raised."we set the bar," stated smith. "and the bar is a championship. anything less than that, rests on my head."smith believes the magic need to make up an "eighth of an inch" between themselves and the nba's best teams.what holes need to be filled? orlando only has one point guard, with jason williams and anthony johnson having expiring contracts. smith described both players as being “long in the tooth."turnovers hurt the magic throughout the season. the effect of orlando's occasional sloppy play became magnified against the celtics. more ball handlers would alleviate pressure on nelson to keep the ball moving.how much will the roster change? smith clearly believes the magic can compete as is. that said, smith predicts only minor roster adjustments.simply put, the magic will be looking to get better at the wing and point guard position. somehow, i can still see smith performing his nba jedi magic, and adding a true power forward.will the team keep j.j. redick? my rock solid pick for nba free-agency, j.j. redick stays in orlando. the organization values redick.  smith indicated as such, "we'll do what we can to keep him."what are the magic's draft plans?  smith did a great job finding courtney lee two years ago. orlando has the 29th pick in the first round, and the 59th pick in the second.  orlando hopes to get better via the draft—but if they can't, expect a deal.orlando's approach—make the team better—could mean that smith trades the picks, getting more seasoned talent in return.here is the complete article from bleacherreport.com.
