the seattle swiss society is an active club, a great way to meet new and old swiss friends. we organize regular events throughout the year for members, their families and guests. presently, we have about 200 members and our quarterly newsletter is read by over 500 people in the greater seattle area. 
our club has a long history (over 100 years) of organizing activities and providing togetherness for the swiss community in seattle. founded in 1901, we were originally named the "seattle schweizer verein". on september 4, 1937, we changed our name to the seattle swiss society. 
membership in the seattle swiss society is open to all people of swiss heritage or with an interest in switzerland. we invite you to contact us today for more information
