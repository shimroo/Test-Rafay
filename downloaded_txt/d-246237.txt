i have trusted these guys with my beautiful bmw on two different occasions (other people hit my car) and the repairs both times were truly flawless. i have been so impressed with their work and their customer service/support during the process. and my car looks better than new--truly!

got my car hit in a parking lot and i reallllly couldn’t give up my car for more than a couple days. time was a definite factor and kevin and the ladies there got me in and out in two days, my car looks amazing and i have it back a day earlier than i expected! they worked seamlessly with my insurance also, and took care of my rental car return and everything. amazing service, thank you!!!!
