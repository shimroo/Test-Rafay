testimonialswhat our clients say about us 
cisco is hands down the best hairstylist i've ever been to. i've been a client from when he was at del amo and now to the new location. he is so sweet, efficient and talented.  from haircuts to color and highlights he's done it all for me. he's taken me from  my dark asian hair to  blonde while still keeping the integrity of my hair. i love him..he's amazing!


jolene l.torrance, ca

 
nancy or "blue" is the best for hair color! she gives my graying hair life and vibrant color.  she also does a fantastic cut without making my hair shor... hubby loves long hair and she respects that for me. love nancy... i've been seeing her for about 15 years and never been disappointed.

nice salon in the heart of mt lebanon! staff is friendly, and the service providers are very knowledgeable of their craft. they sell a wide variety of hair and skin products as well.


juli s.mt lebanon, pa

 
jennifer did an amazing job with my hair!! i really struggle to find someone who knows how to cut my very thick, very wavy, very long hair without leaving me looking like a triangle or putting holes in my layers. jennifer completely understood my needs (i need a very low maintenance cut because i have an 8 month old) and i felt like her consultation was expert. i had an enjoyable experience and was very glad i went to jennifer for my first cut since i was pregnant!


vivienne t.bridgeville, pa

 
stylist jaime horvat cut and styled my and my 5 year old daughter's hair. since my original stylist retired i've been looking for a stylist who listens to my wants yet knows what my hair needs. and now that's jaime! jaime is a wonderful stylist and did a beautiful job for both my daughter and myself.


elizabeth p.west mufflin, pa

 
jen is a true hair artist! i've had my hair cut and highlighted many times by her and i'm always very happy with the results. i was hesitant with coloring my hair at first because i had never had it done professionally and didn't know what it would look like but she was great with helping me find a color and look i love!
