			secureway self storage		

“when we were transferred to florida, we required a storage unit. we did a lot of research and found the facility at secureway to be exactly what we needed. the staff treats us very nicely, and we have peace of mind knowing our belongings are in a secure location. we highly recommend secureway storage center.”
ron and sarah




“i am very pleased to have chosen this facility among many in the area. the check-in process was very pleasant and courteous. the gentleman that assisted me couldn’t have done any more to be helpful and attentive. i am very happy to recommend this facility to anyone looking for a storage facility for their needs”
scott




“over the years, i have stored my personal items at many facilities. i must say secureway is by far the best. the staff was very friendly and accommodating. i would highly recommend them.”
josie




“on moving day, i realized the unit i rented would be much too small for all my stuff. in less than 5 minutes, the staff was able to switch me to a larger unit only several feet down the hall, and do all the paperwork associated with that. i was very pleased how well it all worked out and how staff’s efforts to accommodate my needs was perfectly met.”
rick




“rich, our account coordinator was curteous, informative and efficient. moving is stressful enough; but the facility, and staff made us feel easement. it is the light at the end of a tunnel. the facility was cleane, secure and exactly what we requested. rich listened to our needs and met them. accomodating is my review. thank guys, y’all are amazing.”
