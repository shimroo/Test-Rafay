	 my new favorite meatloaf
	 
    


3 lbs ground beef (i use 73/27, but 80/20 should work fine)
1 can condensed french onion soup  (not envelope)
1 1/2 cps italian style bread crumbs
2 lg eggs
1/4 cp ketchup
1 tsp seasoned salt (i use morton's, but any will do)

heat oven to 350.

be ready to get your hand dirty.  using your hands, thoroughly combine all ingredients.  drop into greased 8x11 baking pan. shape into a firm loaf.  bake 75 to 90 mins.

or for really amazing...

place large drip pan in center of coal rack in covered grill (i use the ones kingsford makes, available home depot). put approx. 30 briquettes on each side of drip pan.  if using lump charcoal, fill to about 1/2" below pan edge.  add a teakettle of hot water to pan.  light coals.  when coals are hot, throw some soaked wood chips (couple hands full) or a chunk of hardwood on coals. i really like pecan wood, but whatever your favorite.  leave loaf in pan! place on grill rack.  close lid and bake about 75 minutes.  try to keep temp under 400 by adjusting grill vents.  but it is not a huge deal if you can't.

4 tbls buttermilk pwd
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking pwd
4 cps all purpose flour
1 cp pecan pieces

preheat oven to 300 degrees

in a large bowl thoroughly stir together dry ingredients except sugar.  in a second large bowl cream together bananas, butter, eggs, vanilla, and sugar, using electric beater on low.  add dry ingredients to sugar mixture a heaping tablespoon at a time while using beater, still on low.  slowly beat in milk.

spray bread pans with no-stick spray.  divide batter evenly between the 4 pans.  bake for about an hour, until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  let sit for 1/2 hour before removing from pans.

	 bbq (sloppy joes)
	 
    


i finally found it!  been looking for it for years.  been making it they way i thought mom made it, but it never came out quite right.  then, while looking for something else all together, it fell out from between the pages of a cookbook.  hand written in mom's handwriting, tomato sauce stained.  the recipe card.  this is a recipe with so much family history behind it.  it was a favorite when i was a little kid.  after my dad died, the kids and i tried to visit my mom every 6 weeks. we'd leave after school.  when we arrived in pontiac about 9, there would always be a skillet of bbq, along with father sam's pitas, and freshly baked toll house cookie bars.

my son steven as been asking me about this recipe for a while now.  so here it is, along with the missing secret ingredient.



grandma spurrier's bbq

2 lbs ground chuck1 average onion, chopped1 - 15 oz can tomato sauce1/3 cp light brown sugar, firmly packed1/4 tsp ground cayenne1/8 tsp ground clove

break up and brown ground chuck on medium low (about 300 on electric skillet) until most of pink disappears. stir in onions, and cook until they are clear. add remaining ingredients and simmer over low heat for about an hour (highest point of simmer on electric skillet). adjust spices to taste.....

	 cuban black bean soup
	 
    


this recipe is a combination of two different frugal gourmet recipes.  one from his first book, the other from his book "our immigrant ancestors".  turned out really well after a couple of modifications.

ingredients:
1 lb black beans
1 lb thick sliced bacon, chopped into 1/4" pieces
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
2 ribs celery, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 49 oz can chicken broth
2 bay leaves
1 ham hock
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp tabasco
1/2 tsp chili pwd
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp basil
1/4 tsp thyme
1 tbls red wine vinegar



step a:  soak one pound of black beans in one gallon of water overnight.  rinse, then simmer in 1 gal water for 5 hours.  drain.
                                                          or
open 6 - 15oz cans of black beans

step 2:  in a large dutch oven, cook bacon over med heat until well browned.  drain, reserving 3 tbls  of drippings.  saute celery in drippings for 3 mins, then add onions and saute until onions are soft and clear.  add bacon, beans and remaining  ingredients to pot.  simmer for 1 hour.  discard ham hock and bay leaves.  remove 1 cup of beans from soup, smash with a fork, and stir back in to thicken.  cook 10 mins more, then serve....

enjoy!

	 easy mexican corn (elotes)
	 
    


this is amazingly good!  and easy!


shuck as many ears of corn as you need.  spread mayo thinly on the corn, then sprinle with blackened seasoning.  wrap in heavy duty foil.  cook on top wrack of grill for one hour (or until corn starts to brown), turning after 1/2 hour.  sprinkle with parmesan cheese and eat heartily!



note:  if blackened seasoning is too spicy for you, try bbq seasoning (i like paul prudhommes)

	 nic's unbelievably tasty irish stew
	 
    


my texas friend nic boedecker is not only good looking and smart, but a great cook too.  here's her idea of a perfect recipe for a cold winter day¼ cp olive oil1 ½ lbs stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces (i prefer buffalo stew meat)6 large garlic cloves, minced6 cps beef stock or canned beef broth2 cps of guinness stout beer (i tend to just put in one can)1 ½ cp of good red wine (i typically go for a cab or cab-merlot blend)2 tbl tomato paste1 tsp sugar1 tbl herbs de provence (basically a bunch of dried herbs pre-mixed - found in the spice aisle)2 tbls worcestershire sauce2 bay leaves2 tbl (¼ stick) butter3 lbs russet potatoes , peeled, cut into ½ -inch pieces (about 7 cups)1 lg onion, chopped (if someone has onion allergies onion powder can be used instead)2 cups ½-inch pieces peeled carrots1 ½ containers quartered fresh white mushrooms2 cups sliced celerysalt and pepper (after simmering through add approx 1 ½ teaspoons of salt - i use sea salt b/c it's helathier for blood pressure issues than regular salt)1. heat olive oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. add beef and sauté until brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. add garlic and sauté 1 minute. add beef stock, guinness, red wine, tomato paste, sugar, herbes de provence, worcestershire sauce and bay leaves. stir to combine. bring mixture to boil. reduce heat to medium-low, then cover and simmer 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally.2. while the meat and stock are simmering, melt butter in another large pot over medium heat. add mushrooms, celery, potatoes, onion and carrots. sauté vegetables until golden, about 20 minutes.3. add vegetables to beef stew. simmer uncovered until vegetables and beef are very tender (minimum 1 hour). discard bay leaves. tilt pan and spoon off fat.can be prepared up to 2 days ahead. salt and pepper to taste. cool slightly. refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and refrigerate. bring to simmer before serving. transfer stew to serving bowl (or individual bread bowls) and serve.hint: to thicken a little add some plain instant potato flakes or you can bake and mash some fresh and add to the stew.hint: a sourdough bread bowl is the perfect container to serve this delicious stew in!

	 eggnog
	 
    


i love eggnog, but seldom make it, because it is a lot of trouble.  here are two recipes i like.  the first i love, but haven't made in years.  i have no idea where i got the recipe, probably from a newspaper somewhere.the second i saw made on the today show last year.  i tried it, and liked it a lot.traditional eggnog recipe12 eggs, separated6 cups milk2 cups heavy/ thickened cream2 cups bourbon1+ 1⁄2 cups sugar3⁄4 cup brandy2 teaspoons ground nutmegin a large bowl and using a mixer, beat the egg yolks together with the sugar for approx 10 minutes (you want the mixture to be firm and the colour of butter).very slowly, add in the bourbon and brandy - just a little at a time.when bourbon and brandy have been added, allow the mixture to cool in the fridge (for up to 6 hours, depending on how long before your party you're making the eggnog).30 minutes before your guests arrive, stir the milk into the chilled yolk mixture.stir in 1+ 1⁄2 teaspoons ground nutmeg.in a separate bowl, beat the cream with a mixer on high speed until the cream forms stiff peaks.in yet another bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.gently fold the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture.gently fold the cream into the egg mixture.after ladling into cups, garnish with the remainder of the ground nutmeg.serves: 8.this next one comes from australian chef curtis stone, as seen on today.  it is a bit different from the first, perhaps not quite as good, but much easier.  but still excellent.   and  this recipe is cooked, so none of the perils of raw eggs.  i made this last christmas, and enjoyed it a great deal.curtis stone's eggnog 1 cup heavy whipping cream2 cps milk6 large egg yolks1/3 cp sugar1 tsp nutmeg (please grind fresh!)dash cinnamon3 t bourbon (or any good quality whiskey)combine the milk and  cream  into  a heavy sauce pan and  bring to gentle simmer over medium heat.  in a large bowl , whisk together yolks and sugar until thick and creamy, about 3 minutes.  whisk the milk mixture into the egg mixture to blend.return mixture to the sauce pan, and add  nutmeg and cinnamon.  cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly, about 10 mins,  until mixture coats the back of the spoon. do not allow  to boil!    stir in whiskey.strain through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl.  place bowl in large pan of ice water, and stir nog until cold.  refrigerate to chill completely.  serve  in small mugs topped with sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon.

ingredients:  2 - 12 0z. pkgs. white button mushrooms (break off the stems) 1 pkg.(6-8 oz.) cream cheese 2 tbsp. sour cream 8 slices of bacon, cooked then chopped (i use a food processor to chop the bacon into really small pieces) 1/2 of a small sweet onion (3 tbsp.) diced into very small pieces (fry in a little bit of the bacon grease) 1  cup shredded mild cheddar 1 tsp. garlic salt parmesan cheese2 cups shredded mozzarella     mix cream cheese, s.cream, cheddar, bacon, onion , and garlic salt all together. stuff  the caps of the mushrooms as generously as you like. place the stuffed mushrooms in a greased baking dish or pan, sprinkle parmesan cheese on top of the mushrooms. bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. when done baking, set your oven to broil. cover each mushroom with mozzarella, and broil for 3 or 4 minutes, just long enough to brown the cheese on top. delicious!

i adapted this recipe from one i found a while ago.  it came from the chicago culinary institute, circa 1956.1/2 lb. mushrooms (sliced)1/3 cp butter1/4 cup chopped green pepper1/4 cp flour1 t salt1/2 t monosodium glutamateblack pepper to taste1 1/2 cp cream2 chicken bouillon cubes1 1/2 cp boiling water1 simmered chicken, cooled & deboned (see previous recipe)3/4 cp frozen whole kernel corn3/4 cp diced carrots1/4 cp canned pimiento, cut into stripsin a small sauce pan, cover carrots with water, and simmer until soft.  add corn, cook about 7 minutes.  drain and set aside.dice the chicken.  set side.in a large, heavy skillet or dutch oven, melt butter.  add the mushrooms and green peppers, saute until soft.  remove the peppers and mushrooms with slotted spoon, allowing the butter to drip back into the pan.stir flour, salt, msg, and pepper into the butter.  cook about five minutes, or until mixture begins to take on the color of peanut butter.  remove from heat, whisk in cream.dissolve bouillon cubes in 1 1/2 cp boiling water.  stirring constantly, gradually add to flour/cream mixture.  return to heat and cook, stirring, until thickened.  stir in chicken, mushrooms, vegetables, and pimento.at this point you can either:divide mixture into six cassolettes, top with your favorite pie crust, and bake at 425 until crust is golden brown, or (and this is my favorite way):prepare either jiffy or bisquick drop biscuits as per package directions.  pour chicken mixture into a 3 qt casserole and drop biscuit dough by tablespoon onto top of mixture. bake at 375 until biscuits are golden brown.

	 simmered chicken
	 
    


simmering chicken is the perfect way to cook chicken for use on sandwiches, in chicken salad, or anytime you need cooked chicken for a recipe.  the breast stays wonderfully moist and flavorful when prepared this way.you'll need:one large stockpot with tight fitting, heavy lid.one large (about 4lb) fryerfill the stockpot with enough water to completely cover the chicken.  bring water to a full rolling boil.  holding chicken by the ends of the drumsticks, plunge it into the water.  count to 20 (one mississippi, two mississippi).  pull bird out of water.  wait until water resumes full boil.  plunge chicken back into water, put lid on the pot, and reduce heat as low as you can without the flame going out.   cook for one hour.  do not peek!  remove from pot, drain and cool.  pull meat from the bones and you have the perfect chicken for sandwiches or salads.note:  meat around the  bones may have a red tinge.  this is not blood, nor does it mean the bird isn't cooked enough.  the simmering process may leach a bit of color out of the bone.  it is harmless.

	 home made beef jerky
	 
    


okay, admittedly, this is definitely a guy recipe.  but my kids have always loved this recipe, and i think the men in your family will too!jerky 3 or 4 lbs  beef or venison (i prefer flank or brisket)1/2 cp  worcestershire sauce2-3 tbls  water1 tbl  vinegar (i like red wine, but cider or white  will do)1 tsp  pepper1 tsp  onion powder 1/2 tsp  garlic powder 10 dashes  tabasco 1/2 to 1 tsp  liquid smoke (oven recipe)trim meat of all external fat (fat gets rancid over time).  slice meat with grain into 1/2 " thick slices.  using fine side of tenderizing mallet, pound to 1/4" thick.  combine remaining ingredients (omit liquid smoke if drying in smoker).   marinate  meat in liquid for 24 hrs, turning occasionally.  drain meat, and blot dry.move top rack in oven to it's highest point.  using paper clips bent into s-hooks, hand strips from  rack, over a drip pan.   set oven between 140 and 150 f.  dry 6 -8 hours.  jerky is done when stiff or slightly pliable.note:  if using an outdoor smoker, omit liquid smoke in marinade.  soak 1 cup of hardwood chips over night.  drain, and wrap tightly in hd foil.  poke a couple of holes in foil, and place on top of heat source.  smoker temp should be maintained about 140 to 150 degrees.  an old fashioned oven thermometer is very helpful here, but halfway up the low heat section of your smoker's thermometer is usually about right.store up to 3 months in glass jars with tight fitting lids.  4-6 weeks in ziplock bags.

	 roast chicken - cajun style
	 
    


i am not sure where i first came across this recipe.  it has been a favorite of my family for many years.   it is guaranteed to make a chicken that is moist , sticky, and just will force you to succumb to the temptation to lick your fingers.roast chicken - cajun  stylefeeds 2 -4for each whole broiler/fryer you will need:2 tsp salt1 tsp paprika3/4 tsp cayenne1/2 tsp thyme1/4 tsp garlic powder1/4 tsp white pepper1/4 tsp black pepper1 lg yellow onion (chopped fine)1 rib celery (chopped fine)combine spices in small bowl.  rub mixture into chicken inside and out, making sure the spices are evenly distributed and rubbed into pores.  seal in a ziplock bag and refrigerate for 24 hours.  stuff loosely with onion and celery and bake, uncovered, for 4 hours at 250f (three hours unstuffed), basting occasionally.this recipe also works well with large roasting chickens.  simply double the ingredients, and bake 4 1/2 to 5 hours. let sit 10 minutes at room temperature and carve.  i like to defat the pan juices,  heat them, and pour over the white meat slices.for cajun gravy:deglaze the pan with a splash of water.  pour into a large measuring measuring cup.  dissolve 2 tsp  of instant chicken bouillon in the pan water, then add enough whole milk to equal 2 cups.  over medium heat, melt 2 tbls butter or butter flavored crisco.  stir in 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning (see above spice mixture), and 3 tbls flour, and cook until mixture takes on peanut butter consistency.  whisk in milk mixture and heat until thickened.

	 cajun beans and rice
	 
    


this is one of my favorite meals! it is relatively easy to prepare and really tasty. it is especially good on a winters evening after sledding with the kids. it is also a great camping meal!there are any numbers of variations on this meal. instead of ham, i will sometimes use 1 1/2 lbs pork steak, boned, trimmed, cut into half inch cubes, and browned. i'll add an extra hock when i do this. sometimes i'll use a pound of ground pork, browned and crumbled. sometimes i'll use smoked sausage instead of ham. any way, this meal is always great.cajun beans and rice3 tbls oil1 med onion, chopped1 bunch green onions, chopped, including tops2 cloves garlic, minced2 ribs celery, sliced1/2 and average green bell pepper, chopped1 tsp salt1/2 tsp black pepper1/4 tsp basil1/4 tsp thyme1 lg bay leaf1 48 oz jar pinto beans*2 14oz cans chicken broth3 cps ham, diced1 smoked pork hock4 cups water1 tbls butter1 1/2 tsp salt2 cps long grain white ricein a large heavy pot, saute vegetables in oil until soft. add all remaining ingredients except water, butter,salt, and rice. simmer 35 minutes, stirring occasionally. with a fork, smash 20 or so beans against the side of the pot to thicken broth, stir, simmer 10 more minutes. remove pork hock and discard.meanwhile, about 10 minutes after beans have started simmering, place water, butter, and salt in a large, heavy sauce pan (one with a tight fitting lid) and bring to a boil. add rice. return to boil, stirring. reduce heat to slow boil, and cover. cook 15 min. do not stir. do not peek! remove rice from stove, and let sit 10 minutes. again, do not stir, do not peek! fluff rice with a fork.to serve:  spoon a mound of rice into the middle of a large soup bowl or plate.  ladle beans around the rice.   serves 6 - 8.* you may use red beans instead, but i think this recipe is more flavorfull using pinto beans.

	 cajun stuffed peppers
	 
    


i came across this recipe many years ago, in the ft. wayne journal/gazette. it comes from a feature where the recipes are drawn in cartoon form, titled cheap thrills cuisine! the recipes come from windsor/toronto chef bill lombardo. any how, i really love these. they are pretty low fat and really tasty! i have altered the recipe a bit (i always do), but it is pretty close to the original.cajun stuffed peppers 1/4 cp red onion, finely diced1/4 cp red bell pepper, finely diced1 celery rib, finely diced1/3 lb smoked sausage or smoked andoulle sausage, diced small2 tsp cajun seasoning 1 tsp fennel seed, crushed1 cp cooked long grain white rice 1 lb ground round, browned and crumbled1 egg 1/4 cp corn (i use frozen, but canned or left over will do)1/4 cp unseasoned bread crumbs 6 bell peppers, tops cut off and seeded (i prefer green)1 14oz can diced tomatoes3 tbl salsa (chose you own heat)in a heavy skillet, saute first six ingredients in one tbl of oil for 5 min. combine with next 5 ingredients. stuff peppers to overflowing. combine tomatoes and salsa. pour over stuffed peppers. bake, covered,* 1 hour at 350f.*  i use a small porcelain roaster, but a large casserole or small (not cast iron) dutch oven will work just fine too!

	 roasted brisket of beef
	 
    


way back in the day, when barb and mark were kids (yeah, way back in the day), and texas style bbq was popular in, well, texas, brisket was about the cheapest cut of beef you could buy. my mom found this recipe in the pontiac press, and, always looking for an inexpensive way to feed two very large appetites (my dad and me), decided to try it. not only did it become an immediate family favorite, but for many years, it was the staple of church dinners.unfortunately, the growth of texas bbq has caused the price of brisket to soar, and it is no longer economical to serve as a church dinner staple. but it is still the single most demanded item for family dinners in my clan. this recipe is tremendously easy, very hard to screw up, and absolutely delicious. it works particularly well in an electric roaster, but does just fine in the oven as well!roast beef brisketwide roll heavy duty aluminum foil1 whole brisket (not corned)1 box (2 packets) lipton's onion soup mixplace brisket fat side down on a double sheet of hd foil large enough to tightly wrap meat in. spread two packets of onion soup mix across the top of the meat. wrap tightly and place in roaster. bake at 350 for 2 hours. turn heat down to 325 and bake another 2 hours. turn heat on roaster down to warm.* very carefully open foil package. remove roast to cutting board, and pour liquid from the foil packet into the roaster. with an electric knife, slice meat across the grain in 1/4" slices and add to roaster. spoon liquid over top of beef.any leftovers you might have (and around here that is rare) are wonderful heated and served over toast, or on a good hoagie roll!* if you are baking in the oven, there are a couple of things you can do to keep the au jus and beef slices warm. if you have an electric griddle, place it on the table, thermostat on warm, and place roaster on top. or you can transfer the liquid to your electric skillet, set on warm, and add slices to that. i prefer the former because it is one less pan to clean.posted by mark

	 bill knapp's au gratin potatoes
	 
    


as i believe i have mentioned before, for 25 years, bill knapp's was my family's favorite restaurant. i recently came across a number of recipes online, purporting to be from knapp's. quite frankly, i was dubious of a couple of them. so i used my kids as guinea pigs and fixed these for thanksgiving dinner. i was very pleasantly surprised! they were a big hit! these recipes are in fact the real deal! so i am sharing them with you.knapp's au gratin potatoes 1 1/2 lbs russet potatoes2 cps milk1/2 cp butter1/2 tsp salt1/4 cp flour 1 tsp paprika1/4 tsp pepper 1 tsp instant chicken bullion granules6 oz american cheese night before, boil potatoes until easily pierced with fork, approx. 1/2 hour. chill thoroughly. next day, peel potatoes and cut into 1/2" cubes. set aside. melt butter in a large sauce pan, add salt and flour and blend. gradually stir in milk and cook, stirring, till thickened. add paprika, pepper, bullion and cheese. cook, stirring, till cheese melts. stir in potatoes. pour into greased casserole dish and bake, uncovered at 350 for about 1/2 hour, or until top start to get brown and bubbly.note: if you double this recipe, it fits nicely in a greased 9 x 13 pan. you can also divide this into individual cassolettes and bake, which is how knapp's served it.posted by mark

biscuits and gravy have become a family tradition for holiday breakfasts at our house. however, my sons are not content to keep this as just a special holiday treat. about once every couple of months i get a phone call requesting this recipe, so i am posting it where everyone can easily find it!the biscuit recipe was adapted from the late jeff smith's book the frugal gourmet cooks american.  it is my favorite biscuit recipe! biscuits2 1/4 cp  flour2 tsp  baking powder1/2 tsp  baking soda1 tsp  salt1/4 cp  shortening1 cp  buttermilksift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. cut in shortening with a pastry blender until the texture of coarse corn meal. using a fork, stir in buttermilk. do not over mix. turn out onto a floured board and knead 3 or 4 times only. gently pat out to about 1" thick. cut into circles with a floured biscuit cutter or glass (i often just dip a chef's knife in flour and cut into 3" squares).heat oven to 500 degrees. place a large cast iron skillet in the oven and heat about 7 min. remove to stove top and melt 2 tbls shortening in the skillet (i use butter flavored crisco). place biscuits in skillet, then quickly turn each biscuit over. return to oven, and bake until golden brown, around 10 min. you may have to do in two batches. if you don't have a large cast iron skillet, you can bake these on a greased cookie sheet on 425 for about 15 min.  brush the tops with butter.old fashioned sausage gravy2 lbs good quality whole hog sausage (purnell or tennessee pride work very well)9 tbls  flour6 cps whole milk (heated almost to boiling)pepperin a heavy cast roaster or dutch oven, break up sausage and brown over medium heat until thoroughly cooked. drain, reserving 6 tbls of fat*. heat fat over medium heat, and stir in flour. cook, stirring, until flour takes on the texture and color of peanut butter. whisk in milk, and return sausage to pan. liberally grind pepper over top. cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened.* if using a premium sausage like jimmy deans or bob evans, you may have to add some butter or shortening, to make it to 6t of fat.posted by mark

	 bill knapp's orange nut bread
	 
    


 before they closed their doors in 2002, bill knapp's restaurants were a 54 year tradition in michigan, ohio, and indiana.  they were famous for their birthday celebrations (you got 1 % off your bill for every year you lived!), their fabulous cakes,  out of this world biscuits, au gratin potatoes, and good honest home cooking.  they had the best fried chicken i have ever had anywhere.  mom and dad loved the steaks.  the ex and my daughter always got the chicken fricassee or the meatloaf.  they had a very loyal clientele, and when they finally closed the doors on their last 26 restaurants in 2002, there were legions of disappointed people.  my son and daughter-in -law still talk about how much they miss knapps.awrey bakery in detroit still makes the cakes and markets them under the bill knapp's name.  they are available at meijer stores.  the following recipe is for my dad's favorite:bill knapp"s orange nut bread2 cups flour1 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons butter1/2 cup boiling water2 tablespoons grated orange rind1/3 cup orange juice1 cup sugar2 teaspoons vanilla1 egg, slightly beaten1/2 cup chopped walnutsgrease an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan.sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.melt butter in boiling water. add orange rind, orange juice, sugar, vanilla and beaten egg and blend.sift dry ingredients over orange mixture. add nuts.stir just until flour is damp. batter will be lumpy.pour into prepared pan. bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.posted by mark

	 bubble and squeak with wow wow sauce, and it's irish cousin colcannon
	 
    


even though my mom's family was english, i never had this dish until about 25 years ago, when a small tavern specializing in traditional english food opened in commerce mi. the tavern is appropriately named bubble and squeak, and it is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere!bubble and squeak2 1/2 cps shredded cabbage (about 1 lb)3 tbl bacon drippings or butter1 med onion, chopped2 cps coarsely mashed potatoes (about 1 lb)1/2 tsp salt1/8 tsp ground black pepper1 lb thinly sliced cooked roast beef  or corned beefplunge cabbage in a pan of boiling salted water, cook 5 mins,, thoroughly drain in colander.heat a heavy 10" skillet over medium heat. melt drippings, add onions, and cook till soft. about 5 min. lightly press on cabbage with the back of your spatula to remove any remaining moisture, and add to the onions. stir in potatoes, salt and pepper. press mixture down lightly with spatula. lower heat to med. low. top with slices of meat. cook, covered, about 15 min. do not stir. remove cover, and cook 10 - 15 min, till bottom is nicely browned. if you listen, closely, you should hear how the dish got it's name! while dish is cooking, prepare sauce.wow wow sauce2 tbls butter2 tbls minced onion2 tbls flour1 cp beef stock1 tbl white wine vinegar1 tbl english style mustard1/2 tsp prepared horseradish1/4 tsp salt1/8 tsp pepperin a 1 1/2 qt. sauce pan, melt butter over med heat. add onion, stirring constantly, until soft but not brown. stir in flour and cook one minute, stirring constantly. add stock all at once and whisk until smooth. stir in all remaining ingredients and bring to boil. reduce heat to medium low and cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 10 min.invert skillet contents onto plate.  cut bubble and squeak into wedges, and serve with sauce.  serves 6colcannoni like this served with corned beef at fiddler's hearth here in south bend.2 lbs potatoes, peeled and cut into eights2 tsp salt (divided)4 slices irish bacon (if unavailable, use american)4 cps shredded cabbage1 1/2 cp green onions or leeks, finely chopped (if using leeks, use white part only)1/3 cp milk1/4 cp butter (melted)1/8 tsp pepperin medium sauce pan, bring 1/2" water to boil. add potatoes, 1 tsp salt, cover, and cook 15 - 20 mins, till fork tender. drain thoroughly.meantime, in large, heavy skillet, fry bacon until crisp. remove and drain, reserving drippings. in the reserved drippings, saute cabbage and onions, with 1/2 tsp salt, until soft and translucent. covering pan helps vegetables cook faster.in a large bowl, beat together potatoes , milk, remaining salt, and pepper until light and fluffy. fold in cabbage, onions and crumbled bacon. make a well in the middle and pour in melted butter. this goes really well with corned beef and wow wow sauce!posted by mark

	 tarte au sucre jaune
	 
    


this is an old recipe that has it's origins in french canada.  the amish call it miliche flitche (poor man's pie), and add a bit of cinnamon..  the cajuns top it with meringue.  down south, it's just called brown sugar pie.  i found this recipe in the university of north carolina's student newspaper, along with a story about a homesick student bringing a bit of grandma's house to campus.  i decided to try it, and really liked it.   there are dozens of variations of this on the internet!  so you might want to look for one that strikes your fancy!  but i thought this was very tasty.brown sugar pie2 unbaked pie shells1 lb brown sugar5 eggs1/2 cp sweetened condensed milk1 tsp vanillawhisk together brown sugar, eggs, condensed milk and vanilla. pour into shells.  bake at 450 for 10 min, then 350 for 20 min.  serve warm or cold with ice cream or whipped cream.

	 french bread
	 
    


i love homemade bread or rolls with soup or stew when the weather is cool. i usually make this into hard rolls topped with poppy seeds rather than loaves--or sometimes i make it into bread sticks. bread lovers--enjoy!7 - 7-1/4 cups flour2 packages active dry yeast1 tlbs sugar1 tbls salt1 tbls cooking oil2-1/2 cups warm wateryellow cornmeal1 egg whitedissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water (follow temperature instructions on yeast package). add sugar, salt, oil and remaining water. mix in about 4 cups of the flour, and continue adding flour until dough can be turned out onto floured board or cloth and kneaded. knead, adding flour as needed, until smooth and elastic (5-10 minutes). let rise until double in size. punch down and divide into four parts. cover and let rise 10 minutes. roll each part in a 12x8 inch rectangle. roll into loaves and taper ends. place seam side down on greased cookie sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. gash tops of loaves 1/2 -- 1/4 inch deep every 2-1/2 inches.beat egg white till foamy. add 1 tbls water. brush tops and sides of loaves. let rise. bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. brush again and bake 20 minutes longer.barb

	 pudding cake
	 
    


i finally found it--mom's pudding cake recipe!  this is one of mark's favorites.1.  in an oblong pan, 13x9x2,  mix 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup cocoa.  then stir in 2 cups water.2.  cut 13 marshmallows into quarters and scatter over mixture.3.  spoon devil's food cake batter over this.  top with 1 cup broken nut meats (mom would have used walnuts--i prefer pecans).  bake at 350 degrees 45 to 50 minutes.  top with whipped cream or ice cream.if anyone is interested, i have a recipe similar to this for hot fudge cake which is on the 'heart smart' list, with less than 30% of its calories from fat.  i also have a pudding cake recipe made in the crockpot.  it's actually quite good.barb
