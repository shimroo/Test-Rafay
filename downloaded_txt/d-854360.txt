testimonials






ellen williams and larry miller, cambridge, ma





we have bought and sold a number of houses over the years and our experience with tea lane has been far superior to any other experience we have had with other realtors anywhere. we simply cannot recommend them highly enough. they are professional, thoughtful, and responsive. they have always been able to understand our personal needs in any of a number of different situations. they are the best. look no further.

brendan and claudine hanley, rye ny





for nearly twenty years we have relied on tea lane’s trusted advice and unrivaled knowledge of the island. our family has rented, purchased and sold homes through tea lane. as first-time renters looking to experience up-island for the first time or pre-children, as we evaluated our first purchase. recently, tea lane helped us identify a new home while simultaneously selling our existing home. tea lane will guide you through the process with transparency and skill. their client-focused culture is clear at every step.

jennifer dunner weaver, riverwoods, illinois





my family has used tea lane associates for over twenty years. during that time, they provided us with wonderful rentals for summer vacations and also found us a home, which we fell in love with and ultimately purchased. we not only still reach out to tea lane for referrals and advice (because they know everything there is to know about the vineyard), but we also have formed close friendships with many of their agents.
