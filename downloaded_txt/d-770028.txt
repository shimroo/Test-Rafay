            what is the cw mars network?
          










ayer library is a member of the cw mars library network, providing cardholders access to 8 million items from over 160 libraries. cw mars stands for central and western massachusetts automated resource sharing. it is the largest of nine library consortia in massachusetts. members include academic, public, and special libraries of all sizes, from tiny towns with populations under 500 to large urban libraries with many branches. cw mars hosts and supports the hardware and software needed to power our shared online library catalog and library staff software, and provides technical support to ayer library and other member libraries.








            how much can i borrow? for how long?
          










with some exceptions, ayer library cardholders may generally borrow up to 50 items at a time; place up to 20 holds; keep each item for up to three weeks; and renew each item once for an additional three weeks. audiovisual materials, video games, magazines, and library of things items may have additional limits.speak with a staff member or read our library services policy for more details.








            what does "fine free" mean?
          










ayer library wants you to enjoy your materials stress-free and reduce barriers to continued library use. so cw mars libraries have done away with all late fines for all materials kept past their due date, and will auto-renew any materials that can be renewed.however, when an item is kept 4 weeks beyond its due date, we will automatically bill patrons for a replacement copy. if billed items are not actually lost or damaged, simply return the items and the bills will be removed.for more information, read our library services policy.








            help! my library card doesn't work!
          










there are two possible reasons you might have lost access to services your library card provides.first, library cards expire every two years. you may renew your card by updating your contact information in person, over the phone, via email, or in the online catalog. proof of identification may be requested by library staff at the time of card renewal.second, all cw mars libraries agree on common blocking thresholds. public patrons are blocked by the system whentheir card card expires;they owe $10.00 or more in fines, replacement costs, or fees;they have 50 or more items checked out;they have 1 lost item.we want to make sure you have access to the ayer library. our library services policy outlines a variety of options for reinstating blocked accounts. for help resolving your access issues, speak with a staff member.
