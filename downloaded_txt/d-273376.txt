the city of greensburg, indiana




welcome to the tree city! home to the famous courthouse tower tree, greensburg sits right off of i-74 at the halfway point between indianapolis and cincinnati. if you are looking for a rural town experience while still being close enough to enjoy the amenities of two large cities, then greensburg is the place for you.
among rolling cornfields, greensburg is the picturesque county seat of decatur county, home to more than 13,000 residents. we strive to provide our citizens with the city services necessary to keep our community safe, clean, and welcoming to all.
our school system is top-rated, with a state-ranked basketball program. if you love high school basketball and rooting for the home team, you'll fit right in supporting the greensburg pirates.
