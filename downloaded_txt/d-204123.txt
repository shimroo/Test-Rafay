 changing habits: the caregivers' total workout






















  





caregivers are bombarded with additional daily stressors which greatly undermine their ability to function as effective caregivers. before they can overcome these demands, they need to see the whole context of life to rediscover their true identity and to fulfill their individual dreams.

thats the guiding light behind my book, changing habits: the caregivers total workout  this is the first comprehensive health and fitness program that shows caregivers how to energize, get fit, eat right, shed stress and enjoy life. a series of small, defined changes can lead to sustainable happiness. each chapter demonstrates how to restore balance physically, emotionally and spiritually.
