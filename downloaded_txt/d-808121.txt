these are early pictures of us.  terry was twenty months old in june 1946 and brenda was two years and one week old in november 1951.  you may be able to spot some more recent photos of us in the weddings pages.

    sadly terry passed away on 3rd september 2024 having lost the battle with cancer, and brenda is now picking up the pieces.  our lovely family; three married daughters, six grandchildren and two great granddaughters have been wonderfully supportive through the difficult times

     
      she is keeping busy with various arts and craft groups and also the family history.  there are also new skills to be learned such as looking after the garden.
