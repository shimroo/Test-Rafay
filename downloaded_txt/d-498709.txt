new covenant fellowship









new covenant fellowshipreflecting the redemptive love of christ
now the lord is the spirit, and where the spirit of the lord is, there is freedom. and we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. for this comes from the lord who is the spirit. - 2 cor. 3:17-18
