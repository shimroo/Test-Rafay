power your students’ learning with salvadori steam!




    book a program
  
















we partner with nyc and pennsylvania schools to provide push-in steam programs for k-12 students that include all curricula, instruction, materials, and supplies.  our multi-day in-school and after-school programs use the built environment ~ buildings, bridges, parks, and communities ~ to show students how what they learn in school is part of their everyday lives.  our collaborative, hands-on, project-based approach instills teamwork, effective communication, critical thinking, and creative problem solving ~ vital skills students need to succeed. 


























our collaborative, project-based programs show students how math, science, and the arts are relevant. they include grade-specific curricula tied to national and state educational standards.

we use the built environment - buildings, bridges, parks and communities that surround our students’ lives to help students see the relevance of math, science, and the arts.
