founding fathers in my eyes







many people seem to like
to ask what would the founding fathers do. so i decided to re-read
ben franklin's auto biography.  some of my notes on what he would do
and suggest.  inoculate/vaccinate  your children.  own a printing
press. give up the gold standard and print money.  printing money is
a good idea if you own the press that prints it for the government. 
the dude that owns the printing press can shape public policy by
telling people what to think.  always give money to charity and
churches.  never attend church as the preacher only wants job
security and is kind worthless when it comes to lame sermons.   do
not call them taxes but make sure people pay for great service like
hospitals, libraries and fire departments.  public work projects like
street repair keep society civil and moving foreword.  the rich
unfairly write laws so they do not have to pay their fair share. any
businessmen that does not do business in multiple languages is a
complete idiot.
