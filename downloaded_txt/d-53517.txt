what's new in hpv and cervical cancer prevention 










				what you need to know about the hpv self-collection test			


hpv self-collection is a great new option for cervical cancer screening. it is easy to do, and lets you avoid a speculum exam which many people find uncomfortable.










				listen to the cervical cancer survivor series			


the cervical cancer survivor series is an eight-part podcast series sharing stories from cervical cancer survivors across the country, touching on topics including diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship, as well as advice for others whose lives are impacted by this preventable disease.










				new option for cervical cancer screening — self-collected samples			


the fda recently approved hpv testing using self-collected samples. experts hope allowing people to collect their own samples will increase screening rates.










				too few people understand the link between hpv and cancer			


a new study revealed a disturbing trend in health knowledge; fewer people seem to understand the connection between hpv and certain types of cancer including cervical, oral, anal, and penile cancers.










				is one shot of the hpv vaccine enough? study shows promising results			


is one shot enough? a recent study adds to evidence that one dose of the hpv vaccine might be enough to provide protection against cervical cancer. 










				even more evidence for the value of early hpv vaccination			


an exciting new study in scotland found no cases of invasive cervical cancer in young women who had gotten the hpv vaccine by the time they were 14.
