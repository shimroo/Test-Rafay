fighting for freedom




    join the fight
  



from courtroom lawsuits to boardroom negotiations, from picket lines to economic boycotts, from schoolrooms to factory floors, the detroit branch naacp has demanded justice and civil rights. we seek not merely a superficial procedural justice, but a substantive, deeper form of justice that derives from the very spirit upon which this country was founded.






















  

there are those today who seek to turn back the rewards of history. those rewards have been achieved through the blood, sweat, tears and bones of those who gave their lives in the cause of freedom and justice. so no, we shall not turn back!
