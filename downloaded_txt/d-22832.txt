what you say about us 
kind words from guests, ranchers and the press

we have been thrilled to be a part of the top50 ranches and ranchweb family over the years. from the innovative marketing ideas and the prominence of the websites, to the skillful leadership of gene kilgore, our business has gained great benefits from ranchweb and top50 ranches. both have provided us excellent exposure to direct clients and travel agents, and we love the way they allow potential guests to pinpoint the ranch that truly fits them. we all have different strengths as ranches and we appreciate the way gene kilgore steers people towards those who want what we offer.
