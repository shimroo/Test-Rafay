as to the accuracy or suitability of their ephemerides for any purpose.
ephemeris.com is not associated with jpl, but does use their publicly
available ephemerides.

jpl's planet positions are derived from their de405 ephemeris.  the software
section of ephemeris.com contains a free software package to read, write, and
interpolate de405 (the world's most accurate planetary database), and any other
jpl planetary ephemeris.  the software is available under the lesser gnu public
license, meaning you can use it anywhere, even in software you intend to sell.
