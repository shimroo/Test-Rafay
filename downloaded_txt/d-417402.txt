the stanley museum, inc. commemorates and preserves the heritage of stanley family genius. the famous “stanley steamer” automobile was invented by francis edgar stanley and manufactured by him and his twin brother, freelan oscar stanley. the stanley dry plate company was also a joint endeavor of the twins, f.e. and f.o. stanley. freelan oscar stanley along with nephew carlton stanley opened a violin making business. their sister, chansonetta stanley emmons, and her daughter dorothy are equally important, chansonetta for her photographs depicting rural turn-of-the-century american life and dorothy for her paintings.
the museum has assembled a collection of all facets of stanley family history and memorabilia — airbrush painting and photography, photographic dry plate technology, violins and examples of stanley steam cars from 1905, 1909, 1910, and 1916. the museum uses these collections to illustrate the technical, artistic, social and economic achievements of the stanley family and how these achievements relate to the past, present and future.
the museum, located at 40 school street in kingfield maine, houses four stanley steamer automobiles along with a family room dedicated to the history, ingenuity and the artistic talents of the stanley family.
the stanley museum was established in 1981 as a non-profit foundation for education (501.c.3)
