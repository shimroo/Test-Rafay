  carrying luggage and groceries on a mobility scooterthe vast majority of mobility scooters â regardless of size â have no provision for carrying luggage or any sizeable amount of groceries. the best one can hope for is a small bicycle basket, mounted to the handlebars and banging into your knees every time you try to turn.here at travelscoot we have many years of experience with this issue and have come up with a number of intelligent solutions. these all have in common that they are mounted independent of the handlebar movement, allowing much larger items to be carried. traveling with the travelscoot â¢itâs all in the name!a carry-on size (22 inches max. height) suitcase can be strapped easily and securely on the small platform in front of the steering column. another, medium-size, luggage item can be placed loose on the frame in front of the seat. we suggest you do this after you are seated on the scooter. our rear-mounted luggage hitch allows a wheeled suitcase of any size to be attached in seconds, leaving both hands free to steer (see video).    please note that, ideally, you use two-wheel suitcases on your travelscoot, since the wheels are recessed to save space. four-spinner cases have exposed wheels which can interfere with, or even obstruct, your feet. also, iata air-travel regulations on luggage size are based total suitcase dimensions, which include the wheels. as a result, two-wheel cases provide more internal volume.iata carry-on rule: 55 x 40 x 20 cm (approx. 21.5 x 13.5 x 7.5 inches) max. weight 8 kg / 18 lbs. these rules may vary by airline.shopping with your travelscoot â¢basket and/or boxes are the shopping containers of choice. up to two baskets can installed on the travelscoot without interfering with the rider. itâs possible to place, without attaching, a third basket or box on the frame in front of the seat. when itâs time to get on or off the travelscoot, just set the basket or box aside; just slide it under your feet when seated. the rear-mounted luggage hitch can be installed in place of the rear basket.  new accessoriessmart luggage kitour innovative, smart luggage kit universal carrier system allows you to attach a large crate or cabin-sized suitcase to the steering column as well as wheeled suitcase to the rear. all components are extremely lightweight and donât protrude beyond the travelscootâs footprint. this allows the kit to be permanently installed. even so, installation and removal takes less than a minute. show smart luggage kit    show distributors for prices choose one of our world-wide distributorsshow distributors © 2024 travelscoot. all rights reserved. secured by avanet imprint & disclaimer privacy policyfollow us on:  international deutschland international espaã±a / mã©xico france italiano å°ç£
