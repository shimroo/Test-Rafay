trail running is all about leaving the noise and pollution that characterises road running far behind, in preference for running in the refreshing environs of nature: in forests, through parklands, in valleys and on mountains, over creeks and meadows. but, essentially, trail running is all about running in beautiful and inspiring parts of the world that remain as mother nature intended: untouched and wild!
