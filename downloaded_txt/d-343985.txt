"there               are a lot of ways to save fifty 
      cents on the cost of a hunting trip.               choosing your 
      muzzleloader bullet should not be one of them."  


welcome to our extensive line               
      of custom muzzleloader bullets. our fundamental belief is that in          
           order to humanely harvest game a bullet must dissipate kinetic energy 
                    inside the body cavity. extensive bullet testing, using 
      animal carcasses               and a bullet recovery box, has shown us 
      that soft, pure lead is               the only bullet material which will 
      consistently perform over the               entire velocity range 
      generated by modern muzzleloaders. jacketed               bullets may work 
      at very close range when the velocities are moderately               high 
      but as the range increases, the jacket prevents the lead from              
       doing its job. our tests conclude that there is no place for jacketed     
                bullets in thin-skinned game hunting situations. 
                    we offer a variety of weights to 
      reflect the twist of rifling in               the barrel. the blackpowder 
      hunter can purchase rifles with twists               of 1-66",1-48", 
      1-38", 1-32", 1-28", 1-26", 1-24" and 1-20". obviously,               a 
      bullet that is ideal for a 1-38" twist will not be stabilized              
       by a 1-48" twist and will not be optimum for a 1-24" twist. that          
           is why we, and we alone, offer bullets in all weights from 175 grains 
                    to 535 grains. due to their unique design, all weights in a 
      given               model will expand to the same proportions but only one 
      weight will               give absolute accuracy in each specific rifle. 
                    there are very few muzzleloaders made today that are 
      not capable               of shooting 3 shot 2.5" groups at 100 yards. 
      every bullet we manufacture               is capable of sub 1" groups just 
      the way they come to you. your               job is to match the weight of 
      bullet with the charge and type of               powder that will make 
      your rifle perform to these standards.
