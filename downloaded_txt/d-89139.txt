prescott, prescott valley and chino valley: about the tri-cities
tri-cities of prescott, prescott valley and chino valley - ask the prescott locals, and they'll tell you that prescott - meaning the city of prescott - is completely different from prescott valley. that's absolutely true; they are separate cities entirely, with different municipalities, unique attributes and individual atmospheres. furthermore, rounding out what we call the "tri-city" area, is chino valley, with its own environment and idiosyncracies to boot. but as a visitor, all you need to know is that they're all "prescott." they're all part of what makes this swath of central arizona extraordinary. read on to find out what each city brings to the experience that is all prescott.
other very popular and worth while places to visit while you're here is sedona, jerome and cottonwood. in recent years, cottonwood is giving sedona and jerome a run for it's money in the tourism industry. being the green belt of central arizona, the numerous wineries, nature opportunities, and fishing holes, cottonwood is well worth a visit for a day or two. but of course, nothing really beats sedona' red rock views or jerome's "edgy" character. you have many options for very worthwhile day trips near prescott, az.
