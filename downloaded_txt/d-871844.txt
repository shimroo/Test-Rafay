i want to commend you and all at cwnp for having a great organization. you really 'raise the bar' on knowing wi-fi well. i have learned a ton of information that is helping my job experience and personal career goals, because of my cwap/cwdp/cwsp studies. kudos to all at cwnp.

word of the day (wotd)
phyed



wi-fi question of the day (qotd)
you must implement 7 aps for a branch office location in your organization. all aps will be autonomous and provide the same two ssids (busnet1 and guestnet). because each ap is managed directly through a web-based interface, what should be changed on every ap before enabling the wlans to ensure proper staging procedures are followed?
