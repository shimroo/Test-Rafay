originally a music store that opened in ely, mn in 1998, music outfitters later expanded with an online store in 2001. the store started by offering basic musical instruments, top-selling cds. they quickly expanded into specializing in independent music from independent bands and independent musicians, starting with the ely, mn area, then expanding to artists across the world. by 2008, they were selling putumayo world music, hohner harmonicas, sageman drums, music accessories (blacklights, strobe lights, fog machines, bubble machines, haze machines, snow machines, and effects lighting). they were also giving music lessons, renting band instruments, holding drum circles, and supporting the ely area concert association.
for 6 1/2 years, music outfitters exclusively sponsored the radio show "off the beaten track". airing wednesday nights from 7 pm to 9 pm on local radio station wely and their audio stream, the show played and promoted the best in independent music, and was hosted by author, computer consultant, and friend of the owners vince o'connor. it was also at this time that they began building the online music resources section of the website.
in june of 2018, both the brick and mortar and online store closed. but the website morphed into a site dedicated to being a curated one-stop source for music information and and resources for visitors across the web.
