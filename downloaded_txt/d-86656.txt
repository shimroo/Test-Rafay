(2020)  even though you were directly connected to your friends, they wouldn't know if a message someone had written was from you, or from one of your friends, or from one of their other friends, or from one of anyone's friend's friends, or beyond. messages that you had read could spread to your friends, then their friends, and then their friend's friends, and ultimately not stop forwarding until “dying out” at the compounding mercy of each recipient's voluntary or involuntary reactions and some server/client-side algorithms. the message forwarding flow in some ways resembled behaviors in conway's game of life.   some of the ways that users could react to their composed or received messages. (2020)  furthermore, the system was designed in a way so that all messages were encrypted both locally on device and also end-to-end in transmission. this meant that the data traveling between friends and various other friends' devices (and beyond) was not readable by anyone “in the middle” who was not a designated recipient… such as the app's server and cloud system providers, anyone's internet service provider, any engineers working on the app's platform, nor even if all of the data were to leak and be shared publicly somewhere online. decrypting these “256-bit encrypted blobs” en masse would be a cryptographic undertaking of considerable size. i'd written the ios app's entire client-side codebase in objective-c, a language that i'd also begun more so to distance myself from in the years leading up to this app's retirement. my major, personal ios projects until then had all been written in this language, but my interests had shifted increasingly and more dramatically toward swift with its newer versions, abi stability, and ultimately with the unveiling of “swiftui.” it's tremendously challenging to launch social networking products, but they are fun. communication is the backbone of the smartphone's popularity, and some chat applications are incredibly successful. i would love to have a simple, anonymized feed to post messages to with friends (and beyond), but developing products takes a lot of time. “shh…” was discontinued in early 2020.    view my blog post about this project.               2005 - 2012: mobile17    ios (4.7 rating) android (4.4 rating) web windows phone acquired press big data mobile music  served tens of millions of mobile-content downloads and was covered in major publications such as popular science magazine, men’s health magazine, the boston globe, and pc magazine. also featured on digg, cnet, techtv, and lifehacker.    traction  success     mobile17 was a mobile-content tool enabling the simultaneous creation and editing of personalized cellphone ‘ringtones’ using any original full song found on the user's computer as a music-source. (via itunes, mp3s, ipod, etc.) editing of songs into ringtones took place primarily via its website and was assisted by crowd-sourced statistics/voting of which parts of the songs sound best. ringtones could also be created offline on smart-phones using its iphone and android apps, and data was transmitted back to the website via a centralized api. in late 2011, a native windows phone application was co-developed with microsoft to enable its users to sync ringtones from the mobile17 website directly to their handset, without any complex downloading or additional installation.   “mobile17” song page (2012)  the site either hosted a file for download, or delivered content directly to the user's handset upon creation. the company was acquired in 2012.    the boston globe (mention) cnet— “make your own ringtones online” digg (multiple front page stories) lifehacker (multiple mentions) men's health (print)— “make your own ringtones” pcmag (review)— “mobile17” popular science (print)— “can i use my own songs as ringtones?” techtv— “original ‘smashthetones’ project, debut on the screen savers!” view my blog posts: #mobile17 (project)               2016 -

2015: accounts    ios fail press big data mobile social  a “contacts network” that served as a futureproof communication layer for relationship retention. you'd receive notifications when contacts updated their information, or joined a new app or service.    traction  success     accounts was a simple network for sharing your accounts and usernames that you use for web services selectively with groups of known contacts. the goal for the service was for people to keep in touch using whatever apps from the app store as they always have, but then to use accounts as a consistent, reliable, and centralized index of all of the people that they know. accounts was not only a powerful address book that updated itself, but was designed to keep people in touch and manage their contacts for the longterm.   “accounts” homepage (2014)  users would receive notifications when someone updated their information, or if there were new apps installed on their devices that could be added to their profile. they would choose who to share their basic contact information and particular accounts with, and wouldn't feel obliged to post any updates or worry about their privacy given that there was no actual user-generated content being shared within the app! accounts was discontinued in april 2015, with plans in hand for a successor product.    techcrunch— “accounts launches a new address book for ios that tracks your many identities” view my blog posts: #accounts (project)               2014: rocketbro    ios retired game mobile  an “endless 2d scroller” game for iphone and ipad that launched into the ios app store in 2014.    traction  success     the player had a single “life” with each play, or up to two lives by unlocking the second “undersea bonus level” with an in-app purchase of $0.99 usd. the game was otherwise free to play, but if the player crashed on the initial “outer space” level after having achieved a certain score/points threshold (from shooting and avoiding flying objects and platforms), they would reach a cutscene of traveling to earth over the atlantic ocean, and either be prompted to pay to continue the game or instantly transported into the second level thereafter if they had already chosen to make that optional purchase. the player could in theory continue playing endlessly for free on the first level by not crashing into platforms and by successfully destroying flying objects, even as the game increased its speed, but the player would then never reach the bonus level or cutscene.   “rocketbro” game cutscene in the atlantic ocean (2014)  rocketbro was available on the app store and free to download and play through the end of 2015.              2009 - 2012: i like b-sides    web retired press music  analyzed your music library and provided new song suggestions from artists that you already enjoy.    traction  success     took from concept to reality in just three days. accomplished recommendations by mathematically analyzing your listening habits and comparing them with online sales rankings of a selection of artists to find missing or previously unenjoyed (but similar) tracks.   “i like b-sides” match page (2012)  the project's website was released to extremely positive reviews that same week. it cost virtually nothing to run by relying on amazon web services and other cloud offerings for scaling and stability.    cnet— “'i like b-sides' recommends music you're ignoring” lifehacker— “i like b-sides analyzes your itunes library to suggest new music” pcmag— “i like b-sides recommends music you'll actually like”               2008 - 2009: bitsmash    web retired press  a service that tracked and provided analytics of what people shared on the internet via bittorrent, a multimedia file-exchange protocol utilizing over 35% of all internet traffic on average at the time.    traction  success     bitsmash did not aid in distribution, but instead gave a centralized database of statistics that identified content to likely tangible product matches (such as actual books or dvds found for sale on amazon.com) and could also geographically pinpoint (via google maps) where users were spreading content to or from. the site offered billboard-style charts showing the demand for certain types of media, as well. closed this project in 2009 to refocus and apply knowledge gained to both dubspace and mobile17.    torrentfreak— “bitsmash launches bittorrent statistics tool”               2009 - 2010: dubspace    web fail social  provided a profile page-builder and discussion community for owners of vehicles (of all kinds), classified by modification levels and type.    traction  success     modified and tuned volkswagens with friends for years, and simultaneously launched dubspace. although the site received great praise from its users, its market was too saturated for organic growth. i later applied its technology and design attributes to mobile17.              2012 - 2013: app map    ios (4.0 rating) retired press big data mobile social  identified and displayed the most commonly and actively used apps near you on iphone or ipad.    traction  success     app map tracked live app usage activity, anonymously, worldwide amongst its users. users who had downloaded app map participated in an anonymized app-usage sharing platform that was great for app discovery. their true identities were never tied to their locations, and social connections could only see each other's app activity when opted-in.    techcrunch— “app map for ios lets you see what apps are popular in your area” thenextweb— “app map for ios now lets you see what apps your friends use, as well as people around you”               2008: diggsuggest    web retired press  a tool for users to discover news stories that were not being featured by the algorithms on the “digg” news website.    traction  success     created as a working concept for digg, a socially-driven news and bookmarking site launched in late 2004. digg had become one of the internet's most popular websites. it organized news into tech-oriented categories with the stories ranked by their popularity, but lacked personalization features for users. accomplished building this by measuring users' interests in keywords and topics from their past bookmarking history. the site was an instant hit and actively discussed in the blogosphere.    cnet— “diggsuggest tells you what you should read on digg” mashable— “diggsuggest. is this necessary?” readwriteweb— “diggfilter vs. diggsuggest: third party recommendation engines head-to-head”               2004 - 2005: bitoogle (yotoshi)    web sold press  a search-engine for bittorrent files, acting as a frontend to google search but providing additional filters and statistics tools.    traction  success     bitoogle (later renamed to “yotoshi”, before being sold) received a lot of traffic and turned into a profitable (through online advertising) side-project very quickly. — it was eventually purchased from me by an entrepreneur based out of tokyo, japan.   bitoogle's “bootstrapped” servers in 2004  being a teenager at the time (with limited financial resources), i built servers for the site out of older computers and parts that i had around the house. one of the better machines was actually assembled in a dr. martin's brand shoebox after i ran out of cases.              2003: lan2p    windows retired press social  decentralized, peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing software for use on windows computers connected to a local-area network.    traction  success     wrote this windows software in 2003 to enable users on a computer network to search and exchange files in a serverless, distributed peer-to-peer network. each computer connected to one-another and created an instant, encrypted network for sharing of files, without the need for a centralized or “always-on” server.        posts, by date  2022   07月02日 migrating windows from intel (x86) virtualbox to arm windows on m1 mac computers  #apple #mac #windows #software    2021   02月27日 regarding perception and dreaming…  #life #offbeat    01月16日 return anything: amazon and ebay turn a blind-eye to “missing parts” or “defective” merchandise  #amazon #ebay #shopping #stuff #business #minimalism    2020   12月26日 the first ski/snowboarding goggles i've ever liked  #snowboarding #life #japan #shopping #stuff    2019   12月18日 “shh…” launched  #iphone #projects #apps #messaging #minimalism    06月16日 2.9-inch epaper weather display (arduino powered/programmable) review and guide  #hardware #hack #dev #electronics    05月14日 received a cool shoutout from the apple security and safari teams this week 🔐  #apple #ios #ipad #iphone #mac #software    2018   12月02日 set a custom, emoji-filled lock screen message on your new iphone or ipad!
