  the knickerbocker family
yes  we are all related! the fun part is proving it.
 
summer 2023 
this web site was
  started over 25 years ago to support the knickerbocker historical society at
  schaghticoke, ny and to provide a spot for sharing family information. the
  genealogy world has greatly changed from my publishing a paper family
  newsletter in the 90s to having massive commercial on-line sites and dna
  based genealogy available today.
i have kept
  this site available to provide the base family genealogies and as a link to
  the schaghticoke society. knickerbocker research will always have a home
  here. welcome cousin - w­­­­­e are all related. 
 
the new
  knickerbocker unified family tree - link
weve finally
  done it. our own modern independent on-line family tree containing about
  7,400 entries is up and running. we were able to move the ancestry site to
  roots magic 9 and from there, via gedcom, to the gedsite 4 static web site
  builder program.
we managed to
  reduce the huge size of the ancestry site by deleting some 14,000 copyrighted
  image files leaving us with about 1,400 images to manage
we have
  verified the early family by tying the mid-19th century censuses
  to the early albany family. this new genealogy contains only the descendants
  of harmen jansen and their spouses. the concentration is on the male lines as
  researching female lines past to present is almost impossible.
we have
  abandoned the family search genealogy site for anything but a historic
  picture depository. there is no control over ill-informed people making
  changes to established and proven relationships.

dave
  knickerbocker
i wanted to
  remember dave knickerbocker who died in 2019. dave and george walker kept us entertained
  with the great alvin hunttm until bryan solved this
  all-consuming brick wall mystery.  i met dave in person once
  at schaghticoke - but we exchanged hundreds of emails over the years. dave
  was a vietnam combat veteran, mayor of oviedo, fl and a successful
  businessman. link

lawrence
  knickerbocker and his children
this is the rich
  tale of the knickerbockers exploding out of their dutchess county roots to
  areas across the eastern united states. most knickerbockers who are alive
  today have been affected by this sequence of events.  we begin this
  story with a road trip through key locations in dutchess and litchfield
  counties.  we then use an analysis of 1850 census results to explain how
  the knickerbockers migrated out of the hudson river valley to far off
  lands such as the finger lakes and michigan.  we believe this approach
  will provide a solid foundation for ongoing studies of later generations of
  knickerbockers. link
