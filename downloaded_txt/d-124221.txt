chateau pedesclaux - pauillac 5eme grand cru classe 2005





château pedesclaux lies on a chalky plateau overlooking the town of pauillac and among such illustrious châteaux as mouton rothschild, lafite rothschild and pontet canet.it was founded at the beginning of the 19th century by mr. urbain pierre pedesclaux, a well-known wine broker in bordeaux, and was then classified in 1855 as a 5th growth grand cru classé. it is now in the hands of the jugla family who, of late, have invested huge amounts of money and effort into the development of the chateau and the vines—the result now speaks for itself. bottle size : 75clalcohol percentage : 13% abvprice : 24.50 gbp where to buy : http://www.fromvineyardsdirect.com/personal opinion : a little bit on the expensive side but if you don't mind paying this price you will be hugely impressed. in my opinion, this is one of the secret treasures of pauillac. keep the bottles in your cellar for a few years and experience something special. personal score : 8.5/10

beringer founder's estate - cabernet saubignon 2005





the beringer founders estate cabernet bursts with bright cassis, black fruit and sweet brown spice aromas with just a touch of vanilla that leads into a juicy mouthfeel. a balanced dose of structured tannins and its long finish make this unmistakably a california cabernet. however, this cabernet doesn't need to be cellared; it's ready to drink now.bottle size : 75clalcohol percentage : 13.5% vol.personal opinion : a little strong in alcohol, but still very nice. enjoyable californian wine. we normally don't go for this kind of wine, but i was offered a drink while visiting some friends and i was very impressed with this one. i suppose this is exactly how you discover something different. i would class this wine as an everyday wine, easy to drink and you don't need too much of it.personal score : 8/10where to buy : treshersprice : under 5 pound

ramon lopez murillo - rioja - reserva 2003





the wine is aged for at least three years with a minimum of 12 months in oak barrels before blending and bottling. full, but not overpowering, this rich, ruby red reserva shows all the ripe, juicy fruit character of the tempranillo grape, with just a hint of spice and buttery toffee on its long finish. it is an old world wine with a touch of new world ‘up front fruit’ style.serious meat-eaters will find it a perfect companion to beef, game and lamb. serve it with venison sausages and mash and be instantly transported to alfaro, in the south east of la rioja, where it was created.alcohol percentage : 13.5% vol.bottle size : 75clprice : 3.49 gbp (on offer) - normal price 4.99 gbpwhere to buy : aldipersonal opinion : well, this was a surprise. you think, aldi?, reserva?, but as soon as you taste this wine, you forget where you bought this. aldi is usually associated with cheap stuff, but never associated with top quality. this is where aldi has proved everyone wrong. buy this now and experience a top quality wine at a fantastic price. nothing more said.personal score : 9.5/10
