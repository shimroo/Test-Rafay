mann's choice -- biased list
of organized hotlinks [back in the early days of the web (say 1994-1996 or
  so), before there were excellent search tools like google, web users
  would create and post their favorite links, called "hotlinks" back
  in the day.  so this is an archive site and is not meant to be
  updated (these links were probably last updated in the early '00s).
  it's more a snapshot of one person's favorite links from
  the mid-90s.]
