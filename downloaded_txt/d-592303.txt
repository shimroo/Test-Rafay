  1.  the  land of israel is called in tradition "the land of the tzvi," where  tzvi is a gazelle, but the expression implies a land of glory. there is a photo on the news here, i will post if  i find it on the web, of a wild gazelle in haifa leaping in the air with a wall  of forest fire flames behind him. it sums up everything.     2.  in  america, pusillanimous politicians and appeasers are afraid to say the words  "islamic terrorism". in israel, pusillanimous politicians and appeasers  are afraid to say the words "arab arson". if you are not afraid, share!     3.  haifa;  while the whole world is talking about the arson intifada, there is another  side to the story. i find this one of the most fascinating aspects to the  story. my wife is a professor at the  technion. she was stuck on campus for several hours today because of roads  closed by the fire.  she received a phone call today from one of her graduate students. he said he  owns an apartment that is not occupied near rambam hospital, far from the  fires, and if she and the family are forced by the fires to evacuate we are welcome to use it. the student is an arab.     4.  arson - the  newest palestinian human right.   make palestine anachronistic again!

    1.  obamacare explained in half a  page:    obama candy    the affordable candy act is now on the books, guaranteeing free  access for youth to candy stores at prices they can afford. the law defines the  mix of 9,800 candies that stores must be willing to provide consumers,  including fine belgian chocolates. the cost would be restricted to 75% of the  median teenage candy outlay before the act. any teenager can sign up for  instant access. stores will be allowed to enter the market and sign up  obamacandy customers.  after a year it turned out that most districts had no stores  participating in obamacandy. a few had a single provider of candy, charging 6  times what was allowed. the other stores refused to participate. the act had  ignored the actual cost of producing and procuring candies. as obamacandy is now about to be replaced with hillarycandy, the  problem will be resolved by subsidizing teenagers to sign up for it and  subsidizing candy suppliers into joining as providers. so far, none have  agreed.     2.  from 2013, http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/209905/ten-reasons-obamacare-will-fail-steven-plaut     ten reasons obamacare will fail the price-controls, shortages and reductions in quality headed our  way.     3.  the tessellations: a story  by steven plaut the crisis in new cyprus actually  began in the most seemingly innocuous of manners. new cyprus was a typical city  in the american heartland, consisting of four neighborhoods whose residents  were predominantly black and latino minority members, and 8 other neighborhoods  whose residents were predominantly white.  one day in june a proposal was laid before the new cyprus town council  concerning the reconstruction of sidewalks in new cyprus, where traditional  city sidewalks made of asphalt or cement would be replaced by special artistic  tessellated colored bricks laid down in a creative pattern. the project  promised to turn new cyprus into the very model of midwestern aesthetic  planning. part of the costs for the project would come from local businesses,  and some were matching federal funds.  the town council approved the proposal with enthusiasm. the only problem was  that not all neighborhood sidewalks could be reconstructed at once. initially  funds were sufficient for three neighborhoods only, with the implementation in  the other neighborhoods expected to be several years into the future. being a  liberal town in a "blue" state, it was decided to implement the first  stage of the program in three out of the four minority neighborhoods, granting  them priority for political reasons, and then the fourth minority neighborhood  would be among those selected in the second phase 3 years hence.  and so was born the rainbow sidewalks project of new cyprus. the sidewalks were  a metaphor for the successful colorful integration of many ethnic strands in  the city's heritage.   three years after the initiation, the second phase began, with three more  neighborhoods receiving the colored tessellations. that was followed by two  more phases, so that eventually the entire city was treated to the sidewalk  reconstruction. planning and architecture students from all over came to view  the project. it was the toast of the media.  all was not to remain so peaceful. fifteen years after the initiation of the  project, after the funds were spent, it was noticed that in the four minority  neighborhoods, where the tessellated sidewalks had been constructed somewhat  earlier, they were sorely in need of repair and partial rebuilding. in some  cases the sidewalks in the minority areas were constructed 15 years before the  newer ones in other parts of the city. and they were showing their age. bricks  were missing, some removed by vandals, others victims of tree root expansion  and winter storms. they were uneven and some were covered with graffiti.  the gap in the state of maintenance of the tessellations between the white  areas and minority neighborhoods became the focus of emotion. some local  leaders in the minority neighborhoods started to criticize the institutional  racism that had created the problem. national news shows did specials on the  infrastructure gap. it is only the tip of inequality in new cyprus, opined many  locals.   over time tensions increased. one fall evening a black teenager breaking and  entering a white home in new cyprus was shot and killed by the property owner.  suddenly the years of harmony were forgotten. "black lives matter"  commuted in to hold rallies against the violent racism and discrimination in  new cyprus. classes were suspended at the local state college campus, while  classrooms were used to hold a teach-in denouncing the naked discrimination in  the tessellated brick sidewalk policy in the city.  when a young hooligan was shot by local police officers while breaking into a  store, violence erupted. stores were looted. police attacked.  and to draw special attention to the role of the tessellated brick sidewalks  where the problems had begun, rioters made a point of vandalizing them, digging  up the colored bricks to hurl at police and public service vehicles. the  president sent in a fact-finding mission to prepare a report on racial tensions  in new cyprus. it spoke about years of discrimination in the provision of  public services there. it called for a new dialogue of tolerance and  rebuilding. federal funds were pledged.  it was decided these would be first used to make infrastructure investments in  minority neighborhoods.

    1.  by concentrating on his role in the oslo debacle, it is  easy to forget the fact that for most of his career, shimon peres was a great  man. while he was hardly a founding father of the country, as the media are  proclaiming in mindless unison, being too young in 1948, peres played a  critical role in israeli arms procurement, in the creation of the dimona  reactor, in relations with france, even in erection of early settlements in the  west bank. he was ben gurion's sidekick in the rightish breakaway rafi party, which split from  mapai. because it lasted so long, the majority of his  career days were as a skilled diplomat and leader of the labor right, and as  ben gurion's robin. had he retired 25 years ago, that would have been his  legacy. but he did not. he spent his last 25 years  committing oslo, endangering the very existence of israel with his delusions.  hectoring the country that if there was no peace it was because israelis did  not want it enough, insisting to the end that almost all israelis support the  "two-state solution," whereas in reality almost none do. proclaiming that  palestinians seek peace, whereas they seek genocidal jihad. the obscene reaction to his death among arabs  serves better than anything else to prove how deluded he was. arafat wearing military fatigues  while collecting his nobel peace prize;     2.  everyone  is over-analyzing the debate. counting numbers of factual errors, about which  most people do not care. the real test of who won will be any changes seen in  the poll numbers next week. am i the only one who picked up on hillary's  comment? where she mocks trump for allegedly saying that women do not deserve  the same pay as men unless they do the same work as men?  the fact that she considers that idea absurd  states volumes. she is so wedded to affirmative apartheid quotas and dumbed  down standards that she wants women who do not do the same work as men to get  the same pay as men. by the way, did she also say that maybe trump is  not really as rich as he thinks he is?     3.  protectionism  does not "create jobs." at most it causes a shift in employment of  existing employees from one sector (exports, non-tradables)  to another (import substitutes), from more  efficient jobs to less efficient jobs. it harms export sectors. politicians cannot "create jobs" except  using macro tools and structural reform of the labor market. otherwise, at most  they shift employed people from sector to sector.     4. so the minister of finance kahlon wants  to bring housing prices down by taxing the ownership of 3 or more apartments by  one person. by his logic, we can get even better results if we  simply have a housing ownership tax on all apartments and then use the proceeds  to help people to afford housing! (find the fallacy!)

amos  schocken is the editor of the anti-israel haaretz.  he took it over from his own father, gershom  schocken, who ran it from 1939 until 1989 after amos' grandfather bought the  paper in 1937.  gershom was moderate  compared with his pro-terror pro-jihad son.   this  week was the anniversary of the attack by the irgun (etsel) on the military  headquarters of the british in the king david hotel in 1946 before israeli  independence.  see http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac10.htm.    lots of chatter about it in the press  this week.      at  the time, gershom schocken published a condemnation of the attack in shrill  terms that included the comment that if an attack like that on the king david  were the price to be paid for israeli statehood, then maybe it was preferable to  forego it.   this a year after the shoah ended.  his son seems to think that if the price of  israeli statehood is israelis burping, then maybe it is preferable to forego  it.      i  mention this because almost every day haaretz under the hegemony of amos  schocken argues that that if mass terrorist attacks by palestinians against  jewish women and children are the price to be paid for a palestinian state, it  is worth it and only fascists would say otherwise and besides it is not  terrorism!!by the way,treason does not sell. haaretz market share is now down 1/3 to 3.9%of newspaper readers, or about 1% of all israelis.  .the residuals read it for the marker.  2.  all of israel is buzzing over the football hooligans, the creeps calling themselve la familia, the jerusalem beitar fans.i suggest that until all such hooliganism ends. all sports columns in israel be published only in talmudic aramaic...3. http://www.algemeiner.com/2016/07/26/the-times-of-israel-goes-on-a-crusade-against-israeli-binary-option-peddlers/the times of israel goes on a crusade against israeli binary-option peddlers

     the latest crisis in israeli philistinism involves the  artsy-phartsy arts "college,"   shenkar college.  seems that one  of the final projects by a student there was to make a painting of israel's  religious minister of justice ayelet shaked wearing only her smile.  see http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4830419,00.html    the philistine president of the philistine "college"  is yuli tamir, one-time minister of education and tel aviv university  professor.  she ordered the painting  removed, not because it was porno defamation of shaked but because it was disrespectful  towards all women.   huh?   and who exactly is this yuli tamir so concerned with the honor  of women?  she is a world advocate of  female circumcisions.   read all about that here:   http://www.israelnationalnews.com/blogs/message.aspx/2274   yuli tamir goes a-snipping     can the procedure be performed from the neck up?  hold on to your -- er -- hats! before pouncing upon me for posting a  tasteless spoof, let me forewarn you that this is not a spoof.  it is for  real, and any nausea you feel should be directed against the actual cause,  not your humble messenger. nevertheless you can check it all out  for yourself.  it is there in black and white. never mind that the  israeli mainstream media have hidden the story for the past 11 years, trying to  protect the rep of the labor party's daffiest leader. israel's minister of education, yael  "yuli" tamir, has campaigned publicly for the common form of female  mutilation in the third world known as "clitoridectomy."  it  means what you think it means.  "yuli," back in 1996 when  she launched her campaign, was a professor at tel aviv university and had  just joined labor.  previously she had been shulamit aloni's sidekick  in the "ratz" party.  she was in the news the past few weeks for  proposing that arab students in israel learn from textbooks that portray  israel's very existence and creation as a "naqba" or catastrophe. the "boston review" is a left-leaning  political and literary quarterly in boston, the sort "anarchists"  read.  in its summer 1996 issue it rantamir's own article  entitled, "hands off clitoridectomy."   its theme was  that all those westerners expressing revulsion at the practice of slicing up  female genitalia in certain parts of the world are themselves evil insensitive  chauvistic philistine racists.  westerners should stop criticizing and  allow the third world to carry on with its enlightened multicultural  clitorectomies.  she rants thus in the article: 'in discussions about  multiculturalism, clitoridectomy is now the trump card, taking over the role  once played by cannibalism, slavery, lynchings, or the indian tradition of  sati: "is this the kind of tradition you would like to protect?"  liberals ask embarrassed multiculturalists, who immediately qualify their  cultural pluralism. clitoridectomy defines the boundary between us and them,  between cultures we can tolerate and those we must condemn.... 'furthermore, it seems clear that  western conceptions of female beauty encourage women to undergo a wide range of  painful, medically unnecessary, and potentially damaging processes -- extreme  diets, depilation, face lifts, fat pumping, silicone implants. of course, adult  women do these things to their own bodies, and, it is said, their decisions are  freely made. but would our gut reaction to female circumcision be very  different if it were performed on consenting adults? it is not unlikely that  girls at the age of 13 or 14, who are considered in traditional societies as  adults mature enough to wed and bear children, would "consent" to the  mutilation of their bodies if they were convinced that marriage and children  were contingent on so doing. many women who followed the tradition of sati  seemed to do it as a matter of choice.... 'but our own culture fosters  false beliefs of a similar kind. according to naomi wolf's the beauty myth,  some 75 percent of women aged 18-35 believe that they are fat, whereas only 25  percent are medically overweight.1 still  more heartbreaking is the fact that the majority of the 30,000 women who  responded to a glamour questionnaire preferred losing 10-15 pounds to success  in work or in love. so the fostering of such beliefs cannot differentiate their  culture from our own and explain our hostility to it....a fulfilling sex life  is certainly one good, but there are others. ... 'my purpose, however, is not to  justify clitoridectomy, but to expose the roots of the deep hostility to it --  to reveal the smug, unjustified self-satisfaction lurking behind the current  condemnation of clitoridectomy. referring to clitoridectomy, and emphasizing  the distance of the practice from our own conventions, allows us to condemn  them for what they do to their women, support the struggle of their women  against their primitive, inhuman culture, and remain silent on the status of  women in our society.' we have a suggestion for the olmert  government.  remove the worst embarrassment in the cabinet by  performing a small procedure of snip-snip!

  the  uri weiss affair and bar ilan's cowardice  by steven  plaut     for  years the anti-israel academic left in israeli universities has defended the  "right" of anyone and everyone to boycott israel..  the bds terrorists are just exercising  freedom of speech.  so are those who  organize conferences on why israel needs to seize existing.   every  anti-semitic loon has the "right" to appear on israeli campuses, from  neo-nazi norman finkelstein to mister khmer rouge - noam chomsky.  in addition, the left wants everyone to have  the right to boycott "settlers," which is why artists and performers  who refuse to work across the green line must not be denied their cushy  governmental subsidies.  and of course  ariel university must be boycotted!   the  one thing the left will never tolerate is a boycott of violently anti-israel  leftwing academics.   students at israeli universities must themselves  never be allowed to boycott tenured traitors or radical anti-israel howling  pseudo-academics.   that would be  anti-democratic!   all  of which brings us to the uri weiss affair at bar ilan this university week.  bar ilan is usually not the campus of choice  for the leftwing ultras in israel, although it does have a few, like political  science prof menachem klein, who thinks sephardim are jewish arabs and who wants  the old city of jerusalem to be judenrein.   another  faculty member at bar ilan is one uri weiss, who studied law at the radical  leftist law school of tel aviv university and teaches a course in the bar ilan  business school.  to clarify, weiss is  not a tenure-track appointee but an outside adjunct, which in the world of  academia makes him well below the janitors in terms of status or importance.  more to the point, adjuncts who do not have a  quorum of students for their course get that course cancelled and they do not  get paid.   now  komrade uri has been in the news a lot in recent days.  in particular he published ghoulish attacks  against settlers whose children were murdered by terrorists.  http://www.timesofisrael.com/anger-at-bar-ilan-lecturer-who-accused-settlers-of-psychosis/   the settlers not only deserved to see their  children murdered but are themselves guilty of psychosis for living in places  the palestinians want.  never mind that  the palestinians also want the sarona market in tel aviv.      weiss accused idf soldiers of committing "war crimes" when they  raided the gaza-bound mavi marmara terror ship in 2010.  the flotilla's goal according to him was "to  break through a combination of a cruel naval and land siege imposed on an  entire population." he also praised controversial arab joint list mk hanin  zoabi, who was aboard the ship and last week caused a furor in the knesset when  she accused idf soldiers of committing murder during the raid.  weiss has  published trash on the neo-nazi web magazine "counterpunch" accusing  israel's supreme court of "engaging in apartheid."  see http://www.counterpunch.org/2010/01/28/apartheid-at-the-israeli-high-court/ .    in the past, in 2014, in response to his  cheerleading for terror, students demanded that they be allowed to drop his  course and swap it for a different course with someone else.  back then, bar ilan agreed.  http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/1.2386146    but bar ilan quietly let him sneak back in,  until his comments this week.  bar ilan  students led by im tirtzu zionists demanded that the university allow them to  boycott the course.  the problem is at  this point in the summer the course is done and there is just the exam to take.  the university proposed as compromise that  the students who so requested should be allowed to opt out of the exam and just  take a "pass" as their course grade.   that way the students could still be boycotting the pro-terror  anti-israel lecturer.  freedom to boycott  - just what the loony left says it wants.   ah but then the radical academics together with  haaretz went on the war path.  why should  these students claim the right not to be indoctrinated in anti-israel  hate!  isn't that why we have israeli  universities in the first place?   bar ilan's courage lasted less than 24  hours.  it then cancelled the deal with  the exam and ordered students in the course to take it after all. http://www.iba.org.il/bet/?type=1&entity=1170438    and so the bottom line is this:  in israel thou must not boycott leftwing  dingbat faculty members nor get their propaganda courses shut down!!

1.  don't you hate it when this happens?in the mid-1960s came the eureka moment the conspiracists had long awaited. at last they had found a yemenite child who had been put up for illicit adoption to an ashkenazi family, one from bulgaria, well probably ashkenazi cause some bulgarian jews are sephardic. the girl was named miriam shukar. she had been born to yemenite parents in a maabara transit camp, albeit well after the 1950-1 period when all the "kidnappings" were supposed to take place, and the girl was in the hospital before being adopted.gotcha, bellow the conspiracy nuts. prima facie proof.or is it?shukar's parents were in the process of getting divorced. the baby was placed for adoption behind the back of the father but evidently not that of the mother. the adoption was deemed legit by the commission of inquiry into the "kidnapping." miriam grew up and traced her biological parents to meet them. the case was kicked around the media as proof that there were all sorts of other illicit adoptions. no one has found any, although a handful of legit adoptions occurred. if miriam's adoption was illicit, the problem was the adoption procedure and law in the 1960s and exploitation of it by parents in a divorce conflict, not a grand conspiracy by ashkenazim who were too stupid to know that the orphanages of israel were full of ashkenazi orphans waiting for a home.no kidnapping. no conspiracy.2.   loon alert - you first heard it here:it is only a question of time before the yemen-kidnap-conspiracy nuts start comparing dismissal of their "theory" to holocaust denial.3.   shifra shvarts, of ben gurion university, who has researched the early years of israel's medical system, said that she never found "even a shred of evidence" that there was any systematic kidnapping. "i have examined some 30,000-40,000 files form that period," she said. "it is inconceivable that, if so many babies had indeed been kidnapped, i would not have found even a single document that proves it. but i did not." she did find "doctors, nurses, and patients who came from different countries and cultures and could not even communicate in a common language, and almost total chaos."ami hovav, a private investigator who served the first two commissions that examined the fate of the yemenite babies, also said "there were no kidnappings." speaking on an israeli tv program in 2013, hovav said that he'd investigated 650 cases of missing babies, and he was unable to solve 80 of those cases; the rest of the babies died, "except for a few dozen who were put up for adoption when their parents could not be traced.""i myself am a yemenite," he said. "i wanted to find justice. but i never found even a hint of the kidnappings. babies were transferred from nurseries and hospitals, with staff and patients who couldn't speak the same language."http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/194601/disappeared-yemenite-babies4.  http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4825751,00.htmlphoto: david eldan / gpo'yemenite children affair' report made available onlineoh dear oh dear oh dear!what about kidnappings? what about conspiracies?report tells about anarchic record keeping in 1950. not a single kidnapping! no conspiracy!  not even any dingos.remind me again - who told you so?conspiracy nuts now to shut up and dine on hats? yeah, sure
