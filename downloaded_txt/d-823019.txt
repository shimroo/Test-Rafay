join us for a night of ukulele goodness!food, music, art, and celebrations from three fine ukulele-based singer-songwriters: boone graham, amy kucharik and katie sachs! come early for some beans and rice. music starts at 7:30. $5 - 10 suggested cover donation for the artists.about the artistsamy kucharik (/kuh-char-ick/) drawing from blues and dixieland traditions and with a street-smart stagecraft honed in the subways of boston, amy’s “modern vintage” grooves have earned her comparisons to lake street dive, maria muldaur and the asylum street spankers. the 2015 kerrville new folk winning songwriter explores the full range of her ukulele, both exploiting and defying its reputation as a novelty instrument. her catchy, sexy, sometimes haunting lyrics recount tales of reluctant love, heartbreak, revenge, and grit. texas outside said amy “…stole the show with the light, upbeat sounds of her instrument and voice against the dark humor of her lyrics.”katie sachs: katiesachs.com. grassrootsmusicservices.comwith a sound that draws influence from jazz, new wave and folk, katie explores complex melodies and rarely discussed subject matter (everything from golgi apparatuses, to the foster care system, and even a love song to her vocal chords!) her voice has been described as having “a deliciously pure tone, with a calculated warble that displays a creamy melodic integrity.” katie released her much awaited sophomore album “the giantness of little things” in april 2015. involved in this project were such notable musicians as wilson marks (new folks finalist, the loveleighs) brannen temple (chaka kahn, bonnie raitt, the dixie chicks) and andrew pressman (raina rose, ben kweller). she is currently based out of austin, tx and has toured extensively across the united states.boone graham: boone is a music teacher and performing songwriter with a passion for growing and learning through music. boone has been sharing songs and leading bands for over 16 years. his writing is inspired by and compaired to the likes of daniel johnston, leonard cohen, they might be giants and jonathan richman among others.
