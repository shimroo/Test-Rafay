"martin and vanessa are superlative professionals, and i can't recommend them highly enough!"
martin took on my case for a flat rate and guaranteed a full refund if he couldn't reverse the suspension. three weeks later, my license was fully restored!


john l.





"mr. martin a. kron & associates is very professional, direct, and responsive."
mr. kron and his firm delivered results way beyond my expectations. job well done and worth the money!!


elie





"one week later my ticket was dismissed."
great decision+great attorney=great result


scott





"attentive, grade a service"
i recently retained martin and his son dan to handle a dui for me as i was incredibly worried that one big mistake was going to haunt me for the rest of my life. i called multiple attorneys and though their fee was by no means the lowest it came in right around the middle of all the quotes i had received. what i felt i got from them was attentive and grade a service though. from the beginning, dan was very reassuring and set me at ease. we discussed my case and came up with a plan for how we would proceed. over the course of the multiple appearances that i had to make he was always there at the right time, saying the right thing, and in general acting like he had my back. in addition, whenever i called the office for updates his assistant was super helpful and whenever i spoke to him or martin, they were super generous with their time. in the end, they obtained as good an outcome as i could have ever wished for! i am very grateful to all their hard work and the professional and friendly demeanor they maintained through this entire travail. i cannot recommend them enough!


michael





"would highly recommend, thank you again!"
the ny dmv can be difficult to navigate, i am so glad that i called martin a. kron & associates. vanessa and the team resolved a difficult situation for my family in a matter of days.


anthony





"martin is the perfect person for this job."
as a former nys traffic law judge and having previously sat where the judges before him now sit, martin is the perfect person for this job. besides a plethora of experience on and off the bench, he's kind and honest, he listens and is attentive to your concerns, is straightforward and most importantly, gives out reasonable expectations. he always returns phone calls in a timely manner and makes himself accessible even on weekends. and to top it off, he even has a sense of humor. hope i never have to hire him again, but if the situation arises, he's my go-to guy!


margie





"i will never deal with another attorney again."
i experienced a very difficult situation between the states of new york as well as new jersey where i was potentially facing a 6-month suspension of my license. aside from the fact that i live 6 hours from new jersey, i was in dire need of professional expertise to ensure that my situation was handled as well as possible. i spoke with a number of attorney's and decided to hire martin; and will never deal with another attorney again. martin was extremely friendly, offered great advice and support and ultimately helped me to have all of the charges thrown out with my case being dropped.as we all know, no one can promise or guarantee the same outcome. however, if you want the best chance to receive the best possible outcome, martin kron and his team are your only option.


matt





"the best decision i made."
i highly recommend martin kron & associates. i had a great experience. a good friend recommended me to marty last year when i received a speeding ticket in nyc. marty knows the process extremely well, listened & answered all of my questions, and ultimately got my ticket dismissed. in addition, during the past 20 months, when i had questions regarding the adjournments and processes, all of the people in his office were extremely responsive, professional and great at answering all of my questions. before getting the referral to marty, i called a few other traffic law firms that i found online to possibly handle the ticket. they all sounded like ticket factories with no real service and no real people behind you. having marty or one of his attorneys representing you in nyc traffic court was the best decision i made and is 100% the right answer. i got a great result and felt that i had the a-team on my side. if you get a traffic ticket in nyc, i would call martin kron...
