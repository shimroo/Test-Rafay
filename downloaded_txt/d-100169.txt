an experienced real estate agent like no other!
















i find homes... let me be your real estate detective.
for me, it is all about quality - not quantity. in order to give you the best possible edge, i work with only a few clients at a time. my devotion is to provide customized service to each client so the outcome of my efforts to locate, purchase and/or sell a property will always exceed client expectations. this is, and always will be, the cornerstone of my client referral based business. when i'm not selling real estate, i lend a hand to all animals who come past my door. the problems of the world are large, but they diminish in size with every act of kindness we bestow.

"our good friend kerrin shettle, aka auntie kerrin, worked with my wife janell & i for two years to find and finance a piece of rural property that met our needs. numerous offers were made & documents exchanged by the fistful.
when we finally had a successful bid, she worked with our lender to successfully finance our ca property & refinance our existing home.when we decided to sell years later, she was once again successfully attending to every detail. the time in between she was our friend & a frequent visitor to our ranch in santa rosa. a fellow animal lover, with a work ethic like our own & just a bundle of energy for whatever project was at hand be it business or pleasure."~ don munsch (u.s. army retired)
