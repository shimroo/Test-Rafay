visitor info & guidelines

stroller policy
limited space and usda containment requirements limit our ability to have strollers or wagons in the butterfly house, including the tropical conservatory. we strongly encourage the use of baby slings or carriers as alternatives to strollers when visiting the butterfly house.
if you require an accommodation, please consider using a smaller, lightweight “umbrella” stroller. the immersive nature of our exhibit areas do not easily accommodate oversize, side-by-side, double-seated, or jogging strollers.
accessibility
the butterfly house and its pathways are fully accessible to guests who use the assistance of a wheelchair, walker, or scooter.  there are benches throughout the facility where guests to sit to admire the beauty all around them. the butterfly house has a limited number of wheelchairs available for guests to borrow, during their visit. 
service animals, as defined by the ada's definition, are allowed at the butterfly house. pets, emotional support animals, comfort animals, and therapy dogs are not allowed on the butterfly house grounds.  


















sophia m. sachs butterfly house
the butterfly house is home to over 60 tropical butterfly species and over 150 tropical plants, in our enclosed 8,000 square foot tropical conservatory.  this breath-taking garden habitat, combined with the beauty of the butterflies, is the heart of the butterfly house. the entire facility, which also includes an insect zoo, classrooms, theater space, and a seasonal native butterfly garden, is open year round.  the butterfly house does close briefly, each january, for annual maintenance 
named in honor of sophia m. sachs, the widow of sam sachs, founder of sachs electric co., and mother-in-law to developer louis sachs.  louis was known as the "father of modern chesterfield".  mrs. sachs retained her wonder of discovery until her death in may 1999.  she shared that beauty with children of all ages through life.  this facility is named in honor of her generous spirit.
the butterfly house opened on september 18, 1998, with the founders evelyn e. newman, lucy lopata, linda penniman, caroline loughlin, and charles a. lowenhaupt leading the vision. in july 2001, the butterfly house became a division of the missouri botanical garden.  the butterfly house became the first facility dedicated to insects to be accredited by the association of zoos and aquariums (aza), in 2003.
