student life































the division of student life


at villanova university













"become what you are not yet"






villanovans take these words of saint augustine to heart, challenging themselves and each other to step outside their comfort zones, push boundaries and learn who they truly are. while intellectual growth is the hallmark of a villanova education, nurturing and developing the whole person is equally valued. villanova supports students throughout their journey, helping them to realize their full potential by providing opportunities to engage, serve and ignite change.
