1903





september 17: u.s. steel products export co. organized with
 james a. farrell, currently general sales agent for american steel & wire co., named
 general manager of sales.
through farrell's friendship with j.t. lilly, the senior manager in the new york
 office of norton & co., one of the foremost shipping agents of the day, farrell
 began to place his steel cargos and charter salt water which eventually led to the
 organization of his own british flag shipping company. the norton agency worked
 symbiotically with the british bucknall brothers and federal steam navigation
 co., managed by allan hughes. the first major orders were for railway equipment.
upon receipt of a contract with the government of chile
 for railway equipment, working through lilly, u.s. steel products export co.bought
 controlling interest in charles g. dunn & co., ltd., 12 africa house, water st., 
 liverpool which immediately placed two of it's ships, the 
 foxton hall and newton hall,
 under "time charter" on farrell's new new york - south american service as the 
 "new york & south american line".
as trade to south america continued to expand, c.g. dunn & co. built four more 
 ships, the charlton hall, craster hall, howick hall and crofton hall,
 especially for "time-chartering" to u.s. steel export co. on the 
 "new york & south american line".









1910





farrell, having developed steel sales in vancouver, bc, established the
 "new york & vancouver line" via the straits of magellan, primarily to guarantee return 
 cargos from south america.
all of the "lines", were in name only, just trade names as none owned any vessels.
august 10: james a. farrell named president of u.s. steel corporation. from that 
 position which he occupied for decades, he continued to support the activities of the 
 isthmian line. the opening of the canal had fueled plans of  many companies to enter 
 shipping, isthmian being a prime example.
isthmian steamship co., ltd., 2 fenchurch ave., london, england, organized 
 by u.s. steel corporation with a capital of 100,000 pounds to operate under the 
 british flag, it's own vessels and others it chartered as needed. isthmian was a wholly
 owned british subsidiary of u.s. steel products export co.
federal steam navigation co., whose history went back to 1782, was also located 
at 2 fenchurch and managed isthmian's one ship. the isthmian flag, a white cross of 
st. george on a field of blue with a red diamond in the center of the cross, was taken 
from the federal flag. on the american side, the company was managed by the norton 
lilly agency, lilly having been made a partner of the firm. actually isthmian was six 
extra accountants at norton lilly who ran the fleet.
the name was chosen in honor of the panama canal, whose opening scheduled 
for 1914 was expected to provide new opportunities. the line was a creation of 
james a. farrell, sr., the chief of the export subsidiary of u.s. steel, who ahead of 
anyone else, realized the key to steel exports lay in providing cheap and reliable 
ocean transportation. between 1902 and 1904 the corporation's exports quadrupled, 
soon to represent 10% of its total sales. farrell used ships of any status for the 
transport of his steel cargos. it was the need for reliable and low cost shipping that 
moved farrell to establish isthmian and other lines such as new york and south 
american, american and cuban, united states and brazil. farrell said the first isthmian 
ships were purchased to carry out contracts overseas, principally for railway materials, 
and for economic distribution of supplies to distant warehouses.
the line loaded the parent company's steel cargoes for india, returning profitable 
jute and burlap on the return voyage. isthmian closely associated with the ellerman 
line, which secured the return cargoes from india in exchange for a portion of the 
steel freight. during its first years isthmian operated more like a collection of "tramp" 
vessels, because as a proprietary company, the ships sailed to one port or another 
anywhere in the world where steel had to be carried.
bantu, 1901, 4230 tons, acquired from bucknall ss lines, ltd., london, 
england for 24,000 pounds.
a subsidiary line, the new york and south american line, was also formed by 
james a. farrell, sr. of u.s. steel to transport iron and steel for the development of the
chilean railroad system. as a private carrier, a large portion of the southbound cargo 
was for the owner's account. remaining cargo space was sold to the public. 
northbound shipments were rarely a problem, as space for nitrate and ores was 
at a premium.









1911





kentra, 1907, 4683 tons, acquired from kentra ss co., ltd., (japp & kirby), 
liverpool, england.

used in 1913.









1914





san francisco, 1914, 5102 tons, acquired new from n. of ireland shipbuilding 
co., ltd., londonderry, ireland.during the first years, isthmian operated more like a 
collection of tramp vessels, which sailed  wherever and whenever steel had to be carried.
the "maple leaf line" ran from new york around cape horn, up the west coast of 
south america to vancouver then to avonmouth or swansea, england.
the following vessels were acquired from c.g. dunn & co., ltd., liverpool, 
england:

with the outbreak of world war i, all british flagged ships are requisitioned by 
england. this brings about the end of the london based company. a new 
company is formed, united states steel products co., 30 church street,new york, 
new york and all vessels transferred to  u.s. flag due to the relaxation of 
congress' "free ship" policy, the "ship registry bill of 1914". these were subsequently 
requisitioned by the u.s. government.

1920





the following vessels, named for southern cities, were acquired new from chickasaw 
sb. & car co., chickasaw, alabama:

birmingham city, 1920, 6194 tons, acquired
chickasaw city, 1920, 6196 tons, acquired.
ensley city, 1920, 6157 tons, acquired.
mobile city, 1920, 6157 tons, acquired.
montgomery city, 1920, 5686 tons, acquired.
tuscaloosa city, 1920, 5687 tons, acquired.
these vessels, based on u.s. shipping board design 1037,  were constructed to a 
special design primarily for the carrying of odd shaped steel products, with heavy booms 
capable of lifting 30 tons. provisions were also made for the carrying of liquid cargo in bulk.

the following vessels, named for phases of activity in steel, were acquired new from 
federal shipbuilding co., kearny, new jersey:

steel age, 1920, 6188 tons, acquired.
steel engineer, 1920, 5687 tons, acquired.
steel exporter, 1920, 5687 tons, acquired.

benjamin watson greer of the canadian pacific railway met u.s. steel and their 
subsidiary isthmian ss co. who were initiating an inter-coastal service. greer 
subsequently left cpr to establish his own steamship agency, greer shipping ltd., 
on behalf of the isthmian line.
january 31: brand new steelmaker departs on maiden voyage for 
vancouver with cargo of steel; capt. george wright, master, john van sneiden, jr., 
chief mate.
march 1: steel age departs on maiden voyage from new york under capt. 
longbottom, loaded with steel for callao, cinca, iqueque and valparaiso.
during the 1920's isthmian active in "intercoastal" trade from atlantic and gulf ports 
to hawaii. initially this alarmed matson but soon when isthmian did not try to ship for the 
west coast, in the late 1920s the two companies made a joint agreement to share 
hawaii-mainland freight traffic.
early in the 1920's farrell organized the seas 
shipping co., first chartering then buying shipping board freighters at rock bottom 
prices. this "robin line" was organized because farrell still needed more ships to satisfy 
u.s. steel's requirements.









1921





the following vessels were acquired new from chickasaw sb. & car co., 
chickasaw, alabama:

anniston city, 1921, 5687 tons, acquired.

late in the year, james farrell's two sons, john and james, along with john m. franklin, 
organize the argonaut line to carry even more u.s. steel cargo.
december 29: in liverpool, the master of the chickasaw city 
george a. saunders disappears, never to be seen again.









1923





the following vessels were acquired new from federal shipbuilding co., kearny, 
new jersey:

steelmotor, 1923, 1695 tons, acquired.
steelvendor, 1923, 1695 tons, acquired.
these motorships were designed primarily for service on the great lakes and adapted 
for use in the coastwise trade during the winter months. these vessels were originally 
intended for the pittsburgh steamship co. of cleveland, oh but were taken over by 
isthmian who opened an office in cleveland for their operation.

even with this large fleet, frequently the line chartered vessels, as many as 20, to 
meet all of the needs of the parent company. intercoastal trade alone kept 15 ships 
fully occupied carrying steel westbound to pacific states, returning with lumber. 
the remaining vessels were engaged in trade to the east and west coast of south 
america, the far east and phillipine islands, the mediterranean, red sea, india and the 
persian gulf.concentration on providing regular sailings on established routes 
throughout the world, still running tramp voyages when necessary to move a 
shipload of steel.
until the general trade slump in the early 30's, isthmian had often chartered vessels 
during the 20's from seas shipping in the intercoastal trade and sometimes on other runs. 
these were the the robin adair, robin goodfellow, robin gray and 
robin hood, four freighters built during the close of ww i by skinner & eddy at 
seattle. these vessels became a "reserve fleet" for u.s. steel, providing the flexibility 
needed to meet extra demands.
isthmian is the largest intercoastal carrier in terms of cargo tonnage.
crofton hall converted from coal to fuel oil.









1924





chickasaw city, the last vessel of the new fleet converted from coal to fuel; 
now all new vessels are oil burners.









1926





the following vessels were acquired new from federal shipbuilding co., kearny, 
new jersey:

steel chemist, 1926, 1694 tons, acquired.
steel electrician, 1926, 1694 tons, acquired.










1927





june 19: craster hall, lost after collision with s.s. reginolite at 
talara point, peru; 40 on board, 0 lives lost.
since the end of ww i, isthmian had been making about four sailings annually 
to india and, with slowly rising cargo volumes, wanted to increase it number of sailings. 
the roosevelt line, claiming isthmian's close association with the british, protested, 
claiming this would in effect reduce the previously agreed upon american share of 
india service below 25%. the british contingent of cunard and ellerman refused to 
reduce its sailings to accomodate isthmian's request and began to freeze roosevelt 
line out of cargo. in retaliation, in december roosevelt slashed its rates in half, 
triggering a rate war.
isthmian ss co.'s underquoting of steel prices on the west coast forces bethlehem 
steel to enter the intercoastal trade with the establishment of the calmar steamship co. 
bethlehem had been operating ore carriers since before world war i through a 
subsidiary, the ore steamship co. unlike ore steamship, calmar was proprietary 
only on the westbound leg, while on eastbound voyages it was a common or public 
carrier, soliciting cargo from shippers, generally pacific lumber companies.

1928





in spite of the india rate war, isthmian's continued insistence on increasing its 
sailings forces a prompt settlement in early august. by agreement, the us retains its 
25% share of the total, now increased to 72, allowing isthmian 2 extra, without 
reducing the sailings of the roosevelt line.farrell, with sons james jr. and john 
and arthur lewis, bids for shipping board ships operated by ernest m. bull. 
with a high bid of $780,019.50, they win and organize the america and south african 
line, with the assurance of outbound steel and general cargo through u.s. steel 
products; this is the forerunner of the farrell line.









1929





with the roosevelt line fearing isthmian would not live up to the agreement and 
seek additional sailings, a new york - india conference is established on january 1. 
before this conference could stabilize to route, the great depression intervened, 
disrupting world shipping.june 25: bantu leaves new york on final voyage 
under a.a. lang. for valparaiso. after discharge of cargo, sold to p. hadjilias & others, 
syra, greece; renamed orpheus.
charlton hall sold to m. kulukundis, syra, greece; renamed atlantis.
howick hall sold to exeter shipping co., ltd., london, england; renamed 
dovenden.
santa rosalia sold to elias g. culucundis and stephen c. costomeni, 
athens, greece; renamed stefanos costomenis.
it was noteworthy that in this period of massive subsidies from the shipping board, 
isthmian operated successfully without subsidy, remaining strong enough to engage 
in rate wars, most noteably new york - india.
john mcauliffe, former traffic manager of the new york central railroad, becomes

1930





january 30: after the crash of the stock market in 1929, with the slump in steel orders 
and the search for cargos, it seemed prudent to separate the cargo allocating subsidiary 
of the steel corporation from its deep water sea shipping operation. thus, isthmian 
steamship co. is organized as a delaware corporation with capital stock of $10,000,000 
divided into 100,000 shares values at $100 each. all except 30 shares are owned by u.s. 
steel corp. the new company, free of any legal connection with the steel products co. 
could call itself a "common carrier", transporting mail, passengers and any goods.
the company splits into two, the existing united states steel products co., 30 church
street, new york, new york and the new isthmian steamship co., 50 trinity place,
new york, new york.
united states steel products co. retains:

steel chemist

shipping board accepts bids for the 52 vessels assigned to the dixie and lykes 
steamship lines. on april 18 lykes submits an offer for these ships. with breakneck 
speed, the shipping board approves the sale on the next day. this sale had not been 
advertised nor had any bids been solicited or received. the files later revealed that an 
offer by isthmian to purchase the ships in the gulf - far east service had been ignored, 
and many other irregularities appeared. this sale attracted the attention of the special 
senate investigative committee, although prosecution was not pursued. the succeeding 
shipping board bureau did retain 9 of these vessels.
new york - india conference disolved in december due to the cutthroat competition 
that had erupted as a result of the great depression. the kerr line, now under british 
control, shifted some of its empty ships to the new york - india run, quoting rates 
one-third lower.
james d. dole of the hawaiian pineapple company, the largest shipper of that 
product, unhappy over the escalating rates of the matson line, attempts to arrange a 
contract with isthmian steamship company for eastbound cargoes. isthmian was willing 
to try. with the arrival of the depression, dole lost control of the company to castle and 
cook, a major stockholder in the matson line. obviously, isthmian was no longer 
considered as a viable shipper.

the kerr line withdraws from the new york - india run, following cunard, leaving 
only the ellerman and roosevelt lines on the new york - india route, except for the 
less frequent sailings of isthmian, also hit hard by the great depression.
the shipping board considers consolidating the roosevelt, now a subsidiary of 
i.m.m., and isthmian sailings into a single india service. for a number of factors, i.m.m.'s 
protests, lack of trade volume, etc., this never occurred.

				the steel worker was known as a hell ship. two entire crews had
				deserted between new york and the panama canal. conditions were bad and
				moral terrible. according to louis,
				the scotch steward on the steel worker kept all the money he could
				save on the food, so we had curry, rice and fried potatoes 3 times a
				day for 3 weeks; once in a while they'd get some tapioca pudding.
				the crew objected and got the menu changed a little but the mate got
				down on louis because he was the one who spoke up.
				
				the chief mate of the steel worker was leonard duks. duks
				"was a naturalized citizen... a russian actually...."
				nobody on the ship liked him, including the officers.	"they were very
				hesitant, they wouldn't speak about it of course but
				you could tell by their attitude they didn't. ... he was a tall slim
				fellow and i believe he was essentially a coward. ... he was a petty man
				and kept digging at the crew in petty ways." louis said that if hed
				had an argument with the engineer on the steel worker you could ask
				him to come off on the dock and he would have gone with you. not [duks],
				he wouldn't have done it in this world."'

meet the emergency of a possible war, isthmian charters 73 additional ships to assist 
with the job. during this time isthmian vessels brought to the us more than 60% of the 
total amount of crude rubber imported from the far east, to say nothing of the heavy 
tonnages of pig tin, jute, tungsten ore, antimony and other vital products.

isthmian, in a joint venture with the matson line, serves gulf and east coast ports with 
hawaiian cargoes, primarily the annual sugar crop. freight rate increases of 20% in 
1947 and 10% in 1948 failed to put the service in the black. these raises left both 
island importers and sugar shippers unhappy and looking for alternate methods of transport.
isthmian ss listed as a member of the gulf associated freight conferences, 1932 - 1964.

in january, of the 24 c-3s, 8 maintain a round the world service sailing westbound. 
seven others serve the indian trade, 3 the persian gulf, 3 more trade eastbound through 
the suez canal to indonesia and malaya. the remaining 3 maintain service to the hawaiian 
islands in cooperation with matson. the 4 older vessels work intercoastwise, shuttling back 
and forth through the panama canal between the atlantic and pacific coasts.
january: all far east and india cargo transferred to erie basin by the end of the month.
isthmian refuses terms offered by marine engineer's beneficial association (meba), 
breaking a strike by manning their ships with members of the brotherhood of marine

u.s. steel begins to have doubts about keeping its own fleet of vessels, partly 
because steel cargoes were declining as other countries set up their own steel mills 
and began to supply nearby countries as well.
with the embarrassment incurred when it becomes public the new york state 
crime commission found the president of the isthmian line had received a $20,000 
gift from a mob-ridden stevedoring firm, internal morale is affected and u.s. steel 
begins to look for a buyer for its fleet.

1956





name of company changed to isthmian lines, inc.
march 6: isthmian lines, inc. purchased for an estimated $30 million from u.s. steel 
by states marine corporation. in retrospect, u.s. steel had made a good business 
decision in disposing of its obsolete fleet, thereby avoiding altogether the problem of 
replacing its break-bulk vessels. this acquisition hit shipping circles "like a bombshell" 
because it was the largest single shipping purchase in memory. physical transfer of the 
fleet was expected to be completed by the end of the month. ralph blough, chariman 
of the board of u.s. steel, explained that u.s. steel's need for these ships was over. 
the addition of isthmian's 24 vessels makes states marine the largest unsubsidized 
u.s. flag firm and came close to challenging u.s. lines in size. henry mercer, president 
of states marine, seeing increasing demand for u.s. flagged tonnage, was acquiring a 
fast fleet to supplant their heavy use of "time chartered" ships. plus, they acquired 
isthmian's world wide web of agents and contacts with resources and a reputation 
for service unexcelled in the international shipping business.
march 7: isthmian president, vice admiral glenn b. davis retires, suceeded by 
archibald king who had been with isthmian since 1938. the sale was simply a change 
in ownership, not in management.
with states marine's pending application with the u.s. maritime commission for 
an operational differential subsidy for four cargo services, plus plans to build 30 new 
cargo liners at a cost of $232,000,000 over the next 15 years and ready to begin  the first 
6 for $42,000,000 contingent upon the award of the subsidy, things looked very bright.
at the time of the purchase, isthmian was exclusively siu and states marine 
exclusively nmu.









1958





in june of 1956 matson lines, looking for new trade routes, had incorporated a 
new subsidiary company, matson orient line, applying to the federal maritime board 
for an operating differential subsidiary to operate between atlantic coast ports and the 
far east via the panama canal. additionally, approval was sought for purchase of 
eight 20 knot "mariner" type vessels to operate the route. in 1958 the application was 
changed to be a venture operated jointly with isthmian lines utilizing six c-3 vessels. 
at the conclusion of 1959 the application was still pending.

				'what a shock to see of the ship i rode on as a little girl on a trip
				from new york to manila in 1958! that is such a neat photo of the
				ss steel executive. we came close to losing our lives during a
				typhoon while crossing the pacific. i've often wondered if anyone has
				access to the log of that trip. our captain, who had traveled that
				route many times, said that he was unsure if we were going to make it.
				we traveled through the eye and the winds slacked off. the captain
				attempted to turn around because we'd made no progress for three days,
				but the winds returned and we were caught again in the grip of the storm.
				
				the panama canal was the highlight of the trip-watching the parrots and
				tropical birds was memorable.
				
				i was asked to give a talk to the children at our church about my trip
				as a child to be a missionary to the phillipines, and we googled the
				"ss steel executive" and found your site - voila, it looks like the real thing.
				
				again, thanks for posting the photos and bringing back my memories.'

isthmian and matson lines, in an uneasy joint venture, carrying sugar to gulf and 
atlantic ports, moving about 25% of the sugar crop, satisfying no one.

1923 - 1984.









1960





randolph sevier, president of the matson line, seeks acquisitons 
or mergers with isthmian, along with u.s. lines, states lines, luckenbach steamship 
and others. in the end, nothing was produced from any of these negotiations.









1961





isthmian lines, inc. moves to 90 broad st., new york, new york
california & hawaiian sugar co., a cooperative that refined and marketed the island's 
crop, canceled its contract with the matson-isthmian combination for the transport of 
raw sugar to gulf and atlantic ports, handing the business to reynolds aluminium co.
in a matson line study, total cargo handling costs increased 167% from 
1946 - 1961 while vessel operating costs per day went up 115% in same period.









1964





for nearly 30 years matson had run a joint freighter service to hawaii 
with isthmian from the east coast and gulf of mexico. after long arguments with castle & 
cooke, a major matson stockholder, over pineapple rates to gulf and atlantic ports, on 
april 30th matson cancelled the arrangement with isthmian. the cargo would move 
overland across the u.s. to west coast ports for loading into matson containerships, 
leaving a scorned isthmian with empty and increasing obsolete freighters. isthmian 
decides to carry on alone.
isthmian lines listed as member of the far east conference (fec), 1920 - 1984.

isthmian concludes that carrying pineapple to gulf and atlantic ports really hadn't 
been such good business after all. abruptly they cancel the service, sending dole 
pineapple back to matson ships, at least for a while. the last isthmian ships depart 
hawaiian ports:

				"through my father's contacts, capt. donnelly, the marine superintendent
				of isthmian lines, hired me as a third mate in the ss knoxville city on
				august 1, 1930. i say 'in' the ss knoxville city. people say 'on' ships
				but that's wrong. she was one of a type of good ships built about 1922
				by u.s. steel, owners of isthmian lines, at their yards in anniston and
				mobile, alabama and in liner service from new york to india. they were
				over 400 feet long, about 8,000 tons, and made twelve knots. hatch number
				five was in an uncovered well deck. two large doors at the after end of
				hatch number four could be removed, which reduced the cubic capacity of
				the ship and the tolls paid in the panama and suez canals. these ships
				were the first to have gyro compasses because of the effects of the steel
				cargoes on magnetic compasses. in some there was a separate room for the
				gyro. in others it was in the after end of the saloon, or officer's
				dining room. we were in liner service to india. i transferred to the
				ss fairfield city as third mate, then to the ss steel engineer as second
				mate. promotions were slow. even after getting my chief mate's and
				master's licenses, i was still sailing as second mate in 1936."
