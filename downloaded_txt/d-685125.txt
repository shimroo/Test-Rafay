explore jacksonville

welcome
to jacksonville, nc - the city where heroes are born and train. jacksonville is
the proud home of camp lejeune, the largest marine corps base in the eastern
united states. jacksonville is one of the fastest-growing cities in the
country, in part thanks to camp lejeune, camp geiger, and the new river air
station. jacksonville’s largest employers are the military and the board of
education, but health care and customer service call centers are growing
fields. jacksonville is set along the new river, and activities include
fishing, paddling, swimming, running, and more. there is no shortage of
athletic challenges, from road races to soccer and softball tournaments.
jacksonville’s dining scene offers multicultural flavors, coffee shops, and
craft brews. take time to wander through the lejeune memorial gardens to learn
about our military heritage and honor veterans. hospitality, a patriotic
spirit, and military heritage thrive in jacksonville.
