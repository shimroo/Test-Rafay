red flag parking
to increase public safety, the fire department and department of transportation have created a program to remove illegally parked vehicles in posted locations within the very high fire hazard severity zones. the goal of this program is to educate the public on the potential hazards associated with a fast-moving brush fire, and the importance of keeping roadways clear.

brush
the canyons of los angeles are always a challenge in terms of fire safety. in addition to obvious brushy hillsides, there are multiple types of fire hazards that exist because of ornamental vegetation. the los angeles fire department works year-round to ensure those with this type of shrubbery obey the fire code relative to clearance and care.
