slip ring brushes
replace worn brushes on fabricast slip rings or design our silver graphite leaf and plunger brushes into your application. common uses include low noise instrumentation and power applications with brush grades for various environments.
custom slip rings




custom slip rings are required for applications in which a stock fabricast slip ring does not meet the customer requirements. these custom slip rings are built using standard tooling to the customers specifications and requirements.

fabricast designs and manufactures precision slip rings for instrumentation & power applications. slip rings are electromechanical components used to transmit electrical signals (e.g. analog, digital, ethernet, video, thermocouple, strain gage, etc.) and power across a rotating interface. stock slip ring units are available for a wide range of industrial, commercial, and military applications.
