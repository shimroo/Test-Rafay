"to encounter a friend is always a joy," is the message at amici. you will feel like a friend at this warm and inviting family style italian restaurant. the friendly greeting from co-owner francesco iacono is genuine and so are the dishes his father pasquale iacono creates. we pay close attention to details that result in fine quality dishes. we take great pride in our cooking and service.
