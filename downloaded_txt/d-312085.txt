"i believe eric is one of the 
    premier christian apologists traveling the country today."

- rev. bob fort, chairman, united evangelical churches
"eric barger is one of the most 
    knowledgeable defenders of the faith on the christian scene today. equally 
    important, he is a down-to-earth effective communicator who is able to make 
    complex ideas understandable to the average person. but even more important 
    is the fact that everything he has to offer is thoroughly grounded in the 
    word of god."
- dr. david r. reagan (www.lamblion.com)
"we have invited eric to speak 23 
    times since 1987. i highly recommend his ministry."
- pastor milton hubbard
"eric's articulate presentation of 
    carefully researched information is solidly based in scripture and 
    life-changing in its impact."
- pastor jim keys
"over the years we have had eric at 
    our church many times. we have always found his ministry to be balanced and 
    to the point. he has helped our church stay focused and walk in the will of 
    god."
-  pastor sam buckingham
