 business empowerment 




























        how a small business can be a big success.    small, minority and women-owned businesses are vital to san antonio’s economic health, to general business expansion and to the community at large. nevertheless, at certain stages of development, these small businesses need the support and help of a knowledgeable team.that’s why we created the business empowerment plan. this plan provides growing businesses access to people and organizations that are ready to help:

city of san antonio economic development department
alamo colleges – economic & workforce development: corporate college
south central texas regional certification agency (sctrca)

the business empowerment plan is structured in two phases.
phase i is the small business education boot camp. phase ii consists of two programs – the mentor protégé program and the bonding assistance program. these programs bring together the best of business development organizations, professionals and business community members to help small businesses build capacity and make a big impact on south texas.disclaimer
participation in the city of san antonio’s bonding assistance and/or mentor-protégé program is neither a guarantee of obtaining bonds or contracting opportunities; nor is it a promise of business. but rather it is a means to foster positive long-term capacity building skills for small business enterprises. the assistance provided by the bonding assistance/mentor-protégé program affiliates is to improve upon business practices and offers no guarantee of financial gain.
