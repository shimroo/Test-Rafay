    the idea
 
 mokai boats enable exploration
 the mokai watercraft was born from the desire to provide a lightweight, durable, environmentally friendly, and fuel-efficient craft that is easily transportable. our goal is to enable fishermen, hunters, and explorers to access those hard-to-reach upstream or shallow water areas that were previously inaccessible. with our innovative powered kayak, this vision has become a reality. whether you're navigating remote fishing spots, exploring hidden waterways, or venturing into pristine natural habitats, the mokai watercraft is designed to make these adventures possible!
