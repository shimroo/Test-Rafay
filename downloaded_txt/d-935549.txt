books for mystery loverswe publish mysteries by three authors whose work is  at the heart of what we believe mysteries are all about. terence faherty’s owen keane series, p.m. carlson’s maggie ryan novels and john billheimer’s owen allison series are intelligent and endearing, books that readers walk into independent bookstores and libraries hoping to discover. maggie ryan has an ability to make folks around her better people. owen keane is driven to answer life’s larger questions, seeking answers through methods he’s learned from the detective stories he cherishes. owen allison’s investigations explore the interplay between development and preservation in his native west viriginia. these aren’t just great reads. these elegant whodunits and fascinating characters leave you feeling good about the genre itself.
