history of the summit tennis & athletic club

the summit was founded in july of 1993 as a 20,000 sq. ft. fitness facility staffed by twenty-three employees. the club at that time consisted of a swimming pool, strength training, aerobics, and cardiovascular equipment.
by the end of its first year, the summit was the premiere health club in the central pa region. in the fall of 1994, construction began on a sports complex. this addition would add an indoor soccer court, two basketball courts and three tennis courts, as well as, racquetball courts, physical therapy facility, expanded lobby and an additional cardiovascular room.
the summit is proud to serve central pennsylvania with its health club facility.
