mexican food, tequila & atmosphere

welcome to salena’s mexican restaurant, a family-owned and operated restaurant and bar in the heart of the neighborhood of the arts, one of rochester ny’s most vibrant neighborhoods.







our menu features delicious mexican food including tacos, burritos, enchiladas and more. our homemade dishes are inspired by both traditional mexican recipes, as well as “americanized” versions. we serve dishes from our hearts and we are proud of each of them. there are a wide range of vegetarian and vegan options, celiac friendly options, and an awesome kid’s menu inspired by our own children.

in addition to the mexican food on our menu, we are inspired by the vibrant culture of mexico, and aim to combine a comfortable family restaurant atmosphere with the warm and lively environment of a mexican cantina.



salena’s mexican restaurant also carries rochester’s finest selection of tequila and agave spirits, with each bottle handpicked for you to try. in addition, a variety of mexican beers and other drink specials are always available. see below for links to our menus, drink specials, & more!
