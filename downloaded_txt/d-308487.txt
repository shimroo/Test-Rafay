          when you appear in public…always appear as a peer to the major brands. 

this is a powerful signaling move for a low awareness brand. it’s the right kind of cocky. 

just got my barbacoa breakfast tacos at snooze an a.m. eatery  near uc san diego in la jolla. 

“want hot sauce?”
“yes,ma’am”
she puts yellowbird®  on the counter first. then cholula. 

f*%k cholula

that’s the power of restaurant placement in the right zips…you’ll show up branded as a peer, not an insurgent.

          great conference today from capitol weekly on the future of media in california.

a couple of takeaways:

📰  news deserts are a crisis that allow room for disinformation. with the number of newspapers that are closing everyday, other outlets are trying to step in to fill the gaps, but there is still more that needs to be done.

📰 newspapers are changing the way they approach journalism, focusing on the needs of readers and delivering more informational and high-impact reporting.

📰 newspapers need to change the way they seek funding. what once was an advertising-driven industry is having to find new sources of revenue, especially with more readers turning from print to online.

📰 news coverage of the legislature has changed greatly in the past couple of decades with less reporters and less access to elected leaders. this can result in less accountability.

          linkedin a platform for business, ideas, community & innovative thinking...to me. so were the grateful dead. r.i.p. @phillesh

i got turned on to the grateful dead in early ‘90’s at long beach show…changed my mind, soul, sense of community & economy. what i witnessed & experienced was a whole new world…music as a driver for bringing ppl together, spreading joy, global messaging, branding & economic innovation - that was & is my experience. i say i went to 50'ish grateful dead shows…all i know is they created a platform for many things…

1. social media: “the well” one of the 1st social media platforms created.
2. gig economy: parking lot economy - sell to the market to make cash whether "kind burritos", chili, crafts, weed, acid, haircuts, clothes, a ride to the next show to selling ginseng.
3. branding: shakedown street was the main parking lot avenue where everyone sold & shopped. oh yeah...and the jerry bear...and themed events...nye free donuts at midnight...
4. memes: "i need a miracle"...why does that guy have a finger in the air?
5. free hugs: free hugs
6. leave no trace: pick up what you brought in.
7. human community: from sharing blankets, food, drink to checking in to "making sure you're alright", rockmed
8. gaming: twirling. set list guessing. yelling out for songs...
9. innovate, create wonder & magic: before burning man were dead shows
10. crypto: before bitcoin - the dead community created global money & trade exchange without cash. you gotta home, i gotta ticket...

          many of us feel helpless when we watch what's happening in california. while these feelings are 100% valid, you *can* do something.

here are some places you can donate to provide relief for those in need in ca right now (thank you megan senese & jennifer ramsey for some recommendations):
 
💚  baby2baby: currently responding to the devastating wildfires raging across los angeles by providing critical items including diapers, food, formula, and hygiene products for children and families who have lost everything. 
💚  california fire foundation: provides aid and resources for both fire crews and residents.
💚  american red cross: helping those affected by disasters during and after crisis. 
💚  world central kitchen: their relief team is currently in southern california to support first responders and families impacted by wildfires in the los angeles area.
💚  los angeles regional food bank: currently working with government agencies, nonprofit and faith-based partners, and others to respond to the fires throughout los angeles county.

if you have any other recommendations for places we can donate to, please leave a link in the comments.

          better than a pulitzer!!  made  a media request in los angeles before judge juhas- a request printed in the min. order. guess he viewed using my email to make his disclosures, which he had not bothered to do before. 

judge juhas like so many other public court judges these days have  reportedly been " trying out" to be a private judge. last year we got wind that  attorneys dennis and laura wasser were acting as his marketing agents as he planned to jump the public service ship to  signature resolutions, the firm wasser dumped angie jolie in when the private judge was disqualified. 

private judging is when lawyers or retired judges get lawyers to bring them cases diverted from public court by getting clients  to agree to use an attorney as a judge for a divorce or custody case. these private judges are paid a great deal of money, rarely disclose their conflicts of interest and have no training that public court judges do.  one judge said it looks like bribery - then he retired.  bribery , gratuity or paid fees the results are the same - under qualified lawyers get immunity to be judges and take your money to do it. 

it was bates and trotter who started private judging in the business known as jams . intially judges who went into this busienss might have served a valauble alternative for public court , but today it  has become super corrupt. 

california has underpaid judges. at $238,000 per year, no public court judge could support a family and live in an area of town that we would expect our judges to be able to live in. in santa clara and most counties , the elected da makes nearly $600,000 a year and the appointed public defender $400,000. that means when the da and pd stand before a judge, they make nearly five times what the judge makes. 

this creates for an imbalance and unfairness in the courts. it also makes it ripe for public court judges to chase and entertain offers to be a private judge in retirement. but in planning that retirement, a public court judge easily becomes corrupted, often not noticing as other judges remain silent as they do. 

in gathering comments on our recent article on judge david rothman, link here: https://lnkd.in/gjzsurpw  we got what we need for our reporting on rothman, the private judge. coming soon in the davis vanguard , where we also wrote about judge juhas ! 

see link here: https://lnkd.in/gsi76ter

looks like another la media request is brewing as we write about the good, bad and the ugly when it comes to california's courts.

          william drown
        






 

              
          statement from dripsy drown film and entertainment:

we are initiating legal action against multiple los angeles agencies, including the sheriff's department, parks department, and the philharmonic, for $2.5 billion in damages. this includes claims of defamation, pain and suffering, intellectual property theft, and violation of civil rights—specifically, the right to protest, freedom of religion, and obstructing access to a native american religious site and burial mound.

### laws violated and their repercussions

1. **defamation**: publishing false information that damages someone's reputation. this can lead to significant financial penalties and restitution to the injured party.
   
2. **intellectual property theft**: unauthorized use of someone else's intellectual creations. this can result in hefty fines, injunctions, and even criminal charges.

3. **violation of civil rights**: this includes infringing upon rights such as freedom of religion, right to protest, and access to religious sites. these actions can lead to federal charges, civil penalties, and compensatory damages.

4. **ponzi scheme**: involvement in fraudulent investment operations where returns are paid to earlier investors from new capital. this is a serious federal crime with severe penalties including imprisonment and substantial fines.

5. **desecration of burial mounds**: under nagpra, this is the mishandling or desecration of native american remains and cultural artifacts. violations can result in federal criminal charges, imprisonment, fines, and civil penalties.

### additional concerns

furthermore, we have reported these agencies to the fbi and the justice department for involvement in a ponzi scheme. additionally, we have alerted nagpra regarding the desecration of remains on the burial mounds. nagpra, the native american graves protection and repatriation act, is a federal law that ensures the respectful treatment and return of native american human remains and cultural items. violations of nagpra are severe crimes, with penalties including imprisonment and fines.

additionally, i have been stalked, assaulted, and voyeurized by the suspects, and local police and government officials have failed to address the situation.

our commitment to justice and our rights is unwavering, and we will be filing federal charges to address these transgressions.

### call to action

we urge anyone who has witnessed or experienced similar injustices to come forward and share their stories. it is only through collective action and shared voices that we can hold these agencies accountable and seek justice for all affected parties. stand with us in demanding accountability and ensuring that these grievous violations do not go unanswered.

          google largely got its way this week when it reached a deal with california lawmakers to help fund local newsrooms in place of a law that would have required it to pay them. if the bill had passed it would have been the us’ first such law modelled after canada’s bill c-18 that came into effect last year requiring google to pay the canadian news industry $74 million annually to run its content.
 
instead google agreed on a public private partnership deal with the state of california wednesday committing to fund ca's local journalism in an amount per year that’s significantly less than what it currently pays canada. (california and canada have similar populations). 

another california bill that's making noise this week is sb 1047. if it’s signed into law, which could happen as early as september, it would regulate ai development and deployment of any company doing business in california that runs large ai models worth over $100 million. 

the tech giants, most of them operating out of ca, have naturally voiced opposition even calling into question the future of open source ai models if they’re held responsible for policing them under the proposed bill. the bill is expected to pass through the legislature by end of month. more to come on this soon...

          i love matcha and my “matcha moments.” ☺️🍵 

this was me a few years back enjoying a cup at a local san diego cafe during a meeting with my writers group.

and although i don’t belong to a writers group today, matcha is still very much a big part of my life. 😁🍵

often, writing does take discipline. a commitment to finishing what you started. and developing the skills to create a phenomenal masterpiece. 

whether you are writing a script, a book, or blog, setting yourself up to succeed is important. 🏆💪🏽

helpful tips to writing success:

📝 schedule your writing time. waiting for inspiration that may or may not come isn’t something you can count on. a scheduled event increases your chance of writing. 

📝 if you’re needing support along the way of writing that future bestseller, consider hiring a writing coach or being part of a writers group. coaches and groups can be helpful. 

📝 avoid distractions when writing. for example, the temptation to scroll your social media accounts or to watch online videos. focus. a way that helps with this is to have a goal that you have to accomplish, such as writing a certain number of words or pages in a certain period of time. 

📝 create a welcoming and cozy space to write. i don’t always, but i often like to drink a hot matcha latte while writing a script. it’s relaxing to me. sometimes i write at my desk in my  home office. other times, i’m writing in the backyard. do what works for you. 

i invite you to get some writing done this weekend. you’ll be glad you did. 👩🏽‍💻😁☺️💜

happy friday! ☀️🏝️

          pro bono mental health services for la fire victims

i believe in using linkedin and other platforms to share important resources during times of crisis. 

the devastation caused by the la fires is overwhelming. growing up near where the eaton fire continues to blaze, i am have family and friends who have been evacuated, and personally know people who have lost their homes. 

while the physical losses—homes, buildings and possessions—are visible and absolutely heartbreaking, the emotional and mental toll is often overlooked. when safety and predictability are shattered, it disrupts the foundation of entire communities. places tied to memories, connection and belonging are destroyed, leaving behind a profound sense of loss.

the mental health impact of wildfires is real and long-lasting. as this new york times article (https://lnkd.in/gi5ps-wc ) explains, researchers from ucla and other institutions have documented how the trauma of losing homes, evacuating and facing uncertainty affects mental well-being. it’s an important read for understanding how these events ripple far beyond what we see on the news.

if you or someone you know is struggling, here is a list of amazing pro bono therapists in la offering support during this time. 

https://lnkd.in/gqdas7vn

let’s take care of each other with empathy, compassion and understanding. see here for more resources on how to help: https://lnkd.in/gtd36ggh

          sending out your regularly scheduled social posts and e-blasts to people in los angeles right now only hurts your brand. any organization, whether a business, nonprofit, or government agency, communicating in the greater la region right now needs to focus on value.

use your brand and platform to provide resources, expertise unique to your work, and actionable information that help people navigate this moment. talk about how you’re caring for your community, whether your employees, clients, or the public.

the messages that people will receive right now are the ones with meaning. anything else right now risks being ignored—or worse, doing damage. communication and pr professionals, be intentional and find the unique ways your organization can contribute. actions and words make a difference in times like these.

          what conspiracy??!

dear hearts, the 'news', which is by now 'counter-intuitive', is not that having a living minimum wage (as if $15/hr or even $20/hr were living) is economically feasible, but the incredible forces, the massive propaganda campaign, aligned against it. 

the facts of this, and so many 'progressive' solutions to our rigged, exploitive, heavily controlled economy and society, are completely drowned out by billions being spent on misinformation, disinformation and outright lies. lies with only one purpose - to disadvantage the working class and further line the pockets of the wealthy. 

and then of course, there's the billions spent to buy off the governments of almost every nation in the world, especially our own, to ensure the continued hegemony of western capitalist oligarchs - to wage war, build empires and exploit anyone and everyone who can be victimized by their endless greed and lust for power.  

sounds serious doesn't it? 
carry on!
mutton or wool?

          over the weekend, i saw an article celebrating hollister incorporated's summer program that is addressing the youth mental health crisis through music. while i'm thrilled to see that mental health at the forefront of the minds of mainstream brands, a part of me felt defeated and lost. 

since 2016, i have been clawing my way to get in front of the right people. painfully sharing my personal story of struggling with depression and self harm as a teenager, and how my favorite bands truly saved my life. i started superbands with no experience under my belt. my shy, introverted-self began cold pitching as many people as i could, sharing my vision to reshape the conversation about youth mental health through the lens of music and fandoms.  because i knew the power that they held in saving lives. 

i wish i could be sharing a success story for my organization, a david versus goliath-type of win. but instead, it is the exact opposite. 

just because i didnt have any connections, just because i didnt have money, i couldn't make the impact that i have been wishing for since superbands began. 

while i usually look forward to may given my birthday celebrations, this may has been the roughest, most difficult one of my life thus far. it has tested my patience and my resilience. 

this might be the first time i truly have considered if it is time to throw in the towel. how could someone like me go up against corporations with millions of dollars, against industry professionals with endless connections just a phone call away? 

i don't know the point of this post. but all i know is that i never will stop believing in the power of music.

          got to talk about california, los angeles - and specifically santa monica - in terms of retail, crime and social impact.

retail crime and other challenges have more than tarnished the golden state's reputation. many have seen the impact on san francisco with the departure of numerous stores and san francisco center owners unibail-rodamco-westfield handing back the keys in june 2023. (it's now owned by trident pacific).

two things further to this state's retail reputation story.  first, on friday (16 august 2024) california governor gavin newsom signed a blizzard of paperwork creating new and strengthening past legislation in regards to organized retail theft - specifically retail crimes and sale of stolen goods. as part of that he's asked that stores be able to get temporary restraining orders against repeat offenders.

speaking at a news conference at a home depot store in san josé in the state, gov. newsom said:  "these bills will strengthen existing laws. they'll enhance other laws, and they will address the challenges that are well outside the purview of previous initiatives and laws. that's the issue of organized retail theft, the issue of serial theft, the issue that is front and center in the consciousness of so many californians."

this is welcomed but there also seems to be a strong feeling that it's too late and too little. what has been clear is that doing nothing is just exacerbating an already dire situation.

which leads me to another - and very visceral - assessment in regards to retail crime and its impact on california destinations:  santa monica's third street promenade. i have strong family connections with the los angeles beachside community of santa monica and love going back there.  the victor gruen-inspired promenade that emerged in the 1960s had its major 'reincarnation' in 1989 and was the result of architectural vision of jon jerde one that evolved into the present-day entity only in 2010.  it was a fun destinational place. today however it's where trouble - as much as products - may sadly be in store. a video from property investor graham stephan, who grew up in santa monica and  who walks the promenade - explains with great clarity  - what the impact of not just retail crime, but on-line retailing, covid and failing social policy - has been. 

i'm sure there will be those who either disagree or who may not like mr. stephan's reasoning - but if you want a realistic and, to my mind, really effective - situational explanation from one who knows his numbers, then get a cup of tea or coffee and spend 18 minutes or so viewing this video (also released this past week)!  https://lnkd.in/d4cvraya

          conversations with spirit ad response.
i have received some discerning negative feedback from the first ad i shared on facebook which promoted my event in yakima, so i thought i would create another post- this post and a video to give a bit of an explanation and share what i have learned through my work.

for those who do not believe in what i do, you don't have to. i'm not asking you to. i'm asking those, who trust their own thoughts, feelings and emotions, who are ready to hear what i have to share, to give me an opportunity to connect for them or watch as others receive connections. i'm asking them to come and see mediumship for themselves so they can decide if it leaves them feeling peaceful. i am asking those who are interested to step into their power, trust their hearts and release the fear thrown at them. i'm asking them to know they are safe and to know that none of the fears and nastiness thrown at them, comes from a place of love. if you are tired of fear controlling your life, this is the event for you! let's discuss it. let's dive deep. let's step into our power!

none of the ugliness i've had tossed my way comes from god. period. it still baffles me that people buy into that nonsense. god is love. god is not based in fear. fear and love do not go together. if you are allowing fear to control you, you are not working from a place of love, which is where god resides.

after experiencing many deep losses, including my parents, the entire generation above me, my son and a sibling, my mind and my heart opened to experiences i cannot explain. i know in my heart, those experiences are not coming from a dark place, and i hope to share that with you.

i thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today.

          i would like to re-introduce myself. 

i grew up in oc, ca. 

i excelled at sports & loved surfing. 

i also joined a cult early on in my teens that really did a number on my thinking that i am happy to say i feel free of & healed from.

i left that cult (think non-denominational church on every street corner with great music aka cult ) in my late 20s and went hog wild in all things fleshly appetites. money and women were my interest. 

fueled by deep insecurity i tried to f@ck and sell my way to being fulfilled. 

i didn’t work, but it did teach me valuable skills. skills i still use to this day. 

i slept with hundreds of women and finally met “the one”. that lasted a couple years and i left her. we got back together soon after for life and a couple years later she left me. 

that was my wake up call. that i wasn’t showing up as the man i thought i was and wanted to be. 

from that moment on it was about becoming the best me for me. not her. not you. but me. 

this led me to understanding why she left, why women lose attraction for their man & why bedrooms end up becoming libraries instead of the playgrounds they are meant to be. 

i think most of what’s taught about marriage today is bs. it clearly doesn’t work (just look at how many unhappy couples there are)

it fires me up to share what i know and help men who sit in darkness see a light. 

my light has become more bright the more i realize this information actually helps men’s lives. 

i can’t unsee what i’ve seen. 

a truly happy couple is rare. it’s the exception.

i have lived unhappy. now i’m in bliss. and that bliss is simply by following a particular way to live. 

i show this way because any guy can get the same results. i’m not special. just followed a path that kept beckoning me forth. i couldn’t turn away. and it led me to freedom. 

welcome to my little corner of the internet. i’ll be sure to offend & hopefully help you see the path to freedom more clearly. 

🙏🏽😎🤙🏼

regardless of where you are at, i’m rooting like crazy for you to love your love life.

very few seem to understand how this actually works. if you’re tired of the cliche answers that keep you stuck. stick around i’ll  show you

          i believe this goes back to the reagan years as governor of california. california unions went completely in with the democrat party because reagan was know as a union buster, which in turn made democrats promise unrealistic pension guarantees far into the future. the result to this day is democrat politicians get an unknown number of guaranteed votes every election by the unions who want to ensure their pensions remain intact. the last la mayor's race, the republican candidate won the day of the election vote by several percentage votes, but then lost the trickle in vote over the next week by a 2 to 1 margin. 
pension spiking is when a union member's highest amount of hours worked during their busiest year is used to set their pension. so if a union member works double hours one year, resulting in a massive spike in pay, that is the salary used to set their pension, even if they never worked over time again! the unions literally scheduled their people for their pension spike year. i find it sad that our country has no true, independent entity that controls the actions of both democrats, and republicans. we keep talking about how great our system is even as it goes further into debt each year with both sides raiding either our environment, (the democrats in california, ironically enough), or wanting such minimal taxation that basic services cannot be paid for.

          minimum wage violations have more than doubled in california cities like los angeles, costing workers billions.

california workers lose up to $4,000 per year in major metro areas that include san francisco, san diego and san jose, according to a study by rutgers university.

how much do you think you've lost? here's one of my latests at ktla.
