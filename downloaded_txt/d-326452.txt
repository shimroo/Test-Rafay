murry. g


scratchgard®
short & sweet, scratchgard saved my agency thousands of dollars in damaged train windows.

laura. d


scratchgard®
upon arriving to my store, we found windows covered in paint. luckly, we had scratchgard applied months prior. all we had to do was peel away the sacrificial film to expose the undamaged windows. huge cost saver.

h. perkins


blastgard®
i am a campaign manager in a politician’s office and last year we had a molotov cocktail tossed through our front window. two weeks later we got blastgard.

r. marchese


blastgard®
as a government contractor i’ve seen a lot of products that claim to work under the worst human conditions. most of them are crap but this is the real deal.

j. lenihan

the installation = top notch! loooove the finished product -- no one seeing my building for the first time would ever notice the window film! image is important. test. test.

s. donovan


blastgard®
i’m the owner of an insurance agency and just had this installed on our office windows. i strongly urge other business owners to go the same – the benefits far outweigh the cost, which is surprisingly affordable.

e. tarmin


blastgard®
safe and looks great, just like glass.

f. confino

d. beck


blastgard®
i run a preschool and we had this product installed last week – you can’t be too careful when dealing with kids!

k. daniels


blastgard®
our church board of directors just approved installing this product – we pray we’ll never need it but you never know!

b. patterson


blastgard®
our store is right near an air force base and there are times the glass windows rattle and shake from the jet take-offs. having blastgard on the windows makes me hopeful they won’t shatter one of these days!

m. davenport


blastgard®
my tax office is on the same block as a government office building – best thing my boss did was to install this to help prevent damage and injuries. we’re all a little nervous these days.

l. repetto


blastgard®
i operate an abortion clinic and the health and well being of my patients is paramount. enhancing the safety of my office is something i do regularly and this product was key part of my recent upgrade

a. meyers

i served in the army and was deployed overseas and you won't see a better product than blastgard available to the public.

t. lewy


blastgard®
i purchased blastgard the day after the bombing of the pittsburgh synagogue – nowhere is safe anymore.

c. gallo


vehiclegard®
simple to install – took less than two hours! can’t tell there’s anything there.

m. kline


vehiclegard®
i’m installing this on my fleet of yellow cabs – people are crazy!

k. fallon


vehiclegard®
my pharmacy delivers. my drivers know not to leave the car unattended with prescriptions inside but there are times when they’re outside the car. this helps me prevent smash and grabs.

e. krieger


vehiclegard®
i’m a surgical device sales rep and my equipment is both expensive and proprietary. i can’t protect my car enough!

w. martin


vehiclegard®
after getting ripped off again, i added window films to all of my contractor vans. so tired of having to replace materials – costs me time and money.

j. levy


vehiclegard®
i’m a security guard in a gated neighborhood and we just got these installed on our cars – it was really fast and not noticeable.

b. munoz


vehiclegard®
i sell products at flea markets so my truck is my storage unit. this product was a small price to pay – much cheaper than an insurance claim!

a. pado


vehiclegard®
i’m a lyft driver and got this installed because my car is my business. i can’t take chances, i got bills to pay.

s. haas


vehiclegard®
our daughter turns 16 next month and will get her driver’s license so we got this installed last week. there’s nothing more important to us than her safety.

r. coleman


vehiclegard®
i’m a repair guy for a big electronics retailer and my boss added this to our vehicles to help prevent break ins – super cool product!

c. han


vehiclegard®
as a law enforcement officer i was leery about this product but i have to say it works! i’ll be getting it on my personal vehicles too.

d. wyman


vehiclegard®
i invested every penny of my savings into my food truck and everything inside is brand new. there’s no way i’m taking any chances so i installed the security film to the windows.

r. garcia


vehiclegard®
i have a plumbing business and our vans get broken into a lot. equipment is expensive so we added this product to the fleet – fingers crossed no break ins yet.

v. cavallo


vehiclegard®
i go to school full-time and work part-time so i have tons of   valuable stuff in my car. adding this makes me confident everything will still be there at the end of the night.

j. sullivan


vehiclegard®
as a mom with two young kids who shuttles everywhere for sports and activities -- at all hours of the day and night! -- i feel much safer. anything that helps protect my family gets my mom vote ok.

g. merced


burglargard®
if you own your own business you can’t afford not to have this product.

m. frew


burglargard®
our high-end boutique sees a lot of window shoppers and we worry some are actually “casing” the store. the glass protection film plus our alarm helps stop thieves and more importantly, keeps our inventory inside the store!

k. leland


burglargard®
our gas station sees a lot of petty violence, mostly from drunks. but it causes a lot of damage and scares employees. having the security film makes us feel safer and lets us stay open.

c. healy


burglargard®
my elderly mom lives in an area where kids terrorize the older residents. installing this gives us reassurance since she lives there alone.

i. hernandez


burglargard®
we had this installed right before the holidays and didn’t have to close the store! this is amazing since i have a gift shop and it was prime shopping season.

w. greene


burglargard®
our home was broken into last month and the sheriff suggested we get something like this to help prevent another burglary. i`m for anything that helps protect my wife and kids.

s. garner


burglargard®
i’m a single woman living in a ground floor nyc apartment – there’s no way i’d sleep at night without this on my windows.

d. nicolai


burglargard®
you can’t beat price and warranty, worth every penny.

g. collins


burglargard®
i’m a loss prevention officer at a major retailer with electronics, cell phones and jewelry. my boss just approved this product and it’s getting installed next week – can’t wait.

e. o’leary


burglargard®
my bodega is near a big college and there’s lots of rallies. having this film on my windows helps protect me from rocks and other stuff that gets thrown around.

h. ramos


burglargard®
i have a vacation house with a beautiful view of the lake.  i want security since we are not there all the time but didn’t want to impact my view – this is perfect.

n. scarnati


burglargard®
i own a local pharmacy in a large city. even with metal security gates, i get a lot of attempted break-ins and replace my glass windows a lot. adding this glass film gives me bonus protection.

f. ryan


burglargard®
i'm a small business owner in changing neighborhood and can't afford a fancy alarm system. the security film protects my store and inventory and that saves me money and headaches.

a. vazquez

my money transfer company is a hot target for lowlifes looking for quick cash. this safety film is so affordable there’s no way i wouldn’t install it to protect my money and my people.

s. pressman

we live in the northeast but have seen an increase in storms over the past 5 years. we applied this to our windows so when fast storms move through we’re ready.

p. weinberg


stormgard®
we live in tornado country and glass damage is pretty common. anything we can do to protect our home is worth it – bonus that i could install it myself!

k. werner

a tree branch hit my storefront window during a tropical storm. the glass cracked but didn't shatter so everything inside was still okay- if it wasn't i woulda been out of business.

h. trouson

what makes a good window protection film?
essentially there are three important ingredients that will ensure the performance of the product..





high quality raw materials
shattergard is one of the leading and most respected window film providers in the world. all films utilized are subject to stringent testing and carefully inspected prior to leaving the plant. our firm markets only 1st grade security and safety window films. we are proud to attach our name to such a high quality product. for this reason, shattergard is proud to offer the only lifetime film and labor replacement warranty in the industry.





the adhesive system
the adhesive is a critical part of any shattergard window film. the adhesive system not only provides the all-important bonding between the polyester film and the glass surface, it also incorporates an invisible ultra-violet inhibitor that rejects upwards of 98 % of the harmful rays that fade furnishings.





professional installation
shattergard window films will only perform to specification if the installation is carried out by an expert installer. unlike the inexperienced neighborhood window tinter, shattergard technicians must undergo many hours of specialized training to install our security and safety films. our technicians can apply our window films with absolutely no disruption to your home or business. there's absolutely no mess or odor.










											what we do?
											



the shattergard company protects people and property worldwide by offering a wide array of  glass protection film. our unique security window film not only beautifies your home or business, they also defend against burglaries, mother nature and bomb blasts. wherever glass protection film is required.. you can bet shattergard has a product for you.












											how we do it?
											



shattergard markets and installs a series of incredibly strong security window films that are designed to prevent glass from shattering. our unique maintenance-free and highly scratch-resistant products improve the structural integrity of any windowpane. in the unlikely event the window breaks, our security film will help hold the broken shards together reducing the likelihood of window penetration and razor-sharp flying glass. and when applied by an authorized technician, shattergard films are virtually undetectable to the human eye. shattergard glass protection films reduce the need for unsightly burglar bars or hurricane shutters. and unlike costly ballistic glass, shattergard ™ window films are guaranteed not to be yellow or distort over time.
