we are the first solar energy
      company in new jersey 
      creating self-sufficient eco-systems.






 

































 



solar energy is great
the electricity you use from the local utility company costs approximately $0.17 per kwh. with a solar panel system you will save thousands, maybe even millions of dollars, over the life of the system.

and eco-friendly
solar power systems are clean and non polluting. new jersey now generates more of its energy from solar power than from nuclear power plants. solar is safer, cleaner and less expensive than dirty sources of power. we no longer need to destroy our environment with dirty sources of energy like nuclear and fossil fuels. we can now choose better. we can choose solar.









 


 



solar panels
                    are durable
solar panels can withstand a one inch hailstone travelling at 50mph.
