the cove is a privately owned, certified tree farm. the cove covers about three thousand acres ranging from one 
to three thousand feet in altitude in the appalachian mountains and a part of the cove has been developed to 
provide outdoor recreation for the general public. it is the desire of the present owners to share the charm, 
solitude, and beauty of the cove with those who love the outdoors.


it is unfortunate when campers cancel their weekend plans because of "a chance of thunderstorms." regrettably, many campers 
miss out on great camping weather because of this. don't miss out! feel free to call us and ask what the weather is doing.
