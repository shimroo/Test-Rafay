rescue a pug. make a forever friend.kentuckiana pug rescuefacebook instagram twitter 





welcome!kentuckiana pug rescue (kpr) is a volunteer-based, 501(c)(3) non-profit rescue organization (permit #p15-001003) committed to helping all needy pugs in the states of indiana and kentucky.  we work to find both abandoned, as well as surrendered pugs, loving, forever homes in which they can live out the rest of their lives. kpr does not have a central facility where pugs can be visited.  each rescued pug lives with a foster family until they can be placed in an adoptive home. kentuckiana pug rescue operates solely on donations to care for our pugs. all donations are tax deductible. would you consider donating to help our pugs? click here to learn more about ways to donate!
