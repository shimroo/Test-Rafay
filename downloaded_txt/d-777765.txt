modulenotfounderror: no module named 'torch._custom_ops'



did you ever feel like you were the only one on earth who has ever seen this error?  well, just because your favorite search engines are not giving you results, does not mean you are alone.traceback (most recent call last):  file "/usr/local/bin/easyocr", line 5, in <module>    from easyocr.cli import main  file "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/easyocr/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>    from .easyocr import reader  file "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/easyocr/easyocr.py", line 3, in <module>    from .recognition import get_recognizer, get_text  file "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/easyocr/recognition.py", line 6, in <module>    import torchvision.transforms as transforms  file "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torchvision/__init__.py", line 6, in <module>    from torchvision import _meta_registrations, datasets, io, models, ops, transforms, utils  file "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torchvision/_meta_registrations.py", line 4, in <module>    import torch._custom_opsmodulenotfounderror: no module named 'torch._custom_ops'got this after installing easyocr version 1.7.1 and executing the command "easyocr -l en -f image.png" in accord with these instructions.  to "solve" this problem after finding nothing with search engines, i simply commented out the lines in the file /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torchvision/_meta_registrations.py that referred to _custom_ops.then i started getting all the normal errors that you get with easyocr as follows:$ easyocr -l en -f test_en.jpg /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torchvision/io/image.py:13: userwarning: failed to load image python extension: '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torchvision/image.so: undefined symbol: _zn3c104cuda9setdeviceei'if you don't plan on using image functionality from `torchvision.io`, you can ignore this warning. otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?  warn(neither cuda nor mps are available - defaulting to cpu. note: this module is much faster with a gpu.([[2, 2], [1002, 2], [1002, 34], [2, 34]], 'as warren buffett; one of the most successful investors of all time, said: "if you don\'t find', 0.6927859396455398)([[2, 46], [724, 46], [724, 78], [2, 78]], 'way to make money while you sleep; you will work until you die"', 0.5957261107425325)no idea about the "normal" errors, but at least you can start using easyocr like this:$ easyocr -l en --detail 0 -f test_en.jpg  2>>/dev/nullas warren buffett; one of the most successful investors of all time, said: "if you don't findway to make money while you sleep; you will work until you die"hope that helps.p.s. if any of you know of an easy way to add hebrew to my easyocr install, please let me know.currently getting this when trying to use easyocr to get hebrew:file "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/easyocr/easyocr.py", line 109, in __init__    raise valueerror(unknown_lang, 'is not supported')valueerror: ({'he'}, 'is not supported')my favorite search engines are not suggesting anything to help me with this issue.  imagine that.

how to turn off google assistant



do you hate pop-ups like google assistant as much as i do?i doubt it, but because i am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, you get also get the following instructions for turning off the google assist garbage on your phone.steps to turn off:0. consider pruchasing one of these phones https://e.foundation/, and let me know if that works out for you.  i am seriously considering it also.  google is getting too big for their britches.1. pull down twice from the top of your phone, you should see this gear icon for the "settings" and click the gear icon2. type "assistant" into the search settings bar at the top and click enter, then look for "assistant settings" in the list of results, and click it.3. you will get a looong list of options, scroll down to find the "general" option and click it.4.  you should see a screen like this where you can turn off the google assistant.  make sure it is grey like it is in this picture.you are welcome.  and again, please let me know if you e phone works out instead of this fix, i would really like to know.

skype drops connection within about 20 seconds of initiating a call on macos



is this happening to you?  well, i pain your feel!  but do not worry, i figured it out. simply kill skype, remove your skype application's user profile, and restart skype.  then i was able to initiate a call over wifi, and it would not drop.  specifically, this is what i did to fix the issue:
$ killall skype
$ cd ~/library/application\ support/
$ mv skype ~/trash/skype_01
$ mv skype.app ~/trash/skype.app_01
then restarted skype, and all was well with initiating calls.

here were the symptoms of what i was experiencing:


if i initiated a call, it would drop within about 20 or 30 seconds of starting it. 
if i was on a group call withe others, and i tried to share my screen ... it would silently fail and they would never see my screen share. 
if someone else initiated the call, the call would procede normally, and it would not be dropped, so it makes you feel like you are the only one on the planet who ever sees this issue. 
the problem crept in with a skype update within the last 6 months of 20161012, so some time after april of 2016.  installing skype_7.37.178 did not help. 
this was occurring on macos yosemite and sierra.
originally had skype_6.17.60.477 installed and let skype update itself from there.

i tried everything, nothing helped. here were some of the things that failed to solve the issue:

basically, following most advice on this web site was useless.
specifically, these posts which came up first with google.
there was this one post which i found after solving the issue which seemed to have an answer which was close to solving the issue on macos, but i basically had to google the solution in order to find this.
any posts which talked about adjusting settings -> energy saver or using the "pmset" command to adjust power management settings or sleep settings ... these suggestions were useless.
upgrading to macos sierra did not help.

hope that helps.

org.osgi.framework.bundleexception: unresolved constraint in bundle jaxb-api



if you are getting this error message:
missing requirement [1.0] package; (package=javax.activation)
do not worry, this is because you are unknowingly using the wrong version of java to start glassfish.
even though you think you are running glassfish with the version in your shell's environment, either via sudo or some other sub process, the environment is not your own, and it is attempting to run glassfish with a different version of java (probably a newer version of java).

if you are running glassfish with sudo because of this bug,
try these possible workarounds instead of the suggested ones:

java_home=$java_home ./asadmin start-domain --verbose=true domain1
sudo java_home=$java_home ./asadmin start-domain --verbose=true domain1

hope that helps.

and here is more of the original error message in case yours is similar:

cannot find function addeventlistener in object [object htmldocument]



if you get this error, do not worry.  the answer is not difficult to understand.

answer: 
   do not initialize your htmlunit webclient like this: 
      new webclient();
   instead, initialize it like this: 
      new webclient(browserversion.firefox_38);

the default "browser" that the htmlunit webclient gives you does not have some of the basic javascript functions available to call such as "addeventlistener".

see also: htmlunit issue tracker non-issue 1615.
