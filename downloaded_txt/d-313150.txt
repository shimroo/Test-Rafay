laroke was an ibm compatible pc computer consultant in boca raton, florida area specializing in 'wintel' (windows/intel) hardware, software, system, peer-to-peer networks, and internet publishing solutions.






welcome to laroke microcomputer consultants. my name is larry robert kephart, and i provided general pc consulting services in the boca raton, florida area at one time. this site remains but the business is gone.
anyone who is interested in computing of the nineties may find something here. the only area now that receives updates is the personal section and most of those concern my hobby activities with my four vehicles: "billybob" a 1955 chevrolet pickup truck, "deerslayer" a 1937 chevrolet utility express hot rod truck, "renegade" a 1991 jeep wrangler renegade and "bettylou" a 1993 chrysler concorde.
