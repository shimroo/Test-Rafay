the life expectancy project is a research and educational group. we primarily study life expectancy of children born with 
cerebral palsy, persons in the vegetative state, and those who 
have sustained spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury. 
we also study other medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke. 
we have published extensively in medical and scientific journals.
