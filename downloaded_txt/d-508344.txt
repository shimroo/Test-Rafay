proper nutrition is essential for health  
			

proper nutrition is essential for 
			maintaining health, preventing disease, and restoring health in the 
			face of disease. 
medical 
			nutrition therapy, seeks to improve health and symptoms naturally
			by optimizing patient nutrition, thereby decreasing the need for 
			medications.


the balance of nutrition is unique to the individual and can 
				vary depending on diet, digestion/absorption, age, race, gender, lifestyle, 
				medications, and state of 
				health or ill health.


the common symptom in every disease is the loss of health, and 
				it's the one symptom doctors 
				often fail to treat. yet any symptom can be made worse if the nutrition is insufficient 
				to maintain health or promote healing. 





nutritional 
				deficiencies are common in chronic and 
				degenerative disease or after 
				trauma injury or surgery.


medications can't correct for nutritional 
				deficiencies, and improved nutrition can't correct for medication 
				toxicities (side effects). long term use of medications increases the risk of 
				side effects which are usually treated with more drugs.
				 
				medical nutrition therapy can improve symptoms naturally which 
				may decrease the need for some medications.


self-care is the most important part of 
				healthcare, and proper nutrition is the foundation for health; 
				without which you can't obtain adequate exercise, quality sleep, 
				adapt to stress, detoxify or maintain the body's tissues.


medical nutrition consultation and therapy

medical 

nutrition therapy identifies areas of 
				nutritional weakness that can negatively impact health, and 
				provides information on how to strengthen these areas to improve 
				overall nutrition, health and wellness


telemedicine consultations available at no extra 
				charge.
