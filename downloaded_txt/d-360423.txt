about

		mus has made its mark empowering boys through excellence since 1893. in an environment focused on honor, scholarship, service, and belonging, young men thrive as they prepare for college, and for life beyond their degrees. our unparalleled academics, dedicated faculty, all-boys experience, and 94-acre wooded campus offer students an opportunity to grow intellectually, morally, artistically, physically, and socially, becoming leaders well-equipped to turn ideas into action.

come learn for yourself why there is no better school in the mid-south for boys. we are committed to academic excellence, and we know how to teach boys. nearly 70 percent of our teachers have advanced degrees, and they average 22 years of experience. we maintain a student-teacher ratio of 7 to 1, and a typical class size of 15. step-by-step, our students learn to take responsibility for their actions, serve the community, and develop leadership skills as they make lifelong friendships.

academics

the extraordinarily accomplished and dedicated faculty is our driving force, and providing boys an unparalleled college-preparatory education is our guiding principle. since the school’s founding in 1893, we have upheld a tradition of excellence, and we stay on the cutting edge by keeping an eye on the future. what we teach is shaped by the expectations that colleges have for students they admit, and by what we believe we should pass on from generation to generation.

arts

understanding and appreciating the works of man’s creative spirit are necessary for a complete education. we offer students myriad opportunities for hands-on, full-fledged participation in performing, visual, and recording arts. boys here have the chance to sculpt, to paint, to act, to sing, and to perform, and the whole community benefits from the creativity that they express.  
 
“it is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance … and i know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process.”  - henry james, 1915

athletics

sports have always played a significant role in shaping the moral character of our students. teamwork, self-sacrifice, courage, stamina, perseverance, hard work, self-control - these values are forged in the crucible of competition. while we are extremely proud of our numerous athletic achievements, we realize these endeavors are never an end in themselves, but a powerful means to an end: self-knowledge and self-improvement for our boys. our athletic program lives by the highest code of sportsmanship. we play hard, we play by the rules, and we have fun. at mus, we always play the games well.

student life

a tradition of excellence remains vigorous here due to the commitment of the entire community - especially students. we encourage our boys to strive for excellence because that allows them to find meaning in what they do, to play a role in something greater than themselves, and to discover a sense of competence and thus confidence in themselves and in their abilities. if our academics, or our sports, or our arts, or our service and leadership opportunities do not challenge or engage boys, then they lack the capacity to transform boys. the struggle for excellence makes our experiences real. and boys need something real.

our campus

		our beautiful campus comprises nine buildings, six athletic fields, two gyms, a cross-country trail, an indoor/outdoor tennis center, and a fencing center. set on 94 wooded acres in east memphis, the verdant landscape and elegant georgian buildings provide a fitting setting where students learn, play, and grow. see our athletic facilities here, and the rest of our campus here.
	















"u" marks the spot

“there comes a time in every rightly constructed boy’s life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure.” - that’s a quote from mark twain. he knew about boys … and at memphis university school, so do we.
