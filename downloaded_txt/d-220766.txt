welcome to great books and classics






"the student is half afraid to meet one of the great philosophers face to face. he feels himself inadequate and
thinks he will not understand him. but if he only knew, the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more
intelligible than his modern commentator. the simplest student will be able to understand, if not all, yet a very
great deal of what plato said; but hardly anyone can understand some modern books on platonism."
- c.s. lewis, on the reading of old books

slowly getting updates started again

my full-time job and volunteer positions have eaten up a lot of my time over the past year, which has left me little time for the website
besides assembling the "today in the classics" posts on
twitter,
facebook,
parler, and
gab.
now that those responsibilities are starting to take a bit less of my time, i'm hoping to get back to assembling the
reading list pages and adding new works and authors to the site, though progress will likely remain slow for a while.
you can get notified of new updates and additions by following me on any of the four social media sites linked above.
