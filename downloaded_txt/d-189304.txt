let’s get together client
my friend and i both attend a social group for seniors run by circle of care because it’s a wonderful way to socialize, meet new people, and enjoy fun activities together. as it turns out, we are also neighbours who’ve known each other for a while, and we just happened to reconnect through this social group!



















zhanna
meals on wheels client
i find the services helpful because it’s been getting harder for me to cook, and i like variety in my meals. with meals on wheels, a very efficient volunteer always shows up at my door on time and delivers exactly what i asked for.



















dan
home care client
my psw emily has a caring beside manner. she’s really looking to see what my particular needs are for that day, and i look forward to her visit because i know that i’ll be heard. she also thinks aheads to what my needs might be after she leaves, like making sure my water glass is full. her care is on a whole other level.
