											what are some of the obvious differences between older and more recent singers?
											 we list a 
											dozen differences
											 for a start, and give you eighteen sound samples.
											

											"i hear you haven't got a wobble".  that's why the english coloratura soprano 
											gwen catley
											 was chosen for an important radio programme.   we examine her pure art.
											

											why all the current emphasis on 
											 darkness
											 in a voice?  we compare this to a more 'enlightened' past.
										



											opera versus oratorio?   for some of our thoughts on the current state of play, 
											click here
											.
											


											puccini coached maria jeritza.  we look at 
											jeritza's account
											 of this, and her dramatic singing.

							our editor, james anderson - who gives 
							lectures
							 on singers - says, "i am a classical musician, who most
							recently ran the
							prestigious festival de pollensa in majorca.  i used to work at the arts
							council of great britain.  i have spent much time collating the advice in 
							the    we sang better    volumes.
							i now give time to educating students and voice
							lovers about the achievements, ideals and training of these great
							singers of the past.  their advice is much needed again today!"  james anderson
							also gave a lecture, on the link between music and the prime numbers, at
							the incorporated society of musicians london on 19th january 2018.
