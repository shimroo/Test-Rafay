                        – member:  theresa s.                    



                        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ my name is peter k. and i've been a member for over 30 years. i want to shout out loud kudos to tina. she helped me with my enrollment in the zelle system. she is absolutely terrific at her job and how confidently she handles each problem. needless to say, she is accurate and detailed in all her transactions.  if tina does hit a snag, she is on the phone and gets answers.  
i am so glad she is at a branch near me. go girl go!

                        i'd like to tell you that i go to the palmyra branch all the time and i absolutely love the ladies there. i'm getting older and always enjoy their smiles!

                        the gals at the drive-thru are always friendly.                     

                        – member: geri s.                    



                        i have been a member with pa central for over 20 years. during this time, i have received the best treatment from your staff, and i truly feel like a family member. i normally do my transactions at your jonestown office and wanted to give a special compliment to tina, chrisy, and marilyn — these staff members are amazing. i had questions for tina and if she was unable to give me a clear answer, she would put down whatever she was doing to put me in contact with the person who could take care of situation. all of my children and my wife continue to bank with pa central, and a big reason for this is due to the treatment we receive every time we make contact with your staff.  thank you!
