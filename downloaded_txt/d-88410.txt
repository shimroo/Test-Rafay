testimonials



"balboa reached out in regards to two rental cars that had not been returned, asking if we needed to extend them. andrea was informed we reported them to avis for recovery assistance (one over a week ago, and the other a few days ago). andrea quickly gathered some details from us and communicated updates in regards to the status of the vehicles. her knowledge and sense of urgency successfully helped recover the two cars that we had reported to avis directly. in under 24 hours, andrea made this happen. thank you!!"

"thank you, balboa, for the awesome resourcefulness in making an alternate travel plan work. i just arrived at the delta check in when they started paging me. i will be boarding in 10 minutes and making a connection in minneapolis to make it back to montreal tonight. genuinely better than mid-day tomorrow. thank you everyone. i appreciate the help and the ‘can’t-be-stopped’ attitude."
