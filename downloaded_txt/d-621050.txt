we are driven to accelerate and scale world-class mentoring in canada
the future of canada is embodied in its youth. throughout their growing-up years, the support young people receive will shape what they achieve. at mentor canada, we know mentoring can transform young lives. this knowledge informs everything we do. across canada, in wide-ranging sectors and regions, organizations and individuals are drawing on mentor canada’s groundbreaking research, resources, tools, and technologies to help young people thrive. 
why we do what we do






canada has a significant mentoring gap
mentoring increases self-confidence, sense of belonging, likelihood to seek further education, potential to secure meaningful employment, and ability to sustain career growth among mentored youth compared to those who aren’t mentored. yet one out of every two young people among the 3,000+ we surveyed claimed that when they wanted a mentor during their younger years, they couldn't find one. this is a significant obstacle, especially for equity-deserving youth. 
analyzing the gap




we have a plan to close the gap
mentor canada is working to broaden and deepen access to quality mentoring for youth in canada. working alongside governments, the private sector, schools, and community organizations, we are building a world-class mentoring ecosystem designed to transform the future of every young person from coast, to coast, to coast. 
a plan of action





















be the change
whether you’re part of an organization looking to set up or improve a mentoring initiative, or an individual moved to make a difference, you're in the right place. engage with mentor canada in a way that makes sense for you.
