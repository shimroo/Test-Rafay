the imds (international material data system) is the automobile industry's material data system. initially, it was a joint development of audi, bmw, daimler, dxc, ford, opel, porsche, vw and volvo. further manufacturers have meanwhile joined the community and imds has become a global standard used by almost all of the global oems. talks are being held with further manufacturers regarding their participation in imds. in imds, all materials used for automobile manufacturing are collected, maintained, analysed and archived. using the imds, it is possible to meet the obligations placed on automobile manufacturers, and thus on their suppliers, by national and international standards, laws and regulations.
