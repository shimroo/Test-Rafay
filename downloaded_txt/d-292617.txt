a few old 
			jokes:
worse than 
					the weather
					one saturday morning a man gets up early, dresses quietly, 
					gets his lunch made, puts on his long johns, grabs his dog, 
					goes to the garage to hook up his boat to the truck and down 
					to the driveway he goes.
coming out of his garage 
					the rain is pouring down: it is like a torrential downpour. 
					there is snow and sleet mixed in with the rain. the wind is 
					blowing at over 50mph.
minutes later he returns to 
					the garage. he comes back into the house. turns the tv to 
					the weather channel and he finds it is going to be very bad 
					weather all day long, so he puts his boat back in the 
					garage, quietly undresses and slips back into bed.
there he cuddles up to his 
					wife's back, now with a different anticipation and whispers, 
					"the weather out there is terrible". to which she sleepily 
					replies, "yeah, can you believe my stupid husband is out 
					fishing in it?"
my blue 
					pajamas
					a man calls home to his wife and says, "honey i have been 
					asked to go fishing at a big lake up in canada with my boss 
					and several of his friends. we'll be gone for a week. this 
					is a good opportunity for me to get that promotion i've been 
					wanting so would you please pack me enough clothes for a 
					week and set out my rod and tackle box. we're leaving from 
					the office and i will swing by the house to pick my things 
					up. oh, and please pack my new blue silk pajamas." the wife 
					thinks this sounds a little fishy but being a good wife she 
					does exactly what her husband asked. the following weekend 
					he comes home a little tired but otherwise looking good. the 
					wife welcomes him home and asks if he caught many fish? he 
					says, "yes! lot's of walleye, some bluegill, and a few pike. 
					but why didn't you pack my new blue silk pajamas like i 
					asked you to do?" the wife replies; "i did, they were in 
					your tackle box."

					reasons why fishing is better than sex...



 ** 
			you don't have to hide your fishing magazines..


 ** it is 
			perfectly acceptable to pay a professional to fish with you once in 
			a while.


 ** the ten 
			commandments don't say anything about fishing.


 ** if your 
			partner takes pictures or videotapes of you fishing, you don't have 
			to worry about them showing up on the internet if you become 
			famous. 



 ** 
			your fishing partner doesn't get upset about people you fished with 
			long  ago 



 ** 
			it's perfectly respectable to fish with a total stranger. 



 ** 
			when you see a really good fisherperson, you don't have feel guilty 
			about imagining the two of you fishing together.
             



 ** 
			if your regular fishing partner isn't available, he/she won't object 
			if you fish with someone else.  



 ** 
			nobody will ever tell you that you will go blind if you fish by 
			yourself. 



 ** 
			when dealing with a fishing pro, you never have to wonder if they 
			are really an undercover cop.  



 ** 
			you can have a fishing calendar on your wall at the office, tell 
			fishing  jokes, and invite coworkers to fish with you without 
			getting sued for harassment.  



 ** 
			there are no fishing-transmitted diseases.  



 ** 
			if you want to watch fishing on television, you don't have to 
			subscribe to the playboy channel.
            
** nobody expects 
			you to fish with the same partner for the rest of your life  



 ** 
			nobody expects you to give up fishing if your partner loses interest 
			in it.  



 ** 
			your fishing partner will never say, "not again? we just fished last 
			week! is fishing all you ever think about?"
