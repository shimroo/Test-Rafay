ozarks rfd: when a coke was a nickel
i do, but unless you’re near my age, you likely don’t. according to a 2012 broadcast on national public radio, the last nickel coke was sold in 1959 — the same price it sold for when introduced in 1886 as a fountain drink.



a deplorable state of outlawry
note: these are not wholly my words, rather more or less a summary of newspaper articles originally printed march/april of 1899. many dates do not add up and will require further research. -cch



a thank you from the mail
saturday evening, i had the honor of attending the marshfield community theatre’s annual award show. mct is not only one of my favorite groups in webster county because of my past involvement in performances, but also because of kelby lorenz.








movie review: double feature – “wolf man” and “one of them days”
since two new releases made about $11 million each at the domestic box office this past weekend, and since i don’t have much to say about either movie, i’ve decided to throw them both a quick review.



tracks in the snow
in the quietness of the early morning, he sat staring out the window at the first winter snow. the thermometer out the window showed that the temperature was in the mid-teens again, as it had been for several mornings lately. at least it was not windy and causing single-digit wind chills. what happened to global warming?








movie review: “den of thieves 2: pantera”
it’s an odd choice to do a sequel to the 2018 heist movie “den of thieves” in 2025. the first film made less than $50 million at the domestic box office and to my knowledge doesn’t have much of a cult following. i didn’t see that film at the time, but i did see it on max to prepare for the sequel, and was unimpressed. there was some competent action, but the story and characters were unoriginal and unengaging. i would have given it a c-. for such a bland movie to get a sequel at all seems unlikely, let alone one that goes to theaters and isn’t dumped on streaming or video on demand. for all i know, that was the plan and then some studio executive noticed there were no wide releases scheduled for this past weekend, so they just threw in whatever they had. the tactic worked, the film took the #1 spot away from the fourth weekend of “mufasa,” but this is not a movie that i could see succeeding through any means other than a lack of competition.








mysteries at the museum: finding forgotten heroes
this past december, in looking back we remembered the funeral of charles rush in december 1899. a veteran of the late war with spain, rush was working as a civilian clerk in the philippines, when he became ill, dying while enroute home. charles was the fourth son of major james laurence rush and his wife frances, who was killed in the cyclone, the major dying suddenly in february of 1892. for whatever reason, i wasn't sure where charles was buried and tramped off to the cemetery in search of his gravesite. the rush plot is near the entrance and that's where he lay, beside his parents and little sister. it occurred to me this is where the unidentified picture was taken. let me explain.



whatever it takes the bullying must stop
matthew 27: 24-25 “when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, i am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. then answered all the people, and said, his blood be on us, and on our children.”








movie review: mufasa
like many critics, i despised the 2019 cgi version of “the lion king.” the new animation was ugly and the rehashing of the story from the 1994 classic without many changes made the whole thing seem unnecessary. but unlike many critics, i’m not ready to throw prequel “mufasa: the lion king” away just because of the sins of its predecessor. i’m not saying that it’s not still inextricably tied to the 2019 film, especially with its still-terrible cgi animation, but the story and characters can do some roaming on their own that makes for a breath of fresh air.
