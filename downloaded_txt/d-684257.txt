frequently asked questions








how should i prepare before my consultation?




you will always have a consultation before your first treatment. think through what you want to achieve and the questions you may have. your healthcare practitioner will inform you how restylane® dermal filler treatments can be used safely to suit your individual aspirations. you will also be asked about your medical history. when you leave your consultation, you should feel well-informed about restylane® dermal filler treatments, and you should know what results to expect.








what should i bear in mind when considering a treatment?




you should always contact a qualified healthcare practitioner. one option is to search for licensed aesthetic treatment specialists in national registries. your treatment should be performed in a spotlessly clean medical environment that affords you privacy.








who is qualified to administer restylane® treatments?




only a medically qualified practitioner should perform restylane® treatments. depending on your country’s legislation, this may include plastic surgeons, cosmetic clinicians, dermatologists, cosmetic dentists, or aesthetic nurses. if in doubt, please see our list of clinics close to you.  








what should i expect from my chosen healthcare practitioner?




you should receive comprehensive information and a detailed explanation regarding your restylane® dermal filler treatment.
•    you should be informed of the possibilities and limitations of treatments with hyaluronic acid.
•    you should receive information about possible side effects and precautions for treatment.
•    you should be informed of the cost of the treatment and possible follow-up treatments.
•    your questions should be answered to your full satisfaction.








what precautions should my healthcare practitioner advise me about?




there are several important precautions to discuss with your healthcare practitioner to ensure satisfactory results and avoid complications:
•    if you are taking immunosuppressive medications
•    if you are taking aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or any other medication that affects bleeding
•    if you have any questions about precautions related to the treatment








how is restylane® administered?




first, the healthcare practitioner disinfects the area to be treated. a small amount of the appropriate restylane® dermal filler treatment is then injected into the skin through a fine needle or blunt micro-cannula to fill wrinkles, add volume, shape your face or fill your lips. after the injection, your practitioner may gently massage the treated area to even out the result.
