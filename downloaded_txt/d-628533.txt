stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary






stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary, a wild ocean place near an urban world, sits east of boston, massachusetts between cape ann and cape cod. historically important as a fishing ground, new england's only national marine sanctuary now reigns as a premier whale watching destination and continues to support commercial and recreational fishing. its shipwrecks serve as time capsules of our nation's maritime history.

whales in motion
in april 2024, stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary staff and volunteers participated in
                whales in motion through sound explorations, a special interactive exhibit celebrating
                massachusetts right whale day at bostonâs museum of science. blind and visually-impaired
                students and adults experienced the locomotion and foraging behavior of humpback and north
                atlantic right whales through 3d sculpture models with musicians performing live. as
                participants ran their hands across these sculpture models, musicians performed action-specific
                melodies that matched the same contour and shape of the model.
