how we do it
 

dummy

 
 
strategy

					it all starts with business objectives. what’s our purpose? what change do we seek to create? and how is it best accomplished?
				 
 
creative

					with strategy in place, now it’s about delivering results in a way that is relevant to the audience and in a way that, as we call it, adds dimension.
				 
 
project management

					delivering great creative is important, but you also need to sleep at night. creative thinking and disciplined management can indeed co-exist.

our story in 30 seconds
here’s a quick story. back in 1980, two guys left a news station with the vision to bring video to the corporate world… a pretty revolutionary plan for 1980. well, it caught some steam. and then quickly, the company expanded into various forms of live events as well and it began to mature. about 40 years later, mvp collaborative has evolved into a full-service marketing and communications agency with a broad set of services, resources and expertise.
