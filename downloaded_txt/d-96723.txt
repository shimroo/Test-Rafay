we're so pleased that 
		you have found our rescue!  there are many deserving great danes that are in need of loving, lifelong, adoptive 
		families. be sure to stop by often, your new best friend may be waiting 
		for you.

		harlequin haven great dane rescue is a no kill shelter located in ohio 
		dedicated to saving and placing abused, abandoned, and neglected great 
		danes in suitable, loving, and forever homes in ohio and extreme northern 
		kentucky.

		the welfare and safety of the great danes and other dogs is our main 
		concern. all adoption applications are carefully screened to assure that 
		the right great dane is placed in the right home. the adoption of a 
		great dane or any dog is a serious commitment and should not be done on
