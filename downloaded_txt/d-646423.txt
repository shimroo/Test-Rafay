introducing arara, our newest affiliated society!






14 feb 2025 12:49 pm |
                dina rivera (administrator)





we are delighted to welcome the american rock art research association (arara) as an affiliated society of the register of professional archaeologists (rpa). founded in 1974, arara's mission to support rock art research, conservation, and education aligns perfectly with our own values and goals.
arara's diverse membership, which spans various professions and backgrounds from the united states and beyond, is a testament to the universal importance of rock art. we commend arara's commitment to ethical standards, as evidenced by the requirement for all members to subscribe to the arara code of ethics. the establishment of committees dedicated to the conservation and preservation of rock art sites, as well as public education on the significance of protecting rock art, further highlights arara's dedication to this vital field.
we are particularly excited about arara's upcoming annual conference, scheduled for memorial day weekend, may 22-27, 2025, in visalia, tulare county, california. with a four-hour workshop led by dr. lawrence loendorf and a rich program of field trips and professional papers, this event promises to be both informative and inspiring. we encourage all members to attend and participate in this memorable conference. additional details can be found on arara's conference page.
once again, welcome to the register community. we look forward to a fruitful and collaborative partnership.

we’re thrilled to announce the success of the inaugural tag uk ethics bowl, sponsored by the register of professional archaeologists (rpa)!
this rpa-led initiative brought together archaeology students from leading uk universities to engage in a rigorous ethics competition. through case-based discussions, participants tackled complex ethical dilemmas, enhancing their professional development and ethical reasoning skills.
congratulations to team guilder from the university of liverpool for taking home the top prize! special thanks to rpa ethics committee members katherine chiou (chair), kenneth aitchison, and daniel perez for organizing the event. we also applaud all participants, including team florin (university of cambridge, bournemouth university, & university of edinburgh), for their thoughtful contributions.
rpa is proud to support ethics education in archaeology, and we look forward to continuing our mission of promoting responsible professional conduct worldwide.

as dr. jesse r. goliath's three-year term as the american anthropology association (aaa) liaison comes to an end on january 1, 2025, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for his dedicated service. the register of professional archaeologists thanks dr. goliath for his invaluable contributions and unwavering commitment to advancing the field.
dr. goliath, an assistant professor of biological anthropology at the department of anthropology and middle eastern cultures, has made significant strides in skeletal biology, focusing on forensic anthropology, microscopy, functional morphology, bioarchaeology, skeletal development, and bone biomechanics. his research, grounded in bone functional adaptation theory, explores the relationship between bone architecture and mechanical loads experienced during life. with extensive field recovery experience in north america, europe, and southeast asia, dr. goliath has served as a consulting forensic anthropologist for various agencies. he has developed histological age estimation techniques and regression models for forensic casework and has presented his findings at numerous prestigious conferences. his published works in leading journals and contributions to edited volumes underscore his impact on the field. currently, he is pioneering new methods for detecting variances in bone morphology using advanced imaging techniques.
dr. goliath’s expertise and dedication have made a lasting impact on the register and the broader archaeological community. we extend our heartfelt gratitude and best wishes for dr. goliath’s future endeavors.
we are pleased to announce that dr. jordi rivera-prince will be stepping into the role of aaa representative on the rpa board.
dr. jordi a. rivera prince is a presidential postdoctoral fellow in the department of anthropology at brown university, with affiliations across several institutes, including the joukowsky institute for archaeology and the ancient world. specializing in bioarchaeology and mortuary archaeology, her research spans coastal communities in the andes and colonial new england, focusing on social inequality, the materiality of the body, and equity in archaeological practice. her work, supported by prestigious organizations like the national science foundation and the ford foundation, includes significant projects such as the north burial ground documentation project in providence. dr. rivera prince holds degrees from the university of pennsylvania and the university of florida.
we look forward to our continued cooperation and collaboration with aaa and the valuable insight dr. rivera-prince will be sharing during her appointment.

in memoriam of dr. alex kirkish






4 oct 2024 12:35 pm |
                dina rivera (administrator)





archaeologist dr. alex kirkish died december 17, 2023 in san diego, ca. born in san francisco, california in 1946, he became an avid long-board surfer during high school in the monterey area.
with a young family at his side, he caught the archaeology bug while attending university of california, santa barbara, working on burton mound among other sites, under the direction of dr. claude warren, and receiving his ba in anthropology.
he worked in archaeology labs at arizona state university, went on numerous geology field trips (just as plate tectonics were coming to the fore), and later attended university of california, riverside, where he obtained his ma degree in anthropology (specialization archaeology). during these years he actively worked with local native americans in protection of cultural sites.
before obtaining professional work as county archaeologist for ventura, california, he helped support his family as a plumber, saying later “it’s all earth science.” there, he continued developing deep relationships with the regional native american communities, which became a lifelong commitment. eventually he began working with the bureau of land management in colorado, returning to his beloved home state in the late 1970s, and began working on major projects in cultural resource management over much of southern california.
during most of the 1980s, when paying jobs in archaeology became scarce, alex obtained his california state contractors license and got his own plumbing business up and running.
by the late 80s he resumed his wide and varied career in cultural resource management, working for the department of the interior, and later for the united states air force. he held both a standard teaching credential and a california community college credential. he loved teaching classes in the schoolroom as well as in the field, and greatly enjoyed demonstrating and teaching flintknapping.
eventually alex worked as archaeologist for the california department of transportation in southern california.
his long fascination with the various beads found at coastal and inland native american sites led him to pursue his doctorate in the field from the university of leicester.
his thesis “bead exchange among the historic kumeyaay indians” examined the dramatic change in bead types found at kumeyaay sites during the historic period, linking it to demographic disruption and examining connections with the revitalist chinigichinish cult that may have been a reaction to this disruption. he was admitted to the degree of doctor of philosophy by the university of leicester on july 10th, 2013.
in his "retirement," alex was a frequently sought consultant owing to his deep expertise with beads.
a dedicated father and husband, occasionally impatient, but just as impatient to shrug it off with an easy laugh, he was always active around the house and next to his beloved cats, he loved the garden the most. we miss the annuals that he planted and the beautiful wildflowers. he loved nature, but he was most at home in the desert, enjoying its quiet beauty.
he is survived by his wife christina (kit) and his son jandro. we are bereft in so many ways: his colleagues and collaborators have lost a vast and hard-won store of expert knowledge. his friends and family miss much more of course – the pleasure of his company, his friendship, and the wildflowers.

unearth your perks! take full advantage of your registration.

the register of professional archaeologists is committed to supporting excellence in professional archaeology as a discipline. equally important to us is that we support registrants by offering resources that may no longer be within financial reach for many of our registrants. we’ve heard many of you express concerns about pay gaps, lack of employer-provided benefits, and other inequities and we are trying to do our part to help. by opening up our pockets or negotiating with service providers, we’ve recently added a number of other benefits and discounts for our registrants. current benefits include:
pathways to professionalism: discounted rates on professional development workshops and on-demand courses (with new opportunities coming soon) through our partnerships with acra, saa, and other professional organizations
job seeking tools: a professional profile that can help reach prospective employers, a job posting board that helps you find employers that are looking for registrants, and a database of regional or agency specific standards and guidelines to help brush up on local requirements
academic databases: free access to jstor and ehraf archaeology for scholarly articles and literature
swag: “print-on-demand” rpa clothing, hats, and other branded merch from land’s end
discounts: get 8% off field supply orders from forestry suppliers, and for your furry field techs, a discount on spot pet insurance (yes, that’s real!)
we are continually searching for ways that we can help provide services and benefits to our registrants. if you have ideas on how the register can leverage our resources to help offset rising costs of living or to bridge the gaps we face, we’re all ears. send your suggestions or questions to executive director michael o’toole (executivedirector@rpanet.org) or president lisa westwood, rpa (president@rpanet.org).
keep on digging!

ehraf archaeology access is now live!

                dina rivera (administrator)









understanding that obtaining research resources can be a challenge, the register began offering registrant access to jstor publications in 2021 and now are pleased to include yale's human relations area files for archaeology (ehraf archaeology) to assist our registrants in necessary archaeological research.
the goal of the human relations area files (hraf) is to foster an understanding of cultural diversity and commonality, both in the past and the present. to achieve this, they produce scholarly resources and infrastructure for research, teaching, and learning, and support and conduct original research on cross-cultural variation. the database is subject-indexed to the paragraph level by hraf anthropologists, according to hraf’s modified outline of cultural materials (ocm). this comprehensive subject retrieval system extends search capability well beyond keyword searching, allowing for precise subject retrieval.
ehraf archaeology is organized by regions and archaeological traditions. an archaeological tradition is defined as a group of populations sharing similar subsistence practices, technology, and forms of socio-political organization, which are spatially contiguous over a relatively large area and which endure temporally for a relatively long period. each tradition consists of a general summary and documents including books, journal articles, dissertations, and manuscripts.
we invite you to learn more about the traditions covered in the database and explore how ehraf archaeology can enhance your research.
explore the hraf access portal for more information!
we continue to look for ways to bring more benefits to your register engagement. please let us know if you have any suggestions, comments, or concerns!
