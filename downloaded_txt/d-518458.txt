profile of the winston student:parents choose winston for their children because traditional school programs have not been a fit for their child, and their child typically has not experienced consistent academic success. in addition, the prior academic environment has not provided the types of academic support the student requires to demonstrate their true academic potential. click here to learn more about our talented students.
