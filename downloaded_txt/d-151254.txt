old-fashioned valentine's day
saturday, february 15| 10:00–4:00
the air may be chilly, but the farm's wintery landscape is the perfect setting for a heartwarming valentine's day ride. couples can take a romantic spin in a two-seater sleigh or carriage pulled by a team of light workhorses. families can ride in a bobsled or hay wagon pulled by a handsome team of drafts. no matter the hitch, the horses will be wearing their finest bells.  

thank you for visiting! be sure to follow us on facebook instagram, and youtube for farm updates!
 

 
hands-on learning

ice harvestjanuary – februarylearn how people take advantage of the seasons to meet their year-round needs. what are the unique properties of ice and why are we cutting it now? use simple machines to cut, lift and store heavy blocks of ice. then come inside to explore the science of ice cream as you churn and sample a batch. maple sugaringjanuary – marchwhat is sap and why is it in the tree? can you tap any tree to make syrup?  enter the sugarbush areas to tap trees, collect sap, and learn about the different modern and historic sugaring methods used in the woods. at the sugar shack, see a working evaporator and learn how the final steps in the process have changed in the last century.
 
the farm staff will lead students on a brief walk between the sugar bush and the barnyard, while teaching ways to identify different species of trees. in the barnyard, cut and split the firewood needed to boil sap into syrup.  finally, walk through the open-hearth kitchen and see pancakes being made with flour ground from wheat grown right on the farm...and take one with you to taste with syrup you helped make.
