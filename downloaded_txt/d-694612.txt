new ai model deciphers the code in proteins that tells them where to go







artificial intelligence



february 06, 2025







whitehead institute member richard young and colleagues have created a machine learning model that can predict in which cellular compartments a protein will reside, generate proteins to reside in a desired compartment, and detect disease mutations that alter cellular compartments, with implications for understanding and remedying disease.

a planarian’s guide to growing a new head







development and regeneration



february 06, 2025







the lab of whitehead institute member peter reddien describes how planarians use the delta-notch signaling pathway to adjust the spatial pattern and relative numbers of neurons and glia at a given location. this allows the organisms to restore large portions of their nervous system following injury.

foundational research uncovers the biological processes key to understanding health and disease.




foundational research — as opposed to applied research — is research conducted not to solve a specific problem, but to satisfy a driving curiosity about the unknown. seemingly simple queries, such as ‘how do cells divide?’ or ‘how can plants control how their genes are expressed?’ can pave the way for more applied research in therapeutics, cancer biology and genetics, and open up vast new fields of study that reshape the way we understand biology.

multidisciplinary science is key to addressing challenges of modern society.




since its beginnings in 1982, whitehead institute has explored the core questions that underlie our basic understanding of biology. and while our mission remains the same, much has changed in the intervening decades; new research tools allow our scientists to look deeper and design better experiments than ever before. the more we understand about how biological systems work, the better we can design informed and effective therapies and treatments to meet the challenges of modern society.

research areas

nervous system development and function


whitehead institute researchers are making important insights into the biology of the brain, from how it develops to what goes awry in neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders.














image
 

















cell renewal


our researchers seek to understand how our cells and tissues renew and replenish themselves. they investigate how the molecules and specialized structures inside of our cells work in concert with each other, in a precisely choreographed dance, to ensure that biological processes happen when and how they should.














image
 

















cancer 


cancer is a disease, or set of diseases, in which abnormal cells in the body experience uncontrolled growth. cancer biology is complex, with many potential factors contributing to a given cancer’s development and outcome. researchers at whitehead institute are investigating the fundamental biology of cancer cells and have helped drive steady advances in biomedicine’s understanding of cancer, contributing to innovative strategies in both diagnosis and therapy.














image
 

















regeneration, rejuvenation and aging


our researchers are investigating important questions about how organisms develop —how does one generation beget the next? how does a single cell give rise to a complex organism?—and, with the help of new tools and innovative approaches, revealing answers that give us a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of life.














image
 

















plant biology


whitehead institute researchers are shedding light on the intricacies of plant biology in order to provide insights into plant development that could contribute to improved crop yield and global food security; discover plant-derived medicines and other valuable natural products; and improve our fundamental understanding of biological processes, including gene regulation and protein folding.














image
 

















infectious disease


our researchers are working to understand the biology underlying infectious diseases and the microbes and viruses behind them, using innovative genetic approaches and  new tools and methods.














image
 

















innovation centers


whitehead institute’s core facilities set it apart. the cores, staffed by experts and providing state-of-the-art instrumentation and tools, allow our scientists to pursue more ambitious investigations.














image
 

















circuits and pathways


when genes and their functions are considered within the context of what they do and how they interact broadly, important aspects of our biology can become clear. our researchers study individual genes, but they also study how networks of genes and gene regulators interact. similarly, they study not only what occurs within one cell, but how groups of cells interact. 














image
 

















tool development


as our researchers seek to answer novel questions about fundamental biology, health, and disease, sometimes they find that the tools needed to answer those questions do not exist. in these cases, they must invent new tools–or tailor existing tools–in order to make new discoveries.












 




our community

our campus


located in the biotech and biomedical research hub of kendall square, the whitehead institute campus features five floors of laboratory space, as well as state-of-the-art facilities for genomics, computing, microscopy and more.
