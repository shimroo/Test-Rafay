what questions should i ask a child care provider?

 










what ages does bright horizons in san jose serve in its child care program?


open


most of our san jose child care centers serve children ages six weeks to six years. bright horizons is more than daycare. we have programs with developmentally appropriate curriculum for infants, toddler, preschool and pre-k.










i've looked at other child care solutions in san jose with long waitlists. what if i want to enroll at a san jose bright horizons center but space is not available?


open


you can select and register with up to three bright horizons child care locations, including the center in which you are most interested. by registering, you are confirming interest in all three centers. once registered, we will add you to our waitlist and offer you a space as soon as one becomes available. our goal is to accommodate families as soon as space allows, and so during the entire process, we will keep in touch with you regarding your status. while waiting for a space to become available at the first-choice location, many families enroll at their second or third choices temporarily until space becomes available at their first-choice centers. enrolling at another location will not only solve your immediate child care needs, but will provide you priority access to your first preference.










what is the background check process for all staff at bright horizons san jose child care centers?


open


bright horizons conducts comprehensive background checks on all prospective employees and frequent visitors. in san jose, the state of ca department of youth and families requires background checks for employees of a daycare or licensed child care facility.
