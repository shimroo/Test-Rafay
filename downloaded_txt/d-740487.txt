our mission

parrots international is an all-volunteer organization. our board of directors involves a diverse team of individuals with a wide range of talents, experiences, knowledge and education. the team is dedicated to the conservation of endangered parrot species and improving the welfare of both companion parrots and parrots in the wild. we are committed to remaining non-partisan, above "eco-politics" and working cooperatively with other conservation organizations for the maximum benefit of the birds.
