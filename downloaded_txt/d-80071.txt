na hawai’i






welcome to the narcotics anonymous hawai’i website.
this site is administered on behalf of the narcotics anonymous groups in the state of hawaii through its’ hawaii regional service committee (hrsc).
on this site we publish information about narcotics anonymous in hawaii such as our meeting schedules,  our regional convention, area gatherings,  social activities, our vision and mission statements, and how to contact narcotics anonymous in hawaii.
we also post on this website the daily readings for addicts: just for today and a spiritual principle a day.
if you are submitting an update for a meeting, use our change form here. 
if you are submitting a hawaii na event for posting to the website, use our submission form here.
for na events outside of hawaii, use our feedback form to send that information.
be advised that “narcotics anonymous”, the stylized initials na (appearing alone, within a single or double circle) and the diamond within a circle symbol are registered trademarks of narcotics anonymous world services, inc., and are used by permission.
mahalo nui loa,

the hawaiian sea turtle, or honu, is a symbol for longevity in hawaiian culture.  in narcotics anonymous, recovery is not a momentary event; recovery is a life long testament to living happy, joyous and free from active addiction.
