exploring larger reality and experiential context


welcome to current version of 
  the leading edge international research group website, which has had quite a 
  varied history and evolution over the years since it began in 1998. since 
  1977, we have conducted explorations and analyses of experiential reality at
      various levels and published books (primarily the matrix book series, 
  which began with us in 1987) and the leading edge international research journal
      (150 months) which detailed ongoing findings. the production of various
      books began in 1988
      with "the matrix: understanding planetary power structures",
  followed by other volumes over the years that were the result of the
      examination of various major experiential dynamics in civilization, taking
  into consideration what had been discovered previously. from 1988 to 1998, all
  of our research was consolidated into these books and publications, which were
  available to researchers worldwide. from
      1999 on, there was a focus on the nature of higher reality, which yielded 
  the matrix 5
      series, beginning with "the quest of the spirit - the ultimate 
  frontier", through the use of out-of-body experience 
  and exploration on advanced levels of reality. after 22 years,  we stopped publishing
      books in 2011, and our focus then turned exclusively to managing the 
  leading edge research journal online (below) which began in 2006 as a
      conceptually expanded online reincarnation of the le research journal, as well as the
      continued exploration of higher dynamics of the context of our existence 
  with the matrix v material. we 
  also simplified this main page for the site.


 leading edge international research journal
      online


 if you have a 
	  pc, ms/mac
      (or android with opera mini android browser), this is the  ultimate
 way  to stay informed about what is happening. if you're a
	  
	  polymath, you will really appreciate the span of ongoing information. for more than a decade, the
      le journal online has been the 
      best evaluative tool available for the astute 'observer', one who is a non-participant in events but takes notes and evaluates, who wishes to
      look much deeper at developing events and situations in order to see the
      roots of ongoing issues and dynamics.  articles are viewable through the printfriendly®

      proxy, which largely eliminates ads, cookies and unnecessary bells and
      whistles, and has options to enlarge text size for those who need 
      help reading, as well as printing, creating a pdf or emailing the article,
      making the experience safer and the time more productive. extensive
      archives provide the opportunity for subscribers to do deeper
      research. 
      

typically more than 1200+ news articles, videos and other items from
      168
      sources are reviewed as a total package, daily, allowing the selection and, after 
      analysis and relational aggregation, presentation
      of the  most informative, relevant ongoing distillation which reflects
      significant changes in 18 different categories  (see
      left, below) which encompass  all
      the changing dynamics on and off the planet. furthermore, it embodies
      'relational analysis' of ongoing dynamics which uncovers latent
      information and info relationships not usually realized. having a eidetic memory
      for events and a creative drive to do this makes the website indispensable.
    we would enjoy
      your support. try it - you'll love it.

"mobile
    applications: i have an android, and i switched to the opera mini android browser, and the journal is
    easy to read, as opera optimizes text within each window for best readability on mobile screen.
    opera is said to be a private browsing alternative to google  products.  so far it works great.
    i found that by installing 'duck duck go' search engine into whatever mobile browser i'm using, the online journal works perfectly, and all the 
    text is resized for optimal mobile device viewing and scrolling.
    also glad to have found a solution that works, and to use more non-tracked,
      non-google applications."

"this website is wonderfully overwhelming in the amount of information it provides--like standing in front of 18 different television screens with 18 different awesome shows on at once.  i've decided to start working my way through the matrix 5 material while glancing at the other "screens" for now, because that information is where i have been focusing for a bit, and then start integrating some kind of approach to taking in the rest of the info.  overall, i am beyond satisfied with the site--the astrological considerations are an extra nice touch!
      i plan to be watching these screens for a long time... thank you again for making this available." 2/14/18


"you sure do a great job - your research - the site's perpetual improvement - the pics and
      videos. i enjoy it very much, i like the diversity of subjects from financial to humor (almost the same sometimes), from space to
      underground-sea, etc. thank you for your creativity and your funny notes and
      comments!" 


"i have logged in and had a look around, the content is impressive
      ... treasure hidden in all corners." 


"thanks again for all your hard work and of course your comments, which often make me giggle (which is very much needed these days) i go onto the journal website a few times a day/night and look forward to it greatly. its very miserable here in the uk, not just weather wise but 'people wise' - i shall be so glad when
      i'm out of here."


"just want to let u know that it isn't said enough, nor do you seek it, but; nice job on the web site. its really great how fast you can target a
      topic! the expansions are great. its one stop shopping on issues and trends! so thanks, for the work u put in on this."

      "thanks for providing and allowing access to exciting and truly educational information."


"i've wanted to sign up for the online leirg for
      while, so i was quick to take advantage of this current "open enrollment" period. i'm very familiar with your work, as i picked up
      the matrix series years ago. the caliber of your research is impressive and
      i've always found your analyses timely, educational (but sometimes shocking), inspirational
      and fascinating ..."   

"it's incredible, val. i was amazed at the quantity of information on the site and i love how it's very well organized. i just finished reading about half of the advanced matrix 5 material near the bottom of the website, and now i'm just about to begin simultaneously reading the matrix 5 volume 4 & 5 editions. i greatly look forward to continuing to learn from the massive amount of information on the site." 
       

"thank you for all you do! i really appreciate the effort you put into the site and the content available."

"wow! thank you so much val. i know you must put alot of time and energy into the journal and i really appreciate this. it is my first item of the day to see what's going on around the planet. although, some days i am disappointed i "wake up" in the physical at all however, your sense of humor does help lighten the load along with witty insight."

"i have been following your work/leirg since the 90's and appreciate all your hard work and commitment in sharing information and helping me to grasp the wider picture of my/our time here."

" what else can i say, leading edge is a masterpiece of work that helps me navigate in a very ' interesting world'.
      my eyes are rolling so much that i must be extra vigilant while i'm driving."

"so much happening so fast it makes you go out of your mind. your site is really helpful on condensing current observations with little searching needed. so thanks for your efforts in all you do it is appreciated!" 
"i have just subscribed to your on-line journal and i must say, it is
      mighty impressive, comprehensive and vast, so much information,  you're right.... it is the best on the
      web. thank you so much for all your effort, this must be a 'full-time' project for you, i will spend many hours here...... well worth the money.
      i especially like your 'side/notes/comments ;-)" 
"thank you for your continuing work in bringing the best to your readership. you do a fantastic and very useful job."
"your work is invaluable to me and it helps me keep track of unfolding events in endgame. on a side note, the website is fabulous on an ipad, really easier to read than on my laptop."
 "i've really enjoyed the content on the site lately.  its always been good, but it seems
      even better.  i've taken more of an interest in world affairs, especially since the election, and now the changing of the guard.  thanks for the time and effort you put in, the journal is definitely my favorite website.  i will continue to subscribe as long as the rock still spins and we're all here.  with any degree of luck, check out time isn't that far off."   

"spending time on the journal everyday is the highlight of my day. once again thank you very much for your dedication regarding your website. words cannot express how much i really feel about all the time and hard work in giving your members such balanced info.." 

 "we especially want to tell you how much we
      very much appreciate all your hard work for the site, and its content, which is really crucial during endgame.  its amazing, the diversity of all the stuff you come up with, so thanks! your site is the 1st thing we look at in the morning over coffee, its fun to discuss, and watch the cool videos." 

"at first sight....it is an overwhelming
      amount of info, i am going to stay all night just to get the basics of it... :-)"


"i just wanted to pass along my gratitude to you for the website and the books. 
      without doubt, it's the very best website i have ever had the privilege to use. thank
      you for making this website available.  endgame? bring it on! ...
      with a side of tacos."


"wow! an overwhelming volume of superior quality material, including so many very absorbing videos and documentaries, and so much else that i have not even begun to explore. pretty damn good for 50 cents a day!"


"every time i visit le online, i feel like i am opening a present."

"your site is
      assuredly singular, invaluable, and illimitable within its superiority to
      others which attempt a similar panoramic multi-system surveillance
      perspective."
"val, thanks for all your hard work and for all of your insights into this plot. it has been an interesting journey here and you have been a great part of that."

"val, you alone put to shame the
      multimillion dollar budget corporate news. your work shows what a very
      advanced incarnation can do when really spirit-oriented: illustrious
      achievements. your site continues to provide consistent and reliable
      information and, very importantly, helps to keep the focus in these
      difficult times."  

"i really have been enjoying your web site. things seem to be getting more hectic every day. i'm glad that i have had time to read, think and understand what is going on. who said being unemployed is a bad thing? much of the information on your site has made a great observer out of me and has made it much more fun to agitate. luckily i have always had a good sense of humor, because people are so damn funny.
      keep up the great work." 

your website is one really awesome
      creation. this is mind-boggling stuff

"great site!! thank you for all you do,
      it is a real service to me and is what's needed in these volatile
      times."
"i have never seen a site with this much information from all over the world.
      i think you've done a top notch job val, really. although it was my first time i saw info on topics i never found before and as i get used to browsing around it'll be my morning coffee site of choice. and i will talk to a couple people about what you offer after i can get the bigger picture and send them your way.
      really great work."
"thank you for your hard work, consistency and patience to keep us informed."
"i just wanted to express my appreciation for the effort you put into this service; it definitely cuts down on the amount of time i spend to get my news and i have to confess that i am better informed than i was previous to reading the online journal. the best part, of course, are your comments! it's nice to have your advanced perspective."

      "i have started browsing the online journal and just wanted to thank you for all the work you've put into the site and also especially for making the matrix v materials available, which have greatly assisted me in my perspective and experience in this incarnation. i had been reluctant to subscribe before because of the cost, but now i see that it is more than worth it for the amount of information provided. i would also like to take you up on your offer for the free astrological report, which is not a subject i have studied in much depth, but i look forward to delving into it deeper and seeing what insights it may provide for me.
      thanks again and i look forward to exploring all that your site has to offer."  
"thank you for all
      the extraordinary and superb work! your work in keeping up the website is very much appreciated. the site is just a goldmine of information, either directly or through its links."

the leirj just keeps getting better and better, now that i've found another
      job until the crash it is real easy to catch up on the latest, scanning through
      the journal. the information is easy to find and the dates are highlighted
      as to remember the last visit. to me, it's worth more than it costs. you
      do an excellent job finding the best data
      related to endgame."


"val.. without your leading edge site, i would be still grasping around for answers to the conundrum of what
      this world is about. now it is clear as a bell on many levels"  

"i personally feel you are still doing an outstanding job, given the milieu and stasis of concurrent 'events' and their relative myriad sourced and perspective journalistic "offal" that are at your disposal....i am in utter awe of all of your work....logging into the leading edge research online journal is, admittedly, one of the few things i look forward to each awakening
      'day' "  

"i greatly appreciate all the effort you put into leading edge online. just
      like the whole matrix series it is such a standout aggregation of
      information, insight and enlightenment. a particularly useful aspect is
      how the subject matters are titled and structured. no where else across the internet do you see such balanced insight"  

"the website is awesome; the epitome of diligent, and thorough research."

"your website is my front row seat. really appreciate all you do. awaiting the finale!"  

"i have enjoyed the your fantastic journal
      daily. i consider it my go to site for necessary important information about what is truly going on in the world and what and who is really behind it
      all, and the complete picture. end game seems to be getting stranger and more interesting by the day.
      i must stay upon things as they unfold. thank you for keeping me truly informed. i appreciate it immensely.  
"i'm just speechless about the huge quantity of hot topics and high quality sources you are offering and (renewing on a daily basis). the day would need to have 48 hours for me to sort out and digest all the jewels you have to offer. i didn't expect this huge library, i thought the online journal would be kind of like a news-summary like the 100 pages of the old printed journals you once published (from which i bought most of it). anyway, big surprise to me."
"i frequent many pages on the web but the leading edge journal leaves my usual "go to" sites in the dust."

it's like ive hit
      the accelerator button on information. it's nice to see the many different
      sides to what's going on at the present time. also the astrological
      considerations are a great read."
you're doing a sterling job plucking "readable material out of the morass that is going on". in the last 4/5 years it's been getting increasingly difficult to find anything remotely readable, never mind truly interesting. the information gatekeepers are working overtime!" 

  



 in addition,  we present in the leading edge research journal online
      a summary of existential perspectives with reference to the endgame period and a
      larger contextual perspective, so that
      situations, news stories and events can be viewed from the most accurate and expansive perspective
      possible, making things understandable in ways you may have never
      imagined before.  try it. you'll like it. it's the best one-stop shop 
	  where you can discover your own nature, the nature of reality and keep 
	  tabs on what's happening, because its nice to know who you really are and 
	  the actual context of your existence, since western civilization, like 28 
	  civilizations before it, is
	  collapsing, and everyone will be moving on 
	  soon, well within a few decades. the matrix 5 project goes into detail 
	  about what else happens.

 the matrix 5 material (2000-2017) (see below on this page) goes into 
	  detail about the actual context of our 
	  existence here, and many relevent details from that project (1998-2017) 
	  are discussed on the site. 

of course, when 
	  you know who you really are and what the real context of your presence 
	  here is, there is really only one way to look at things. you can become 
	  detached from specific outcomes in world events and still know precisely 
	  what is going on. author robert 
	  monroe had something interesting to say about a reasonable way to view 
	  what is happening now, in one of his books: "... get through (over) being 
	  angry at how the system on earth works - the seeming inequities, the 
	  unfair advantages, the brutalities, the callousness, the deceit. it's a 
	  predator world by design -- and it's a superb teaching environment " 
	  - "remember that your ultimate goal is not "physical survival". thus, 
	  while it is valid that you are here to do certain things, and there are 
	  functions you must perform to do them, you don't need to be desperate 
	  about it. accidents may happen, but you cannot lose; you have had the 
	  experience ..." - "maintain your transient status. you are here, being 
	  'human', at your own option in the strictest sense. --robert monroe, 
	  ultimate journey, p.89-90
 

see examples
      of article convention
      and style  as seen on the website.

 obviously,
      all websites rely on existential factors which statistically are bound to
      change at any point in the future, like the status of the internet, the
      computer equipment which creates and maintains everything, and the 
	  continued existence here of specific individuals.

q: "i have just a question: when i downloaded google chrome and use your site, the message comes up under the bar with your address: not secure . ive not seen that before for your site, and wondered if you can comment on this." 
      a: only websites that take personal financial information have a
      need to be 'secure'. this website doesn't have a need to do that. google has
      arbitrarily decided for itself that 'all websites' should start
      with https (which websites that take credit card or personal information
      of that nature would use) instead of the usual http.  when you log in, put the
      password in first (ignoring the 'warning'), then put your usename in, and
      click login. it's a mild annoyance. other browsers don't try to force the arbitrary
      issue.

"i will surely enjoy this web site. when 
	  i saw robert monroe on the outside site i was intrigued. i have his books 
	  and read them. i also have the gateway cds. i have been studying the 
	  ongoing insanity of the globalists for over 40 years, so this will be most 
	  interesting. thank you." 1/12/25

"the lerjo is the best portal for 
	  quality information on the internet, lots of great articles, videos and 
	  links. the mainstream media is obviously garbage, and even the 
	  'alternative' media is largely contaminated with trivial, partisan, 
	  polarity rubbish and hidden agendas. if you look at too much of it, it's 
	  easy to get depressed and feel like you need to take a mental shower. it's 
	  important to view events in the world from the highest perspective 
	  possible. the truth has a certain vibration to it, and there's something 
	  about the energy of the lerjo site - it just feels 'cleaner' if that makes 
	  sense. i recommend it." 8/27/24 
	  australia
"the information you provide is the 
	  best source and of the highest level on earth. thank you for all your hard 
	  work and creativity!" ." 7/03/24
"i get excited at leirg every night, and 
	  on weekends when i can read/listen and catch up on stories and videos. 
	  you've opened my eyes to so many excellent links and sites, and you give 
	  great insight of how stories relate to matrix v and the 
	  simultaneous/sequential world we live in. leirg helps me feel connected, 
	  and i appreciate all you do." 6/12/24
"i want to thank you for all your 
	  efforts and writings over the years. it has helped me understand and 
	  function on this planet! many thanks!!! all the research from 
	  understanding how we are manipulated by physical substances to 
	  psychological operations and how to function in an observer state has 
	  increased my awareness.  i honor you for what you do and have done! 
	  thanks." 3/07/24
"its nice to have someone of like mind 
	  in our life's journey!! your website is awesome, still amazes us all the 
	  info you put up." 1/24/24
"thank you for all your dedication, 
	  focus and creative efforts." 12/07/23
"it's good to get back on the lerjo. i 
	  spend hours online everyday trying to learn as much as i can, while i can. 
	  there are lots of good websites with good information, but usually with a 
	  lot of rubbish mixed in with it, so it's easy to get distracted. the lerjo 
	  cuts through all the crap and just gives you the best stuff, much more 
	  than i could ever find by myself. it's quite overwhelming at first, 
	  there's so much stuff on here, you couldn't possibly read all of it. also, 
	  you get access to the invaluable matrix materials, which you won't find 
	  anywhere else. don't worry about the cost, this is the best site of its 
	  kind there is, and if it helps you to access the highest quality 
	  information and clarify and enhance your perception of reality, it's well 
	  worth it."

"the information in the leading edge 
	  international research journal is invaluable. your hard work , executive

	  for your work and daily creative efforts."

 "thanks for amazing things on 
	  trufax.org that get me through another day! specifically, eric berg, dc, 
	  who has some great videos which i watched last night and tonight. my 
	  daughter has kidney disease and these were more than reminders to me, they 
	  offered new information to me, like the benfortiamine. very motivating to 
	  me to get back on track! i'm more open to suggestions, i would say, and 
	  not immediately dismissive of things like i was before. some kind of 
	  growth there!! so thanks for all that! and then ricky gervais, so funny, 
	  enjoyed him too. my daughter turned 31 and we had a birthday party for 
	  her, which we hadn't done in a few years. one moment at a time. clif high 
	  and suspicious observers and so many sites with real news. many thanks for 
	  your contributions that keep me going."

	  to keep on top of things and to focus on current events, with maximizing 
	  the time i want to spend on all the changes happening. it's perfect for 
	  those of us who are gemini, wanting to know something about everything! " 
6/20/22
"i always look at the star rating you 
	  give, and i pay particularly close attention to anything you give the 
	  recently-created "4 stars". i may know the end of this saga before anyone 
	  else i know because of your diligence and open-mindedness. so, thank you 
	  again for all your hard work on this project of yours. it is second to 
	  none." 5/6/22
"trufax is my favorite daily site that i 
	  appreciate. i really enjoyed the recent "mystery writer" for what he said; 
	  some of my questions were answered and i was encouraged with the details. 
	  you are doing a wonderful service for all of us who take great value in 
	  this connection with you and leading edge". 1/6/22
"as i expected, your site is very 
	  impressive. i don't think i could ever read more than a fraction of it, 
	  but i'll do my best. thanks val for all the work you've done over the 
	  years, it's much appreciated. 1/6/22
"i appreciate all the effort you put 
	  into this site that seems to get better and better. with great 
	  appreciation. 1/5/22
"thank you. i have received the 
	  login. i have been scrolling through the site for the last few hours it is 
	  all mind blowing."

"the le website is completely 
	  unique on the internet. it has a massive amount of useful information and 
	  more than anyone could ever expect. the way it is presented and broken 
	  down into categories that maybe at first glance don't seem related, but 
	  most definitely are, has a way of giving the conscious reader a resonant 
	  glimpse into the way a very advanced individual sees this complex 
	  'reality'. even if one found all the same news (a herculean task) and read 
	  it, it would not include the overall integral view from a higher 
	  perspective in such an elegant way. val is very busy giving those of us 
	  aspiring toward such a view at this time a most wonderful gift. the gift 
	  of wisdom if viewed with awareness. shift your awareness toward your 
	  higher self and read, view and listen to what is happening on this 
	  wondrous site, and somehow the horror of the situation becomes a 
	  comprehensible and necessary culmination of our great desire to spiral 
	  ever onward and upwards. instead of being upset, angry or depressed we can 
	  see the absolutely unspeakable and glorious vistas spread out before us in 
	  all their infinite grandeur. there is no other site like it. join the 
	  celebration!" 

	  9/19/21
"we want to let you know how much we 
	  appreciate all the creativity, work and critical information that goes 
	  into the le website. we are long time subscribers, because there is 
	  literally nothing else like your website on the internet! your daily 
	  posting of current news stories, videos and related pdf file information 
	  obtained from numerous worldwide sources covering a huge variety of 
	  interests is truly a "sight" to behold. its the first thing we look at in 
	  the morning over coffee to get caught up on the day's events. there are so 
	  many thought-provoking categories on your site. the le website provides a wide 
	  array of subjects and information from alternative websites, with the 
	  source links posted, and is an incredible time saver for the person who 
	  wants to stay informed." 

	  9/08/21
"im very grateful for the m5 project, 
	  the leoj and your helpful observations. thank you!" 

	  8/09/21
please accept our best wishes for the 
	  continuation of your life's work. heartfelt gratitude."

"besides leading edge and matrix v , i 
	  thank you for sorting through all the videos and articles, keeping me a 
	  bit saner with what's actually going on." 

	  7/16/21
"thank you for all you do! there's no 
	  element of reality that you don't cover." 
	  6/27/21
"wow, the prediction for a really bad 
	  endgame ending was definitely cited many times in the matrix v books. now 
	  we are in the midst of this, holding on to our hats." 
	  6/25/21
"thank you for your continued work. good 
	  to know people like you are out there." 
	  6/01/21
"i enjoy all of your articles. thanks 
	  for the true news. i wish you the best." 
5/30/21
"thanks for all the news. i am so glad 
	  to have your site available every single day, and glad to be reading from 
	  matrix v material daily, just the best." 
5/22/21
"much more material than i realized 
	  there would be. looking forward to digging in even more. thanks and 
	  blessings to you for everything." 
5/16/21
"have had a nice time getting used to 
	  your site. congrats to you too, you've done a fantastic job." 
5/11/21
"i am grateful for all that you do to 
	  keep us well informed. i have been a reader of your site since i 
	  discovered it in the late 90s in my mid-twenties and have purchased some 
	  of the le published research volumes. there are so many people who are 
	  ill-informed as to what is going on in these strange times and i am 
	  definitely going to keep subscribing for as long as the journal is 
	  available. my two favourite segments are the american vagabond and 
	  suspicious observers. the astrological segment is also quite eye opening 
	  for me, and the other well curated items are always on point." 4/24/21
"i felt special with access to the lerg 
	  collection of best articles, no subscription meant there were great gaps 
	  in  what the world watched. recent reading i find names of other good 
	  journalists i read." 4/20/21
"just the best stuff online is from you. 
	  thank you." 4/01/21
"love reading the astrology written by 
	  people who know the matrix v material. great to be connected." 1/30/21
"thank you for all your hard work 
	  with bringing important information to the forefront that you have with 
	  the online journal." 1/2/21
"thank goodness for matrix v and leirg. 
	  can't thank you enough for providing all the information and resources 
	  that have brought me to where i am now. you have provided a service that 
	  has led me to a very different place than i could ever have imagined, 
	  tough as it has been at times." 6/24/20
"thanks for the most truth full 
	  information on planet earth."  
	  6/20/20
"i greatly appreciate access to 
	  your comprehensive and penetrating research." 
 
	  5/19/20
"having a lot of fun. you weren't 
	  kidding about a lot of info on your site. you've done a really good job 
	  separating the "wheat from the chaff"." 
 
	  5/16/20
"the leading edge online journal 
	  has been integral to my ability to chart a course through the chaotic 
	  shoals of these penultimate chapter(s) of endgame. indubitably, the most 
	  spiritually advanced information on the planet. additionally,some of the 
	  the x-22 peripheral, or tangential observations have been very helpful in 
	  providing information i probably would not have been aware of otherwise 
	  about things going on behind the scenes." 
 
	  5/4/20
"thanks for your recent inputs re 
	  the pandemic. those articles are some of the best that ive seen so far. 
	  your ongoing trufax.org links are really helping to illuminate the shadows 
	  cast by the main stream media. lately ive been trying to make more sense 
	  out of the many local articles showing up on the internet. weird. a lot of 
	  articles, local, national, and international are clearly misrepresenting 
	  the facts and fearmongering. meanwhile the powers that be are clearly 
	  jockeying to gain strategic gain for the near future. the game continues. 
	  hope i got enough popcorn." 
	  4/6/20
" i've found your material to be 
	  uniquely insightful and a welcome respite from cfr-filtered media feeds. i 
	  appreciate your focus, diligence and excellence." 
	  4/6/20
"sure am glad you are still here as 
	  endgame progresses. it would be way more boring without the journal, 
	  thanks." 
	  2/14/20
"just want you to know we think of 
	  you every day, when we read the website. (which you are doing a fantastic 
	  job with,and we thoroughly enjoy & appreciate! ) so much great stuff on 
	  the website! we really like the vids from rt news & others, helps keep us 
	  current, as we rarely watch mainstream, but once in a while to catch the 
	  propaganda." 
	  1/28/20
"wow, almost 20 years since finding 
	  leading edge and still the best site for advanced learning, prepping for 
	  the next stage of experience." 
	  1/1/20
"i appreciate the effort you put in 
	  to create a single collection of information that helps many of us 
	  understand the global dynamics going on and aid with progress on our 
	  individuals paths." 
	  12/30/19
"i like the system very much. on a 
	  practical level, i find the scrollable topic sections to be an excellent 
	  navigational format. regarding the material itself, the news articles are 
	  thoroughly and precisely curated and definitely take me deeper in my 
	  realizations of "what's going on". regarding the m material posted 
	  therein...i am starving for this information and read and reread it. i 
	  don't reread it for lack of understanding, but rather because each time i 
	  do, i glean more personal insight...peeling back the onion, so to speak. 
	  thank you." 
	  11/11/19
"i have been reading your books 
	  since around 1992 and my spiritual maturity level definitely was 
	  influenced by your books. without you and the author this worlds current 
	  events would be scary but now i am just an observer. i always trust in my 
	  higher self." 
	  10/7/19
"we really enjoy & appreciate how 
	  much work you put into the website and love all the plethora of stories/ 
	  current events you come up with. you make it easy to stay current." 
	  9/26/19
"thank you val, for your diligent, 
	  exceptional work. you keep us in "the know" like no other." 
	  9/9/19
" ... sometimes i 
	  step back and get an overview of your site and it really is a fascinating 
	  vision, like looking through a kaleidoscope gone crazy to an exponential 
	  degree. things really are getting interesting. :o your site provides the 
	  most comprehensive view available anywhere and your time and attention to 
	  detail are greatly appreciated!" 
      7/20/19
"i just want to express 
	  my appreciation for all you do. you seem to get better and better. i so 
	  enjoyed the recent bob lazar interview. what a trio of good thinkers with such insights. i could go on 
	  and on about the variety of observations by different thinkers that you 
	  make so readily available to us (and your own apropos notes) to assist 
	  our understanding of the phenomenal changes going on at the world level, 
	  and especially the us. i read the decline and fall of the roman empire 
	  and found many parallels with the current us situation. by the way, the 
	  article about trumps birth chart was also fascinating. many, many 
	  thanks."
      6/24/19
"i am so committed 
	  to leirg and all it has to offer. it is never boring and the sites i 
	  really like always have something interesting. continued learning. you do 
	  a fantastic and conscientious job bringing the world to us."
      4/08/19
"thank you for 
	  providing this invaluable information and knowledge. i am so grateful for 
	  your service."
      4/05/19
"from what little 
	  ive seen so far, i suspect that ill be spending quite a bit of time at 
	  your site peering through this version of reality. thanks for all of the 
	  hard work and effort that youve put into your books and webpages."
      2/01/19
"working my way 
	  through the videos from suspicious observers, and am seeing the unique 
	  position we are in to learn about earth's possible ending... while we are 
	  here. it's presented very well and is quite fantastic, to say the least. 
	  thanks so much."
      1/28/19
"thanks for your 
	  enduring and valuable work in these difficult times!"
      1/21/19
"so much on 
	  trufax.org is mind blowing. i could retreat back to my little world and 
	  pretend it is not happening, but each night i step out of my comfort zone 
	  and i log on to see the truth. i read the articles and your notes. i watch 
	  videos and take it in. but i mainly connect with my higher self and i feel 
	  the trust that has developed over time, a lifeline in a crazy world, that 
	  has become something so tremendous that words can't do justice. my eyes 
	  keep opening with all that is presented on your site."
      1/1/19
"thank you for all your hard work in bringing all the information out that you have; it is amazing to say the least, of how much progress my incarnation has made as a result of your information. i continue to increase my perception and connection to my higher self, the journey continues..."
      12/23/18
"i am so grateful to 
	  you for all of your time and diligence in providing the most salient 
	  information to those of use out here who live quietly but with purpose. 
	  the information you provide clears a path for us to follow without 
	  becoming enmeshed in the chaos. it is true, there is nothing else like 
	  your website - it is a wellspring of information from which each of us can 
	  reach in and utilize the 'tools' you provide for discerning the landscape 
	  of this aspect of living. it is with a full heart that i move through my 
	  journey. your site is such a gift to us all. thank you for all that you do 
	  for everyone. "
      12/02/18
"great work on the site, as always!"
      11/11/18

      10/13/18
"thanks for my subscription. i appreciate the research you do!" 
      8/18/18
"i am enjoying my subscription a lot so far, a lot of great sources.
      great site btw." 8/16/18
"it's just a treasure trove of activities for sequentials as outlined.!  i still cannot believe what is happening, but am truly grateful for your site." 
      8/16/18
"thanks for all your hard work.  the best in the galaxy." 
      8/09/18
"thank you for adding your comments that act as reminders of where we are in all this.
      there are moments that the worry overrides what i know to be true. and then there you are with a sentence or two that relieves my discomfort." 
      8/01/18
"i am delighted to see that you've given me access to something of this magnitude"
      7/24/18
"some of the articles you post resonate deeply with me. some are educational, like nutrition and vax info, while others are philosophical about the current world situation and touch me as truth.  i don't always write you but i am very grateful." 
      6/08/18
"thank you! really appreciate you and your work!" 
      6/01/18
"you are one of the few who really understands what is going on in this endgame. and lets us know!" 
      5/03/18
"many thanks for your continuous hard work from your wonderful website." 
      5/02/18

      things are happening. thank you for all the postings." 
      4/26/18
"there are so many excellent postings on your website......thanks again for all your hard work, (and your great news commentary!) we love having all the news at our fingertips on your site." 
      4/16/18
"i look forwards to enjoying this site... i have had the pleasure of reading all the
    matrix volumes and love the information. thank you for navigating through all the news  and all other information as you do. brilliant!" 
    3/23/18
"i am really enjoying the content - the articles are well chosen and your commentary is informed. the nature of our reality is quite disturbing, but i appreciate having an understanding of the world around me and the agenda at play. i also really like that i can just go to the one place to stay updated as opposed to constantly sifting through junk online. thank you for all the effort you have put into to site."
    3/5/18
     
    "the website is easy to navigate and i love how its archived. the one click easy print button is my favorite feature. any article that has key evidence on important topics
    i send to work and print out in a hard copy/archive it away. this way, while i am busy "red pilling"/waking people up, if someone accuses me of spreading nonsense and says "produce evidence", i just reach in my drawer (divided into sections), pull out the articles, and teach them a thing or two. this also makes it easier to timeline and link past/present events that would otherwise look like they have nothing to do with one another. google is indeed ramping up their censorship, so i feel it is very important to have these resources cited/saved/hard copied. i appreciate all of the time you spend gathering all of this into one location and keeping it ad free.
    keep up the great work and thank you." 
2/27/18
"i'm continuing to love the material you put up on the site. lionel nation and unz.com are two outstanding resources that i have begun to frequent, and i may not have found them it wasn't for your site. wonderful analysis from you, as well, bringing it all into frame within the big picture.
    thanks again." 
2/26/18
"my dad died yesterday. he was 89 and had altzheimer's a few years.
    it's because of matrix v and leading edge that i have been able to come to terms and understand what is really happening with death and the bigger picture of higher self.
    our story continues; thank you for trufax.org" 
2/1/18
"thanks for all your hard work val, appreciated as always"
    1/29/18
" i appreciate so much what you do to assistance us to make sense of the information maze."
    1/24/18
"thank you for your
    hard work. your site is one of the few sources i use to keep informed"
    1/17/18
"your site is giving me new insights into so many aspects of this thing we call 'life'.  it can be difficult remaining in observational mode with so much intentional 'in your face' programming and directed harm going on all around us 24/7.  to minimize this, i don't have a television and i do not read newspapers or magazines.  the articles and the commentary in the leading edge international research journal online (lerj) are exemplary.  it is nice to be able to log on to a site where there isn't the usual differential ratio of 99% falsehoods and 1% truths one has to fish through with uber-keen discernment - akin to swimming through mud.  from what i have read, in just the last month since i first subscribed, is the most incredibly useful information, not just for your worldwide subscribers but for me personally.  i live in a small town with the kind of people who don't question the status quo.  sometimes i don't get home and settled in from work until somewhat late in the evening but i always try to log on at least once a day to read the most up to date information of a variety of subjects that are of utmost importance to me and how i traverse my path.  what i have found to be the most useful aspect of the website is that i don't have to second guess the information.  of course, if i were to read something that did not resonate with me, i would not accept it as fact.  that said, i have yet to read anything on the leading edge journal online that has not resonated with me 100%.  so, a big "thank you" for that.  what used to surprise me is the sheer volume of carefully created disinformation on the internet.  it no longer surprises me because i know the motivation behind it.  the website saves me a lot of time while also enhancing my life experience with information that i can count on to build on as i forage deeper into the larger aspects of life."
    12/13/17
"thank you for all the
    years of hard work you've put into the site to keep us informed."
    11/25/17

    "i am in complete overwhelm of what i have missed in the past 10+ years.  i've been reading some of the m5v5 segments, q's and a's and my head is bursting with pressure.  i haven't even begun to discover everything that you have on the website. the website is phenomenal...i just want to go away somewhere by myself and read and digest it all for a month or so - i feel a great need to "catch up". always so perfect, how hs works...i must have had to do the detours. thank you again, so much, for staying true and focused on your course."
    7/25/17

"thanks for the hard work and cutting through all the fake news stories." 3/25/17
"thanks again for your
    herculean efforts. i appreciate the bond between the readers of m5 gold as well as readers of leading edge research journal especially during these mind melting times."
2/15/17
"i worked at a metaphysical bookstore in san anselmo ca in the 90s and started reading & buying leading edge journal and the matrix compendiums.  i connected with my now best friend for life then because we both read your work with great respect and appreciation. i was led back to your site today by cosmic energy i guess and do want to start reading your work again.  it definitely is the most cogent; highest level info i have ever found published.
    this lifetime i have been fortunate to  be able to connect with great minds to nourish my own ever questing being. thank you so much for all your work.  with great appreciation."
    2/5/17
"so relieved to have another perspective into the dynamics of the world.  my friends and clients are not doing so good about it all.  interesting times indeed." 
    2/5/17
"i just want to let you know that i really enjoy le because it's an aggregator with an m5 slant.  love it.  i enjoy your comments because, as you know, every other news/blog site is usually from a "lower" grade level (i hope you feel the need to comment more often actually).  refreshing.
    1/30/17

"your site is beyond very informative ...
      it's just great." 12/12/16

"thanks for all you do. your site is sound, intelligent and trustworthy in a time of so much stupidity and nonsense on the
      net."
    10/28/16
"thanks for all the hard work in continuing to update the site on a daily basis. it is much needed going forward, in a critical time period for the whole human race."
    9/23/16
"it's refreshing to see someone who is on top of things and actually cares about customer service. i've been somewhat busy so i haven't been able to fully delve into the material yet, but i have to say, from what i've seen i'm impressed!
    i've considered myself one of the more fully informed people on the planet, but now i can safely say i can scratch the "more" off... leading edge fills in the cracks with an advanced perspective. i've been a long time reader of matrix v materials but have never been a subscriber to the site until now. i'm glad i got the impulse to do so!
    9/11/16

"i just want to thank you for your informative site and your exceptional research acumen. i find the site an invaluable resource and would like you to know that your knowledge, time and dedication are greatly appreciated." 7/20/16

"thank you for providing the online
      journal; it is of most benefit to me. in addition, the matrix materials
      continue to push my incarnation to new levels of spiritual growth" 7/9/16

"actually, one of my few favorite places to visit and spend any length of time on the internet."
      7/7/16


      "it's so good to be back. no more wasting time jumping all over the net
      looking for real news." 6/20/16

"your website is invaluable as a source of intelligent content as to the state of the world."  

"your website is the best of the best! ... it beats the tube any day. frankly, it amazes me how you do all the research (and we appreciate it). i love that the articles are balanced, (which of course you
      don't get on mainstream news) so much happening now, and so much to be aware of, and the twist of humor. your comments are appreciated..."

"one of the few sane voices in a wilderness of howling
      idiots".

  the ability and experience of this nature is not something everyone can do,
or be successful with

exploring larger realities &
context: the matrix v project



up
  



  (2000-2017)
 
the matrix 5 project, underway
for 17 years, embodied a collection of the most advanced material we have realized
after a 28 year period of investigation and research geared toward peeling back
the layers of reality, in order to acquire an accurate context relative to our
existence and experience -- something that cannot be done on that scale from
within the frame of reference, but outside of it. the goal of the matrix v project 
was to unleash your individuality and assist you in rediscovering who you really
are. it is about providing the keys necessary for those who need them to spiral out and graduate from the game.
the material was always meant for those with very
        advanced incarnational perspectives which not only take into account the
        larger reality we live in, but the why and how of it all, based on 
        experiential activities of a very high order over a period of time. by definition it would not be
something that most would understand, coming from a strictly cultural
perspective. it was 
written by an author who underwent 12 years of shamanic training, went to the monroe institute, and has achieved
    a vast amount of very very unique first hand observational experience which
    far exceeds the norm. he relates the nature of the larger context of
    reality and the nature of what all individuals (and the planet) are going
    through at this time. it eventually turned out that the implications of the
project far exceeded anything that anyone could ever have imagined.
the main thrust and examination of the
original matrix v
    trilogy was an examination of the nature of the higher self, and
    incarnational 3rd density experience.  the specific title is: "information for very advanced, dominant and final 3rd density incarnations".
the material is not written for
 the general public, but for those with advanced thought patterns and interests
who resonate along those lines. it details understandings
        about the actual existential context in which all beings exist and have
        their experiences, and has produced a continuing commentary with an ever-increasing knowledge base resulting from
  experiential observations, not
      from non-experiential belief systems, using a time-tested dynamic of exploration (out of body travel) shared by many people who have those
abilities. matrix 5, starting with quest of the spirit - the ultimate
frontier, is the ultimate self-help material.
  if 
you are a subscriber to leading edge journal online, you have a special 
matrix 5 panel to access material from earlier volumes and basic explanations of 
elements of the context, to begin with, which is useful because
that's the observational perspective of the website.
as of august 31, 2017, the entire body of work until 
july 27, 2017, all volumes, are at the library on focus 27, available to 
countless individuals. a summary, with select
segments from the first three printed volumes, is on the 
le online journal and 
explains the perspective, terms and definitions, and then perhaps what
 is discussed in the later online volumes will make more sense conceptually.

a few
  points to keep in mind at this point:


remember: "in observer status, you do not move against the game, but you most definitely can point out the
  game's mechanics to other interested observers. share what you see. remember,
  you don't escape by fighting the game, but by removing yourself from it.
  remember what the word 'observer' means - a non-participant in events, but
  someone who takes note and evaluates." -m5v1

"the focus on external power
  giveaways is important to the game. you must give your power away to appease
  the game. as long as your power is given away, you cannot discover who you
  really are."


"your
higher self allows freedom of choice here as learning experiences.
you won't make a choice that will cancel any experience that your
higher self requires, but there is plenty of latitude in 'other'
experiences. the more advanced you become is due to how you handled decisions
for your incarnation. you will, for example, have to experience being both
polarities. without those experiences, you won't appreciate
balance."




"balance
    observes the game and points out interesting facets of it, but does not call
    for actions against it." 
"the
    law of allowance says that light-siders must be free to be what
    they are, just as are dark-siders. this is part of the game.
    light-siders do not follow this law and neither do dark-siders. this
    is a law with balance at its root and balance is what both polarities
    dislike. there is no right or wrong, just different experience,
    but the best choices are made with greater information,
    so you are less likely to be suckered in. as with everything else, by the
    time you reach very advanced stages, things will be made clearer to you.
    "

observations on static cultural reality models

by denise breton and
    christopher largent
    authors of the
    paradigm conspiracy 1988 



up
  

the
    control paradigm posing as a "philosophy" 

the dumbing down - becoming
    less than who we are - brings us face to face with one of the control
    paradigm's most powerful devices for achieving control. the control paradigm
    presents itself as a "philosophy", as if it's innocently telling
    us what's what. it even insists that its mechanistic, materialistic,
    control-measured picture of reality depicts the "real world" and
    tells us how to be practical in the world of facts and things, dogs eating
    dogs and sharks eating whatever. the more our reality can be reduced to
    objects, this "philosophy" tells us, and the less we trouble
    ourselves with ideas, values and other intangibles, the more we understand
    the "realities" of the control universe.  adopting this
    philosophy as "the most practical way to maximize our personal sphere
    of control", we don't notice that we're made controllable in the
    process. to "buy into" the "philosophy" is to become
    controllable by its "values" of external rewards and suggested
    into a view of ourselves that is not true to our nature and potential as
    true human beings. but, the control paradigm isn't philosophy. it doesn't
    encourage free thought or dialogue. it doesn't develop our minds or souls.
    it doesn't invite inquiry into its core assumptions, strategies, responses
    and goals. instead, it functions as a mind-control trance.  the control
    paradigm comes across as "the one way" to experience reality, and
    it doesn't make room for alternative perspectives. to do so would go against
    the control agenda. as a result, the control paradigm in truth has little in
    common with philosophy and much in common with propaganda and mind control
    methods - trance inducers.


the reason
closed social systems don't work 

responding to the need for
balance in society doesn't work using closed-system thought patterns,
because the nature of the game: 
maintains
a toxic order:  first, if the system equilibrium is already toxic,
it gets reinforced. bad "norms" are simply perpetuated, since closed
systems "run on automatic". they don't have the power of discernment.
they don't evaluate systems in light of personal needs, human evolution or
planetary health. their one mandate is to "preserve the established
order", even if that "order" is toxic for the people and planet.
 

puts systems above people: achieving "social order" through
closed-system methods put systems above people - system needs over personal
needs. systems come first. that's the message we hear in social systems, namely,
preserving systems is more important than nurturing people. closed systems say
to people, "you are part of us, therefore we own you. who you are is
incidental. you must perform the roles we assign you in the ways we require. we
won't allow you to deviate. if you changed, we'd have to change, and that we
won't allow. our 'social order' would collapse". putting the rigid
structure of social systems first costs all of us. people get "chewed
up" by systems. the idea of "sacrificing ourselves for the greater
good" may be a laudable idea if the greater is good. but, what if it isn't?
 
features
control and abuse: closed social systems don't work because they keep
order through control - force, punishment, and other power-over methods of
enforcement. but, can social harmony be forced? is top-down control the way to
achieve "social order"? threats and intimidation cannot be the fabric
of healthy social systems. they do too much violence to our inner lives, costing
us our freedom. how healthy can our social system be if the people are
psychological wreaks? when we are deprived of out essential powers as free,
creative beings, our social systems reflect our emptiness. when do we get in
return for "submission"? not security. being one-down in a control
hierarchy isn't a secure place. when people get deprived of freedom and security
while at the same time they are bound by control systems, they behave like caged
animals. intelligent beings don't do well in cages.  
and ...

the nature of reality isn't closed: another reason closed social systems
don't bring social order is that reality itself isn't a closed system. the old
scientific belief systems such as closed-entropy energy systems, also used to
reinforce closed-system social control patterns, are rapidly becoming
transparently false as scientific research has shown over the last few decades.
no matter how much closed systems try to control variables and shut out change,
reality won't be shut out. we can't make our social units into "islands of
no-change", because the greater reality (the context on which our systems
depend) is dynamic. 

paradigm
cloaking devices - paradigm protective dynamics 

the best way to make our
paradigm "armor" invulnerable is to make it invisible. what can't be
detected by the population can't be shot down. when invisible, our paradigms
avoid the risk of attack. we hide our paradigm's filtering processes under
acceptable cloaking devices - and many such covers will do the trick. 

staying within a group 

one way to make paradigm
filters invisible is to surround ourselves with people who share our set. we
align ourselves with groups who take the same paradigm for granted. surrounded
by people whose filters are familiar, ours blend in. paradigm filters stay
invisible, and we ask "what filters?" and "what paradigm?"
everyone shares the same agenda of keeping the paradigm filters unchanged. when
paradigm issues do manage to surface, it's to reinforce how
"successful" and "right" the group's paradigm is. the
official lines get repeated and the catchphrases echoed. those who question the
paradigm and don't speak its "language" are out.  it is because
of this that cliques permeate paradigm-rigid societies, with each group accusing
the other of being "cultish". paradigm dynamics, or dogmatics of each
group resemble what goes on in mainline churches, corporations, schools,
universities, governments, labor unions and non-profit organizations. the
strategy of keeping filters invisible under the cover of a group-shared paradigm
turns out not to be considered aberrational behavior, but the "required
norm".  when groups support growth - there are groups that support
growth and evolution, and group-shared paradigms can be useful if they are
exploring these areas involving full potential. working with people of like mind
takes us forward by leaps and bounds. as we work with others in this way,
developments emerge greater than any one person could produce. whether group
involvement supports "filter evolution" or "filter
fixedness", therefore, is a matter of paradigm development. 

compartmentalization of paradigm
filters 

mechanism: another way
to keep paradigms invisible is to split our lives into compartments and to
design paradigm filters for each "box". when we are convinced to split
our perceptive world into separate pieces, we protect the paradigm filters we
use for each piece. in a fixed area, certain paradigm filters don't apply, and
we don't mix them with filters we use for a different box. that way, we never
have to ask how it all adds up; it just doesn't, and no one expects it to add
up. 
social result: lack of
consistency. we don't ask whether the values we use at work are the values
we'd like our children to live at home. if we adhere to one religion or belief,
we don't want to hear about the views of another. by putting walls between our
filters, we protect our overall filter arrangement. we avoid filter comparisons
which would inevitably bring our paradigm out into the open and subject it to
revision. some of the greatest leaps in knowledge and art - cultural paradigms -
occurred when two or more societies interacted. control paradigm isolation of
societies prevents these leaps. box-category thinking, valuable as it is for
producing specialized knowledge, prevents this type of exchange. it forbids us
even to attempt to integrate our filters with wider contexts - a process which
paradigm evolution demands. "there's no overall paradigm", we tell
ourselves, which means our cultural paradigm stays "offstage",
invisible. 

openness and objectivity issues 

another way to keep paradigm
filters hidden is to "appear to be filter-free", as if "we have
no paradigm, no filters, and no covers for them either. for decades, scientists
and social engineers hid filters behind claims of objectivity, pretending to be
"unbiased observers". claiming to be "open" and
"skeptical", while rigidly adhering to paradigm dynamics, are other
ways of hiding paradigms we're not keen to question. sometimes, claiming to be
"open" is used as a strategy to make us appear paradigm-free, which
guarantees that neither we nor anyone else has a chance to look at our filters.
by appearing to be "big-minded", we keep our paradigm close to the
chest and off limits. 

use of covers to block paradigm
awareness 

if we are to evolve, we need to
know what paradigm we're using, so we can change it. defensive covers block this
awareness. how far are people willing to go to protect their paradigm? history
shows that people will kill to protect what they "believe" to be the
case. changing paradigms, ways of thinking and perceiving the universe based on
new information, can be scary for some people. no wonder the strategies for
keeping paradigms in place are more developed than strategies for changing them. 

use of social
taboos to block paradigm awareness 

one of the most potent paradigm
cloaking devices individuals and societies have is the taboo. a taboo prevents
the questions we dare not raise, the things we dare not do, and the ways we dare
not think. when members of a society obey taboos, they pretend that aspects of
their lives do not exist. problems are not problems, and obvious sources of
trouble remain off-limits for discussion, and people are manipulated into not
speaking of them. people let the social system throw walls of silence around
them, so the system is not threatened by hearing the truth about what we're
experiencing. most current social systems on the planet are maintained in a
status quo state in this way.  
taboos about sex - the
actual function of the taboo on sexual matters in western countries, which
paradoxically exists at the same time as the maintenance of a strong focus on
sexual matters, is to supplement and increase the focus on sexual matters in
society. the same principles holds for gender-specific taboos, which also have
the function of suppressing different factors relating to wholeness of being and
expression. many of these taboos have the function of introducing the socially
complicating factors of "guilt" and "shame", and are also
included in some religious paradigms.  
taboos about feelings - there
is also another taboo which exists that makes feelings off-limits in some social
system. people are programming "to be in control" of emotions. even
the words "emotion" and "emotional" are cast in negative
connotations, and are often used to discredit a persons viewpoint. in fact, the
process of socially programming the factoring-out of emotions is highly
convenient for control paradigm systems, because if we cut ourselves off from
how we feel under a situation of domination, we tend to "tolerate" it
more readily, and we are programmed to disregard the pain when we witness
control-system abuse to others. control system abuse is seen on television 24
hours a day and termed "entertainment", which goes to show how deeply
some paradigm elements are buried. another phenomenon that arises is that the
control paradigm feeds people with rationalizations, judgments and the ultimate
ultimatum: "things must be done this way or chaos will follow".  

science taboos - many of the social control taboos in our
society have in fact been inherited from science - what's "real" and
what is not, what we can "talk about intelligently" and what is
considered "superstitious" or "pseudo-science". in general,
the rule is this - "if you can measure something, manipulate it, predict
its function and then replicate it (control the outcome of experiments on it) -
"it's scientific and real; if not, it's imagination or illusion."
people are programmed to accept this approach to science because it reinforces
the idea of control over the environment. unfortunately, this strategy reduces
the idea of "knowledge" down to a matter of "control". we
are led to believe that "knowing something" means being able to
"control" it -- which is the control-paradigm epistemology. we are led
to grant science this "authority" and we are programmed not to
question it, even if it stands in the face of mountains of observed (but not
reproducible, and therefore "anecdotal") evidence. 

science taboos - the wider
impact 

defining knowledge in terms of
control raises questions. what kind of "control" does science give us?
control paradigm science inevitably disregards wider contexts, because wider
contexts aren't easily "controlled". to "gain control",
scientists "eliminate variables" and "constrict the field".
in fact, scientists learn early in their programmed training to think in
narrowly focused ways and to disregard broader contexts, thus, the most
defensible ph.d. thesis is the most specialized one. a result of this process is
that using narrowed control thought processes, we find ourselves faced with
wider-context problems. for example, we are stuck with nuclear waste with a
half-life of 500,000 years and clouds of acid rain that kill forests. if the
same money went into researching new evolutionary technologies, as the
impression was given to the public in the early 1970's that it "would
be", we wouldn't have the problems we have today. but, a public programmed
to think along the same lines has simply ignored this simple idea. 

science taboos - ethics and
values 

a very important point to make is
that the taboos that insulate control-science from its impact on society also
hide its values. the directions that science and technology take involve
decisions based on values - control values. nonetheless, taboos place science
above ethics. in other words, control-science taboos hide its decision-making
process and the values that guide them. these values and decisions affect the
course of science. the fact that some scientific research gets screened out
while other research receives both funding and publication is attributed to
"the natural course of scientific development", as if there is no
paradigm-based filtering going on. in fact, "there's a whole lot of
filtering going on". various "experts" dominate each field of
"inquiry" and also dominate the direction and "limits" of
research. they give their "positions" at "conferences",
where "reputations" may be "made" or "broken", and
they edit the journals. even more telling is the funding of research by
industry. there is an unspoken but real incentive to present projects that
support the agenda of work being done in various industries. combinations of
industrial, academic, and political interests influence, and even control, what
should otherwise be open scientific research, in many cases research that could
potentially save lives. the cancer and aids industries are good examples.

life in a
paradigm controlled by external reward systems

in a paradigm of externals,
externals call the shots. instead of allowing us to be guided from the inside
out (a formula for anarchy, the control paradigm claims), the paradigm controls
our behavior through rewards and punishments. we come to think and act like
pavlov's dog, salivating over the next bonus, a bigger kennel to call home, a
fancier collar to sport, or a top dog position. the paradigm isn't about
developing our talents, abilities, or potential; it's about making us
controllable by giving or withholding external rewards. to achieve this control,
the paradigm grades each "thing" in a hierarchy of externals. the
inner life means nothing compared to the outward characteristics indicated by
our species, race, gender, age, status, group affiliation, and income. if dogs
possessed the wealth of bill gates, for instance, they wouldn't suffer in
medical experiments, just as people who have money don't work in sweatshops or
sell their children into slavery. that's the problem with externals: they're
fine until they become the means for enslavement, which unfortunately they do
almost immediately. when a paradigm puts external values first, consciousness
dimensions are dismissed out of hand. small wonder that the potentials of our
minds and hearts-and all the values that go with them, e.g., meaning,
compassion, justice, or wisdom-go undeveloped. a control paradigm has neither
use nor place for them.

 closed social external
control-based paradigms don't like discussing this

naming paradigms and their power
for good or ill isn't a new insight; it's as old as philosophy. it is, however,
an overlooked insight in an age that can't seem to shake a materialistic,
control-obsessed paradigm-and for good reason. reflecting on paradigms is the
stuff of change, and changing paradigms is the most fundamental and powerful
change we can make. to a paradigm of control, that's not welcome. the sum total
of our experience contingent on something as invisible and changeable as a
philosophy? change by paradigm shifts, which anyone can make? powers of
perception and creativity that defy rigid material boundaries? humans as beings
of immense powers and abilities? once you let these cats out of the bag, there's
no telling what mindsets and institutions might be made obsolete. obsolete is
precisely what established institutions of power and control don't want to be.
they learned from the fate of carriage and buggy whip manufacturers when cars
came along. established interests now make sure that questioning the neanderthal
paradigm of burning things for energy triggers "war-of-the-worlds"
panic about destabilizing the world economy. even the call for improved public
transit systems borders on subversive. stiff challenges face a paradigm shift on
the simple level of out-there technology, frozen at a stage that captain picard
sometimes finds among the more primitive human civilizations he encounters. what
challenges might we face if we embark on a far deeper level of questioning-on
redrawing the paradigms that sort out who we are and why we're here? plenty. if
the cultural paradigm's purpose is not to honor human potential but rather to
make it an obedient servant to existing social structures, then nothing could be
more threatening to the established order than a paradigm shift regarding our
self-conceptions. we fit into society as it is now only as long as we don't
remember that we're more and here for more.

 examples of control
paradigm lack of interest in developing human potential

the agenda for traditional
psychoanalytic therapy, for instance, isn't to develop human potential; it's to
keep people functional in established social structures, however miserable their
lives may be and however abusive or wrong-headed the social structures.
"well-adjusted" becomes a synonym for mental health. but if someone is
well-adjusted to being an ss officer in nazi concentration camps, is that person
mentally healthy? in fire in the soul, psychoneuroimmunologist joan
borysenko writes of this narrow aim of therapy: "sigmund freud...believed
that when a person was cured of neurosis the best outcome that could be expected
was return 'to an ordinary state of unhappiness.'" (new york: warner, 1993,
p. 54) psychotherapy's official job is mopping up the mess that social systems
make of our lives by convincing us that the mess is our fault, our failing, our
screwiness. if we don't conform, adjust, fit in, and measure up, something must
be wrong with us. and psychotherapy has its truth: we may well be frozen in
grief or shock and not functioning at our best, but don't the social systems
that shape us deserve equal scrutiny, equal critical analysis? thankfully many
therapists reject this paradigm and venture forth with their clients on the
forbidden territory of meaning and human potential as well as of critiquing
social structures, but it's no easy task persuading insurance companies to come
along. control institutions pay insurance companies to pay health professionals
to keep people in their place, serving the established order.

the agenda for school systems in
a control paradigm

nor are school systems
committed to developing the more that we are. schools are an arm of social
structures, whether religious, governmental, or economic. according to the
paradigm-defined needs of those structures, tapping human potential doesn't
create enough dilberts to ensure the "efficient" running of corporate,
governmental, religious, and educational hierarchies. in this century, business
interests have dictated the structure of schools. henry ford quickly noticed
that creative genius and intuitive knowing aren't useful on factory lines. so he
pioneered the "modern" school system that inculcates values and skills
appropriate for 20th century work life: being punctual, obeying orders, enduring
hours, weeks, and years of boring, repetitive tasks, not talking while working,
not resting, keeping to the schedule at all costs. our minds become casualties
of industrialization.  our souls end up casualties as well. trusting our
own judgment, thinking for ourselves, adhering to our values, and having
confidence in our innate worth don't make us good foot soldiers for
my-way-or-the-highway bosses. only people with low self-esteem are sufficiently
insecure to tolerate abusive work environments. insofar as we believe we don't
deserve better, we adjust, becoming the kind of person that's required to
"do the job."
obligingly, school systems
produce people with precisely the low self-esteem that's needed for worker
"flexibility." fears of being wrong, of not making the grade are fears
confirmed for 90 percent of the population. that's the percentage who are
required not to get a's by the bell curve system, guaranteeing that 90 percent
of everyone coming out of school believe that they're incapable of excellence.
schools mirror back to students the mass message that "you're just not good
enough, but if you do what you're told without question, you may get better and
be rewarded." that's a handy message to have installed in the psyches of 90
percent of the population-handy for perpetuating corporate, religious,
governmental, and professional tyrannies, that is.  all this modern
schooling goes against what we know about the human mind and how we learn-and
have known for decades. studies in learning show that we learn best when we're
most relaxed, yet schools maximize stress through fear of failure. studies show
that children learn most easily through cooperative learning, yet schools impose
a competitive model. studies also indicate that students' beliefs about their
own learning abilities affect their performance-if they believe they're good
learners, they learn easily; if not, learning the simplest things becomes
difficult-yet schools systematically undermine students' confidence. in these
and many other ways, school systems perform virtual lobotomies on our psyches,
producing graduates who've long since lost their joy in learning, who believe
they must be right all the time and "know it all" or be condemned to
outer darkness, and who experience post-traumatic stress symptoms at the thought
of having to learn new things on the job.

on cultural
non-commitment to potential

alice miller, a champion of the
potential we all possess from birth, pulls no punches in her books-for your
own good in particular analyzes the social, cultural agenda of shutting down
our potential. as she explains, the traditional rules of child-rearing passed
down from generation to generation have nothing to do with developing our
potential, either emotionally, intuitively, psychologically, or intellectually.
their one agenda is control: control the child as soon as possible by any means,
whether it's by punishment, humiliation, intimidation, beatings, grading,
whatever it takes to break the child's will and autonomy.
the justification for this
agenda is that children raised any other way won't fit into society when they
grow up. according to this cultural paradigm-expressed in the rules of
child-rearing-learning to forget who we are and to become what others want and
expect us to be is the most important survival skill. our potential as human
beings is irrelevant, a side issue, compared to our ability to conform.
of course we're supposed to believe that social systems have our best interests
at heart and that obeying them is indeed "for our own good." if we
conform properly, our potential will develop accordingly. but is this so? as
we've seen, schools and therapy-two systems that you'd think would be committed
to developing human potential-have no such commitment. in what system or area of
the culture might such a commitment exist?
governments are fully occupied
with who has power over whom, who has the biggest budget, where money can be
found, who wins which election or vote, etc. developing the human potential of
its citizenry is not a priority. if anything, it's not on the agenda at all. the
insider's view that "the masses are asses" is music to ambitious
politicians' ears, who then believe it's their manifest destiny to expand their
personal power and become benevolent dictators. dumb masses are easy to
manipulate with slogans and half-truths. for their purposes, the less human
potential the better.
as much as we value spiritual
teachings, we can't say that religious organizations have much commitment to
developing human potential either, though granted there are exceptions. adhering
to fixed doctrines, building congregations, raising money, meddling in the
personal affairs of members, running down sectarian competitors, and using fear
and guilt to exact obedience and tithing keep them busy enough.
businesses and corporations
certainly don't concern themselves with human potential, even though they
sometimes pay lip service to it in the hopes of making employees more
"productive." the bottom line is the bottom line, and if human
potential comes up at all, it's considered a frill or luxury-"warm fuzzy
stuff" that doesn't count in the "real world" of business except
to mollify disgruntled workers or help them adjust to higher levels of stress.
scanning the culture, we
frankly can't find any system that's consistently committed to exploring human
potential. if anything, our social systems regard human potential as an
impediment, an annoying feature of human beings that gums up the systems'
otherwise efficient workings. if people would just learn their roles and stick
to them, everything would work so much better.
if we didn't know the paradigm
behind these systems, we may find this lack of interest in human potential odd.
developing human potential seems crucial to keeping human civilizations vital
and evolving, up to speed with the challenges that continually arise. technology
per se can't save us, since we're not using the alternative technology we
already have to remedy social and environmental ills. what we lack is the the

"list
  of cognitive biases"  



"a cognitive bias is a pattern of poor judgment, often triggered by a particular situation. identifying "poor judgment," or more precisely, a "deviation in judgment," requires a standard for comparison, i.e. "good judgment". in scientific investigations of cognitive bias, the source of "good judgment" is that of people outside the situation hypothesized to cause the poor judgment, or, if possible, a set of independently verifiable facts. the existence of most of the particular cognitive biases listed below has been verified empirically in psychology experiments.
      cognitive biases, like many behaviors, are influenced by evolution and natural selection pressure. some are presumably adaptive and beneficial, for example, because they lead to more effective actions in given contexts or enable faster decisions, when faster decisions are of greater value for reproductive success and survival. others presumably result from a lack of appropriate mental mechanisms, i.e. a general fault in human brain structure, or from the misapplication of a mechanism that is adaptive (beneficial) under different circumstances.
      cognitive bias is a general term that is used to describe many distortions in the human mind that are difficult to eliminate and that lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, or illogical interpretation. [...]" 
note: discussed are: 1 decision-making and behavioral biases. 2 biases in probability and belief.
      3 social biases 4 memory errors and biases 5 common theoretical causes of some cognitive biases
      6 methods for dealing with cognitive biases. all these constitute complex
      elements of the social environment. of course, when we on levels of
      reality where we are telepathic, none of this exists. language and other
      factors introduce these factors into experience at this level.

logical
        fallacies from written media: books, newspapers, magazines,
        newsletters, etc.  a "logical" fallacy is a
        mistake in reasoning, that results in a erroneous proposition without
        any validity. yet, people are conditioned over a lifetime to 'believe'
        fallacies constitute valid discourse, even creating 'laws' and social
        customs around them.  fallacies are defects in an argument - other than false premises - which cause an argument to be invalid, unsound or weak.
