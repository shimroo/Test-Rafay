about us
















































































the commercial horticultural association (cha) is the british trade association for manufacturers and suppliers of plants, products and services to commercial horticultural growers throughout the world.established in 1978, initially to represent the interests of the british horticultural supplies sector in uk markets, the association evolved to extend its services into international markets and to develop trade links between the uk supplies industry and international growers, wholesalers and retailers across the world. the cha’s secretariat is managed by the federation of garden & leisure manufacturers ltd.













the cha promotes its members’ products and services and british horticulture as a whole throughout the world at shows in selected uk and overseas markets. a full portfolio of benefits is available to member companies, and this is enhanced regularly. all the services and benefits are specifically designed to assist member companies to extend sales into new markets and develop business opportunities.cha members can meet your requirements, from young plants, growing media, substrates and fertilisers to post-harvest technology, cut flowers, nursery stock, right through to retail and point-of-sale services (and everything in between). building on its enviable reputation for research, innovation and high quality standards, the uk supplies sector has introduced some of the world’s leading technology, processes and services which are being utilised worldwide. 




















the cha showcases the best of british horticulture at the leading international horticultural trade shows and exhibitions. currently we focus on key events including fruit attraction (spain), ipm essen (germany), fruit logistica (germany) & greentech (amsterdam). the cha offers british companies a fully-supported opportunity to participate in these and other leading events. we also promote the british group presence through pr and a british exhibitor group preview.the cha works closely with the british government department for business & trade and its commercial offices at british embassies, consulates and high commissions throughout the world. through the department for business & trade, the cha is able to lobby for grant support for uk companies exploring international markets, provide access to research and introductory services, and to assist overseas partners to develop trade relationships with uk stakeholders. the cha is a trade challenge partner accredited by the uk government to the highest standard to deliver practical, cost effective and successful initiatives and services to encourage and expand our country’s exports.
