    "crafting excellence: unveiling the gleeson family courtyard - a journey of transformation at brother rice high school"

august 22, 2023

this past week we celebrated a journey of growth and transformation at brother rice with the "gleeson family courtyard". at c.e. gleeson constructors, we have had the honor of being proud builders behind brother rice high school's evolution, shaping spaces that nurture education, community, and spiritual enrichment.                                    to highlight some of our successfully completed projects at brother rice high school, each contributing to the institution's ongoing excellence:                                    üìö academic resource center: a hub of knowledge and exploration, the academic resource center stands as a testament to our commitment to creating environments that foster learning and intellectual growth.                                    üèÄ athletic facilities: from pre-game preparations to post-game celebrations, our meticulously designed locker rooms and athletic facilities provide athletes with spaces that motivate and inspire, contributing to their journey of achievement.                                    üî¨ science wing: the science wing reflects our dedication to empowering the next generation of innovators. cutting-edge laboratories and interactive spaces facilitate hands-on learning and scientific exploration.                                    "i am proud to give back to brother rice to honor the lessons of my parents so that this courtyard and grotto may be a special gathering of community, of joy, and of prayer as was our home under the sacrifice and love of julianne and charles gleeson." - charles gleeson ii                                                                                                            üå± and now, we stand at the threshold of a new milestone‚Äîthe official unveiling of the "gleeson family courtyard." this courtyard represents more than just physical space; it's a testament to the values brother rice stands by. charles gleeson '80, who has three sons who attended brother rice‚Äîcharles '14, connor '16, cameron '17‚Äîalong with a daughter, caroline, at marian '21 next door. it's a space dedicated to community, joy, and prayer, embodying the essence of the gleeson home under the love and sacrifice of julianne and charles gleeson.                                                                                                            moreover, the brother rice community is interwoven into the fabric of c.e. gleeson constructors. the commitment to excellence extends beyond construction, as we're proud to employ michael carney '17‚Äîa brother rice alumnus.
