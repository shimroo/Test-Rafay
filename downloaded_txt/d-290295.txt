            testimonials






i jumped on the tractor and went to work moving 
            dirt. wow, was i ever impressed! i can fill the loader with dirt and 
            haul it anywhere in the yard. i dug a trench to bury drain tile for 
            a downspout. ive just used the plow to move more dirt and back 
            blade the piles. ive used the bucket to fill in behind some 
            retaining walls. ive used the bucket for everything i can think of  
            and a few things im not supposed to (moving a 400 lb rock and a 
            10ft x 14in diameter log) and it has worked flawlessly.
            david g.


i am attaching pictures of him using it, 
            thank you so much for producing such a great product. he doesn't 
            like to write reviews, so i wanted to let you know we are very happy 
            with it. you may use this as testament for your product, again thank 
            you for being a great american company. sorry i don't have any 
            pictures of the plow on it.
 deb a.
  








 overall, i really like the jbjr. 
            it digs surprisingly well, though i think the tooth bar will make it 
            better. it is very easy to store when not in use, too. its light 
            enough that i can lift it into the back of my poly cart and store 
            them both in my trailer. great product!
