more about our treatments                       pioneers of natural cosmetics. for us, natural skin care has been on trend since 1967since then we've been using above all medicinal plants, high-quality oils and waxes and, depending on the formulation, other natural ingredients such as silica, thermal brine, almond flour, silk and mineral pigments for our dr. hauschka cosmetics. where available, we acquire our raw ingredients from organic farming and fair trade sources. demeter projects are our first choice. all of our products are genuine natural cosmetics and have been since long before standards for certified natural cosmetics even existed. today all dr. hauschka products bear the “natrue” quality seal for genuine natural and organic cosmetics. show more      dr. hauschka

dr. hauschka skincare helps your skin tap into its own, natural ability to stay healthy and beautiful. unique formulations with medicinal plants give your skin effective stimuli that invigorate, calm or strengthen it—according to its individual needs. this keeps your skin beautifully radiant at all stages of life. we get independent institutes to confirm the efficacy of our skin care through scientific studies. our night time care supports your skin with its nightly renewal processes and leaves it free to breathe. it works exclusively with revitalising stimuli and light textures. specially for mature skin, our regenerating and regenerating intensive lines offer highly effective formulations. they reduce the appearance of fine lines and pamper your skin with nourishing, creamy textures.       how suitable are your products for all skin conditions?   ever since our establishment in 1967, we at dr. hauschka skin care have put our trust in the power of nature: we draw exclusively on natural raw materials for our formulations, including medicinal plants, botanical oils and waxes, and essential oils. before we launch new skin care products on the market, we get independent institutes to carry out dermatological tests on volunteers to confirm that our skin care is suited to all skin conditions, including sensitive.        what is the quality of dr. hauschka skin care?   dr. hauschka stands for certified natural skin care of the highest quality: more than 90% of our botanical ingredients are grown using organic farming. they preferably come from our own biodynamic medicinal herb garden, the fields on our demeter farm or from wild harvesting in the swabian jura. from harvesting to bottling, the production steps are closely coordinated and delivery routes short. in this way we protect the climate and ensure the best, fresh quality of our products. we then buy plants that don't grow in our climate from partners who share our values and with whom we have worked closely for years. if we cannot source an ingredient from organic farming, we purposefully launch biodynamic cultivation projects around the world. we help our partners to implement them by providing advice and support. we therefore do not use synthetic additives. we guarantee the first-class quality and microbial safety of our products through a whole range of further measures: our raw materials undergo thorough microbiological tests before we process them under particularly hygienic conditions that meet pharmaceutical standards. we then formulate our ingredients carefully to ensure they interact well for great product stability.       what ingredients do you use?   dr. hauschka is certified natural skin care. that means our ingredients don't come from chemistry sets, but from nature, such as medicinal plants, botanical oils and waxes, and real essential oils. we also use minerals, metals and animal substances. all in all, we draw on a pool of 500 natural raw ingredients, many of which are organic. the ingredients in our products are mostly of botanical or mineral origin. depending on the desired effect of the skincare and the skin’s needs, we decide whether or not to use animal raw materials for each individual product. for example, beeswax is a valuable substance for natural skincare. a gift from nature that we use with the utmost care. but we do offer vegan skin care too. dr. hauschka skincare is free from mineral oils, microplastics and dissolved synthetic polymers. we also do not use mineral-oil-based substances produced by synthetic chemical means. we obtain our glycerine and fatty constituents exclusively from plants.       do you test on animals?   looking for skincare that doesn't use animal testing? we have never tested on animals. since dr. hauschka was established in 1967, we have never carried out or outsourced animal testing. in the european union, animal testing has been completely banned for cosmetic products and their raw ingredients since 11 march 2013 under the cosmetics directive. it is a mandatory ban that all cosmetics manufacturers in the eu must respect. dr. hauschka skincare is not always vegan. depending on the desired effect of the skincare and the skin’s needs, we decide whether or not to use animal ingredients for each individual product. we are aware that whenever we take something from nature, we are responsible for the environment and the quality of the substance we have taken away. however, we do offer vegan skincare too.
