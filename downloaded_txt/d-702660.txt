honoring the alutiiq peopleswe operate on the traditional and ancestral lands of the qutekcak alutiiq peoples, the indigenous inhabitants of the kenai peninsula, prince william sound, and the kodiak archipelago. they have lived in this region for thousands of years, maintaining a deep connection to the land, waters, and all of creation.we recognize these peoples as the creators of qayaks, and are the original stewards of this area and honor their continued presence, wisdom, and vibrant culture. we commit to learning about and uplifting the qutekcak in our operations, offerings, and storytelling.







































our commitment to wild placeswe love our home!! sunny cove wants to share the same quality experience of resurrection bay and kenai fjords with your children and grandkids as you do today. not only is this our home, but it is also home to our families, friends, and community and to an abundance of wildlife and amazing wild places.  regenerative tourism practices give us an opportunity to care for our wild places and to educate others about the importance of wild places in a way that creates opportunities for all of us to share a high quality of life in our community.




sunny cove’s valueswe’re more than a group of kayakers, we’re a group of people who deeply care about our hometown, our wild places, and the people who have given us the privilege of sharing their alaska experience. for us, it’s not just about the bottom line, it’s also about contributing to our community, protecting our natural environment, and educating the people who join us in our backyard. it’s also about providing a quality, fulfilling place to work, live and play for our staff.
