a very welcoming hotel conveniently located! i spent two nights here, but they provided everything i needed. all the amenities i required for a quick trip were available. the rooms were spacious and tidy, with a coffee maker and mini fridge. also, there were lovely restaurants, bars, and bay areas adjacent to the hotel. the woman at the front desk was accommodating with sightseeing tips. overall a pleasant stay. i would highly recommend it!
- joshua




good price, safe and clean.as a couple on a road trip, we enjoyed our stay at the greenwich inn. check-in and check-out were a breeze. the rooms are cozy and clean. this place offered great value for money in the marina district and was the perfect location for all tourist attractions. the area is not too far from the piers but also not too close to the big city fuss. i will come back the next time i'm in sf.
