boom! studios challenges you to fence  acclaimed creators c.s. pacat and johanna the mad deliver an all-new original series in november 2017  

los angeles, calif. (august 17)  – boom! studios is thrilled to announce fence, an all-new original comic book series debuting in november from bestselling novelist c.s. pacat (captive prince) and popular online sensation johanna the mad. launching from the boom! box imprint, fence
 brings together the worlds of teen soap opera with the adrenaline rush 
of competitive fencing, an exciting journey of self-discovery that 
challenges readers with one simple phrase: en garde!  “fence
 follows the rise of sixteen-year-old outsider nicholas in the world of 
competitive fencing, as he joins the team at an elite boys school,” says
 pacat. “readers will experience the world of fencing, its elegance and 
danger, and the high stakes of a combat sport. but most of all, fence
 is about the characters—with intense rivalries, lifelong friendships, 
and the thrill of romance between teammates—a diverse cast and a story 
that is exuberantly queer.”  fence marks the 
comics debut of both c.s pacat and johanna the mad, whose individual 
work have amassed devoted fan followings. pacat’s bestselling book 
series, captive prince, began its life as an original-fiction 
web serial that went viral, attracting the attention of publisher 
penguin random house. johanna the mad is a fan-favorite artist who has 
gained widespread popularity for her sketches, illustrations, and 
handmade items.  “fence means the world to 
me,” says johanna the mad. “it has always been one of my biggest dreams 
to draw comics, but i never thought i'd be able to work on one that i'd 
end up fangirling about!”  “johanna’s artwork captures everything that is hot, dangerous, and exciting about fencing,” adds pacat.  fence #1 launches with two open-to-order covers, one by johanna the mad and another by superstar artist kevin wada (scarlet witch). the series will be colored by rebecca nalty.  "teen drama, pretty people, self-discovery, and the thrill of competitive sports? fence
 is everything i love in one comic," says dafna pleban, boom! studios 
editor. “c.s pacat and johanna the mad have created a truly special 
comic we can't wait for people to read."  print copies of fence #1 will be available for sale at local comic book shops (use comicshoplocator.com
 to find the nearest one) or at the boom! webstore in november. digital

homeless ninja heroine returns in street angel: superhero for a day
an all-new street angel story arrives this halloween


portland, or, 08/24/2017 — jesse "street angel" sanchez knows the pressure of being the girl
 who always saves the day. it’s just who she is. but when she and her 
friends find a powerful alien artifact, they learn that being a 
superhero is not all fun and games. is this an extraterrestrial plot to 
destroy their middle school friendship or a gift from above that jesse 
can pawn for a hot dog?

“although street angel is the toughest superhero ever, her stories don't
 look like traditional superhero comics,” said rugg. “in street angel: 
superhero for a day, we finally see jesse with angel city's other 
champions—and we see how she responds when her role in her circle of 
friends is threatened. it's an exciting, new take on the superhero 
genre, guaranteed to shake up the status quo like watchmen and dark knight did generations ago.”

this october, eisner award-winner jim rugg (the plain janes, afrodisiac), brian maruca (afrodisiac), and image comics present the biggest, most epic street angel yarn yet.

street angel: superhero for a day (diamond code: aug170741, isbn: 
978-1-5343-0553-3) arrives in comic book stores wednesday, october 25th 
and bookstores tuesday, october 31st. the final order cutoff deadline 
for comics retailers is monday, september 4th.

street angel: superhero for a day is available for preorder via amazon, barnes & noble, indiebound, and indigo.


select praise for street angel:

“street angel shows girls that they can be anything they want to be, 
including someone who saves the world and fights injustices, one bad guy
 at a time. she also defies female stereotypes right and left, and that 
is pretty darn cool.”
—cindy whitehead, founder of girl is not a 4 letter word

“street angel is pure, unadulterated punk.” —multiversity comics

“jim rugg’s art is a real treat. it’s simple and bold and seems to adapt to the individual scenes in the story.” —comic bastards

“jesse sanchez is my new favorite comic book character. great middle school dialogue and the battle scenes will blow your mind!”
—jeff smith (bone, rasl, tuki)

“street angel remains as charming, inventive, and pitch-perfect as it was in the beginning. an indie-comics classic!”
—hope larson (compass south, batgirl)

giant days brings the holiday cheer  in an all-new special!  celebrate your favorite time of the year with boom! studios in november 2017  

los angeles, calif. (august 16, 2017) – boom! studios is excited to announce the giant days 2017 special, on-sale in november 2017. just in time for the holiday season, eisner award-nominated giant days creator john allison (bad machinery) is teaming up with jem & the misfits  artist jenn st-onge for a tribute to the films of richard curtis, because nothing says london at christmastime like love, actually.  
 when esther is invited to stay with her friend and mentor, shelley 
winters—who is less a mentor and more utterly mental—she brings daisy 
and susan with her.  shelley winters is a great and distinguished career
 woman who is hopelessly in love. susan, esther and daisy observe (read:
 aggressively meddle in) her life, falling back on tried-and-true 
rom-com cliches to teach her some valuable life lessons.  “it’s
 a tribute to the films of richard curtis, and the bridget jones movies,
 by someone who has seen those movies perhaps once, and maybe not all 
the way through,” says allison.  the giant days 2017 special is
 also a tribute to the fictionalized london-as-written for americans, 
according to allison. “iconic locations are presented as if they’re a 
brief walk away from each other, 1950s throwbacks still seem to walk the
 streets, it’s very clean, there are no poor people,” allison 
describes.  “the ghosts of mary poppins and bad dentistry loom large, 
but not as large as colin firth. he’s everywhere.”  “readers 
can expect some holiday hijinx from our main ladies (with only the best 
intentions, of course), some gentle ‘love, actually’ inspiration, and 
the return of some familiar faces for longtime readers of john allison's
 comics,” adds artist jenn st-onge. “i'm a huge fan of giant days and i really hope that as a guest artist (and non-brit) i do this special justice!”  giant days
 is one of boom! studios’ most acclaimed series, earning numerous award 
nominations, including eisners, harveys, and one for best humor comic by
 the inaugural ringo awards (which comics pros can vote on at ringoawards.com.)
 the ongoing series was first illustrated by animation artist lissa 
treiman and is currently drawn by max sarin and liz fleming, who won a 
national cartoonists society award for their work.  print copies of the giant days 2017 special will be available for sale at local comic book shops (use comicshoplocator.com
 to find the nearest one) or at the boom! studios webstore in november. 
digital copies can be purchased from content providers including 
comixology, ibooks, google books, and the boom! studios app.  the giant days 2017 special is the latest release from boom! studios’ critically acclaimed boom! box imprint, home to popular original series such as lumberjanes by shannon watters, grace ellis, brooke a. allen, and noelle stevenson; the backstagers by james tynion iv and rian sygh; slam! by pamela ribon and veronica fish; and goldie vance by hope larson and brittney williams.  for news on the giant days 2017 special  and more from boom! studios, stay tuned to www.boom-studios.com and follow @boomstudios on twitter.

all-new action-horror series dark fang takes a bite out of climate change

portland,
 or, 08/15/2017 — writer miles gunter (nyc mech) and artist kelsey 
shannon (bastard samurai) will launch their ecological action series 
dark fang this november from image comics.

when valla lived, she was a fisherwoman. in death, she is a vampire, 
peacefully residing on the bottom of the ocean—until a mysterious dark 
plague descends upon her aquatic paradise.

searching for answers on the surface, valla finds a world headed toward 
an environmental collapse that will ultimately wipe out her food supply.
 now, to stay fed, she must take on the juggernaut that is the global 
fossil fuel industry.

climate change deniers beware: dark fang is coming.

“dark fang was largely born out of the anger and frustration i feel 
towards people either denying or having an apathetic attitude towards 
climate change,” said gunter. “working on this book has been a fun 
catharsis for all my frustration about the issue, and i hope it will be a
 catharsis for others who feel the same way.”

“i've worked on many books that are devoid of any meaning beyond its own
 self-contained universe,” said shannon. “but this is the first time 
i've had the opportunity to invest myself in something that is not only 
fun and sexy, but also has meaning beyond itself and our art form. it 
actually has something important to say and i find that tremendously 
exciting!”

dark fang #1 (diamond code: sep170613) arrives in stores wednesday, 
november 15th. the final order cutoff deadline for comics retailers is 
monday, october 23rd.

myths become rallying cries in coyotes
all-new super-smart, ultra-violent series arrives this november

portland,
 or, 08/15/2017 — writer sean lewis (the few, saints) and rising-star 
artist caitlin yarsky will launch their new series coyotes this november
 from image comics.

women are disappearing. a legion of wolves roam the border, hunting them
 down, and a band of survivors have come together, ready to wage war.

detective frank coffey is struggling to wrap his head around this 
mythic-level bloodbath when he meets red, a little girl with a 
secret—and a sword.

“every once in a while, my wife will read me a weird fact about women 
who go missing across the world,” said lewis. “it's always staggering. 
it's always unsolved. it's terrifying. so i wanted to go to war with 
that. coyotes is about women who go missing, women who fight back, and 
stories we tell ourselves to get through life.”

“my favorite fantasy stories are the ones that help us relate to each 
other and our own reality, and coyotes is all about that,” said yarsky. 
“as soon as i read it, i could envision the stark, gritty world and the
