customized bespoke italy







there are three aspects of customised travel: time, expertise and creativity, not all can put the three together. we have over two decades of experience in creating bespoke travel experiences in italy for people who truly understand time, value it and don’t waste it. precision and clockwork efficiency is critical to success both on and off the job. nothing should be left to chance. there’s too much at risk: missed opportunity, stress, lost time, additional costs. the whole idea of the vacation is to escape all of this, feel special and leave the responsibility in the hands of a trusted partner. us. our travel advisors and planners have a wealth of experience with a special focus on food & wine. le baccanti enjoys and impeccable reputation as one of italy’s leading luxury travel companies. to create the quality experiences we are known for takes a lot of time. time to listen and understand, time to select the best travel experiences, time to put all the tiny pieces together seamlessly, time caring for you during travel, time to follow up once you’re home.  your time is our time, we’ll plan it wisely.
