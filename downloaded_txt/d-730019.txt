		right products and information to make your fishing trips more 
		successful. please feel free to contact us by phone or e-mail with any 
		questions you might have. we're happy to share our knowledge and offer 
		suggestions about what might improve your trip.
for example: tandem flies may work better at a given destination or 
		time then a single rigged fly. maybe you are not interested in igfa

		that info and are glad to share it with you to make sure you order the 
		correct product from us.
