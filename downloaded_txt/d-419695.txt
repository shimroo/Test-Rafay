anna halprin: 100 years, a life of dance
few dance artists have been as influential as anna halprin. in her ten decades as a dancer, she has redefined the art form, abandoning conventions and embracing the wide open field of creative expression. she has brought the healing power of embodied creativity to people around the world. the tamalpa institute honors the life’s work of this amazing woman, our co-founder, who continues to be a source of inspiration, peace, and social transformation.


on may 24, 2021 anna halprin passed away peacefully at her home in kentfield, ca. she was 100 years old.



she touched and inspired so many and received so much in return. all who have danced with her, studied with her, and supported her work have blessed her life and will continue to bless her spirit. her love and her legacy will continue to live in the hands and hearts of her family, through the many dancers’ workshop and tamalpa institute students, colleagues around the world, and the future generations who will continue to be inspired by her work. read the new york times article written in memoriam of her life after her passing.
