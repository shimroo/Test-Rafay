hello and welcome to my
          cobbled together pages

so much to do, so much to know, so much to
          say, so little time (and bandwidth, and server space)

we don't stop playing because we grow
                old; we grow old because we stop playing.

                never be afraid to explore, to discover, to take risks
                and  try new things. 
 
 



 

 



  
 


  
 



 

"a human being should be able to
              change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a
              ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts,
              build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders,
              give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations,
              analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer,
              cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, and die gallantly.
              specialization is for insects."

      please email
        me and let me know how i am doing. in particular, let me know
        about any inaccuracies in my writings; there is a lot of b.s.
        out there about firearms, (among other things)and i certainly
        don't wish to add to it
