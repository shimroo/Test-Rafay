amst welcomed amst alum ('10) solomon j. brager for a discussion of the book, heavyweight, on november 19th, followed by a workshop on graphic nonfiction and comics the following day. #umd #americanstudies #solomonjbrager #crafttalk #workshop



congratulations to kristy li puma (amst doctoral candidate), who was recognized by university athletics for her teaching excellence and strong support for our student athletes. kristy was awarded the honor of being a "guest coach" at last weekend's football game, and now holds the singular distinction of being (as far as i know) the only amster ever to appear
on the jumbotron on game day.



amst is now on bluesky! https://bsky.app/profile/amstumd.bsky.social
