hinnant family vineyards and winery is truly a tradition in the making.
for over 47 years, we have dedicated countless hours and extreme
effort into cultivating the best quality muscadine grapes in the state.
located in pine level, north carolina, hinnant family vineyards is the largest muscadine vineyard in north carolina, sprawling over 100 acres.
from our dry white and reds to our traditional sweet scuppernong, we catch a spectrum of flavors in our international award-winning wines.
so it is our family to yours that we dedicate each bottle we process here at hinnant family vineyards with the hopes that our extended family,
our clients and customers, will enjoy and treasure the memories each bottle of wine is sure to bring. click below to see the health benefits of muscadine grapes.
