it's been a long time since i've updated this page, so i 
hope you'll enjoy the new work. 

 
scrimshaw is the art of incising or cutting 
			designs into bone and ivory. early whalers used whales' teeth and 
			bone to create their works of art. eskimos used mammoth and walrus 
			tusks. today we scrimshanders use woolly mammoth tusk and ivory 
			substitutes like micarta and corian. well-intentioned, but 
			uninformed activists have practically eliminated the use of antique 
			elephant ivory, though it is still legal to possess that ivory. i 
			don't sell any elephant ivory myself.


back in 1978 i was 
			selling prints of my pen and ink drawings when a jeweler in portland 
			suggested i try scrimshaw. he felt it suited my style which was 
			stippling (drawing with dots of ink), and the subject he'd seen - 
			sailing ships. so he cut some ivory cabochons and told me to scratch 
			the polished surface with a needle and rub ink into the scratches. 
			that was all the instruction i got. i'm a slow learner, but over the 
			years i managed to make better scribes to cut microscopic points and 
			lines. i also learned that oil paint offered superior qualities to 
			ink.


the work on this site has been 
				commissioned by collectors. i hope it inspires you and if you 
				are interested in having something done, that you'll be 
				confident that you can expect the same quality in anything you 
order. so just click on the links below to visit the many pages.
