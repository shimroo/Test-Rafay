	colin broad boxes interface between old and new technology


mike thornton - pro tools expert

cb electronics have been very clever in producing one monitor controller
		that can control any of the following units.


    avid x-mon monitor controller

    cb electronics a-mon monitor controller

    trinnov d-mon monitor controller

    ntp-dad ax32 monitor controller

    avid mtrx monitor controller

he describes the tmc-1 as a large console monitor system without the large console, which fits very well with the trend
away form large consoles that we are seeing in our industry.


rob james
"the man behind cb electronics is the charismatic colin broad. colin who? for years, the film and broadcast community
	have relied on colin broad's expertise to solve a range of problems in the area of machine and system control.
	in fact, you would have to search hard to find a uk film dubbing theatre without at least one of his products,
	known to all and sundry as 'broad boxes'. they are also a common sight in dubbing theatres across the world.
	because big film dubbing theatre requirements are so complex most of the previous products have tended to
	involve a degree of customisation to suit individual requirements".
