				our story				




for 22 years, talia’s steakhouse & bar has continuously reinvented the strictly glatt kosher restaurant as a hip, modern place, where everyone will feel welcome: from chabad and satmer chasidim to modern orthodox, secular jews, non-jewish customers, and all other ethnic groups, talia’s has something for everyone.
throughout talia’s years, the owner, ephraim (effie) nagar, and his three sons have all spent a substantial amount of years honing cooking techniques and managing operations. daniel (27) who is a ramaz and cornell university graduate, was peeling potatoes at the age of 7 before he became one of talia’s managers. the twins, ben and adam (31), subsequent to serving in the israeli army (idf), both led our management team and kitchen operation for numerous years. we look forward to continuing this family effort to serve the needs of talia’s most cherished community.
