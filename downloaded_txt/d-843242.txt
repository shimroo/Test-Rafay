probably no call letters for a top 40 
            station were as descriptive as those given the mclendon station in 
            louisville. the station's original call letters were wgrc -- the grc 
            in honor of revolutionary war hero george rogers clark. when wgrc 
            became a mclendon station, though, an effort was made to create a 
            "ziggy call sign that people remember and that kids relate to," said
            don keyes 
            (1989). gordon's secretary, billie odom, suggested waky (pronounced 
            "wacky"), call letters that don keyes declared were "a natural" 
            (keyes, 1989). 
"we were there to come in and invade 
            louisville, kentucky. and that was...probably the biggest success 
            story of the whole chain. we went from zero to a 60 percent hooper 
            rating in two months. absolutely destroyed people. when we went in, 
            there was an old-timer called winn. they were the music station for 
            louisville, kentucky. they were playing fifteen minute segments of a 
            given artist. that was the state of louisville radio 1957 or 1958. 
            fifteen minutes of kaye starr, fifteen minutes of frank sinatra, 
            fifteen minutes of mantovani. that was it....and we went on the air 
            with the usual flying circus. it was devastating, just devastating." 
            (keyes, 1989)
[excerpts from gordon mclendon: 
            the maverick of radio by ronald garay]

wgrc-waky fcc records




from the louisville times, june 6, 
            1958
            agreement near on sale of wgrc for 
            $750,000
final arrangements for the sale of radio station wgrc here to a 
            dallas, tex., firm were expected to be completed today.
j. porter smith, president of the northside broadcasting 
            corporation -- owner of wgrc -- said the price for the local station 
            was about $750,000. he added that the sale, if completed, will be 
            subject to approval by the federal communications commission.
the prospective purchaser is the mclendon corporation of dallas, 
            which operates three stations in texas and one in louisiana.
wgrc moved to louisville in 1942 after six years of operating in 
            new albany. its offices are in the kentucky home life building. the 
            station has 5,000 watts during the day and 1,000 watts at night. it 
            operates on 790 kilocycles.
gordon mclendon, son of mclendon corporation head barton 
            mclendon, broadcast sports on the old mclendon liberty network here 
            some years ago.
smith and wgrc vice-president and general manager charles l. 
            harris would remain with the proposed new for a year in advisory 
            capacities.mclendon owned waky 
            for three years and six months, selling the station in early 1962.

waky-wklo 2006 
            reunion review page












the waky 
                  call letters returned to the louisville market on may 11, 2007 
			when oldies station 103.5 wase-fm in elizabethtown changed their calls to waky. now much of the 
                  louisville market can enjoy the music and jingles that made 
                  waky famous in fm stereo on 
                  


waky radio. 
			as of 2015 the new waky can be heard in kentuckiana at 100.1 fm and 
			620 am as well.






why 79waky.com?
for over 20 years, waky (790 am) in louisville, 
            kentucky was one of the most influential and highly-respected 
            secondary market top 40 stations in america. 
in the summer of 1970 
            while visiting louisville for a week, i discovered waky. i had never 
            heard radio like waky before. the station boasted strong and entertaining 
            personalities like bill bailey, 
dude walker, 
johnny randolph,
gary 
            burbank, weird beard and 
mason lee dixon. the 
            music presentation was upbeat and fun. waky was big time radio that 
			could hold its own to similarly-formatted stations in new york, 
			chicago and los angeles. 
i 
            was so impressed with waky that when i returned home to lexington, 
            kentucky (90 miles from louisville) i 
            started paying more attention to the local radio stations while 
            continuing to listen to waky every chance i could get. because of 
            the spark waky ignited in me, i pursued a career in on-air radio 
            which continues today at 
            wtma  
            in charleston, south carolina.


in 2003, with the 
            assistance of legendary waky program director johnny randolph, 
            i produced a one-hour audio tribute to waky. 

waky remembered became one of the 
            more popular streaming presentations on
            reelradio.com. cd copies 
            were made for many waky fans and alumni. due to all of 
            the positive feedback, in late 2004 i decided to put together a 
            sequel. interviews were recorded 
            with many former waky djs and newsmen. 
            in the process of talking to these "louisville legends" the question 
            kept coming up: "why hasn't anybody put together a waky tribute website?" 
because waky was such an influence to me not only 
            as teenager but as a broadcaster -- and because nobody else had done 
            one -- i put the sequel on hold and launched this waky tribute site in january of 2005. 
79waky.com 
            features downloadable waky jingles and airchecks, photos and music 
            surveys, information about the waky on-air personalities, and 
            memories from other waky fans. 
we cover the entire history of waky 
            here: from its launch as a top 40 station in 1958 -- to its adult 
            contemporary days in the late '70s and early '80s -- to its final 
            rock-based format (oldies) between 1982 and the station's switch to 
            automated beautiful music in 1986.
if you have any waky 
            memories (pictures, tapes, promotional material, etc.) you wish to share with our site's visitors please drop me a line. a great big 
            thank-you to all former waky 
            personnel and fans who've contributed thus far!

john quincy, 
            charleston, south carolina





about the curator





even though he was born 15 
            years earlier, lexington, kentucky native john quincy didn't really 
            discover top 40 radio until he smuggled in a transistor radio to a 
            church camp outside of louisville in the summer of 1970. after a few 
            hours of listening to the legendary waky in his dorm room, he caught 
            the radio fever. upon his return to lexington and a visit to local 
            stations to find out how radio stations really performed that on-air 
            magic, he was hooked.
shortly thereafter a high school 
            teacher told 
            him about a junior achievement program being sponsored by wvlk-am. 
            every wednesday night wvlk would turn over a half hour of their 
            programming to high school kids who would sell, operate, and 
            program it. quincy made sure he was one of the ones chosen to be one 
            of the teen djs.between his junior and senior year 
            of high school, quincy scored a summer job 
            working seven days a week at wbgr am/fm in paris, kentucky. most 
            of the time was spent running the board for cincinnati reds baseball games, but for 
            part of each shift he got to play dj. while it was country music 
            (which was especially bad in the early '70s), it was radio. from 
            that point, quincy never looked back.there were stints 
            at other lexington area radio stations (weky, 
            waxu, wcbr, wkdj, and wblg) before quincy got the call in 1979 to 
            escape lexington's mostly awful winters and work in sunny savannah, georgia 
            (wkbx and wzat). then in 1981, quincy moved up the coast to 
            charleston, south carolina to take on pm drive duties at rock 
            station wssx. later charleston 
            gigs included ac wxtc (where he spent nearly 10 years as pd), all-70s wjuk, country wbub, oldies wxly, news-talk wtma, country 
            wnkt and ac wsuy. subscribers 
            to tom konard's
aircheck factory service might remember quincy 
            as one of the narrators of "around the dial" and various profiles.
            in december 2024 quincy 
			retired as the 
			program director and morning host at 
            news-talker wtma 
            in charleston. he can still be heard occasionally playing 
			kentuckiana's greatest classic hits on
			waky-fm in the 
			louisville, ky area.
along with his radio work, he creates and maintains web sites including tributes to charleston radio stations
			
			wcsc,
            wtma and
            woke, as well as pre-1990s
            louisville and 
            lexington, kentucky radio.
