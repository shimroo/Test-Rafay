    willy’s community outreach

our community is at the heart of willy's! in the past year, we have worked diligently to provide a variety of scholarship programs for young and old, organizations, municipalities, recreation departments, and swim teams. specialty programs for the blind, amputees, and those suffering from autism, parkinson's and alzheimer's diseases, arthritis, and depression, among others, are available.our goal is to provide fitness and wellness to all! no one should be denied. willy's is here to make this a reality with our newly established nonprofit 501c3 charitable organization. this nonprofit is dedicated solely to provide funding for all people in need to attend programs, secure memberships, and utilize the services at willy's. it is governed by an independent board.



    designed with the cape population in mind

older adults face a myriad of problems, from increased immobility, bouts of sickness, and deaths of friends and family. but, as studies have shown, the increase in social isolation among older populations is exacerbating those issues. some studies are underlining how isolation can affect sleep patterns, immune systems, and stress hormones. willy's, with the help of our newly formed non-profit, is mitigating this growing problem. free or discounted gym memberships and fitness classes to older adults provide a social benefit to those who use the club, this program will directly increase physical activity and self-rated health, directly decrease social isolation, and indirectly decrease loneliness." although the program was not designed to combat the solitude epidemic, it is noted that a gym can be an important social venue and place for the community. "everyone recognizes the gym as a pro-health environment, but the mechanisms by which fitness program membership benefits health for older adults are more varied than mere exercise alone. willy's is dedicated to making memberships affordable for everyone for a plural of reasons it is all about our community.willy's is ready, willing, and able to assist with membership. programs and services to provide everybody access to the club. it is time to make a difference, and willy's is happy to lead the way." says owner barbara niggel. if you know of anyone who might be interested, please have them contact barbara (memberservices@willysgym.com  

 or phone

 

(508) 255-6370) day or night. she will, in turn, direct them to the board. this process is completely confidential.
