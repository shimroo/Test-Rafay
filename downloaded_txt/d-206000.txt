rose levy beranbaum 













"she's obsessed. there's really no other way to describe cookbook author rose levy beranbaum and her fixation with the minutiae of baking. if god is in the details, as the aphorism goes, then beranbaum must have one foot in heaven. for rose levy beranbaum, no detail escapes the pursuit of perfection. she's the diva of desserts."                      --the washington post




    rose's bio page
  



epicurious: june 12, 2017 “the 100 greatest home cooks of all time.”was she being presumptuous when she titled her 1988 breakout book the cake bible? not really. anybody who has baked—or even just tasted—beranbaum’s “downy yellow butter cake” knows that it inspires religious-like devotion. and her other bibles (on bread, pie and pastry, and baking, respectively) are no different. beranbaum’s recipes work—always, every time—thanks to her exactitude. she tests maniacally and writes meticulously, ending up with recipes that help home cooks approach birthday cakes and easter brunches with the confidence of the gods.--dtpowellron ben israel of rblcakes: february 12, 2022: always improving, even when we thought perfection has been reached!
