experience pentecost bible study



after coming to norfolk in the early days of the church, pastor blankenship was heavily involved in teaching home bible studies. (sometimes 6-8 per week) he finally wrote his own one-hour bible study meant to lead someone who is ready to receive jesus and give them instruction on “how to” become born again. this is a harvesting tool for those who are ready to move forward.the nbe has over 150,000 published in english and has been translated into a dozen languages being used on the mission fields of the world.since then the new birth experience has been updated into a pocket-sized mini book with a fresh cover but the same message! use this outreach tool to give to guests at your church or use it when teaching home bible studies.
