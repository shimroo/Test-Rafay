 auditory skills researchers have been looking inside children’s brains while they do literacy tasks. using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) they discovered that poor readers showed differences in brain activities than those who are literate. some important brain areas are underactivating. a common weakness is in auditory discrimination skills. for example, many poor readers do not “hear” differences in letter sounds. to them, the five short vowels sound almost exactly alike. this causes poor readers to expend more effort for less return. they have a harder time rapidly and accurately recalling letter sounds. inefficient letter-sound recall makes it more difficult for these children blend letter sounds to make syllables or words. finally, their brains are inefficient in recognizing and recalling words. but their brains work well in other areas, which explains why they can be bright, yet functionally illiterate. the good news is that children’s brains are not etched in stone. auditory skills and letter sound memory can be strengthened. your son or daughter can become a good readerâ€”with your help. the tri-method instruction to literacy success in a perfect world, children would learn how to read using a combination of three methods of instruction: auditory training, phonics, and whole language. it’s clear from research that using one of these methods will help only a few children. in fact, using two out of three methods will still leave numerous children illiterate. however, when auditory training, phonics and whole language are merged, literacy rates increase significantly. hopefully, you will see all three methods reflected in curriculum and used in american classrooms soon. literacy facts  in 1998, the national assessment of educational progress (naep) tested children nationwide for reading skills. the results for reading tests for 4th graders were: below the most basic level—38%; proficient—31%; advanced—7%. in 1998 there were ten million children between seven and eleven years of age who performed below the most basic level of reading achievement. it is very important to note that a substantial number of children from highly literate households and who have been read to by their parents since very early in life also have difficulties learning to read. in 1998, students who reported reading more pages daily in school and for homework had higher average scale scores than students who reported reading fewer pages daily. in 1998, students who reported watching three or fewer hours of television each day had higher average reading scores than students who reported watching more television. national institute of health studies are finding that at least 95% of even the poorest readers can learn to read at grade level if they are given proper instruction in sound-letter relationships. having kids read a lot is one of the crucial components of becoming a good reader. young readers need to become practiced at recognizing letters and sounds. the only way to get good at it is to practice. the average reader spent about 6 minutes per day reading connected text. children with reading problems spent about one minute per day. the amount of time students spent on worksheets did not relate to gains in reading achievement. what appeared to be most relevant was time spent reading connected print. four year old children who were read one alphabet book per day significantly improved in their awareness of phonemes – tiny letter sounds that make up words. children who struggle in vain with reading in the first grade soon decide that they neither like nor want to read. (juel, 1998)  reading selections what is a reading selection? a common mistake that adults make is to insist that a child read a whole book. it is far better to help a child reread a short selection to excellence. a short selection is one or two pages from an easy book or one paragraph from a higher level book. if the selection is on the correct readability level for your child, he should make no more than one or two mistakes per twenty words. any more than that will cause him frustration and will actually block his reading progress.3 don’t make him read it cold turkey either or he’ll sound like a car starting up on a winter morning – bumpy and hesitant. we don’t want your child to practice bad reading. that’s why you want to do the following:  read the short selection to him twice. read the same selection with him twice. finally, ask him to read it by himself twice.  to, with, and by is a fabulous repeated reading technique that will catapult your child forward in reading skills.4 it will help him learn and apply sight words more quickly, helps him to practice fluent reading and improves his comprehension-all the important skills of reading. some parents say, “but she’s memorizing the selection!” well, when was the last time you used phonics to sound out words while reading? phonics is used as a last resort when bumping into unknown words such as cruciate ligament. when reading you usually recognize words by sight. phonic skills are necessary to jump-start the process of learning to read. but reading by using sight words is more efficient.
