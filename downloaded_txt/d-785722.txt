testimonials







 





going to heritage academy was the best decision my parents and i made.  i went from struggling after covid with academics to excelling.  every teacher, parents and staff member strives to make sure every student is happily learning to the best of their abilities and i am beyond thankful for that.  heritage is like being part of a family and i couldn’t be more grateful for the knowledge and love i have gained from being there.






mrs.deir, thank you so much for teaching the fall sat prep class! you have helped me understand the material, and not stress as much walking into sat and act. you basically taught me 3 years worth of math in 1 semester. i had a very poor understanding of algebra/ geometry before the semester started. on top of this class,i had honors algebra ii. i was pretty prepared when we started certain subjects in that class, because we touched on it in sat prep. i was very glad that you sat down with me many times during class, and helped me do a couple problems, then i would do them myself and get them right. thank you again for teaching this class, and thank you for being one of my favorite/ one of the best math teachers i have ever had!






heritage was the best decision i ever made. i was able to explore my passions for giving back, leadership and my love for school.  i was not only able to learn about different subjects and challenge myself mentally but i was also able to be involved in my community and make time to do extracurricular activities that gave me a purpose.  i would have never been able to get into the school of my dreams without heritage academy or amanda o’nan.






at first, taking this class seems a bit exhausting and not really one of the best ones to take. but, i changed my mind when i realized half of the material we went over i forgot about. i really think taking this class helped me do exceptionally better than without it.






heritage academy is the reason i am the adult i am today.  the faculty there gave me room to grow and strive as an individual but was also there for me when i needed guidance.  they have pushed me and made it so that i am ready for my next journey in life.






attending heritage academy will forever be one of the greatest decisions ive made.  it created a learning environment that challenged me but was also enjoyable.  i was constantly surrounded by the most encouraging faculty and i never felt unnoticed.  heritage prepared me to move confidently into my next chapter.






i wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the sat prep class this year. it has been incredibly beneficial, and i feel much more prepared and confident about taking the sat. your guidance and teaching have made a significant difference in my understanding and approach to the test. thank you for all your hard work and dedication. i would definitely recommend this class to others.
