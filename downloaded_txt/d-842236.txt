alyson bauer, parent
both our son and daughter have attended camp echo bay since pre-k. after twelve years, we can only speak of the camp in superlatives. the camp is clean, safe, educational and staffed by truly wonderful people. i would recommend the camp to anyone.
jennifer ross, parent"when i think of camp echo bay thereâs one word that comes to mind and thatâs home! both my daughters have attended this camp since they were four years old and every year gets better and better. there are so many activities and fun things to do at this camp. a big plus for me as a parent is the on site swimming pool where the kids go swimming twice a day!! 
read more my kids love the different themes the camp has every week. their favorites are definitely carnival and disney week. the counselors at this camp are absolutely amazing, the way they treated my children every summer  was phenomenal and  made me feel content when i dropped them off. i also love the drop off and pick up system this camp has, in and out one two three! everyone at this camp knows one another and they truly are like one big happy family! i would absolutely recommend this camp to anyone with children. i guarantee the smile you will see on your child's face everyday will be worth it!  oh and the camp director tommy is our family's favorite! we love you camp echo bay!" read less
