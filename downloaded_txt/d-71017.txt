											how can i keep the romance alive?
									 	

stick to the topic
when fighting or arguing with someone, try to stick with one topic. one mistake we all commonly make is to bring up what is bothering us and then complicate the issue by bringing up other issues and tossing them back and forth at each other like hand grenades while the actual issue gets lost in the heat of the battle.

winning the battle
arguments and fights in relationships often get out of hand because one or both parties feel they must "win" the battle. rather than trying to convince the other person to see things your way, lower your expectations to simply "venting the problem" without having to win.

fighting with compliments?
when fighting or arguing with someone about something you would like them to change, your suggestions will go a lot further if you have also let that person know what s/he does right. if your compliments and criticisms are out of balance, you may need to tip with scale by making sure you have given plenty of compliments before adding criticism.

											how can i change who i am?
									 	

inferiority complex
eleanor roosevelt once said, “no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”

											how can i keep the romance alive?
									 	

the only one for me
there are thousands of others out there who are compatible to us and to whom we might find ourselves attracted. many times, we become confused, thinking that if we are attracted to someone else, we must not be attracted to our mate anymore. this is not true. humans are capable of being attracted to, and loving, many people at the same time. how else could you be a wife, husband, parent, grandparent, or good friend?

											how can i keep the romance alive?
									 	

attracted to someone else
just because a person finds him or herself attracted to someone outside the relationship, does not mean there is something lacking or wrong within the relationship. it simply means the other person is compatible.
