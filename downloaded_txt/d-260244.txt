testimonials




thanks for helping us tremendously with our relocation from overseas. you knew the neighborhoods, listened to us and were always timely and responsive. this took real dedication since you had to transmit information halfway around the world.mike and beththank you for all your efforts. it’s a breath of fresh air to meet someone who is so professional and so caring.marie and salthank you so much for your honesty, commitment and loyalty to the selling of our home. when we first contacted you, our house had been on the market for 6 months. our careers had moved us out of state, so we were very concerned. you evaluated the situation, informed us of some cosmetic changes and kept us updated every step of the way. we had a contract in less than two months in a very difficult market. we sincerely appreciate you and all you did for us.bob and sharonwe cannot thank you enough for all your hard work and diligence in helping us find the house! you are definitely at the top of our referral list.holly and mikethank you so much for all of your help finding our house. you could have pushed us to buy something that we really weren’t sure about, but you kept telling us to look. you were more interested in us than you were in making the sale. we love it here.homeowneri just wanted to say thank you for helping me find my own home. your guidance and knowledge of the market really eased the search for me. i’m so happy to be a homeowner.sarah
