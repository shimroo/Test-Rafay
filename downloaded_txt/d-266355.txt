the titan 
                          50 delivers a show stealing performance in every heavy 
                          duty recovery operation. designed with the towing operator 
                          in mind, the titan 50's weight transfer maximizes towing 
                          capabilities while providing superior strength and power 
                          to make the job easier.









 












dramatic 
                          recoveries are a cinch with the cyclone 100. the combination 
                          of a 100,000 lb boom that rotates 360°, superior 
                          winch placement, and a standard radio remote control 
                          give you the ability to complete the most difficult 
                          jobs with ease. the cyclone 100 is equipped with a 40,000 
                          lb under lift with an excellent 128" of reach beyond 
                          the tailboard.

















aatac's 
                          amd is a tough act to follow. its "reverse hose 
                          track system" is designed for the least amount 
                          of wear and tear and the longest life of any hose system. 
                          the low clearance, 9,000 lb winch, 14,000 lb payload, 
                          and superior wheel lift, make an unbeatable combination.





















aatac's 
                          self loader is all about speed and convenience. the 
                          best rearward visibility of any self loader on the market 
                          combined with its extensive reach makes operation easier 
                          than ever. the towing operator can use radio remote 
                          controls from inside the cab or use manual controls. 
                          the exclusive auto-height and tilt sensing wheel lift 
                          make every job easier.
