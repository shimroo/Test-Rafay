what is molesworth furniture?


thomas c. molesworth


thomas molesworth was the pioneer of western design from 1890 to 1977.
his shop was located in cody, wyoming and was called “the shoshone furniture company”.
in the peak of his work in the 1930s and 1940s, his commissions included large dude ranches, the plains hotel in cheyenne, abercrombie and fitch, the annenberg’s, and president eisenhower.
molesworth’s artistic eye and timeliness created a legacy which is often imitated.
in june 1995, christies the auction house sold the entire ranch a collection, with items selling more than 50 times the expected price.
read more about thomas molesworth at the buffalo bill center of the west and by western hands.
