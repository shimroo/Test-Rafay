well, maybe three. i’m still putting one together “from scratch” – but more about that further down the page. in the beginning… roland’s sub-brand “boss” pretty much had the market sewn up. as a consultant to roland at the time, i was one of the first to enjoy it. heck, i even remember doing an […]
