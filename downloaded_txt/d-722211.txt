mattracks - rubber track conversions







mattracks, the original rubber track conversion system, transforms most 4x4 vehicles into a true all-terrain vehicle equipped with rubber tracks that will go almost anywhere and bring you back!

sprositive drive







the sprositive drive™ option for atvs and utvs has been specially designed to compensate for the mismatched ratios on atvs and utvs using over-running front differentials. by eliminating the slack in the front sprockets pitch and changing the pitch diameter in the rear, the sprositive drive allows your vehicle to stay locked in 4wd and helps keep all tracks pulling at the same speed.

steering assist







the steering assist provides easy, one-finger steering on hard surface by tapping into the vehicles power steering system. the electronic control module (ecm) part of the steering assist is required to operate the steering assist cylinders and automatically activates and deactivates their operation depending on if it's needed or not. it also automatically disconnects the power when not in use to prevent any drain on the vehicle electrical system.
