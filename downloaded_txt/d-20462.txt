						"lost without loadplus"
i originally started with a company that had a program downloaded to our server. we now use the remote version and log in through the remote desktop. we just completed 10 years of our company. freight mgmt has helped us along the way so much. anytime we have an issue, they are prompt to respond. i am proud they continue to improve the software – no resting on their laurels! it is always easy when hiring someone new because software is very straightforward – it makes the training process very efficient.
