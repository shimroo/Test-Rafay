"cherie
                  has done 3 absolutely wonderful portraits for me. just today,
                  i received the 3rd one, it is my recently deceased little
                  welsh corgi boy, simon. as i viewed the scans cherie sent me
                  of her progress, i was simply in awe of her talent. but today,
                  when i unrolled the portrait and saw it, it truly took my
                  breath away! i could not be happier with this portrait, it is
                  more than i could have hoped for. an e-mail or testimonial
                  wasn't enough, i had to call cherie and tell her how wonderful
                  it is! i swear, i can look at simon's face and it is almost as
                  if i am gazing into his eyes. cherie, you rock!!!! thank you
                  so much!!!"   charlene- illinios

"words
                  cannot describe how grateful i am for cherie's talent. cherie
                  blessed my family and i with two amazing pet portraits of my labs
                  dakota and jake. her artistry and love for what she does is
                  undeniable. dakota and jake were a huge part of our family and
                  i am so glad that through their portraits they will continue
                  to be for years to come. i could not ask for a better way to
                  memorialize our boys. cherie is a joy to work with and her
                  talent is a true gift!" - diane - media, pa
"working
                  with cherie was such an enjoyable experience. the portrait of
                  my dog, sport is so awesome. cherie really captured his
                  essence and the portrait itself looks like it was drawn with
                  such love. if you are looking for a special gift for someone,
                  or want a lasting tribute to your animal, i definitely
                  recommend pet portraits by cherie.''  sharon  -

"i
                  hired cherie to draw a portrait of my sister's beloved black
                  lab, bud, who was 15 yrs old when he died. the finished
                  portrait was fabulous. cherie managed to capture bud's true
                  spirit and the ever loyal and trusting look in his eyes. i'm
                  giving this portrait to my sister as a gift. it was an
                  absolute pleasure to work with cherie. she is a true
                  professional with a talent for capturing the spirit of your
                  pet. if you're looking for a wonderful gift or a portrait of
                  your pet just for yourself, i can without hesitation, highly
                  recommend cherie."  donna - pa
