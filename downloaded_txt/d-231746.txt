nasdaq combined composite index (compx)
close: 20027.0000 (81.1300), 14 feb 2025


positive






















						nasdaq combined composite index is in a rising trend channel in the medium long term. this signals increasing optimism among investors and indicates continued rise. a head and shoulders formation is, however, under development. a decisive break of the support at 19255, ideally with an increase in volume, signals a further fall. there is no resistance in the price chart and further rise is indicated. in case of a negative reaction, the index has support at approximately 18600 points.  the index is overall assessed as technically positive for the medium long term.




microsoft (msft)
close: 408.4300 (-2.1100), 14 feb 2025


negative






















						microsoft is within an approximate horizontal trend channel in the medium long term. this indicates that investors are uncertain and waiting for signals of further direction. a break upwards will be a positive signal, while a break downwards will be a negative signal. the stock gave a negative signal from the rectangle formation by the break down through the support at 417. further fall to 378 or lower is signaled. the stock is between support at dollar 404 and resistance at dollar 422. a definitive break through of one of these levels predicts the new direction. negative volume balance weakens the stock in the short term. the stock is overall assessed as technically negative for the medium long term.
