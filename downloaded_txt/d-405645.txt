who we are
south suburban special recreation association (sssra) is a therapeutic recreation program that is an extension of seven park districts and three recreation and parks departments. it is organized to provide individuals with disabilities or special needs, the opportunity to be involved in year-round recreation.











"the programs have really helped build up her self-confidence."

 











"words can’t express my gratitude. they are such good spirits and kindred spirits. they know your child’s strengths and they strengthen your child’s weaknesses."

 











"(sssra) changed our lives almost immediately."
