celebrating childrens’ talents in stem since 2003
as technology increasingly influences our lives, computer science and its related fields are now more important than ever - yet many children still don't have enough opportunities to learn how it all works. our mission for over 20 years at planetbravo has been to bring students fun, engaging stem-based instruction that boosts their confidence and gives them the skills they need to succeed in our modern world.






our programs
whether it's in our award-winning summer camps, computer lab curriculum, or after-school clubs, our students are consistently learning how to do innovative things. our creative approach to education has our students coding their own video games, engineering custom robots, filming original movies, creating digital artwork, constructing simple machines, and lots more.





  
techno-tainment summer camp
what started in 2003 as a little camp in beverly hills is now la's largest and most popular summer stem program for kids. with 8 locations in los angeles and orange counties, tens of thousands of children have grown up in the tech industry with us!

adrienne
santa monica




"if our schools educated with the same creativity, enthusiasm and ingenuity as planetbravo does, they would never have to worry about a child missing a single day of school or even running late for school! my son can't get enough pb...he wishes camp was seven days a week, and that the days were longer. he already knows what he wants to take next summer..."



karen r.
redondo beach




"enjoy doesn't even cover it...he loved it! i am amazed at the amount of knowledge he learned in just five days. your staff is fabulous. it's one thing to be good with kids or good with technology. your staff really are fusions of the two and make the camp a great experience for all the kids."

debbie

"you are the most organized group ever. i never worry about the procedures as pb is a fine tuned machine!! :) my son has finally found his peers! his niche! he not only is challenged during class, but i find it amazing that he never gets overwhelmed with information - he wants more more more. he is getting stronger and more knowledgeable every week. and just think - he is only 12!"



lisa d.
rancho palos verdes




"planetbravo is consistently ahead of the curve on every front. the camp is a great mix of concentrated and directed tech time mixed with coordinated and free-form play time for balance. [my son] observed that a couple new kids who didn't know others locally felt comfortable within a day and he felt that that was due to the environment created by the counselors."



michael h.
santa monica




"this was our boys' favorite camp for 2 years running; no doubt it will be their top pick for next summer as well."



amy l.

pamela t.
santa monica




"planetbravo introduced my kids to robotics, game design and animation all in one summer. every day they felt like they learned a ton and had fun. the camp offers a techie insider world with cool, challenging, and kid-friendly access. problem solving, creating all sorts of neat stuff like games and music, and playing together inside and outside make for an all-around great time."



michelle h.

shelley z.
studio city




"planetbravo is the best summer camp in la according to the needs of my son. it is a great mix of classroom and physical activities. he eagerly awaits all year long for the summer to come and participate in your programs. english is his second language, yet your friendly staff always make him feel at home."



roberto

michele p.

"planetbravo is the best camp ever! my son has attended many different types of camps, but planetbravo is by far, his favorite camp. he cannot wait for next summer. he says he wants to go to planetbravo all summer."



leslie b.
santa monica




"i found that maddy was excited to get out of bed and get to camp. she wanted to go the last week but had prior camp commitments. i know that with her training she received and how now she can navigate through the computer, will help her feel very confident with her technical abilities at her age. i will continue to support her since this is how we are going to communicate now and in the future. i love it!"



diane t.
redondo beach




"it was so fun and i've been complaining to my mommy i need to go back now! arggggg i need to come back!!! i'm coming for the whole summer next year and i'm seriously not lying! (oh just one thing i would like it to be starting at 7:00am and ending at 6:00pm!)



avery
camper




"[my son] loved camp! every day of both weeks he would get into the car and just go on and on about what a great day he'd had. he really enjoyed movie production and was quite proud of his movie! loved making the video game and creating the challenges and levels. he made some friends, saw some kids he knew from other camps and enjoyed each of his counselors."



synthia p.
santa monica




"everything was perfect! no need for improvement because you have already achieved perfection!"



terri p.
santa monica




"in 9 years of camp experiences with two kids i have never seen such a high caliber staff. the courtesy and caring along with the very fun and friendly personalities made an already great program so much better. [the director] had everyone and everything so well organized while still managing to speak personally with parents each day. the counselors did not speak down to the campers and [my daughter] really felt like they were one big group of people learning and having fun."



melissa s.
los angeles




"i think the program was not only very professional but sensitive to the children's experience. it was very 'kid centric' but in a positive sense. children were challenged yet considered in the planning. from the rock music on day one to the juice and cookies on the last day...i really respect the planning and execution of this camp. it rocks!"



andrea f.
redondo beach




"i originally signed my son up for 2 weeks -- he was so excited about camp bravo (and he's not very excited about much) i went ahead and signed him up for 2 more weeks. he was very sad when it was all over, and i know he can't wait until next year."



shirley o.
redondo beach




"you have the perfect formula – our kids are thrilled with your class. it's so invigorating and motivating for interested and capable kids. my son is already begging to take a 3rd week…"



cindy d.
beverly hills




"my kids begged me get them to camp early and actually ran into the classroom to get started each morning. i would pick them up at the very end so they wouldn't miss anything and be mad at me!"



ilene k.
los angeles




"we were amazed at the quality of work techno-tainment summer camp taught our 8-year-old daughter. she and three other 8-year-old campers created a story line, wrote, edited, and starred in their very own movie! it would rival any college short film. the talent in the team of counselors is phenomenal. this camp exceeded all of our expectations and as parents gave us great pride in the abilities it brought out in our child."



mitzi and stuart w.
beverly hills




"garrett has been attending camp since 2005. he has grown both in knowledge and in social situations. he has made friendships with campers from other schools which he has maintained throughout the years. i hope you will be able to continue some kind of program like robotics and programming for the children even after 8th grade."



marla
beverly hills




"this is by far my son's favorite camp of all time. we have spent thousands on other camps only to have him complain constantly and sometimes drop out. this camp was all he wanted and more. his goal is to keep going until he's old enough to be a counselor in training."

"you are the most organized group ever. i never worry about the procedures as pb is a fine tuned machine!! :) my son has finally found his peers! his niche! he not only is challenged during class, but i find it amazing that he never gets overwhelmed with information - he wants more more more. he is getting stronger and more knowledgeable every week. and just think - he is only 12!"

"planetbravo is consistently ahead of the curve on every front. the camp is a great mix of concentrated and directed tech time mixed with coordinated and free-form play time for balance. [my son] observed that a couple new kids who didn't know others locally felt comfortable within a day and he felt that that was due to the environment created by the counselors."

"this was our boys' favorite camp for 2 years running; no doubt it will be their top pick for next summer as well."

"this was a wonderful experience because, although it was super fun, [my son] also learned something great."



pamela t.

"planetbravo introduced my kids to robotics, game design and animation all in one summer. every day they felt like they learned a ton and had fun. the camp offers a techie insider world with cool, challenging, and kid-friendly access. problem solving, creating all sorts of neat stuff like games and music, and playing together inside and outside make for an all-around great time."

"[our son] loved the game making but he also loved the outdoor time and games played in the yard. a well-rounded platform."

"all the counselors were delightful...friendly, helpful, professional...all of them obviously enjoyed their work with the kids."

"this is an incredible camp. the campers have fun while learning in a safe and nurturing environment. my son has been attending for 3 summers, and it is a joy to be a part of, both for him and for me!"

"my son didn't want to go to camp at all this summer. he had so much fun after his first week at planet bravo, he begged me to sign him up for the whole month!"

"planetbravo is the best summer camp in la according to the needs of my son. it is a great mix of classroom and physical activities. he eagerly awaits all year long for the summer to come and participate in your programs. english is his second language, yet your friendly staff always make him feel at home."

"honestly, i thought everyone was so terrific. my son enjoyed his week so much we just wish we had known about it sooner so we could have signed up for more weeks."

"planetbravo is the best camp ever! my son has attended many different types of camps, but planetbravo is by far, his favorite camp. he cannot wait for next summer. he says he wants to go to planetbravo all summer."

"i found that maddy was excited to get out of bed and get to camp. she wanted to go the last week but had prior camp commitments. i know that with her training she received and how now she can navigate through the computer, will help her feel very confident with her technical abilities at her age. i will continue to support her since this is how we are going to communicate now and in the future. i love it!"

"it was so fun and i've been complaining to my mommy i need to go back now! arggggg i need to come back!!! i'm coming for the whole summer next year and i'm seriously not lying! (oh just one thing i would like it to be starting at 7:00am and ending at 6:00pm!)

"[my son] loved camp! every day of both weeks he would get into the car and just go on and on about what a great day he'd had. he really enjoyed movie production and was quite proud of his movie! loved making the video game and creating the challenges and levels. he made some friends, saw some kids he knew from other camps and enjoyed each of his counselors."

"everything was perfect! no need for improvement because you have already achieved perfection!"



terri p.

"in 9 years of camp experiences with two kids i have never seen such a high caliber staff. the courtesy and caring along with the very fun and friendly personalities made an already great program so much better. [the director] had everyone and everything so well organized while still managing to speak personally with parents each day. the counselors did not speak down to the campers and [my daughter] really felt like they were one big group of people learning and having fun."



melissa s.
los angeles




"i think the program was not only very professional but sensitive to the children's experience. it was very 'kid centric' but in a positive sense. children were challenged yet considered in the planning. from the rock music on day one to the juice and cookies on the last day...i really respect the planning and execution of this camp. it rocks!"



andrea f.

"i originally signed my son up for 2 weeks -- he was so excited about camp bravo (and he's not very excited about much) i went ahead and signed him up for 2 more weeks. he was very sad when it was all over, and i know he can't wait until next year."



shirley o.

"you have the perfect formula – our kids are thrilled with your class. it's so invigorating and motivating for interested and capable kids. my son is already begging to take a 3rd week…"



cindy d.

"my kids begged me get them to camp early and actually ran into the classroom to get started each morning. i would pick them up at the very end so they wouldn't miss anything and be mad at me!"



ilene k.

"we were amazed at the quality of work techno-tainment summer camp taught our 8-year-old daughter. she and three other 8-year-old campers created a story line, wrote, edited, and starred in their very own movie! it would rival any college short film. the talent in the team of counselors is phenomenal. this camp exceeded all of our expectations and as parents gave us great pride in the abilities it brought out in our child."



mitzi and stuart w.
beverly hills




"garrett has been attending camp since 2005. he has grown both in knowledge and in social situations. he has made friendships with campers from other schools which he has maintained throughout the years. i hope you will be able to continue some kind of program like robotics and programming for the children even after 8th grade."



marla
beverly hills




"this is by far my son's favorite camp of all time. we have spent thousands on other camps only to have him complain constantly and sometimes drop out. this camp was all he wanted and more. his goal is to keep going until he's old enough to be a counselor in training."
