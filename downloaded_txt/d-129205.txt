geordie dialect


my childhood council estate was built to house workers for the recently opened ministry of pensions and so attracted people from all over the country. our neighbours were from london, yorkshire, lancashire and a couple of northumbrians. it wasn’t until the slum clearances in the west end that we started to get some proper geordies living there. my dad was a ‘jesmond geordie’ and encouraged us to speak correctly at all times. my mother was a lancastrian, with scottish parents brought up in carlisle so she was no help either! although i did develop an ear for different dialects and became a bit of a mimic.20 years in the motor trade brought the geordie out in my voice and working in gallowgate and the west end meant i had to be able to communicate. i have since researched the origins of our language and written a book on the subject. i also write and record geordie dialect material for monologues.i also present the geordie hour on local radio so i feel suitably qualified to offer advice; if not as a well-read academic but an enthusiastic practitioner! first and foremost, i love dialects, especially geordie and am passionate about maintaining regional identities.












as a result of writing a book on the subject, producing many geordie monologues and cartoons and presenting the geordie hour on radio, i was asked by the bbc to appear on a special newcastle episode of songs of praise. i spoke about the origins and history of our language for a couple of hours - which was then edited down to a couple of minutes!
