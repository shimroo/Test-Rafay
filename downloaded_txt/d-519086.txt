      our mission


  gymnastics revolution was opened in 2001 by ncaa gymnasts allyson and brian bakalar, with a singular goal: to help the area's youth develop the tools for success in life through sports. while pursuits of excellence, championships, trophies, and scholarships would certainly be a piece of this mission, brian and allyson knew that using an approach that valued hard work, effort, positive coaching, and careful planning would give every child who walked through the doors of gymnastics revolution the best chance to reach their individual potential, both in sports, and later in life.
