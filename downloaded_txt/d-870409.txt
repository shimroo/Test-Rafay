butte environmental council is a grassroots-powered nonprofit. we are driven by our 300 members, 1,000+ volunteers, 50 local business sponsors, and more than 4,000 social media & newsletter subscribers. thank you to everyone who fights for our planet and its inhabitants.



missionto protect and defend the land, air, and water of butte county and the surrounding region through action, advocacy, and education. 



visionwe envision a community where humans are living in harmony with the earth; where neighbors are engaged, empowered, and organized to advocate for environmental and community interests. 
















bec’s work










action
through our membership model, bec aims to bring people together to protect the environment through building a strong community. bec is probably best known for the bidwell park & chico creeks clean-up. hundreds of volunteers work together every september to remove thousands of pounds of waste from our creeks and parklands. 






advocacy
our advocacy programs are working to protect groundwater, improve air quality, and encourage growth that is healthy for the community and the environment. bec’s first major accomplishments was a collaboration with sierra club and north state wilderness that resulted in 6,000 acres of ishi, bucks lake, and chips creek being designated as wilderness area in 1984!






education
our education programs inform the public through workshops and outreach campaigns. one of bec’s historic accomplishments has been hosting the endangered species faire for 43 years! in commemoration of earth day, this youth and family fun event brings 3,000 people to participate in interactive exhibits, activities, presentations and festive entertainment.
