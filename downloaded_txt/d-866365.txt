the dan dee experience






ruidoso at its best
cool streams, snowcapped peaks and bear hug hospitality. our charming mountain village provides the perfect destination for family vacations or quiet getaways. sit back and relax or take advantage of countless seasonal activities and events.  nearby midtown beckons with its many fine restaurants and enchanting shops and galleries.







a travel value
your cabin will combine the coziness of a wood-burning fireplace with the convenience of a furnished kitchen, cable tv, wi-fi, air conditioning, outdoor barbeque, picnic table, sitting porch and park-at-your-door convenience - all at a price that's easy on the pocketbook.







ideal location
since 1938 dan dee cabins has epitomized the ruidoso you long for. here you will experience the harmony of a rustic mountain setting and "kick-your-shoes-off" relaxation in the privacy of one of our thirteen forest homes on over five acres in the preferred upper canyon. wildlife abounds - you might even see a bear!







and a few extras
eight-person hot tub, ping pong table and children's playground provide added enjoyment. whether you just want to sneak away for a couple of days or take the whole family on vacation, you will find a welcome destination in the casual comfort and quintessential charm of dan dee cabins.
