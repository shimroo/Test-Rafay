about us
cannon pools has been a local family-owned company for almost 50 years. co-founder, bob malzman, was instrumental in the growth of the swimming pool industry in upstate ny.
there was a time when pools were considered a luxury only attainable by the affluent, but that’s not the case with cannon pools & spas.
our experienced employees have installed over 24,800 swimming pools – more than any other inground/aboveground pool builder in the eastern united states.
