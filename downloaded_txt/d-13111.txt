the diy boat repair theory






do you have to settle for 

 ....or would you rather own 






diy boat repair and parts "the right way", can make all the difference in your wallet!

you may have at some time or another heard the saying, "you might have a good running boat, or you may have some money, but rarely both at the same time" ? well, we are here to help show you that you can change the last part of that statement, and balance out the scales.



when the subject of marine diy comes about, one thinks of a. saving money, b. saving time, c. satisfaction of self worth, d. personal enjoyment of a hobby, or e. all of the above.introducing the diy theory you may find rare in your diy supplier search.....



boatpartstore.com recognizes the value of the diy theory, and has designed itself in catering to those ideas. we indeed want to be involved in providing you with a thru d above when you need repairs to your inboard or outboard motor, but our mission does not stop there like many other entities do. boatpartstore.com prides itself in not only supporting the marine diy theory, but also strives to provide the knowledge and experience of helping our customers do things the right way, the first time. whether your boating activities include skiing, fishing, racing, or whatever else you might like to do, remembering back, you first had to learn how. learning the right way brings about the ultimate in fun and pleasure, learning the wrong way can pretty much cause you to loose interest all together if your boat and motor is constantly breaking down and out of service.



let's face it. there is a right way and a wrong way for everything in existance. very few follow those rules to a "t", but they should certainly be applied as much as and whenever possible. simply "cutting corners" is not our idea of effective marine diy, doing it yourself the right way, including long lasting repairs, is. a boat and motor, being a luxury not a necessity, sort of dictates who can have and do what. a well supported diy person can cut the notch down a tad on the status of luxury being affordable, but only if the job is done right. if it's not, then where do the intended savings go?



when dealing with boatpartstore.com, you can have confidence and trust that you are receiving the highest quality of boat engine parts, experience, knowledge, and support, your hard earned dollars can buy for your marine motor replacement parts. not only will we provide the marine parts and accessories you desire or need, but also whatever it takes (short of hopping on a plane to come do the job for you), to assist you in completing your repairs or modifications as required. we've not been able to succeed the previous 20 years in the marine business for providing anything less.



you are invited to grab hold of the bps diy boat engine parts experience. we feel you'll be glad you did!




boatpartstore.com has a very large listing of the most commonly requested boat engine motor parts and accessories for you to choose from. due to the fact that there are so many motor parts for so many applications that we can't list them all, but you can always contact us for items you do not see in the store. rest assured that any personal information that you might submit while using our website is kept strictly confidential. no personal information will be sold or shared with other businesses. we also use the latest encryption technology to provide you with safe and secure ordering of merchandise.
