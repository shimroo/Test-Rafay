to fully appreciate our experience at sandcastle on the beach, you have to understand how our trip began: 

we originally booked at a resort on the north side of the island using marriott points. when we arrived there, we were told that the water would be turned off intermittently, and we found that, when we did have water, it was cold. the pool was green and closed for the duration of our stay and there was mold in the bathroom. we then tried to check into a hotel in frederiksted, but the office was locked up and there was nobody to check us in. finally, at nearly 10:00 p.m., not really knowing what to do, i called sandcastle, who i had heard about in passing from somebody i met in a bar earlier in the day. i was pleasantly surprised that the owner answered at that late hour and that, not only did they have rooms, but he offered to show us the available rooms and let us pick the one we liked best. 

all of the rooms were great, but, for the minor difference in price, we selected the king villa with the ocean view. it was dark when we checked in, but we could tell we were pretty close to the ocean. even knowing that, i wasn't prepared for the view that awaited us the next morning. it was breathtaking and we were 10 steps from the beach and probably 20 steps from the water's edge. it is the location you dream about when planning a caribbean beach vacation.

the room itself included a large living area with sofa bed, a full kitchen, double-sink bathroom with shower, a separate bedroom with king-sized bed, and a back patio with a seating area and an outdoor shower. the suite was well-appointed and well-equipped with a microwave, keurig, toaster, dishes, plates, mugs, glasses and, of course, all of the things you would expect like towels, soap and shampoo. 

it's a smaller property but it leaves you wanting nothing. there are two pools, a full restaurant with outstanding food and reasonable prices, a full bar, ample chairs, tables and umbrellas. everything is very clean and the attention to detail is second to none. the entire property is enveloped in lush and well-maintained tropical landscaping. you are even liable to see an iguana or two wandering about.

i was completely blown away by everything that was included. i have stayed at enough beachfront resorts to know that nearly everything but the room is typically extra. sandcastle included a continental breakfast, beach chairs with covers, towels, umbrellas and tables, as well as snorkeling equipment - all at no charge. that number of included amenities is unheard of, in my experience.

all of that said, what really makes sandcastle special is its people. chris and ted, the owners, could not have been more gracious when we were in a desperate situation. they truly saved our trip. we were really questioning our decision to visit st croix after our initial experiences, and they made our vacation wonderful. they kept checking on us over and over after we moved in to make sure things were going well. they didn't have to do that but that's the kind of people they are. the entire staff bent over backwards to cater to our every need. i travel quite a bit for business and it's been a very long time since i have seen that commitment to service. that only comes from people who truly care about their guests and that is very very rare. 

not only would we go back to st croix, but we would go back just so we could stay at the sandcastle. it was a trip we will never forget and we are very grateful to chris, ted and the entire staff for making that happen. thank you!  - read moreread less

my wife and i wanted a quick getaway. we chose st. croix because of the reviews for this resort. so glad that we did. what a wonderful little place. after going all over the island, we feel this is the best resort. we appreciate the snorkel gear that they loan. we snorkeled around the pier several times but enjoyed snorkeling right off the beach at the resort as much. ate at the restaurant several times and enjoyed each meal. drinks from the bar were great. glad i asked for a recommendation and got the lime in the coconut. it's one of my new summer favorites. rooms were clean, bright and spacious. the only thing i think that could be added would be some hooks or racks to hang wet bathing suits. some others have commented on the breakfast, but we really enjoyed the local pastries and fresh fruit. we really did enjoy our time on the island and do plan on returning. will only stay at sandcastle on the beach when we do return.  - read moreread less 
 


 



 darrell 

since our first visit to st. croix and staying at sandcastthe on the beach was perfect. my wife and i decided to return to this truly amazing place. the room was really nice with a patio to retreat to when we needed to get out of the sun. we have managed to visit most of the beaches on st. croix and the  beach here is our favorite, especially at sunset. the meals we had here were always great, and the restaurant staff were really nice. speaking of staff, josh is the greatest and really deserves employee of month in our opinion.üòÅ everyone was really nice and willing to help with any questions or needs we had. if you are having a problem with the staff here, you might want to take a moment to consider how you are presenting yourself. this is the only place we'll stay when we visit this great island and  i really can't recommend this place enough. i would give it ten stars if it were possible. so, thanks to sandcastle on the beach for another wonderful visit, and we hope to see all of you soon.  - read moreread less

best place to stay in st. croix
sand castle on the beach is, hands down, the best place to stay if you are visiting st. croix. we spent hours researching and chose scotb based on their reviews, website, stellar customer service, amenities, fair price and location, and we are so glad that we did.
from the moment we arrived, sand castle exceeded our expectations, from their kind and friendly staff, to the beautiful room, grounds, restaurants and pools. the beach is amazing--soft, warm sand, sparkling, clear water, free chairs, beach covers and towels, snorkel gear, kayaks, and more. scotb thinks of everything to ensure your stay is relaxing and easy.
located a short walk or drive from the small town of fredriksted, there is shopping, dining, entertainment, more beach access and a lot of local island life to explore just down the street. it is also close to the airport, grocery stores and pretty much anything you need, while being in the "quieter" part of the island.
after a week at scotb, we had to re-locate across the island for a family wedding, and we were so disappointed that we returned to scotb for one last day with them at their beautiful hotel and beach.
do yourself a favor and stay here if you are planning a trip to st. croix!  - read moreread less

this was by far the best and most memorable vacation we‚Äôve had. i stayed here with my partner and family back in may 2024 and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. the resort was beyond beautiful, the food amazing, staff incredibly kind and helpful, beach stunning, great location, fantastic owners‚Ä¶ i could go on. and on top of that we were greeted by a lovely kitty that roamed the resort. we all agreed we‚Äôd love to come back some day and that the memories we made here were some of the best of our lives. 10/10!!!!  - read moreread less

our stay was totally on point with others' reviews. lovely small hotel on a soft sand beach with beautiful blue water. never hard to get chairs on the beach. you can snorkel in front of the hotel or even better, walk down the beach to the large piece of stone that used to be a pier or something and go straight out. you'll see the shovel/bucket from a large piece of machinery that has turned into a reef, and then just float the drift back to the hotel or even a bit past it to see turtles, rays, and fish. snorkeling at the pier was also phenomenal!  

our room was kind of like an apartment since we had a full kitchen. extremely clean and included everything we needed. i can't say enough about the staff. they were so helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. this was an absolutely lovely place to stay that was quiet (no kids!) and comfortable. the continental breakfast and am coffee is a nice touch and perfect for lazy days at the beach or days when you're planning to be out and about. the owners, ted and chris, are just lovely. while the restaurant is technically separate, it is on the grounds and was very good. tim is a fantastic bartender and will tailor your drinks just how you like them. other notable staff included craig, andre, zander, armas, barbara, aaron, and josh. we can't wait to return!  - read moreread less

it was the best place i have ever stayed. the location was right on the beach with two pools. the little extras and amenities were beyond what i could have hoped for from free snorkeling gear rentals to free fruit and cute little alcoholic drink packages in the rooms. the staff went above and beyond. they were so personable and caring. i can not speak highly enough of them and the owners and the best bartender on the island. go you will not be disappointed.  - read moreread less 
 


 



 kim 

if you go, i guarantee you‚Äôll be back! this was our 3rd stay at this lovely beachfront resort, and i love it more every time i stay. everyone there is kind and welcoming, the resort is adorable, sparkling clean and comfortable. it will always be one of my favorite places on earth. i met another guest who said it was his 30th time staying, and that doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all. you just feel good when you‚Äôre there. directly on the most beautiful beach, i spend hours soaking in the water, then grab a drink or 3 from the bar and a delicious dinner at beachside cafe to watch the sunset, which, as you can see, is spectacular. where else do you see people applauding another beautiful sunset!
i recommend the black and white tuna and mahi bites from the restaurant. until next time, my friends!  - read moreread less

 angela 

let me tell you that it is me and my boyfriend‚Äôs first time in st. croix and this resort made our vacation so memorable. from the location of the resort to the friendly staff and everything else. we‚Äôre simple people not expecting much of anything, but this place is just what we needed for our vacation. it‚Äôs on the west end of the island, definitely surrounded more of the residential area so you‚Äôll see a lot more locals around. your view as soon as you walk towards the pool is literally the beauty of the beach. the front desk staff named josh, is just the best! he was so welcoming and everyday he would give us suggestions on where to go and places to eat at. the resort also has a cafe where you can order food and drinks. you don‚Äôt even need to go anywhere if you‚Äôre hungry. it‚Äôs just right there. all the staff are friendly. they also have ‚Äúcharlie‚Äù the iguana just strolling around the area so you‚Äôll see him there. haha. if you plan to go somewhere, you‚Äôll definitely need a car since this resort is on the opposite side of most of the tourist attractions, but if you plan to just relax and enjoy the beach, this is the place! they also provide snorkeling gears and let me tell you that you can just snorkel right there. no need to go too far to see some fishies and we saw turtles too! overall, we love this place. we will definitely come back!!  - read moreread less

we are fortunate to own a home on st. croix and to spend the winter months there.  whenever family and friends come to visit, we go to sandcastles, buy a day pass and spend a lovely day on their beach.  it truly is one of our favorite things to do on island as the resort is just lovely, super clean (great bathrooms!), with friendly beachside drink and food service.  for $15/person (more on cruise ship days) you get a chaise lounge and a shared umbrella and side table.  and the beach is beautiful and the snorkeling great.  i would recommend the chicken salad sandwich to anyone!

sand castle on the beach in the u.s. virgin islands is a delightful retreat that offers a relaxing and intimate beachfront experience. the location is perfect, right on a beautiful stretch of white sand beach with stunning views of the caribbean sea. the hotel‚Äôs vibe is laid-back and welcoming, with a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel at home from the moment you arrive.
the rooms are clean and comfortable, many with ocean views and easy access to the beach. the staff is friendly and accommodating, always willing to help with recommendations for activities or local dining. the on-site restaurant serves delicious food, particularly fresh seafood, and has a great cocktail selection, perfect for enjoying the sunset.
while the resort is peaceful and offers a great escape, some of the facilities are a bit dated, and the wi-fi can be spotty. however, if you're looking for a tranquil, beachfront getaway with excellent service and beautiful surroundings, sand castle on the beach is a fantastic choice.  - read moreread less 
 


 



 jae 

i have never been to st. croix or sandcastle on the beach. i had the dolphin villa for a week, along with my parents. the villa itself was amazing. well decorated, plenty of space for two couples, close to the bar/ restaurant/ pool and more importantly, the beach. the owners made sure, in passing, to stop and ask if everything was good, if we needed anything and the staff was very friendly and happy as well. their beach was very quiet. plenty of chairs and service was available. they even have ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù for floating, or snorkeling in the ocean. the onsite restaurant was great for lunch and dinner, with a beautiful view of the sunset. open and on the beach, so listening to the waves was a great experience. 
the pool was small, but me, i personally prefer to swim in the ocean and sit on the beach. i did get in the pool a few times and it wasn‚Äôt cramped, or crowded. 
my only complaint? (which is minor) the cookware in the villa. the pan we were provided with, to make scrambled eggs/ breakfast items, was not non-stick, needless to say, once again, minor. the other surprising thing, was the keurig coffee maker. being so close to the ocean, i was surprised, mainly because of the plastic cup waste/ bad for the environment/, plus, with a family of four people, coffee drinkers, it was a test of patience waiting for each cup to be brewed - individually! lol! 
other than that, i cannot wait to go back and i highly recommend this to all of my friends and family.  - read moreread less
