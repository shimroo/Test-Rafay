	               death * by * meth
	               
this is dedicated to travis holappa who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered on july 25, 2004 in northern minnesota.    

this was all due to meth.  i am travis' mother and i wish to make this devastation turn into a better thing by educating and exposing the truth about meth, the dangers, and the deadly consequences it brings about to individuals and communities.

i have just read chapter 6 in the latest book by scott thomas anderson.  it is a must read.  i cannot wait to read the rest! 

i jumped to chapter 6 because it is travis' story.  i am very pleased with mr. anderson's writing and the way he has captured travis' essence.

my child has been meth free for some time now and is doing very well.  there is hope.  there are days that are struggles but she has surrounded herself with so many people who want to support her recovery and do so.
thank you jesus for your love and mercy.

fear.  it is everywhere when you speak to a meth addict who has been involved in some kind of drama with a "friend" who has allowed them to hang at their house.  the "relationships" don't seem to last long nor are they always committed in a real friendship way.  the friendship is there by mutual "what can i get from you and what can you do for me".  when trouble arrives as it eventually does there are not many alliances.  it is dog eat dog.  a "friend" can kick you out of their home, keep all your belongings without any fear of repurcussions.  if you "snitch"... you will be labeled and far worse things will happen to you as the most evil of the meth world come looking for you.  the fear is so tangible, you are more than happy to walk away from all you own that has been stolen right in front of your face.  you want to live another day.  you may not have your belongings, but you still have your skin and if you are lucky... you still have your vehicle.the fear is tangible.  it has a smell and the darkness races to envelop and feed on it.  get out child... get out of that world if you can... that road has a very large sign saying... follow me... let's do the death march together...
