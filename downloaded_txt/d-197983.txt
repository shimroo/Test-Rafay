2024 al all-star team







new york yankees outfielders aaron judge and juan soto, who are like mantle and maris if they had joined the 1962 mets, lead my american league all-star team. soto hit .322/.458/.701 with 58 home runs and 144 rbis, while soto hit .288/.419/.569 with 41 home runs and 109 rbis. judge outpaced bobby witt jr. as the al’s top player. witt’s season was a lot like robin yount’s 1982 mvp season:


                      hr   run   rbi    avg    slg
2024 bobby witt       32   125   109   .332   .588
1982 robin yount      29   129   114   .331   .578


orioles left fielder colton cowser was the league’s top rookie. tigers right-hander tarik skubal (18-4, 2.39, 228 ks) won pitching’s triple crown.
