about









 

the virtual observatory (vo) is the vision that astronomical datasets and other resources should work as a seamless whole. many projects and data centres worldwide are working towards this goal. the international virtual observatory alliance (ivoa) is an organisation that debates and agrees the technical standards that are needed to make the vo possible. it also acts as a focus for vo aspirations, a framework for discussing and sharing vo ideas and technology, and body for promoting and publicising the vo.






to learn more about the ivoa as an organisation, read the "about" section.


 
 to learn more about the vo from a user's point of view, including how to find vo tools and services, read the "astronomers" section. there is also a page about the vo for students and the public.
 
 to learn how to publish vo services, or write vo-compatible software, start by reading the "deployers/developers" section.
 
internal ivoa discussions 
              are publicly viewable in the "members" section.
