            “i like that it doesn’t leak. when you let go, it’s not going to keep coming so you won’t over-fill”

leaving a legacy of quality
quality and trust weren’t just buzzwords when scepter was started as a small family business in 1949. they were the creed upon which this company was built. these traits are still at the heart of everything we do. to this day, scepter remains the symbol of quality.
