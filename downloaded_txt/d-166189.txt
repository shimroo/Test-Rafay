a rich history of the benbow family





hollywood hideaway
the combination of seclusion and elegant hospitality also served as quite an attraction for the early hollywood elite. spencer tracy, clark gable, alan ladd, charles laughton, nelson eddy and jeanette macdonald, joan fontaine, basil rathbone were all patrons of the inn.
dignitaries such as eleanor roosevelt, herbert hoover and lord halifax also enjoyed the benbow hospitality. guests enjoyed all the amenities of fine dining and luxurious rooms, along with the best of the great outdoors: riding stables, golf course, hiking trails, swimming, boating and fishing in the eel river.
