 about us
 
we love our little slice of paradise and hope to share it with you!



“blue sky cabins” is a unique, luxury experience located on a quiet, country road, 19 miles from red lodge, montana away from the noise and lights of the city in a serene, county setting. unobstructed views of the mountains & abundant wildlife makes 'blue sky' an unforgettable escape. we pride ourselves on pampering our guests with special touches and amenities not normally found in your typical, rustic cabin. our cabins are set up for couples only. (one or two people per cabin) perfect for a romantic getaway for 2! (we cannot accommodate children or pets) we are nature lovers, photographers and we fiercely love montana and all it has to offer for our guests. we love knowing that guests come back again and again, often to celebrate special occasions at blue sky.

do you need a vacation away from it all?

										we stayed at the granite cabin for about 36 hours & our only regret is not staying longer!this cabin is beautiful with many extra touches. romantic music on the cd, candles around the bathtub, soft comfy robes & binoculars. a very comfortable bed with very soft sheets. stargazing at night was amazing! so many stars! the owners go above & beyond to make sure you have a wonderful stay. we did not want to leave!
