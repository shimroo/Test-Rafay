  in defense of freedom        over forty groups send letter to congress on 9-11 commission recommendations a coalition of over 40 organizations sent a letter to members of the          congress outlining key points that should be considered as they draft          legislation          based on the 9-11 commission recommendations. the letter defines specific          areas of concern and makes recommendations on how the goal of security        and freedom can both be served.  following the issuing of the commission’s report congress is            acting quickly to address the report recommendations, but the letter            warns that there may be unintended negative consequences for privacy            and civil liberties if precautions are not taken. congress should          be mindful of the known failure of current information sharing schemes            to secure this nation against terrorist attacks, which have been          deployed          at the cost of civil rights and civil liberties.   letter to the congress on              the 9-11 commission recommendations, october 4, 2004          letter to congress on the attorney general's guidelines a coalition of over thirty civil liberties organizations has sent letters           to the house and senate judiciary committees urging prompt review of           the attorney general's guidelines. the guidelines define the powers           of the fbi to bring investigations against americans. changes to the           guidelines made by attorney general ashcroft will allow the fbi to engage           in prospective searches in places of worship and the use of private-sector           databases to detect criminal activity. the letter urges congress to review how the changes impact first amendment           freedoms of political and religious organization, to question the legal           basis for the changes, to establish regular oversight of fbi activities           to prevent abuse, and to determine how long the guidelines will be in           effect. letter             to the senate judiciary committee on the guidelines, june 4, 2002. letter             to the house judiciary committee on the guidelines, june 4, 2002.         in defense of freedom  on september 11, 2001 thousands of people lost               their lives in a brutal assault on the american people               and the american form of government. we mourn the loss               of these innocent lives and insist that those who               perpetrated these acts be held accountable.   this tragedy requires all americans to examine               carefully the steps our country may now take to reduce               the risk of future terrorist attacks.   we need to consider proposals calmly and               deliberately with a determination not to erode the               liberties and freedoms that are at the core of the               american way of life.   we need to ensure that actions by our government               uphold the principles of a democratic society,               accountable government and international law, and that               all decisions are taken in a manner consistent with               the constitution.   we can, as we have in the past, in times of war               and of peace, reconcile the requirements of security               with the demands of liberty.   we should resist the temptation to enact proposals               in the mistaken belief that anything that may be               called anti-terrorist will necessarily provide greater               security.   we should resist efforts to target people because               of their race, religion, ethnic background or               appearance, including immigrants in general, arab               americans and muslims.   we affirm the right of peaceful dissent, protected               by the first amendment, now, when it is most at               risk.   we should applaud our political leaders in the               days ahead who have the courage to say that our               freedoms should not be limited.   we must have faith in our democratic system and               our constitution, and in our ability to protect at the               same time both the freedom and the security of all               americans.           organizations         in defense of freedom   law         professors         in defense of freedom (pdf) press         release   computer         scientists         in
