the hanke family







from our family to yours

three generations of our family have helped visitors have life-changing experiences with some of the most majestic creatures on the planet. we’re blessed to live in what’s been called “the american serengeti,” with some of the highest concentration of whales and dolphins and sea life anywhere in the world — including our totem species, the orca. few people know these waters like we do. our experience and dedication makes it possible for us to guarantee that you’ll see whales on your trip — or we’ll give you another trip absolutely free.
