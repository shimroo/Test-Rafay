make a donation.thank you for considering a donation to support neuse river golden retriever rescue.our volunteers give their time, their homes and their hearts to every dog who comes to us for help. unfortunately, warm homes and loving hearts alone do not pay for the medical care and supplies our dogs need. adoption fees cover only about half of the total cost of caring for a rescued golden in our program, the majority (86%) of which is for medical treatments. sadly, the number of golden retrievers who have entered our program, and the costs related to their medical care, have dramatically increased over the past several years.when you make a tax-deductible gift to the neuse river golden retriever rescue, you can be assured that your donation is directly supporting golden retrievers rescued through our program, and allowing us to continue to provide help to others in the years to come.thank you for your support.
