“my mother and father grew up in mexico, but i was born in california at camp pendleton. i was about five when my father, sergeant edgar sanchez usmc, returned home from his service in iraq. my father’s career as a hydraulics mechanic inspired me to want to study mechanical engineering at texas tech university. my scholastic research is focused on the customization of 3d-printed prosthetics. i also helped design drone attachments to assist with reforestation. as a first-generation college student, support from the mcsf helped make college a reality. i feel the best way i can show my gratitude is to use my skills to help engineer a better world for others.”
