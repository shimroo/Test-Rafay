c, third letter in the english- and romance-language alphabets.
the symbol is derived from latin c, a rounding of the greek gamma, which was derived from a phoenician symbol called gimel or camel, which was in turn developed from an egyptian symbol.
latin c had both a g and a k sound. in anglo-saxon, c had at first only the k sound, the modern word child having been spelled cild.
by the 12th century c had the sound of s in a number of words.
from this arose the modern rule that c has the s or sh sound before e, i, y ae, and oe, and the k sound in all other cases.
