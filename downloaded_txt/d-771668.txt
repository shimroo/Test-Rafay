the
cool jet job i turned down to play rock and roll

i'm
an airline brat, meaning my dad flew for american
for 35 years.
when i was 19, he said 
get in and fly now,
or forever hold your peace.
i chose to grow my hair out and play rock
and roll.. 
(cool video)


 these stats
based on our old city counter over the last 2 yrs,
but stopped when neoworx (our old city counter) ceased giving
us this city data in july/13.... so who knows what it is now..?

 




 why
advertising on z100fm is good for biz


part
of our z-sales kit..
click for the pdf version..


hey bubba. 
you
a us citizen? know what your 
constitutional
rights are when the
cops pull you over? click
here to find out.
like that? then
try out this one with
a hip hop focus group flair..


 
 
q: what is z100fm and why does it sound so good?
 
a1: a station owned/programmed/operated by a musician
with attention to detail in audio quality and selection of the
best classic music mix ever, all digital.. only two commercial
breaks per hour 24/7 weekdays plus 25 hours of
great weekend
programming with westwood one radio news
updates
every hour.
the truth is. big conglom radio doesn't care about music and
 until we sell this station you
won't hear their repetitive weak,
safe, highly tested maximum profit making format here.
a2:  
listen
 in and see why.
