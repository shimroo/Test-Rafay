noble street festival and sunny king criteriumnoble street festival returns on saturday, april 5, 2025 for the 23rd year! 













the sunny king criterium brings a kaleidoscope of colors and whirl of action to anniston with twenty exciting bicycle races in downtown anniston. nine hours of live web streaming showcase the sights and sounds to cycling fans across the u.s., and around the globe. racing action will be called by professional sports commentators brad sohner and lauren hall. it’s one of the best days of racing to watch in person, or online, providing valuable exposure for the hundreds of competitors and their teams as well as area tourism.“there’s no better place to start up the criterium racing season for usa cycling’s pro road tour than in anniston. it’s a fast, smooth course in downtown with plenty of spectators. being close to talladega, speed is the name of the game for the sunny king criterium,” said sohner.sunny king automotive group continues as a longtime supporter of the sunny king criterium. admission for spectators is free for all bicycle races, making it one of the most unique professional sporting events in the country. a portion of proceeds from all bicycle race registration fees are donated to the american cancer society relay for life chapter of calhoun county. since 2002, more than $200,000 has been raised for cancer research and patient support.
