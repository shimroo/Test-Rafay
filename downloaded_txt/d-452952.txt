"independant journalist" means right-wing liar


feb. 28th, 2022 at 5:19 pm



 


ginmarchrist, i just found out somebody i thought was reasonable and sensible follows---and believes blatant rightwing liar andy ngo. you know,  the guy who edits out the parts of videos that shows the peole he calls "victims" attack the people he calls "attackers." https://www.dailydot.com/debug/andy-ngo-million-maga-march-video/https://www.dailydot.com/debug/andy-ngo-fake-articles/https://theintercept.com/2021/05/13/riot-squad-right-wing-video-journalists-black-lives-matter-antifa/https://www.salon.com/2019/08/28/right-wing-journalist-andy-ngo-outed-video-shows-him-hanging-out-with-far-right-hate-group/he lied about trumpies being "attacked."  he lied about himself attacked. he concealedworking with proud boys. in every case,  he makes a deceitful claim about the evils of liberals.  then,  the nextday,  the actualunedited videos come out,  where the "victim" turns out to have been the attacker.he invented fake reporters who inturn wrote fake stories. in every case,  the media runs with it. either the correction gets the small print treatment, or they use, "but some critics say...." which subtly paints the actial truth tellers as having a different opinion. also,  nobody points out,  if you're deliberately falsifying supposed evidence,  it"s not an opinion. it discredits you and the beliefs you're pushing. reminds me of the anti vaxx genius who was at some kind of medical specialty school, and she decided to do her thesis on how vaxxes cause autism, trumpism, priapism, male pattern baldness,  reduce your height by six inches, and so on.....but the school insisted that only peer-reviewed studies.  so she posted on an anti-vaxx board,  rather plaintively,  that all the peer-reviewed studies proved that vaccinations worked. could anybody point her at .......peer-reviewed studies that proved she was right and the whole world was wrong? this is the point at which a sensible person might be tempted to think,  "perhaps i am wrong," ----much the way people moved on from,  "witches ruined my crops," to,  "perhaps i shouldn't feetilize my fields with table salt because u/trumpisgod24 said it worked!  nah,  it's safer to keep doing stupid shit and believing proven liars because......because.....then you won't learn anything. but most important you won't have to admit you were....mistaken.drill sgts have a justified rep for yelling at people who do stupid shit, but the funny thing is,  if you say,  "hey,  drill sgt., i'm just not getting the hang os this.  what am i doing wrong?" the drill usually responds,  "okay, private,  let's see what's going on."  sure doesn't feel like you're stupid.  in fact,  it feels like the fastest way to fix an issue. for the "independant" (rightwing) journalists,  it's not adapting to new facts,  new angles,  or new discoveries that's the issue. it's because they think it's your fault you have to lie. it should be true that this is what their hero is the first one rather than the second one. the purveyers of these lies know lying sells.  the buyers,  though,  they want their lies to keep them safe,  that've been conned by a guy who hates them. that's dangerous.

ginmarjesus christ,  i have been overwhelmed with stoopitt,  dammit.my buddy had a couple of grand kids he vouched for, who i could rent to in exchange for handy dude stuff to be knocked off the rent. one kid had a dog. the other kid wanted a kitty. kid number one brought a dog bed in and said his gf's cat had peedon it. i explained if kid#2 got his kitten it would certainly smell that and might pee on it. kid#2 then said, "if that cat does that it's going in the snowbank."i stared at him sternly and said,  "the only thing getting tossed out is you . i won't tolerate animal cruelty."and the little fucker argued with me,  his potential landlady.  so....a few days later i texted him about the heap of snow we'd gotten and received a whiny,  self pitying text in return. "i guess you don't want me there."which was a surprise to me,  because i hadn't said that.  domewhere in there,  before the snowbank talk, this kid had gotten hired at walmart,  then he claimed the orientation lady abruptly fired him. that was a lie. turns out, he told the lady who was trying to hire him to get her ass moving,  at which point she sent him home to cool off. she called him the next day,  trying to still hire this kid, and he asked her if she'd like it if he came down there with a knife. he then showed up and several guys in suits booted him out with a trespass order. just like with moist chihuahua the crazed trumpie stalker,  he just invented shit to get angry over. this guy went from,  "no,  you're not abusing animals in my house,"-----which he refused to address at all-----to, "i guess you don't want me here." he said his grammps told him that. no, he hadn't. the way you say one thing and he hears something that makes everybidy else the bad guy is pretty illuminating. he doesn't listen to hear, he listens for key words to argue.so then kid #2 told me kid#1 was saying that i better watch myself-----because blah blah blah spoiled self pitying wyboi who doesn't listen invents all kinds of shit where he's the victim. like how he got canned for smoking crack at work,  not that he was such a good worker that jellus coworkers got him fired. long story short,  dipshit mcfuckboi started making threats again,  to me directly----how convenient!-----as well as to his brother,  i called the cops, cops arranged time & place for retrieval of his shit----about which he demanded i text him back (!)----and then he said he wouldn't come (he was already late) unless i called him,  which is some gavin de bwcker gaslighting shit of the, manipulate women into yalking to you. he'll be voting for trump after/if he winds up getting married,(and inevitably divorced), finding the bitter trumpies who live in a bitter soup of self-delusions, self-pity, and some kind of male-to-female translator in his brain that enables h8m to tune out women and substitute one of his sexist fantasies in there. his gramps trespassed him,  too, and gave me some "no trespassing"signs,  to which i will add.  "you know who you are. everybody else is okay." yes/no?  i wanted to put his first name there,  buuuttttt......it's an unusual first name. also?  while i'm venting,  trumpies need to stop whinging about how it's just politics. that's exactly like  calling the terrorists of 1/6 "tourists." trump is evil.  there's no excuse for voting for him. the six bankruptcies,  the attack on a disabled reporter, the hiding of the taxes,  and the constant spineless lies were just the tip of a very large iceberg. he's evil and he wants to turn the us into saudi america. the end.

santa's coming!


dec. 24th, 2021 at 5:08 pm



 


ginmarevery year about this time of day, i get the sniffles. it's that part of the newscast.  you know the one. where news anchors call up norad and some uniformed service member tracks santa's sleigh, giving young kids another year of childhood.  it's a sweet story. https://web.archive.org/web/20111224184358/http://www.noradsanta.org/en/whytrack.htmlbut there are some folks who don't realize that they say more about themselves than whatever the subject at hand is. https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.yahoo.com/amphtml/parent-uses-wing-slur-during-200900658.htmljust remember,  kids,  that one thing we can all agree on is that raisins in cookies are terrible,  deceitful,  icky impostors,  because they look like chocolate, but they are lying,  dammit. so happy hols,  whatever or whoever you worship, and examine your cookies carefully.

dear dudes (you know who you are)


dec. 11th, 2021 at 11:29 am



 


ginmardear dudes (and it's always dudes) who pop up during rape discussions, to trot out the standard rape apologist, "better a hundred  (rapists) men go free  (to rape about six women each)than one innocent man go to jail,"  why yes, i will conclude you are a man because you're defending the age-old idea that women lie about rape. (in this case, this asshole was addressing the mother of a toddler who was raped by mom's ex,  and detailed how despite absolute proof, the guy got a slap on the wrist,  as do the tiny percentage of rapists who actually get arrested.) rather than addressing that, our dude wanted to take the opportunity to nam (not all men) her,  because he cares more about one dude than approxomately six hundred women. then he really compounded the verdict by "calm down-ing", objections.   it's not that one rapist,  asshole.  it's all the dudes who believe their bros when they call their ex a crazy bitch, or who believe every guy who says he was falsely accused,  or who take accusations of rape oddly personally,  who leap to the defense of any and all rapists-----even total strangers but also especially famous sports guys, because sports dudes live vicariously through sports stars, and rape is part of that fantasy life----- but do not hesitate to falsely accuse any and all women.   "false accusations" do not exist when the accused is a woman,  and the accuser a man.   it's how nobody beings up the possibility that burglars or bank robbers might be falsely accused. it's how every woman has been harassed, raped, groped,  catcalled at, assaulted, disbelieved,  and so has every woman she knows. and it's not just once,  either. (unless she's one of those katie roiphe types,  who wrote one of those cool girl anti feminist books in the nineties,  sneering,  "if one quarter of my friends were being raped,  wouldn't i know?"the answer is no,  no you wouldn't know,  because you're such a hateful pickme that nobody wants to talk to you,  much less talk to you about something sensitive.) roiphe went on to sing paens to her son while the birth of her daughter hadn't gotten so much as a paragraph.  she also cheated on her best friend with that woman's husband and wrote an essay about it. it's how though every woman and all her female acquaintances have had all those sexual predations committed against them,  no man knows a rapist or batterer. it's how if one woman does something to a guy once he gets to hate all women forever,  because women are evil.but if a woman even hints something bad happened to her, she's a liar or she asked for it. it's only the past few years that people started acknowledging that there's so many men preying on women that women get harassed,  etc., etc.  multiple times in their lives.it's how the actual figures are that out of a thousand rapes,  only 384 are reported, 57 result in arrest,  11 are tried, seven are found guilty,  and 6 are jailed. that doesn't take into account the untested rape kits,  the cops tossing out rape reports without any investigation at all,  the fact that the vast majority of cops are white,  male, and trumpie,  and the fact that victims are often intimidated into dropping charges, that 40% of cops admit to wife beating.....what else? that's thousands of women,  yet not one guy knows any rapists. but i bet he knows some guys he knows are kinda creepy,  but not to him  or other guys, so come ooooooooonnnn,  ladies,  he's just socially inept!  you're too mysterious and subtle for him! funny how guys like that never have any problem interpreting subtle cues from other men.it's the fact that rape reveals what people realoy think about women----yeah,  you "fathers of daughters," i mean you, it's that rape is  microcosm of how society treats & views women, (even and especially prison rape jokes,  assholes,  because rape is rape and who do you think that guy will blame?),  it's that ultimately indifference is the best case scenario here,  because any guy making this sort of argiment is saying approximately 6,000 rapes don't matter to him as much as one man.  that's not a pure intellectual approach,  assholes. these guys never read books. it's almost like they're afraid of what they might find. also,  dickwad?  stop advocating for the devil. are you on retainer or something? the devil has enough advocates.  advocate for the devil's victims. (why do these guys always assume that the devil doesn't victimize people?)

a day in the life


dec. 7th, 2021 at 2:41 pm



 


ginmaranother life lesson brought to by cats,  to wit:  do not eat chocolate in bed. so after the obligatory morning litter scooping,  i decided to spend some quality time with bailey,  who is terrified of cats but loves dogs.  this usually involves bailey curling up on my feet defiantly,  occasionally just flexing his claws lightly,  which is probably what cat mafia members do when they want to send a threatening message without being explicit. (kind of like trump threatening violence all those times over the years. don't even try,  sad old trumpie farts.) this explains bailey's fear of other cats.  shut up! it totally does. so i'd left my bag upstairs and found a hershey bar in there,  as one does. breakfast! then my phone rang. as i chatted with a friend, i casually shifted some pillows and exposed my left foot. it was smeared brown. i shreiked.bailey gave me one of those scornful cat looks that makes me wonder if they're all secretly judge judy,  inwardly frustrated by the lack of ability to smack down humans judicially.  the friend on the other end of the phone----no doubt used to me shrieking and squeeing by turns after all this time----waited while i cycled through the gamut. omg omg omg that's cat poo how can it be cat poo omg omg omg how? what? where? why? why is it so....smeary? gross!" i flipped over the pillow and you can guess what was there. more shriekng. then i realized i was not asphyxiating from eau de cat poop. cat poo,  as any cat owner will tell you,  no matter how much we love our little beasts, is like nuclear waste,  which presumably does not smell like....cat poo,  which is pretty harmless.  unlike nuclear waste. man, if only cat poop was compostible, is the gardener/cat owner lament,  because composting ought to be a religion. cautiously, as befits a cat owner,  i touched the substance with a finger.  it was chocolate. moral of the story? if it were cat poop the neighbors would know. hell,  wisconsinites would go, "daryl! did you clean the litter box?!" my life,  so glamorous! please, please,  control your jealousy. paris hilton doesn't have this much sophistication in her life. note for trumpies, trollboys, and "i'm-not-like-other-girls-"girls"".....that's called 'sarcasm',  twits.

i must be doing something right


dec. 1st, 2021 at 12:32 pm



 


ginmarbecause trumpies, red pillers, gamergators, incels, anti maskers, anti vaxxers,  the sort of people who call themselves "patriots" with a capital "p" and"christians" with a capital "c", general reichwingers,and johnny depp defenders just hate me. need i go over every category and provide a history of the lies each group promotes?  the abuses and crimes each group endorses?  the conspiracies each group takes refuge in because reality is against them?  go ahead,  point out to a trumpie that trump called nazis "very fine people," attacked a disabled man, and insulted john mccain. show them video. they scream and attack you,  or they do anything to avoid questions and answers. oh,  to be an interrogator again.my favorite was when moist chihuahua accused me of doxxing him. he uses his real name. as an example of their tactics,  he accused me of being trans.or lying about....something. his excuse was that i was in combat in 2004 but women weren't officially "allowed" in combat till some later date. his trolling excuse was, women weren't "allowed" in 2004 so obviously i was lying or not a ciswoman. because in 2004 i must have been a man and since had surgery to change my gender. or.....something. still don't grasp the stupid there,  because it's so multifaceted in its idiocy. another thing i love is how they make up some shit that they claim i said, then "refute" something i never said in the first place.  because i'm such a subtle speaker. the only thing i like more is the capital "p" and capital "c" people,  because if you have to say it,  you ain't it. jimmy carter doesn't burble on twitter about how,  well......he's a lover of christ,  quotes bible verses.....because he's too busy literally sheltering the homeless and feeding the hungry to bother with dipshit poseurs. you see these profiles,  usually of some bottle blonde nazi barbie with guns and maga all over, lots of emojis, sobbing about "babies" and masks and evil vaccines....christ,  it's a virus,  not the goddamned easter bunny.  oh,  and don't forget they all "back the blue."

boy,  what a time to be alive....!


nov. 30th, 2021 at 8:48 pm



 


ginmari cannot beļieve it is 2021 and people don't trust vaccines but do gulp down horse dewormer and bleach-----to own the libs.  really want to own us? breathing. liberals breathe. they tried to install trump as a dictator. now they're saying it was antifa----they never say antifascist,  you ever notice?----despite the fact that they bragged,  plotted, planned, and printed teeshirts, bought plane tickets,and reserved hotel rooms  in advance.  weeks in advance. and before you praise mike pence he tried like hell to find a way to do what trump wanted.there's also the fact that most trumpies are either red-faced frothing email-forwarding stereotypical old white farts-----or their shiftless  gamergator kids living in their basements. there's the occasional "chicken-voting-for-colonel-sanders" type or the bottle blonde nazi barbies or the cool girls and pickmes but most of them look like scared  angry old white guys. they all want you to know how exceptional they are,  because most people in their demographic are too smart to vote for a guy who hates them. it's i'm not like other girls disease plus you know the way bigots say, 'some of my best friends are black?' they're that friend. antifascists----hm,  so if you're anti-antifa,  what are you,  again,  sparky?----look like the kid the angry bulging trumpies disowned for being gay or trans or feminazi---more on that later!---,  besides being a good twenty-odd years younger,  and in better shape than their dads who voted for trump, because they understand science and don't eat healthy. want to find a trumpie? old, white, male, consumed by hatred, watches fox "news", so glad that they no longer have to pretend to be nice.aside from which,  there's the fact that if you believe trumpies antifascists attacked the capitol to overturn an election that they won??and voting for trump!  omg, voting for trump. that tells me everything i need to know. was it the six bankruptcies,  the endless failed businesses-----which look like money laundering now,  which is all donnie's good for or at,  aside from raping lots of women----the lies, the hatred,  the threats,  the extortion,  the fact that every last person who works for him is a scumbag, the way he weasels out of testifying----surely what an innocent guy does-----and finally,  the whiny, petty,  terrified, spiteful,  malicious,  deceitful performance after we won the election and he lost?? i saw a trumpie say on tv, "if you leave off california,  we win." why would you do that,  sparky?  because if you test more, you get more cases,  so just stop testing,  covid will go away??i used to wonder what kind of loser would worship a failure like trump. then i saw some dudes who were wearing guns to go to walmart. dude,  if you have to wear guns,  just stay home and get a penis pump. sorry,  but it's true. the guys who whine about this are the guys who hate how accurate it is. trumpies tell on themselves in about million different ways.   facts are facts. this isn't the zombie apocalypse and despite all that shooting iron,  you'd be zombie chow if it weren't for all the kids and women and old folks you tripped to distract the zombies chasing after you. and speaking of which,  remember when the most tired za trope was "concealing a zombie bite"? now we have assholes who think viruses are the easter bunny and wearing masks is the holocaust. trumpies in congress are trying to install trump as dictator for life by ensuring that black people cannot vote. shut up about what you call "voter fraud",  trumpies;  you just don't want dems to vote or run. meanwhile,  trumpies are still in dallas,  waiting for jfk jr.,to return from the dead, because of course jfk jr., would.....support a reichwing sleazebag like trump,  who even in the nineties was a joke. there's so many layers of stupid here, where do you start? trumpies like to crow they "trigger libs." it's like a kid shouting,  "i win! i win! i win!"when they lose. which is exactly what trump did on election night, using that cooing,  wheedling tone he brings out when the bullshit is especially thick. and we warned you. bernie was never an option,  he was just leftie trump. he hasn't done shit and why,  again,  is he surrounded by such sleazebags?  no,  "the revolution" will not bring about some green existance where poseurs get to teach politics in the afternoon,  while working on their "art" now and then and eating artisan food from vegan farmer's markets. revolutions are wars. look at what happened in cambodia. that is what will happen if thr bros and sarandon get their way. is sarandon going to fight in thid revolution? we're in this mess because too many people love it when men tell lies about women,  but nothing infuriates americans more than when a woman tells the truth about men. ever notice that the phrase "falsely accuse" is never something men do to women,  even though when you think about it,  it's been constant. how come every woman knows countless women----including herself----who's been raped,  molested, stalked, abused,  but all dudes only know dudes who've been "falsely accused" by that "crazy bitch"? or put in the sex offender list for peeing? and "witch hunt"?  how did that go from "a bunch of innocent women were falsely accused by a bunch of rich white men under laws that were created by men for men,  sexually assaulted, tortured, and murdered" to,  "rich white guy accurately accused by numerous women whines that being accused of his own actions and words is the ultimate in injustice"?  in fact, ladies,  the more evidence and proof you have, the more likely you are to accused of plotting,  scheming,  and lying.  funny,  innit?    so here we are.  qanon is real,  but sandy hook is not. masks are a nazi plot,  because....trying to save peoples' lives is just like genocide. vaccines are untrustworthy but horse paste is great! some charleton who believes in demons is more reliable than a doctor who's served five presidents. obama is a muslim. trump is a christian. kyle rittenhouse----who shot two unarmed men---got off on,  basically, pre-emptive "self defense" because murdering people who haven't hurt you is white guys' fondest dream. in georgia,  three other white guys tried nearly the same defense in front of a nearly all-white jury, after they videoed themselves hunting an unarmed black man like a deer, but they got convicted. georgia. they thought the video cleared them. the boss of the dad in the group sure tried to save them, but it didn't work. they thoight the video exonerated them.trumpies are living in a world of toxic loser lies,  told to and about guys who had every advantage ever and still didn't do squat. they believe in those lies because they feel it's unfair that they're not true,  that they should be true. those lies are tgeir identity  mess with those lies and you kill their self image.  that's what we're facing.

the only cure for moscow mitch is carolina reaper viagra


mar. 14th, 2020 at 12:17 pm



 


ginmarso mitch mcconnell stood on the floor of the senate and denounced the house bill to support renters,  poor people,  non-salaried workers,  and workers who rely on tips as "an ideological wish list."  i love it when evil people inadvertantly confess.  to republicans,  compassion and good economic sense are "an ideology." republicans treat poor people as if they're the bottom of the barrel,  instead of what they really are:  the backbone of the economy.  give a poor person money,  and they pay bills,  they buy necessities,  they pay rent.  they make sure other people have jobs.  give a millionaire any money,  and he keeps it in an offshore account and hoards it.  he avoids taxes at all costs, and he pays his workers as little as he can get away with. republicans like to help millionaires screw over their workers and everybody else who can't hire high-priced lawyers. then repubs tell those workers that the millionaires aren't the problem,  it's their fellow poor people.  or they tell them that one day,  they'll be millionaires too,  so they better keep those crooked laws in place. (reminds me of dudes who scream about me too. they might not have committed such crimes themselves---though that's doubtful---but they cherish the idea of doing so, and want to ensure that they can get away with it, too.) "an ideological wish list." there you have it,  folks.maybe he stores his viagra too close to the carolina reaper sauce.  not that moscow mitch ever eats spicy food.  he looks like he thinks gravy is a beverage. one can dream of earthquakes,  though. he's evil.  the end.

ginmarbabygirl,  2010-2020.she was normal the night before.  i took some video then. that was when i noticed how thin she was. her pupils are not dilated. take your pet to the vet immediately if you see this. her retinas are detached. they don't know what killed her because they felt she was too fragile gor blood tests.  her last hours were spent sedated to the gills. thank god. i hope it helped.  i don't think i'll be able to get more cats.  i have to go through this with zillie and morgie and ebs and jez and shadow. maybe i can find homes for the fosters. i don't think i can keep going through this.

ginmarshe's gone. the vet stressed that because she was dumped off on my doorstep there was no way of knowing what she'd been through.  abbie came to me with kidney problems because feral kitties don't get enough water. snowball was fiv+.  shadow is flv+. she had very high blood pressure and at some point in the past two days her retinas became detached.she lost some weight.  she had fluid in the lungs and the trip to the vet was torture for her. i was not going to keep her alive in pain for selfishness, but god,  my kitties are all old. i don't know how people work there and go through that every day.  i got in the house and called for morgie,  shadow,  and......baby. the house is very silent without her.

trump meets lavrov


dec. 13th, 2019 at 10:17 am



 


ginmarso....trump had sergei lavrov in the oval office, and once again barred american press from covering it. we'll have to wait till tacc does a piece about it to find out how the meeting went.  okay,  stop and put your head between your knees till the irony goes away.  when your ears stop ringing,  you're safe to straighten up. oh, gee whiz,  if only somebody had warned us about what a traitorous scumbag trump was.  gee whillikers, how unfortunate that nobody with testicles and the credibility that comes with bragging about sexual assault (or writing how 13-year-old girls are ready for sex and babies) had warned us! meanwhile,  for weeks now the asshole whose daughterwife works in the white house scooping up business deals with the chinese is trying to claim that the son of his supposed political rival was corruption personified.  that explains why he strongarmed the young president of a country (that is currently under attack by his murderous idol vladimir putin) into slandering that political rival's son.  no slander,  no weapons and aid with which to defend his invaded country against putin, who invaded in 2014. tens of thousands of ukrainians have died. no,  excuse me.  those people have been killed by russian soldiers or "ukrainian separatists."  putin wants to be czar. yesterday,  mike fuckabee tweeted this. this is my screenshot. do you get it now?

so i heard some people are....


oct. 28th, 2019 at 11:40 am



 


ginmarso trump bragged---in gruesome terms----about how he got baghdadi.     jim wright at stonekettle station said it was a good thing and that trump did the right thing,  or something like that----and a thousand people dropped him. take a wild guess as to what those people are not going to do on election day,  because,  yeah,  i can really see them holding a grudge that long.  so here are the relevant facts as i see them.  add them up and make your decision.trump betrayed the kurds and let them be slaughtered just last week----in a region where loyalty and honor are paramount.   trump allowed hundreds of isis fighters and supporters to escape as a result of the way he suddenly stabbed the kurds in the back.   baghdadi was a serial rapist and a vicious torturer who burned prople alive,  beheaded them, tortured them, and committed so many atrocities that the english language lacks the foulness to adequately sum up the man. his absence improves the world.  trump revealed operational details that could endanger future missions.  trump revealed information that might identify the source who led to baghdadi in his eagerness to sneer at obama and brag about himself.  he previously caused the death of at least one other source----the isis spy who exposed the "laptop battery explosives" plot that was known only to one or two people. he did this by bragging to the russian handlers he invited into the oval office, the way a weak person brags to try and prove how macho they are.   trump also dismissed the dangers of freeing isis by saying, "they'll just go to europe first," which is just so----!!!     jim wright said trump deserved praise for getting baghdadi. yeah, he greenlighted the missiin and golfed through it. trump's grotesque gloatimg is sure to enrage isis. there you have it. you decide how it balances out----but whatever you decide,  vote blue.  the end.

"straight pride"----because "incel nazis" isn't tuneful enough


sep. 7th, 2019 at 9:36 am



 


ginmarholy shit.so you all remember that pathetic so-called "straight pride" parade a while back,  that everybody who wasn't a reichwinger correctly pegged as a "reichwing incels pride undercover white supremacy" parade? yeah,  the boston pd pepper sprayed all the antifa protesters,  then arrested them,  and then one of the good ole boy judges refused to dismiss the ludicrous charges,  which is like the kkk arresting naacp marchers and charging them with "rioting".  no,  actually,  that's pretty much exactly what happened.  the judge even had one of the defense lawyers arrested when she attempted to read caselaw in court about how calling a cop "a pig" is a right and-----in the case of the boston pd----merely truth in advertising.  all apologies to those of the porcine persuasion. the judge----richard sinnott----was appointed by a repub,  and he is not one of those repub judges that kind of pleasantly surprise you by actually *reading* the constitution. the repub governor who appointed him praised his "human rights record" without noting that "human" to repubs means only "pale" and "male" and "taliban without the turban."  even by the standards of repub hypocrisy,  though,  sinnott throwing the book at protesters is like a whorehouse madam calling somebody else slutty.  turns out sinnott himself *shot* a man,  though he called it "self-defense" and *another* white dude got the charges dismissed.  and shortly thereafter,  sinnott got sent to iraq,  which is exactly where you'd want to send a typical touchy hypocritical proto-reichwing turbodouche,  in case that war didn't meet your "fucked-up" requirement for the decade.  note:  all of the preceding and following remarks are deeply sarcastic,  so don't @me,  which ought to be considered no duh territory,  because jesus christ,  pal,  who am i? (was anybody else disappointed that the sarlacc in rotj wasn't some kind of sarcasm monster?  no? just me? okay, moving on....)so,  anyway,  here is some more sarcasm,  while i dose myself with yet more tea because i have not yet discovered how much tea you can drink before you pee pure caffeine and then fishing in the rivers around your house becomes a brisk exercise in  masochism. https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/09/05/lawyer-held-contempt-guilty-acting-like-man/yliixegfqss4rxap2tiy3i/story.html

ginmarlook at this pudge butt. fyi,  what he's laying on is a "litter enclosure" that's made out of pressed wood and covered with carpet.  i sprayed the inside with flexseal---which was absolutely useless----and put one of those litter catcher mats in there,  which does work.  and then, of course,  a litter box. the dilemma is that first thing in the morning i scoop all the litter boxes,  but also,  the sun is irresistable as well,  and so here we are. time to have my tea.  i've started drinking tea agsin and i've noticed the stomach aches have backed off considerably.  see?  tea solves everything.  on this foundation i shall build my church:  tea, books, cats, real window seats for many hours of reading,  and yeah, adopt don't shop.  plus the first person who figures out a way to digitize all the books will be a saint in thos church, complete with statues.**okay,  said"statue" might resemble old barbie dolls, beanie babies, and action figures,  but the thought is sincere.

epstein


aug. 10th, 2019 at 11:39 am



 


ginmarso jeffrey epstein apparently killed himself after an attempt a couple of weeks ago.  he'd asked to be allowed to serve out his pre-trial detention in his zillion-dollar manhattan penthouse,  which.....shyeah.  he was never going to be a free man again. of course,  lots of very powerful men were implicated in his rape spree.  cui bono?  in a lot of suicides,  the answer is no one,  though the suicidal person themself might believe otherwise.  here is the suicide prevention hitline number. i still call them because the shadows still gather now and then, and you can prevent them from turning into a deluge. 1-800-273-8255.  if you need to,  call them.  repub morons are already trying to make clintonbodycount happen.  to which i say:  monica lewinsky,  you twits.  paula joneshell,  anthony weiner still wanders around. but....but....seth rich,  you say! yeah, before you get to say that poor kid's name, seth rich,  where was barack obama born?  answer anything but "hawaii" and you can bugger right off. seth rich died weeks before that rapist assange got those emails from russian operatives.  abd he lied about that.  meanwhile,  jamal khashoggi was disciplined by the saudis weeks before they murdered him.....for criticizing trump. trump,  who is so thin-skinned and vicious that he wants to murder the press.  trump,  who calls the press "the enemy of the people" or "fake news" when they quote him verbatim or otherwise expose him as the whining lying tittybaby he really is. a few weeks later,  khashoggi was lured into an embassy, tortured, murdered, and dismembered. cui bono?  trump and his fans and enablers lie hatefully, viciously, and constantly.  worse yet,  they lie because of their own failings.  that makes them vicious---and dangerous.  trump has paid bribes to women to prevent discussion of.....whatever. you figure it out.

stop farting around,   a rant in the key of pissed off


aug. 8th, 2019 at 8:54 am



 


ginmarchrist   fuck these commentators for mealymouthing trump's racism. he started his cam------you know what?  fuck this shit,  i ain't repeating all the bullshit.  what i want to know is why trumpies don't iddntify themselves as trunts right up front.  oh,  yeah,  because then you'd know that they voted for this lying, hateful, petty, spiteful, weak, fraudulent, dictator-worshipping, malicious, spineless, constitution-hating, reality-impaired scumbag because he promised to "hurt the right people"----in the words of one of his more disgusting groupies-----and because he bragged about sexually assaulting women.  yeah,  make no mistake.  his male fans voted for him because he's a serial rapist and that's what they fantasize about.  fellow liberals,  we need to talk.  first off,  you cannot educate these assholes.  they are not mistaken or economically insecure or voting in spite of something.  they do not believe abortion is murder,  otherwise they would punish men,  too.  one man can casually impregnate a hundred women.  they do not believe fetuses are babies.  well,  let me put it this way:  they're so fucking dishonest,  who gives a shit what they say they believe. what are the results of their actions? are those results consistant over the years?  then fuck their lying asses. stop wasting your time. they will not listen or learn or "be best." there is no best with these assholes. the reich has a long history of deceit,  starting with calling themselves capital-p "patriots" (often while flying the confederate flag) and capital-c "christians",  even though jesus.....do i need to point this shit out?  before my tea? there's the original breitbart,  who so edited a video of shirley sherrod that she appeared to be saying exactly the opposite of what she actually said,  resulting in her successfully suing that lying slimebag. breitbart gave a start to serial diarrhea-on-legs james o'keefe,  who edited a video of acorn workers till they appeared to be giving sex trafficking advice to a pimple-faced douchebag wearing a seventies-style blaxploitstion pimp outfit. in reality,  he had his vile little anti choice friend lilah rose film him in that get up, then he went behind the camera,  implying he wore the outfit during filming. o'keefe later dressed up in phone repairman-drag to invade dem congresswoman mary landrieu's office to try and place bugs. he took a plea. later on,  he tried to lure a cnn reporter onto a "rape boat" to film god knows what,  but was exposed by one of his compatriots,  who got worried as to what o'queef was really going to do. just this past year,  he hired somebody even dumber than he is to approach the wapo with a story about how she got impregnated as a teen by roy moore,  who then forced her to have an abortion. seriously,  look this story up. i can't do it justice.then there's david "baby parts" daleidon,  who whittled tbs of video of planned parenthood workers discussing organ donation into something that sounded like an advertisement for cannibalism.  then there's jacob wahl or wohl or what-the-fuck-ever his name is. he's the dipshit who was banned gor life ny the sec for crooked trading as a teen. he claimed he knew a woman who'd accused robert mueller of rape. among many problems with the story---oh,  wait!, i have so much to tell you!-----was the fact that mueller was on jury duty several hundred miles away.  jacob wohl claimed that he'd been given this information by an intelligence group. the photos of this company's employees included actor christopher waltz and a filtered photo of wohl himself, under a different name. the "intelligence group's" phone number.....went to wohl's mom's phone. rightwingers lie to you and themselves because they will argue against gravity if they think it helps their cause. they stick to websites that promote their bizarro world theories,  where trump is a christian, but obama is not; where trump is a crusading hero and robert mueller is a craven creeping dishonest schemer; where hillary molests children but roy moore does not; where sandy hook isn't real but qanon is.  i could go on and on and on. they are afraid. fear plus hatred makes for vicious, angry people.  fear us what the gop sells.  that's all they have.  gotta say,  a few years back,  i jad some repub friends who called me a crazy bitch and said i was too hard on repubs. that's because anybody with a brain could see where the gop was heading. and can you knock it off with the "john mccain defended obama," thing? the lady said "obama is an...an...ayrab," and mccain said, "no  he's not, he's a decent person and a citizen who i just hqppen to disagree with on a few things."  this implies that "ayrabs" are none of the things mccain said obama was.  also,  has everybody gorgotten the keating five scandal?  and how mccain "saved" the aca purely to get back at moscowmitch for gutting a piece of mccain's legislation?  (and another thing,  why can't we view people as humans, instead of outsized charactures, both good and bad?) and can we stop with the whole, "well,  i would never have an abortion myself----?" bullshit? it's just another way of embracing misogyny and directing it at other women. yes, honey, you are like other girls.     so dispense with the pretense. if you voted for trump you are scum and not worth my time. if you are a woman and voted for trump, you are obviously hoping to throw other women to the predators in the hopes they get assaulted instead of you.  reichwing women always look like they'd enjoy holding other women down for fgm. plus i think they hate liberal women for not being stuck with the good girl shit reichwing women chose. being a liberal is simple.  you give a shit about other people.  except for those berniac and stein assholes who either didn't vote, voted for trump, and/or spread trumpian lies about hillary.  fuck you. and how sad is it that giving a shit about people is called "virtue signaling" by reichwingers, the supposed "christians" because they can't imagine being nice? abortion is good. gun control is good. so is birth control and gay rights and science and facts and reality and welcoming immigrants to the us and gay marriage and transfolk embracing their true selves and school lunches and libraries and womens' rights and the fairness doctrine and treating everybody equally and getting black folks some justice and  getting trump's tax returns and voting and fighting global warming and and and and and and making america what we hope it can be.  stop apologizing or accepting their framing. start fighting. you want to fight fire,  you have to know how to use fire to stop fire.  start lighting matches.

ginmarwell,  i was taking out the garbage and a wave of that dizziness hit me.  i'm lucky i didn't break my neck. i landed on my knees, my bad shoulder,  and my chin.  i got my hands under me at the last second.  now that the er has diagnosed my dizziness as "unknown" the va is using thatas an excuse to brush it off.   that's my knee.  that's my shoulder. in better news,  i noticed that one of the ferals at the old house was limping on a badly-swollen paw,  so somehow i went zipping down to borrow a trap.  i also ordered tuna and cat nip from amazon,  which then managed to screw the pooch,  because i put do not forward in the delivery instructions.  this confused the driver so much that while he managed to walk from the truck to my door to slap a notice on my door,  he could not deliver that $$#÷^*!! package.  instead,  i was advised i could "pick up" my packages any time. about ten miles away. if i wanted to goddamned pick up the fucking things   why did i order them to be delivered?? ups was impossibly shitty about the whole thing, blaming it on me for putting do not forward in the delivery instructions,  because that confused the evolutionary cul-de-sac on legs they had driving that day.  this was a pain in the ass because i had one day to get a lot done and ubering ten miles and back was not in either my time or financial budget.  miracle of miracles, the kitty walked right into the trap.  he is now neutered, vaccinated, ear-tipped, and the abcesses in his paw were drained and cleaned. i kept him on my side porch for several days till the paw closed up enough,  but finally let him go because he looked so miserable.  he only looked slightly more thrilled after the vet's visit,  which i could joke about but won't, because it breaks my heart to see that liitle face. and to put a capper on everything,  my tenants---who signed an 18-month lease----gave notice a month ago but my property manager "forgot" to tell me,  so they spent weeks lying to my face and sneaking out late at night with their shit.  you know what?  once i get the old house sold, i might just wait out the lease of whoever the tenant is at the time, fix up this one to my heart's content,  knock out a door or two, and live in the whole place.  airbnb a bedroom or two a few times a month. insulate the hell out of the whole house and rewire it. that might be fun.  it's not like i'm not paying the fucking heat bill anyway.
