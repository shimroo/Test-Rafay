aboutmuscle machines


the smell of burning rubber, gasoline, the sound of 1000+ horsepower ripping down the track. that is the essence of muscle machines, the brand that is synonymous with power and classic american muscle. weâve brought the brand back from the ashes before, but this time, weâre doing it different. weâre sticking to 1:64 exclusively with new tooling right out of the gate in every release, everything from american muscle to euro supercars and jdm classics. this way we can focus on bringing enough new content and the muscle machines that the fans have been waiting years for. also, for the first time ever in muscle machines, all new flatbeds transport sets! look for it in-store or online around july. welcome to the new era of muscle machines!
weâre planning on promoting the line heavily online and in print magazines, as well as offering chase cars and limited edition promotional merchandise throughout the year. each car/transport will be individually numbered and have itâs own upc to promote online sales of individual titles as well. weâll be communicating with fans on our social media pages and website to get your feedback and see what cars/trucks you all would like to see in the lineup.
keep checking back on our website www.musclemachines.com and follow our social media pages @musclemachines for all updates and more pics of the new era of muscle machines.
