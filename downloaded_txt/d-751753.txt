"ya, it gets stuck on the thing in the back of my throat when the teacher calls on me."


            "my words are like fish and i can't catch the one i want."


"it's like i got marbles in my mouth, i just can't always say those long words."


"usually...no, it's  useful...no, it's useless! i really knew the word was'useless' from the beginning. i looked at it and knew what it was, but my mouth read the other two words first. it is so frustrating."
