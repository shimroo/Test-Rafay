sometimes, truth hurts!





  hey there, water walkers and water walker wannabes:    minutes ago, i visited novelist rhonda mcknight's fb page as she shared about her mom crying when she received copies of rhonda's new book, an inconvenient friend.    tears of joy.  i love it!  gives me hope; but surprisingly, also, brought up pain.    you see, my books are nonfiction.  in my case, my mom still spews displeasure, hate, and venom anytime my last book, i say a prayer for me, is mentioned, comes to mind.  recently, she let me know that she doesn't want to see the new one or anything else i write.  it hurts.  but write on, i must.   she also doesn’t want to know anything about me speaking anywhere.  if i never got another opportunity to speak it; she would love it.  but god opens doors, and i speak on.  i must.    now, writing this—my feelings—my experience, i feel censured by some whispered unwritten rule created to rise up against my voice steeped in what have become my greatest allies, transparency and honesty.    while i’m living within the my passion and i believe god's purpose for my life, it alienates me from the woman who birthed the woman i was destined and designed to be.  out of respect and to keep the peace, with the one woman i love above all women—my mother; what i do, is unspoken.  sometimes, it’s best to understand rather than be understood.  sometimes, truth hurts!  but to acknowledge and embrace who god has called us to be; we must acknowledge and let go of who we were when, by grace, he chose to extract us from the dark and into his marvelous light.  the moment this wonderful new reality hits us, this grace and mercy that we’ve so freely received, we give up the world’s way—of secrets and sequestered lies that we thought were keeping us afloat and who we really were hidden from the world.  instead, we yield to what no eye has seen or ear has heard—the blessings of a saved life; the wondrous plans and purposes for our lives, as sifted gold through the fingers of god.   but god’s truth always sets free!         posted via email  from stanice anderson's wow zone

things that make you say, "wow!"





    as people are visiting my fb page, where i’ve posted my story as first told on the 700 club 25 years ago, a lot of responses include or a singular “wow.”  it seems that the video is just as anointed—as powerful, as the day they filmed it.  as the evening i lived my crossover from death to eternal life.  my leap out of darkness into the marvelous light.  folks are posting comments which show me that god is still meeting its viewers within the frames—within the words.  i’m humbled and at his feet—gratefully and joyfully so!    it seems that i was born again with wow written into my new dna. one wow experience after another since being clean and free.  how he did it, opportunities he's brought my way, peoples he's chosen to walk along beside me at all the stages of my life.  all wow.  and the titles and concepts that have emerged through the pain and woven into my healing.  all wow.  walking on water when the ground ain't enuf (started off with just the title).      then a year or so later; my son suggested i put together a performance and showcase the talents god gave me.  we picked a date.  he found a venue.  then he asked, “what do you want to call it?”  without hesitation, i announced with the surety of a  dreamworks™ green-lighted project, walking on water when the ground ain't enuf:  a one-woman experience.  my son and i premièred the show january 2007 to a standing room only crowd of 250 at cada vez on historic u street nw, washington, dc.    from there, it went on the road to hartford, ct; fayetteville, nc; chicago, il, back to dc, then prince george’s county, and pieces of the show go wherever i’m asked to speak or perform.  spokentry/poetry here.  monologues there.  a song or two thrown in.  stand-up comedy sandwiched in understanding that laughter heals too.  in the process, the wow zone™ was born.   and a tagline, laid into my mind like a soft feather pillow: where walking on water is a way of life.    and now the new book, walking on water when the ground ain't enuf, book 1 in the wow zone™ series...for water-walkers and water-walker wannabes.  and last sunday, july 25th, my son & i, produced another event that allowed me to set my light on a bushel—showcase the gifts & talents god gave me.  nobody but god could orchestrate such things.  even the hard and painful things built in between are not wasted.  these are, i   believe, what makes the light shine brighter and farther.   yes, only god can design such beautiful and marvelous things.  things that make you say, “wow!”  “i know where my help comes from.  my help comes from the lord; the maker of heaven and earth!” (from psalm 121)      see and download the full gallery on posterous   walkin' on water when the ground ain't enuf by stanice anderson  download now or listen on posterous 02_walkin_on_water.mp3 (8683 kb)    posted via email  from stanice anderson's wow zone

hbo documentary: every f___ing day of my life





 on my facebook page, we’ve had some stimulating conversation as a result of my following posting.   “i just watched hbo documentary, "every f__ing day of my life, a harrowing look at the final days of freedom for a young mother who killed her abusive husband w/help from her son. national domestic violence hotline 800-799-safe”  come and join in.  your point of view is valued.  you never know who you’ll be helped, inspired or encouraged by your words.  it may even be you j!  here’s the convo so far:  o     michelle williams turnipseed sorry i missed it  o    yesterday at 3:59am ·  o     stanice anderson it's available 24/7 ondemand hbo documentaries   yesterday at 9:32am ·  o      michelle williams turnipseed thanks stanice   yesterday at 10:00am ·  o     john austin if i may weigh in-you know thou shall not kill. she wanted to justify killing her husband because he was abusive. truth be told they took an oath before god and vowed for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for better or worse till death do us part. it was just as terrible when cain slew abel. when you slay anyone you are in affect slaying god because man was made in the image of god.   yesterday at 11:37am ·   fredricka tammy carter  hey yall!ok, i will be sure to check the docu. @ john i hear ya, but it also says he who findeth a wife...obviously he didn't think much of any scripture. let's not bring the word in this-we all know. if you're getting your butt whooped eve...ryday by your husb,someone that's suppose to protect you & love you in the best wayyou tell me what's a girl to do-she prob didn't see no way out. (c'mon your mom, your sister, your auntie) so many folks turn their back and have a deaf ear to domestic violence. thank god there is help to assist the ones that's tired of suffering under the control of a hand.1-800-799-safe--- men are also victims of dv also- you know...see more  yesterday at 12:30pm  ·   john austin yes but the root of the problem is had she done her homework and investigated him before getting involved she would had saved herself some whoopings. which takes us back to square one the wages of sin is death. if you are going to insist on being hardheaded then you must pay. there is no getting around it.  o    yesterday at 12:51pm  ·   stanice anderson well this has certainly been stimulating convo and for more go to @john austin's page. being a woman who haas survived one abusive relationships too many - i will say this, women + men if u find yourself being emotionally, physically, verbally, spiritually or any other type of abuse - get out. you don't deserve to be treated with anything other than tlc. ask for help, save yourself and definitely save your children before it gets to deadly stages. that's what i took away from the documentary.  yesterday at 1:41pm  ·  john austin and i still say that the wise thing to do is to look before you leap.  21 hours ago     geneva jean moon john, i appreciate your concern that women look before they leap, but some women have dated men for years and never saw any abuse until after marriage. if you friends, family and church approve, and you do not know the signs or do not see the signs, how is the woman to blame?  16 hours ago ·     geneva jean moon and john, i am not advocating killing anyone either. i'm merely responding to the topic of blaming the woman for making the wrong choice. since ministers are some of the worst abusers (statics prove this at battered women shelters), then for certain, it is not always seen before marriage.  16 hours ago ·    stanice anderson   yes, geneva, i'm with you on every point. i went to my pastor with the perpetrator (my 2nd husband) and when i told him what was happening, all he did was tap his hearing aid and said "you two have to work it out."  to this day, i think hi...s batteries were dead. he couldn't have heard what i said. but then too, sometimes you see the signs--you look but you think you're not seeing right. or you want to be loved so badly and this is some kind of faulty love but it's love none the less. or you've been so bruised even before you get to adult hood by those that claim to love you; you think this is what love looks like. at least all the love that you deserve. and so the convo continues on my page. lord, have your way, you are the potter; i am but clay.  posted via email  from stanice anderson's wow zone
