  about us

  a historic inn on the bay


 harbor knoll was once a historic greenport home before being lovingly transformed into a seaside bed & breakfast. built in 1870 in the dutch colonial style, this mansion served as a summer retreat for a georgian family, later housing notable figures including a greenport mayor and general custer's niece. acquired by gordon and leueen miller in 1973, the home served as their summer residence for nearly three decades before opening it up as a small inn. the building showcases traditional décor influenced by the millers' british and irish roots, leueen's international travels, and gordon's passion for history. today, leueen delights in welcoming guests, sharing stories, and ensuring a memorable stay.

"our family of 5 thoroughly enjoyed our 3 full days at the inn at harbor knoll. this is a very charming, tastefully decorated house, thoughtfully appointed with beautiful items in every corner and a vast selection of good books lining the many shelves in each room. the location is perfect nestled in a quiet spot walking distance to town, while maintaining it’s private oasis. the gardens and grounds are gorgeous right by the sound. chirping birds and serene views of boats and ferries to and from shelter island add to the wonderful ambiance to enjoy from the heated pool and a variety of hammocks, comfortable chairs and chaise lounges inside and out. leueen is a lovely hostess, interesting person and pleasure to chat with. this place is not to be skipped!"- gabrielle t.

"leueen’s incredibly relaxing and impeccably designed b&b checks every box for what one would want in a coastal escape in long island’s wine country. quietly tucked away, yet still within walking distance to town, all you can hear are the sound of waves. plant yourself on a lounge chair and watch the boats, doze off on the hammock, or lie down at the end of the long dock and watch the night sky. it was such an enjoyable experience- i almost forgot i came for the vineyards."- jill s.
