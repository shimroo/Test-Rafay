 turn me loose white man or: appropriating culture: how to listen to american music 1900-1960 book in two volumes with 30 cds of rare music - "unprecedented" in scope. âallen is one of the most important music historians alive, an exceptional thinker who sees the entirety of american musical history with unmatched clarity.  he's unbowed as an intellectual, driven by neither vogues or ideology.   his work taken as a whole is a monumental achievement. there's no one better alive.â â david hajdu, former music critic for the new republiccds or tracks can be streamed or purched individually on bandcamp 
 
 
 
 ducktails, drive-ins and broken hearts  an unsweetened look at '50s music by hank davis "they all tried but few singers and musicians from the 1950s became stars. yet many of them had stories to tell that were far more interesting than the ones you know. hank davis's elegant, conversational prose brings us these people, their music, and the industry that gave them hope, if only fleetingly in some cases. in his hands the decade becomes vividly alive. this book is a must-read for all fans of '50s music." - colin escott, author of hank williams, the biography."hank davis is one of the few guys who really gets it."  - jerry phillips, son of sun records founder sam phillips.
