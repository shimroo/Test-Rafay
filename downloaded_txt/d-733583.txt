use your credit card wisely
credit cards come with legal contracts. hence, it is important that you are aware of their terms and conditions, when you sign up for them.
explore features and learn about t&cs: please read your credit card application carefully to know about your card’s features and associated terms and conditions. the information mentioned in small prints may have big impacts on your fee, charges and usage conditions. while some t&cs are similar on all cards, there are many others that may be particular to the ones you are applying for, so we recommend that you go through all of them.
understand liabilities: if your card has multiple users, know about the liabilities shared by secondary users. also, if you have applied for add-on cards, understand the added responsibilities that come with them such as who will manage the cards, pay bills and debts, etc.
read more

know how to cancel your credit card: knowing how to cancel your card is as important as knowing how to use it. when you decide to close a credit card, make sure all payments have been made and there are no pending dues. avoid closing cards that still have outstanding balance to be cleared or those that make a significant amount of your credit history. cancelling such cards impact your credit score.
learn about cash advances: credit cards give you the freedom of taking cash advances. but avail this service only at the time of emergency because cash advances are levied with charges, which you start paying from the day you have taken the advance. there is no grace period on cash advances from a credit card.
exploring lower rate of interest options for payments: in case of unexpected expenses, it is better to talk to your credit card company and explore different options that you can take advantage of, such as availing low interest credit options. this way you can save on the amount you repay.










tips for secure card usage
credit cards give you a lot of power and if you follow some crucial mantras about their usage, you can harness them well.
ensure the safety of your credit card, pin number, card expiry date, cvv(security code) by all means. also, please do not share your one time password(otp) with anyone. always get your current contact number updated to ensure receipt of transaction alerts. whenever you travel abroad, please stay informed about the benefits you can avail in case of card loss or theft, such card insurance plans & emergency card replacement services.
be vigilant and check your credit card statements/transaction alert sms carefully for any suspicious transaction(s). if you ever notice any unsolicited transaction, immediately report the same.

avail credit cards from institutions that follow national & international standards for secure transactions
do not hand-over your credit card to people, whom you do not know. when you shop, make sure that the card is not out of your sight and you have collected your card at the end of the transaction. also, before signing the charge slip, check the amount printed on it.
keep your credit card, cvv and helpline numbers saved with you separately and in case of card loss or theft, immediately inform your card issuer and get the card blocked.
always log in into your credit card account from a secure computer that is malware free. make a strong password(combination of upper case, numbers & special characters) for the online account of your credit card and do not share your password with anyone.
refrain from responding to correspondences that asks for your credit card number, expiry date, cvv or password/otp details. banks or your card issuer, will never ask for this information from you. whenever you get such mails, calls, sms, etc. bring them to the notice of your card issuer.

credit score
credit score is a 3-digit number, which represents your credit history based on your credit behavior. the credit score ranges between 300 - 900. high score implies a good credit history. a score below 600 is poor, whereas ideally score greater than 750 is the best.
as per rbi guidelines, sbi card regularly submits credit information of all cardholders to respective bureaus on a regular basis. some major bureaus include:

cibil transunion
experian
crif highmark
equifax

importance of credit score
when you apply for a loan or credit card, the lending/issuing company checks your credit score first to determine if you are eligible to avail the loan or get a credit card.
higher is the score better are your application approval chance. low score places you in a risk zone and makes it difficult to secure an approval.
some of the factors affecting your credit score

irregular payments of your dues: ensure timely payments of your monthly credit card dues to maintain good credit history and high score.
over- utilization of your credit limit: usage of credit card balance above credit limit affect credit score negatively.
partial payments: making partial payments of your monthly credit dues/outstanding bills.
