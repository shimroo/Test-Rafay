solar ovens-understanding energy transfer
this lesson, presented by the national nanotechnology infrastructure network, covers the concept of solar ovens. in this lesson, students will learn how "thermal energy flows from the hot air to the cold water via conduction and will indicate that this would continue to happen until the water sample reaches the same temperature as the oven air. the students will also answer questions about how heat could be lost in the oven through conduction and convection, as well as how to get more solar radiation into the oven." additionally, this experiment will prompt students to examine the relationships between conduction, convection, and radiation. teacher and student guides for parts one and two are included.

conservation biology for all
though the complete society for conservation biology site was previously featured (check out the 09-17-2004 scout report), this free textbook resource supported by the site is worth highlighting independently. perfect for undergraduate and graduate level courses, conservation biology for all curates commentary from leading conservation thinkers, bringing together expert scholarship on a range of relevant topics. the more than 300 pages and 16 chapters explore topics such as the history and future of conservation science (chapter 1), invasive species management (chapter 7), and humans' role in sustainability (chapter 14).  a nice feature of the textbook is the suggested reading and relevant websites sub-sections that conclude each chapter. these suggestions can help professors pull together syllabuses or assist readers interested in digging deeper into a topic. at the link above, readers can download the entire textbook or pick and choose chapters of interest. conservation biology for all was published in 2010 and edited by navjot s. sodhi and paul r. ehrlich.
