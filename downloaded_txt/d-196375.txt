this site is permanently under reconstruction

machinehead software is a bristol based company with


 registered users

 from anglesea to zuidland and an annual turnover considerably under
£10million per year. cycling software is a speciality. the
bicycle software was written mainly because the boss
is a cyclist and a harmless loony. the
bicycle software has been such an unprecedented success over the last few years that "we" now have an entire team of software developers working day and night on the new music software and web developers tools! some of my programs can be downloaded for free at this web site subject to the inevitable disclaimer.
