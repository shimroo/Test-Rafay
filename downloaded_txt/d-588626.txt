land acknowledgementthe rick hansen foundation (rhf) respectfully acknowledges that our work spans traditional and unceded territories covering many regions. we wish to recognize that the rhf head office in richmond bc, canada is situated on the ancestral lands of the musqueam people and that our satellite office in toronto on, canada is situated on the ancestral land of the huron-wendat, the seneca, and the mississaugas of the credit. rhf pays tribute to the legacy of all indigenous peoples past and present as we strengthen ties with the communities we serve and strive towards a world where all have equal opportunity to participate.
