capt. douglas fifield filmed and edited this amazing aerial video of the blackburn challenge 2018, run annually by the cape ann rowing club. the video features gloucester gig rowers' blue swans women's crew, along with many other gigs and sliding seat boats. it captures the expanse and breathtaking beauty of the 20+ mile course around cape ann, massachusetts, and is a great tribute the hundreds of rowers and paddlers who participate.
