updates





i have been working overtime trying to finish updating horrotica in time for the release of issue two.  it's been a quite crazed process at times.  the old cms i was using for the site was filled with bugs, so i completely switched cms' and feel like the outcome will be much better.  i added horrotica banner exchange, so sign up and let's move some traffic!i am working on a volume of my poetry for print.  this has been draining at times.  i find that i am most creative when i am either livid or in the depths of depression, which i hate!  but at least something beautifully creative comes out of it!i will keep updates as to the progress of the volume, which at this time is unnamed.i am also working with a couple of people on doing an anthology of poetry and of erotic horror.  i'm excited about both projects and look forward to getting things underway!until next time...eternally,brynja

while still but a child,and left to her imagination,sophia, the youngest countess,found herself in a grave situation.from the corner of her eye,she sees them come to admireher rosy cheeks and growing bossum,their eyes aglow with lustful fire.her father, the king, did notice their gazeand at once sent them to the blade,then whisked in a faire english tutorto make sure young sophie made the grade.her tutor, isadora, a beautiful belle,was serious and stern,and not afraid to slap her wrists,assuring her it was to help her learn.isadora's technique, much pleased the king,as sohpia's studies quickly progressed.isadora was thrilled by her pupils skillsshe pulled her aside and quickly confessed.her offer was extended unto the countess,still a virgin and pure as silkshe accepted her tutors assignmentas isadora moved in for the kill.how divine in her nakedness,isadora had to catch her breath,mesmerized by her beauty,and the firmess of her breasts.a tease of the serpents tongue,the virgins first kiss,between her thighs a lessonwhich taught her bliss.isadora, skillful with her devices,taught faire sophie to please.then their secret sealed with a lovers kiss,isadora brought the countess to her knees.so it ends isadora's master planwith her prized pupil learning still.the king, greatful and pleased,offered her riches beyond her fill.

news & updates





new and exciting things are happening for me lately! i finished up the new, revised version of nocturnal verses the website. of course, there will always be new additions and changes made, but at least it's done! now all i have to do is put it up on the server. it should be ready to rock tomarrow!i've decided to keep this blogger space as my official blog. i've always liked the way it was laid out and it gives me more resources to put myself out there. so, as soon as the website is up, all the poetry will come down and this will be the place you'll come to find out about what's new and exciting in my world!i have a lot of new projects this year. aside from writing more poetry, taking more photographs, and getting myself into the usual "trouble", i plan on putting together a print/online magazine. i'm hoping to work with a couple different writers on getting this done. stay tuned!i'm also working on putting together a new adult service offering websites for those who are interested in becomming "porn pushers" lol. if you're interested, let me know!in darkness,brynja asdis

cold winds cut into my fleshtearing through muscle and bonemy body lies in quiet stillnesswhile my mind swims on through the stone.i know they come with their fallen tearswith flowers that fade into grayish rotwhispering words of meaningless prayerstheir passions contained yet burning hot.forgiveness, i cannot grantbut for the mighty sacrificenothing less sacred for my murdereryet his soul shall suffice.

the gods bright lightbeams down upon her,while angels gatherto see what makes them stir.she adorns hearts,both young and old,the breaker of hope,your soul is sold.with her brilliant eyes,magnificent smile,she needs your loveto make it all worth while.

v





she calls me from sleep,promicing immortality.i am no great fool,i see their reality.yet her bite still stings,burning between my thighs.she will own my soul.there is no compromise.i will not surrender,not even to her persuasive tongue.she seduces me in the night,but she has not yet won.she temps me with sweet promicesbut i know they are lies.she is aware of my strength,yet knows her kisses leave me paralized.i cannot falter,fore my life is at hand,yet where is god,to hear my cries, my demands?she smiles at my insanity,constantly teasing.i submitmy soul releasing.

her too perfect smilehides her deceptive plot.mesmerized,you fall without a thought.her arms open wideyou imagine love's sweet surprise.stench and decay linger,you know she is a lie.her claws grind into your flesh.there is no possible way to depart.she swallows your lifeforce.you curse your foolish heart.

comfort,among the dead,laying amidst corpses,zombies ready to be fed.my nakedness is cold,aroused by decay,longing for the eternal love,that will never go away.the frigid hands upon my skin,my eyes closed tight,i spread my legs willingly,fore i will not fight.my flowing juicesseep into the hard ground,they arise from sweet slumbermesmerized by my hearts sound.they accept the gifts i offer,plunging inside my core,spent and bleeding,i revel in the death i adore.

thirst





the light blinds me,leaving me thrirsty for more.an orb of fire attacks me,sears my tender flesh.i cannot hide.it follows me even into the shade,blaring its poisonous heat against my chest.my swolen tongue knows no word.madness follows the light.where is the peace?my sight hovers about the orb,guiding me towards mother moon.

the one





i wait for her,longing to feel her,taste her.she comes to me,the night blazing with stars,none as beautiful as she.my heart pounds from her,looking into her,mesmerized by her fire.she embraces me,sweet lips so tender against mine,with baby soft skin so hot.i take her into me,loving her passionately,surrendering to her wild desire.hungry, her tongue between my lips,my body tingling alive,gripped by raw need of her love.i am blind of the world,seeing only her essence,her power to fulfill me.i give of myself,all of me to her alone,everything; my soul.she is my destiny,seperated only by time,holding the mysteries of me.

the lie





i love to hate you,detesting this loves need.the weight of promicesfilled with bitterness and greed.attempting to find that place,where hope conquers all,i reach out of my darkness,the blinding light so raw.we co-exist in dead dreams,wishing for that final release,where sadness subsidesand finally the entrance of peace.that absurd fantasywhere everything survives the disaster,sunshine prevailsand we aren't fading faster.that's right,let's continue to live this lie,sit back and cut to the bone,a soul has no choice but to die.why don't we just face the truth,whatever that may be,part in hate and hurt,but at least be free.but no, much too easy.we prefer this smothering weight,strangling intensity of pain.no dear, nothings wrong, our life is great!

the end





wicked thoughts invade my headmaking me wish i were long dead.i don't belong in this place,where my soul in such a waste.i long for freedoms opening doorso i can escape the light once more.blindness when i don't want to see,i cover my eyes begging please.i want no more visions,no more of insanities incisions,not another day in this wretched lifetrying to rise above this struggle and strife.i'm the fly captured by the spider,no need to be a fighter,just surrender and be crucified,nothing but bones in which to confide.let it be my end,i pray,no need for another day's delay.

surrender





rushing headlonginto her wreched arms,unaware of her savageness,i am mesmerized by her charms.not the sight of herblood drenched jaw,her razor sharp nails,it is only beauty i saw.ignoring angelic screamsfrom creatures laden in gold,i embrace my dark mother,my soul finally whole.

soul lover





her razor nailsscrape my soft face,showing mer her loves anger,her distaste.she desires my heart,the blood in my veins,to taste my skin,yet she refrains.she refuses angrilyto release my soul.she must have all of meto keep her control.she drains my veinat least once a day,leaving me dead againwithout a moments delay.but my body fadesthough my soul's entrapped,my beauty is lost,my bones are cracked.i am her limp toy,dangling from her tree.her love lost,she has set me free.

sleep





be still my scared heart!not even your pounding can awaken me!sleep...sleep...sleep...alone i wonder.what feeding frenzy awaits me yonder?with my sword, i prevail warrioress,enchanting even my enemies with my magics.who are they to me?there, in my wake, my avengers come,dancing in sweet relief for my safety,tears and blood streaming from my eyes,not even they can resurrect me.

slave





heaviness upon my chest,i must break free.i claw and dig to the surface,hearing my mistress calling me.the night air slashes my faceas i emerge from the cold ground.i see clearly in the darkness,pick up even the softest sound.i see her now,calling me to my fate,chanting through mist and flame,resurrecting my hate.she dances naked,blood dripping onto fire.she opens her arms to me.i embrace her every desire.

sink





into this darkness,i sink,awake to my sickness,alive in my death.this darkness surrounds me,cradles me,protects me surely from my own selfand the realization of my hopelessness.in this darkness, my darkness,i am complete.whole in my mothers womb,basking in the soundlessness of my salvation.the coolness covers me,enveloping my very beingbut my soul prevails,untouched by my dementia.into this caccoon i reside,hidden from the blinding, burning light,covered in my own decay,freedom ringing on my lips.

self sacrifice





dangling by threads of doubt,she wanders helplessly into the pits.not yet ravaged,but aware of her conflicts.all about her,beasts growling and clawing at her feet.desire burning in their wicked eyes.their master she has come to meet.clean and naked she trails,her feet cut and bleeding,demons licking at her heels,dreaming of their feeding.her beloved hades standsbefore her at the strong iron gate.she lies before him,giving herself unto fate.

prayer





this pain eats at me,devouring the essence of my soul.i am blinded by the light,leaving me unwhole.i crave chaos' elegant planto spin my maddening dreams,to deliver me from the embersthat echo my delirious screams.i beg for the blade,though i am already cold.there is no escapingmisery's fierce hold.the fire of the sunwon't pitty and burn,as i fall to my kneespraying for my turn.i claw in the sand,dig in the dirt,calling sweet hadesto come out and flirt.make me your slave,my god, my king,deliver me from sight.i will give you anything.steal me into black night,usher me through death's gate.i am yours to consume.this is my fate.

mistress





she comes to me in the night,eyes blazing with desire.her skin cold as ice,her breath like fire.never do i deny her love,accepting her mangled embrace.my silent surrender bitter,as she steals her first taste.ecstacy exploding within,my soul aches to be released.once again i am denied,yet she is quite pleased.her mouth presses against mine.i devour her sweet kiss.her hunger satisfied,she soars in bliss.again i am alone,trapped in this shell,unable to escape my fatebut alive by her spell.

master slave





enveloping darknessswallows my soulwrapping me in a vile blanketspinning me out of control.drowning in thick ambrosia,sweet in it's bitter taste,my fangs plunge deeperwithout the slightest haste.i am not the demonthat resides inside.i'm the one you embraced.i'm the one who died.my sacrifice is great,my price eternal.walking among the damned,my prison internal.once my master,now my slave,i drain your source,covering your grave.

madness





she came to me on a sudden breezeleaving me drunk with her love's ways.never is she far from my longing thoughts.to see her sweet smile, i count the days.her love's beauty blazes through my heartentangled in my souls deepest desires.this distance between us a pain so deep.my soul ablaze with her passion's fires.how can i tell her i long for her gentle touch?no thrust of my blade can deliver me from this pain.delusions of her eternal, undying lovefuel wicked delights, driving me insane.my madness cycles into the depths of hell,unaware of my drowning dispair.she has given herself unto another.cursed hatred, how could she dare?does she not hear the song of my heart?frightened by my soul's constant tear,i retreat farther into my welcome chaosto bathe in sorrow, realizing my worst fear.i stand alone in the crowded escape.she draws up a smile to meet my empty eyes.she loves me as her soul is joined with mine.she walks away in love's fury as my dream slowly dies.

lurking





lurking beneath a lightning nightwhere charasmatic demons play,i await my life's truth enslaved,where the wicked dirt smothers and decays.never to me does she show her face,hidden by years of mistake.i am mesmerized by her love,craving her nightly intake.falling slowly into a gently sleep,she arises to fill me with her mist.enchanted by her deception,surrendering, i offer my wrist.the insanity of this pleasure,erotic in its pain,i fall into her heartbeat,no desire to refrain.

loves secret





in the darkness,i am unseen.my purpose known,my senses keen.among the stonethat marks the dead,i quietly creeptoward my lover's bed.i whisper her name,unlocking her shrine,the full moon lightrevealing what is mine.the stone cold flooragainst my bare feetdoes not deterthis lovers meet.and there she restson her bed of stone,unmoving in the silencebut never alone.i gaze upon her beauty,her body still fresh.i breathe deeplyabsorbing the fragrance of death.her eyes unseeing,her skin beginning to dry,she welcomes my love.beside her i lie.

ice





ice falls against her face,cutting into her pale white skin.the rain and snow can't numb her.her story ends, but where does it begin?a lonely child angelfallen from hells grace,abandoned amonst the razors,searching for a soul misplaced.damnable demons scatteredin tattered ruin and tears,cannot imagine a tormentworse than their own fears.she is fresh meatwith her daggar claws poised,her strength immeasurable,her eyes amazed.this is her eternity,her humble abode.bearing crosses of hate,the memories inside her explode.her crimes before her,visions of gore and pain,bring her to this end,dying to be insane.

hidden beneath the scarred moundwhere dust and ash have merged with ground,my lovers bones await me still.no living thing survives the stormthat maddens and corrupts any formbut that of masters will.i stand, awaiting, in anger and painas unseen forces deem me insane,yet not a solid touch do i feel.piercing my soul, his hypnotic voice,driving me to the daggars pointuntil at last my fate is sealed.

dying





deliverance awaits patientlyas shadow engages in truth.ecstacy overwhelms your very coredevouring the fear of the unknown.pain washes away thoughts of power,leaving you floating in a pool of pleasure.sharpness drains your soulas you drift unaware to the surface.acid washed and pale of face,indicators of great death,protrude like daggars from the remaining shellbound by blood and bone.
