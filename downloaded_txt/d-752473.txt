quotereference





















"there  have been many commentaries disparaging ehrs. they do not describe my  experience as a primary care internist. to me, springcharts has been an  absolute boon. in the exam room i write down the details of the hpi of  the 20 minute visit in great detail and note any specific physical  findings and pertinent vitals. the fact that i can send in prescriptions  for controlled and non-controlled meds electronically and quickly via  my phone and computer, including away from home, makes my life a lot  easier.”- richard ganz, md






















we’ve been using the springcharts emr system since early 2010. its functionality perfectly suits the needs of our practice as well as the broader requirements for meeting criteria of the merit-based incentive payment system (mips). springcharts is user-friendly and its logical design and simplicity make it easy to train new users.- reggie hopkins, southeast rehabilitation associates






















i’ve been using spring medical system for 13 years now. it’s very user friendly and easy to understand and learn the system. it also has functionality added which i found it quite useful in documentation of communication with the office staff and with patients. it has easy connection with the practice management system for scheduling and billing. the support team is courteous, friendly and helpful. i recommend the spring medical system to everyone who is looking for easy to use and effective emr system.- jasmine leong, md
