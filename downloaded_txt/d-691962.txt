the featbase is the 
							culmination of many years of research conducted by 
							chris cafiero. the database provided here will 
							hopefully contain an accurate listing of all little 
							feat and feat related shows with setlists. the 
							featbase needs your help. if you have an accurate 
							setlist for any show here, or missing show please 
							submit it for inclusion to the featbase.



							 



a big featbase thanks to 
							our friends from around the world who submit shows, 
							check historical facts and find all of our typos: 
							thomas engelmann, mr. random (ken langford), wes 
							meyette, greg dieste, holger siebert, g.t. 
							keplinger, paul barrere, tom potter, john vanderpool 
							and many many more, too many to mention here.
