note from publisher: yes, we'll be back! thanks to all who have written asking about the future. stay tuned! we're working on equidaily 2.0. perhaps more evolutionary than revolutionary but something that will keep the best of what we've always done -- while adding some new features.
in the meantime we didn't want to leave anyone hanging while looking for pertinent news and info during bc weekend. so we're back at it in our traditional form to bring you the best of horse racing news during this time period...
