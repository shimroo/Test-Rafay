offshore with cowboy charters from striper on vimeo.

we leave the dock before the others and return after they have sent their customers home. our full day offshore trips are at a plus fuel rate, and we earn our money. our crew is conscious of the fuel burn, and will work hard to put you on the fish of your choice.
with our offshore trips, you will not sit on anchor or spend your day tied to an oil rig within sight of the beach. we do not shortcut your opportunity to up our profit margin, and we do not employ young captains with minimal experience.
please feel free to call fishing captain michael jennings at 979.864.9439, or, capatin mike hutto at 713-899-6578 they would be happy to explain the advantages of our fishing trips, and give you a working knowledge of how fishing charter companies operate, so that you can better gauge how the bargain or cheep flat rate trips are only to the advantage of the fishing charter company.
we provide all fishing rods, reels, tackle, ice, and dead bait needed for your chartered fishing trip, but you are more than welcome to bring your favorite set up if you prefer.
