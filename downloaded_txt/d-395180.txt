few people knew john lennon as intimately as may pang.  pang was lennon’s lover during the infamous “lost weekend” which lasted 18 months during late 1973 through 1975.  during this highly creative time for lennon, pang took candid photos of lennon in a comfortable, relaxed environment.

may comments, “on december 29, 1974 the documents to dissolve the beatles were brought to john in florida by one of apple’s lawyers.  after pausing, john finally picked up his pen and, in the unlikely backdrop of disney world, at the polynesian village hotel, officially ended the greatest rock’n’roll band in history by simply scrawling john lennon at the bottom of the page.”  this is the only photo that exists of this historic occasion and is available as a print for the first time.  giclee on canvas, unstretched, size 2’ x 3’ with a limited edition of 99 total prints.  also available is a special hand-embellished diamond dust canvas within this edition (call for info).  hand signed and titled by may pang.  mpg022












 

the lost weekend50th anniversary jamlive at the troubadourthursday, april 13th, 2023!surprise walk on with may pang during "#9 dream" live at the lost weekend 50th anniversary jam @ the troubadour, april 13, 2023. nobody in the band, not even may, knew this was going to happen. the stunned looks (and laughter) on everyone's face is priceless as may reprised her role from the original recording where she whispers "john"...... the first time she's done so since that original recording. from note one, hair up....spectacular moment. "magic in the air". - jeri palumboa very special thank you to dear jeri palumbo. what a night!

 

a very special thank you to the @concertconnection for capturing this incredible evening of music and celebration. (below)
