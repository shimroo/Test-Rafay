thank you.
book an appointmentappointmentseventswhat we dowsava guidelinesin 2010 the world small animal veterinary association published the ‘guidelines for the vaccination of dogs and cats’. the document promotes titre testing and states that the core vaccines last ‘for three years, if not longer’, which allows vets to legitimately reduce the number of vaccines given to cats and dogs, something that homeopathic vets have been calling for for decades.
