lehigh valley wineries
raise a glass.
the successful growing climate for grapes earned lehigh valley the label “american viticultural area," catapulting the region’s wines and vineyards into the (wine) light. an ava is a federally designated wine grape-growing region in the united states, providing an official appellation for the wine produced in a region. think: napa valley or willamette valley, those are avas and lehigh valley is one of them! established in 2008, the area covers over 230 planted acres and includes over 30 wineries.
in lehigh valley, you'll taste our signature varietals such as chambourcin, riesling, chardonnay, vidal blanc, and cayuga white, grapes which grow exceedingly well in the region's climate and its terroir. enjoy these varietals, incredibly drinkable red blends, and even some unique rule-breakers like cotton candy-infused white wine and sweet and bubbly peach mist. 
you can’t hit all 30 lehigh valley wineries in one weekend, but this weekend wine tasting sampling will get you on your way to discovering the wines of lehigh valley. start at breinigsville’s clover hill vineyards, one of the lehigh valley’s founding wineries. dry wine lovers can enjoy the pinot noir. next on your breinigsville visit is vynecrest vineyards, another founding winery. discover the traminette grape there – a gewürztraminer-like dry white wine with a bit of spice. 
weathered vineyards takes its cue from bordeaux, france, and is next on the itinerary with a cabernet sauvignon; bring your own picnic basket to enjoy a late afternoon snack.  no trip to lehigh valley wineries would be complete without a visit to galen glen winery in andreas for their grüner veltliner, known nationwide as some of the state’s best wines. 
there's plenty more so you'll want to scroll and use the map to build your weekend wine-tasting trip to lehigh valley.
