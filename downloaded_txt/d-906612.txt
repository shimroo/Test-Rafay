the discovery that quantum physics allows fundamentally new modes of information processing has required the existing theories of computation, information and cryptography to be superseded by their quantum generalisations. furthermore, the theory of entanglement has provided a new language for tackling the quantum many-body problem. the centre for quantum information and foundations, part of the university of cambridge, and based within the department for applied maths and theoretical physics, conducts theoretical research into all aspects of quantum information processing, the implications of quantum computing and quantum information theory for physics, and broader foundational questions in quantum physics.
