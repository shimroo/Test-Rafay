please read the following statement of faith:

Ã—



we believe:

that the 66 books of the bible, in their entirety, are the only inspired, infallible, supreme, and final word of god and authority in faith and life. (catholics welcome at hannah's prayer ministries.  we recognize that the roman catholic church includes the apocrypha in its canon.  we ask that in matters of discussion and encouragement within hannah's prayer, all uses of holy scripture be confined to the 66 books held in common.) ~ 2 timothy 3:16-17; 2 peter 1:20-21
that there is only one god, eternally existing in three persons: father, son, and holy spirit. ~ deuteronomy 6:4; 2 corinthians 13:14; john 1:1-2
in the deity of jesus christ, who is both totally god and totally man. ~ 1 john 1:1-3
that jesus was conceived of the holy spirit, born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, and willingly offered his own life as payment for our sins by death on the cross. ~ matthew 1:18-25; john 1:14; romans 8:3-4; 1 peter 2:24
that jesus bodily arose from and conquered death, and ascended into heaven, where he now mediates for us as high priest at the right hand of the father. ~ luke 24:6-7; 1 corinthians 15:55-57; acts 1:9-11; hebrews 4:15-16; hebrews 7:24-28
that jesus will physically return to earth in power and glory some day. ~ titus 2:13
in the bodily resurrection of the saved to eternal life and blessing, and in the resurrection of the lost to everlasting, conscious torment and punishment. ~ 1 thessalonians 4:16-17; john 14:1-4; revelation 22:1-5; matthew 13:40-43; revelation 20:15
that all have sinned and earned eternal death, but by the grace of god, all who place their personal faith in jesus christ have eternal life. ~ romans 3:22-26; romans 6:23; john 3:16; ephesians 2:8-9; john 10:27-29
that the holy spirit indwells, instructs, empowers, encourages, convicts, and guides all who have believed on the name of the lord jesus christ for salvation. ~ john 3:3-8; acts 1:8; john 14:16-21, 26; 1 corinthians 2:12; romans 8:14
