								days.  please look forward to future orders as

								customers.
								happy holidays!    -michael.

								you for the most wonderful online shopping 
								experience i've ever had (and the only online 
								shopping i will do this holiday season).       -emily
hi ryan,

								just wanted to let you know how terrific all the 
								hats were for christmas - everyone loved them, 
								and my daughter wore her hat all day!  the skirt 
								is fabulous, with great fitting.  you are a true 
								craftsman, ryan!  the package arrived almost 
								immediately after i spoke with you, so you have 
								definitely trained those mice to work 
								efficiently.  bravo!    -phyllis

								thank you for 
								making such wonderful hats.  now everyone in the 
								family has one and i'm sending the last two to 
								friends.  by the way, it was very nice of you to 
								ship out the other hats so fast.  they came the 
								very next day, in time for my twin boys birthday 
								and their god father's birthday too.  it was 
								great!  ~anna










        hi ryan,
first i must tell you how much i have enjoyed my fleece 
skirts from mouse works.....i have had sooooo many 
compliments on the style but the feel is what has really 
won me over.  so, now it's a week before christmas and 
i would like to buy a fleece skirt for my mother.  
kind regards,
b.b.
 









									hello,

									i just wanted to leave you some feedback.  i 
									bought a gnome hat from you and i gotta say 
									that it is fantastic.  i live in alaska and 
									have gone out in our -40 degree weather with 
									full gear on (including your gnome hat and 
									carhart's warmest coat) and my head is the 
									only thing that has stayed warm.  thanks!

									-wilbur 

 


									ryan,

									we just received our order. your hats are 
									amazing!!!!!!  it also surprised me that 
									they were sent out on christmas eve and are 
									in my hands two and a half days later!! the 
									quality is outstanding....you are a true 
									craftsman. you have a customer for life.       
									thank you      
									-chris 
 

									my daughter keeps stealing my mw skirts (she 
									wears them over her pants on cold mornings 
									to go to school and packs them in her pack 
									when she gets there, and she also just 
									flat-out steals... i mean, borrows them for 
									everyday wear too) and so i ordered her one 
									for her birthday.   -shay



										thanks so much ryan !  we just love your 
										hats :).  unfortunately, we lost my sons 
										last hat from the mouse works the day 
										before he left to go to germany for a 
										visit .... he was not happy so we had to 
										order another- this time i will put a 
										tag in his hat.... if found please call 
										:)
										thanks again for the prompt service!  

										delilah
