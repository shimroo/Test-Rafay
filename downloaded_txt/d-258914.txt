“i believe my time at wfs prepared me for success at cwru both academically and athletically. academically, the high rigor of wfs courses like ap physics gave me a great foundation coming into cwru. however, i think the most effective tool i learned from wfs was building relationships with teachers. building relationships with teachers at cwru has helped me monumentally with assignments and exams.”

“my experience at wilmington friends school set me up for success by providing challenging coursework that required critical thinking. learning how i learned and figuring out a process that worked for me was one of the most important things because regardless of what you want to major in or what sport you want to play at a higher level, you will need to learn the information and how to apply it when it is necessary. friends helped me facilitate my learning process, and i’ve continued to adapt and improve it based on the situation.”

“i always mention wilmington friends as having an incredible influence in my life as preparation not only for college but well beyond. acceptance and curiosity in understanding sound simple enough, but as i get older, i realize the world would benefit greatly if more people were taught those lessons at a young age.”
