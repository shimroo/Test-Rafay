what we do





the experience of lining up at the theater when your favorite movie opens, getting your ticket, grabbing popcorn, and picking out a seat can be a memorable moment in a child‚Äôs life.




but what about the children who are battling life-threatening illnesses in hospitals nationwide who can‚Äôt get to the theater? the kids who don‚Äôt get to enjoy that experience at the same time as everyone else?
that‚Äôs where lollipop comes in.
lollipop delivers the season‚Äôs biggest blockbusters while they are still in the theater right to those children and their families at the hospital, working with leading motion picture studios to bring the joy, magic, and momentary escape of the movies to those who need it most.
