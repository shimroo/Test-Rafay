queen b is baaaack
submitted by mabeldog on mon, 03/18/2024 - 14:29.


instead of continuing with her fabulous "consulting" business (how is that whole shaker square upgrade thing going by the way) and spending the winter months on the cote d'azur with her retired husband mr. b, the queen has decided to take on a new challenge. not that she needs the job mind you as told her best friend. she's rolling in money.

free speech
submitted by mabeldog on sun, 08/20/2023 - 17:14.

real neo is the ultimate in freedom of speech for i don't know how many years. i can say whatever i feel is true and i'm not censored. as twitter or x had its moment in the 1st amendment the new ceo is back to the old rules of shutting down dissent of the approved narrative. who ever started this and whoever runs it now i say thank you!

what really happened to jerry maddox
submitted by mabeldog on wed, 08/16/2023 - 17:30.


jerry died mysteriously on december 26,2019. it took until feb. 21, 2020, almost two months for an obituary free of any pertinent information about the cause of his passing to be carefully crafted for placement in the obit section of cleveland.com. he "went to be with the lord". that's all she wrote.

on a desolate corner of east 140th right off interstate 90, $23.5 million of your tax dollars have been handed over to vesta's arthur greensplat, a multimillionare resident of west hartford, connecticut, to build a publicly funded housing project. let the festivities begin! but in this vesta project, the rent is not subsidized by uncle sambo.

justine's upcoming "accomplishment". 
submitted by mabeldog on fri, 01/06/2023 - 19:10.


 i was talking to an acquaintance today. a real city worker not a foj with a 6 figure made up job. like bradford davy who has been able to move to a big shiny $335,000 house at 6106 bridge his very first home as an owner because of his new job and special relationship with justine. no starter home for bradford d, although his mortgage is $323, 495, barely a 3% down payment. but that's cool because he's really special and fairway mortgage, whatever that is, totally understands that. the city workers do not have a contract and justine is not bargaining in good faith.

"mayor" zero celebrates
submitted by mabeldog on sun, 01/01/2023 - 16:00.


 another year of "progress" with, of course, no specific details from justin and company. when he first got into office with a whopping 30,000 votes which his massive public relations "team" in newly created jobs that did not exist in the jackson administration with 6 figure salaries in america's poorest and most dangerous city called a landslide. a landslide of those who voted because 70% of eligible voters stayed home.
