the importance of regular dermatology check-in‚Äôs

queenslanders enjoy one of the most enviable lifestyles, with many of us spending countless hours in the sun for either work or play. it‚Äôs vitally important that we have regular skin checks to address changes to our skin, helping to avoid future complications.
the dermatologists who consult from the skin centre welcome patients with referrals from other medical practitioners, as well as those without a referral. the dermatologists we support have extended hours to ensure they can offer a variety of appointment options for their patients.

expert practitioners in wrinkles & fine lines
repetitive movement or contraction of the muscles causes the skin to wrinkle. at first the effect is temporary but as our skin losses elasticity and collagen production slows down, these deeper lines and creases can become etched on our face. other than ageing ‚Äì chronic sun exposure, smoking and other lifestyle factors can accelerate the development of fine lines and wrinkles.
