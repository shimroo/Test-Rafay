the brief ovation story
aerospace technology meets traditional guitar making



electric acoustic revolution




charlie kaman, a visionary aeronautical engineer and founder of kaman aircraft corporation, was not only relentless innovator but also a skilled guitarist. he was intrigued by the fact that guitar designs had remained largely unchanged for four centuries and decided to leverage the expertise of his aircraft engineers and scientists to completely rethink guitar building, elevating the design, sound and construction to new heights.


the full story 









innovation




after 18 months of testing and research, the kaman engineers found that the most efficient shape for a guitar back was semi-parabolic (like that of an orchestra shell, amphitheater, radar reflector or even the human ear). the sound such a shape produced was measurably richer, fuller and deeper. but they didn’t stop there: wood as the back material had limitations such as being difficult to contour, reflecting less sound and being fragile. they researched and tested many new materials based on their aerospace components. finally they found the perfect material that actually could be “tuned” (chemically and by heat treating) to a precise degree of resonance. we call it lyrachord.


the full story 









don’t call it plastic 




lyrachord is a high tech fiberglass composite material that can be precision-molded to any shape and thickness and yet remain practically indestructible. it can’t warp, chip, check or split. and lyrachord is still the material we use today, to create these truly remarkable instruments. listen for yourself. hear the rounder, fuller, totally unique sound of the ovation roundback. let your own ear confirm the difference that aerospace technology has created. we think you’ll agree, you’ve never heard it so good.
