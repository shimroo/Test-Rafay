what makes us different 



we are in the business of helping set up other people’s businesses because we realized there was a gap. here’s how we fill it: 




thinking one step aheadit's common for people to buy displays...then later realize they're missing parts. displays can be confusing since they are often not bought every day. we know which parts go together to build something, we know which accessories will likely be needed later, and we want to help you save time (searching the internet or not being able to get set up) and save money (by consolidating parts in fewer shipments). 



updating you constantlythere are a lot of small display suppliers throughout the country. if you are ordering online or by phone, it's common for suppliers to not send tracking information. this leaves people in the dark, making them question when they will receive a delivery. you can expect us to send tracking information to your email for every single order. you deserve to be in the loop and aware of when your order will arrive. 



honesty & positivitythink about a relationship that has no communication...it's probably not great. if we're out of stock on an item - we will tell you. if a shipment is delayed - we will tell you. if there's something you should know - we tell you. we prefer to overcommunicate, rather than not communicate enough. it's very important for us to be transparent from our first conversation through every delivery to your store. 




the 6 core values you'll see when we work together 



if you appreciate these values, you’ll appreciate the way we do business. these core values are what make us who we are. 



1. we follow thru on commitments: if we commit to having displays at your store by a certain day, we are committed to do everything in our power to make it happen. 2. we are honest and transparent: if there is a specific lead time for a display, we will communicate this to you rather than leave it as a surprise. it may not be ideal, but it is the reality. 3. we challenge the norm: if someone says something isn’t possible, we ask “why not?” our goal is to find solutions, not make more excuses. 4. we dig deeper: if you tell us you’re looking for slatwall panels (as an example), then we will ask how you are going to use them. we want to understand if you will need accessories for a certain type of business, installation hardware, installation videos, etc to make the process of setting up as streamlined as possible. 5. we do stuff the right way even if it’s harder than the easy way: the easy way is not always the right way…our goal is to do business the way we’d want one of our vendors to work with us.
