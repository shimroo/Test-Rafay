what parents think of qcms










"the qcms has excellent, dedicated teachers and support staff. it is small, diverse and very friendly. the school hopes that parents - who jointly own and run the school - will participate fully. i used it as a preschool alternative to day care and have been so happy with my child's progress that i am stronly considering continuing there for kindergarten and grades 1-6. if you are looking for an educational alternative to day care or an excellent elementary school i recommend the qcms."
-pete f.






"we have been thrilled with this school. we have moved across the country several times and thus my children have attended 4 different private school and this one is the tops. the teachers are outstanding and really teach to the individual child. instead of forcing the children to fit in a box, they let them grow and learn in their own way. it has been wonderful watching my children excel and thrive."
-anonymous (parent)






my daughter loves this school. her teacher cares so much about her & all of the students in the class. i have no doubt that this school will bring out the best in my daughter. the school felt like extended family within a few months. now my daughter is addicted to books & last year they even did crossfit for kids. we are so lucky to have qcms in the qca."

"this school is amazing. our children have grown a tremendous amount in just a short period of time since beginning to attend. each of our children have very different needs, yet the staff has met all of them accordingly, allowing our children to surpass our previous expectations for them. our children are developing into confident, inquisitive learners."
