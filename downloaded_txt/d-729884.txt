world premiere:
the new siematic sg6

the world premiere for fresh creativity.
the siematic style collection urban has the flexibility of a modular, asymmetric conceptualisation and a mixture of open and closed areas, permitting an exceptional degree of design freedom. complemented by the innovative, elegantly rounded elements of the new siematic sg6, this freedom is almost without limits.
a striking feature of the siematic sg6 is its harmonious curves, a design language taken directly from nature. fine, straight recess channels provide an attractive contrast. open cabinet elements integrate perfectly in the panel wall system, while closed areas replace conventional shelves. 
in this fascinating interplay of novel and familiar elements, the siematic sg6 intersperses from 2025 the urban style collection with delightful new accents and facilitates original, unconventional and solitary designs.
