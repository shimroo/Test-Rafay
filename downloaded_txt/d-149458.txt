i have worked with the herlihy insurance group for over a decade for all my personal and business needs. everyone i work with at herlihy continues to go the extra mile to make sure insurance is one less thing i have to worry about. when i did have a claim, the folks at herlihy walked me thru every step and made the process easy. i consider herlihy a critical part of our team.

in 1959 my father started c.b. blair builders. when he started he was looking for an insurance company and found the herlihy insurance company. that was jim’s father, jay herlihy. since then the herlihy companies have been providing c.b. blair builders with all their insurance needs. over the almost 60 years we’ve been doing business together we have found herlihy’s service to be exemplary. anytime we call they respond quickly and follow thru until the problem or claim is satisfied. we’ve always found them to be competitively priced, whenever we’ve gone out to bid they always are the most competitive. any company would find herlilhy’s to be great business partner, i would recommend them highly.
