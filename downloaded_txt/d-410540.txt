to route 6 walk





 
"travis and i dipped our hands in the frigid atlantic of cape cod and began our trip. travis drops me off each morning and picks me up at day's end. in between, he takes pictures. we're an odd couple, of sorts, a 27-year-old tech-savvy photographer and an old curmudgeon thrown together by a desire to explore."

"even a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step. i took that first step march 26 at herring cove on cape cod, the start of our 3,600-mile trek across the u.s. one step down, 10 million to go. photographer travis lindhorst and i are on a coast-to-coast journey in search of the heartbeat of america as we travel the entire length of route 6, a country road that stretches from provincetown, massachusetts to long beach, califormia."
 
these were among my original entries in my online journal as we began route 6 walk. yes, we completed the journey, and we even wrote the book. the fanfare of the accomplishment was always local. the stories and our experiences were always personal. if you are walking across america to experience america, that seems the proper way to accomplish it. â joe hurley, april 2016
