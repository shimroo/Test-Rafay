mpc is the only vendor i will use when it comes to apparel and promotional items! teresa is the best – she is knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and responds quickly. i love the fact that they are local. that helps tremendously when i need to see samples, want to be more hands-on with an order or when items are needed quickly – which is the nature of our business sometimes. i have such a close, easy working relationship with mpc that they feel like an extension of our department. the fact that their prices are less expensive than the others is just icing on the cake.

since 2013, mpc has been cedar lake’s exclusive logo wear and promotional item supplier. their superior customer service and friendly and knowledgeable staff, coupled with their attention to detail, make them an ideal vendor. we get rave reviews from our staff on the quality and selection of products from mpc.  we are so grateful for this partnership!
