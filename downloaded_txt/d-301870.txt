- largest last supper in cochise county! 11th street & g ave by local artist and craftsman adolpho âwachoâ garcia as a gift to douglas, agua prieta, and the largest last supper museum on earth.
because of the generous donations and grants received, we are now in an expansion phase adding hundreds and hundreds of examples of last supper art history.

âyou can come here for a minute, but you will remember it forever!â.
