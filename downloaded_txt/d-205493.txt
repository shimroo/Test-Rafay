“every single aspect of our gwcs experience has been positive! the administration, staff and teachers are all keenly focused on meeting each student's individual needs. they're true partners with my wife and i in our child's educational and emotional growth. they're sensitive to our daughter's needs and have been responsive to every request. they've also been very creative and extraordinarily flexible. it's clear that they love all of the kids and only have their interests in mind. the gwcs broader community of parents/students is strong and caring, too. our only regret is that our daughter did not attend gwcs earlier. we love this school!”- anonymous parent | greatschools.org













“this school is an amazing blessing to our family. things we love: gwcs is intellectually stimulating and fosters curiosity and a love of learning. gwcs individualizes instruction seamlessly with great flexibility, while maintaining strong college preparatory goals. gwcs is a warm and accepting community for all kids. kids can try everything - sports, music, theater. teachers and students do these things because they love them and it's a key part of being human, not solely so they can win competitions.”- anonymous parent |  niche.com
