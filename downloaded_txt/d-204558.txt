(nyle dimarco/davis guggenheim, 2025) 4½ out of 5 stars if you ever need reassurances about the power of protest, look no further than deaf president now! based on the 1988 protest of the same name, this invigorating documentary tells the story of how students at gallaudet university, the oldest university designed specifically for the deaf and hard of hearing, fought to have the first deaf president in the school’s 124-year  ... >>
