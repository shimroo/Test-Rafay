we raised a good amount of money in a short amount of time. it really worked well, and we were really pleased. the payment options were very helpful for a school the size of ours. our best seller told me: “i really enjoyed selling skratchers. it was so much easier than selling candy bars.”
john early, calvary baptist academy
this is our 4th time doing the skratchers scratch card fundraiser and we’ve raised $10,400 profit so far. the money has helped us cover team travel expenses and pay for new uniforms. we had an easy time with this fundraiser and the customer service at skratchers was great.
