the center for hyperhidrosis at columbia university medical center has been instrumental in modifying the surgical techniques for hyperhidrosis treatment to minimize side effects and improve the results of surgical therapy



 





















"i wanted to update you on the results of ets for facial blushing in hopes that it might help others as well. the surgery was a success and i no longer blush, a life changing result. my daily anxiety has been reduced by about 60% because i no longer have to think of how to prevent myself from going red or a way to get out of social situations because i feared blushing. i find myself actually wanting to go out every day and not just sit in my room to avoid social situations. when in situations where i would usually blush i either feel completely normal and have no thought of blushing or i have a phantom blush where i think i still might blush but it never happens. i thank you for offering this surgery to patients like me because it has already made a big impact on my life and i know it will help me in college life and my future career."
