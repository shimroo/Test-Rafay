once upon a time, not so long ago, there were
    two overgrown boys called oliver and peter. 
    and peter lived on a farm. 
    it was a rather unusual farm because it didn't grow any crops and there were no sheep or
    cows, but it was the home of ivor the engine, noggin the nog, the clangers and of course
    bagpuss.
    and there they made the most beautiful, the most brilliant, funny old small films in the
    whole wide world or so we like to think.




  

smallfilmsa brief history of smallfilms and the films they produced.
here are some photos of oliver postgate and peter firmin at work.



  



  

the dragons' friendly societya
    new society has been formed to help maintain and promote the wealth of works produced
    smallfilms.  named after the society of dragons in the saga of noggin the nog, their
    first act is to produce a new set of noggin material - a  video, a book and a set of
    postcards.

noggin the nogin the lands of the north, where the black rocks stand guard against the cold
    sea, in the dark night that is very long, the men of the northlands sit by their great log
    fires and they tell a tale...

    so began each of the sagas of noggin the nog, in which the crown of noggin, prince of the
    nogs is sought by his wicked uncle nogbad the bad who devises evil plots to threaten the
    safety of the kingdom, and sometimes the world, in order to force noggin to give up his
    crown.  in each saga nogbad pursues his plot to the very brink of success, but at the
    last moment his purposes are foiled by some unexpected piece of luck, cleverness or lack
    of attention on the part of the nogs.

ivor the enginenot very
    long ago, in the top left-hand corner of wales, there was a railway.  it wasn't a
    very long railway or a very important railway, but it was called the merioneth and
    llantisilly rail traction company limited, and it was all there was.
and in a shed, in a siding at the end of the railway, lives the locomotive of the
    merioneth and llantisilly rail traction company limited, which was a long name for a
    little engine so his friends just called him ivor.
so began, in 1959, the first episode of the first series of a set of television films
    which were to become part of the mainstream of children's television for the next thirty
    years.

once upon a time, not so long ago, there was a little girl
    and her name was emily. and she had a shop. 
    it was a rather unusual shop because it didn't sell anything.
    you see, everything in that shop was a thing that somebody had once lost, and emily had
    found, and brought home to bagpuss.
    emily's cat bagpuss.
    the most important.
    the most beautiful.
    the most magical.

    animals that lived on a small moon.they lived a peaceful life, salvaging junk from
    space to build machines, and making friends with all the strange creatures that came to
    visit them.
