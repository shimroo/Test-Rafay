director, global health institute, nyc health + hospitals / elmhurst hopsital center, new york“global health has seen tremendous progress around the world and building health systems capacity is paramount to sustain those gains and support countries’ aspiration for universal health coverage. aiha’s important and timely mission aligns precisely with existing development needs.”– dr. ariel pablos-méndez, professor of clinical medicine, columbia university medical center, former assistant administrator, bureau for global health, usaid (2011-2016)“when i was ceo and vice provost of the st. paul hospital millennium medical college, i experienced first-hand the value of an aiha-led twinning partnership that strengthened our pre- and in-service training capacity in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. as minister of health, i continue to see the invaluable contribution aiha has made over the past decade to improve the capacity of our country’s institutions, resulting in better health outcomes.”– dr. lia tedesse gebremedhin, minister of health, federal democratic republic of ethiopia“aiha has a long history of working with a broad range of stakeholders in lmics to strengthen local health system capacity and train health workers to provide quality, equitable healthcare services. they work hand-in-hand with their partners – from the ministry of health down to

our twinning partnership with howard university and our collaborative capacity development efforts to ensure we build a critical mass in the face of ethiopia’s severe shortage of trained healthcare workers.”dr. ephrem engidawork, associate professor of pharmacology, addis ababa university, ethiopia“the beauty of this sort of institution-to-institution partnership is that it effectively leverages the knowledge, expertise, and voluntarism of the us heath sector to strengthen both the human resources and organizational capacity of their counterparts.”the honorable pamela e. bridgewater, former us ambassador to jamaica“evaluators found a number of factors leading to partnership success. in-country partner ability to leverage within their institutions, communities, and with national governments was also evident in the emergency medicine, pharmacy, and clinical associate partnerships. in cases where the in-country partner lacked sufficient access, the twinning center was able to leverage its prestige to assist with advocacy.”aiha hiv/aids twinning center program evaluation the qed group, llc“thank you for the opportunity of having served as the project officer for the
