hendrix motorsports' rock crawling chassis are
                     engineered for safety, affordability, and strength. computer designed space frame technology weighs less and allows maximum
                     use of interior space. the chassis accommodates two front seats and a rear bench seat with ample room for spare parts, tools,
                     and an ice chest. this competition worthy chassis provides plenty of storage for that three day rubicon trip.
