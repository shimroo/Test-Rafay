welcome to the northwest classic chevy club website.  we’re glad you found us!we are a group of people who love 1955, 1956 and 1957 chevy cars, trucks and corvettes.  from stock to custom, sedans to hard tops, wagons to nomads, and from show cars to drivers with a “patina,” our members’ rides come in many different configurations.  we even count a limo among the rides owned by our members!  one constant is a love for the iconic “tri-fives.”some of our members enjoy car shows and can be seen at a show or two each weekend.  others prefer to wrench on their rides and are constantly looking to make them better.  some are road warriors, driving their tri-fives far and wide just of the sheer fun of “seeing the usa in their chevrolet.” whether you have a collection of tri-fives or just a dream of owning one, northwest classic chevy club has something to offer.for more information about our club and all it offers, head over to our club information page and if you share our passion for tri-fives, please consider joining our club. russ jonesnwccc presidentclub information
