 i
                    suggest the occurrence of many diseases is dependent upon
                    the decline of dhea which begins around 20-25 years of age
                    and reaches very low levels in old age.  also, it
                    follows from my work, that many problems that are increasing
                    with time in the united states and in the world are
                    resulting from the "secular trend," which i suggest is due
                    to the increase in percentages of individuals of higher
                    testosterone and the negative effect that testosterone
                    exerts on the availability of dhea.  disturbances in
                    "dehydroepiandrosterone homeostasis" may be a significant
                    source of morbidity and mortality.

this site is intended to
                  disseminate information generated from ongoing work i began in
                  1984.  two works were produced in 1985: evolution of sociopathy in western civilization. a
                    philosophical treatise followed by a
                    theory of the control of the ontogeny and phylogeny of homo sapiens by the interaction of dehydroepiandrosterone and

                  both copyrighted.  the original focus was narrow. 
                  the scope has rapidly broadened simultaneously with increasing
                  awareness of the explanatory usefulness of the primary
                  ideas.  it is my hypothesis that selection for the
                  androgens, dehydroepiandrosterone
and testosterone, is directly linked to human evolution. 
                  evolution consists of ontogeny
and phylogeny.
                 
the information is
                  divided into categories variously dealing with human ontogeny
                  and phylogeny.  since human ontogeny,
                the life of the individual, and phylogeny, the life of the species, are interdependent, my
                  divisions are also not exclusive.  these categories are
                  intended only as different entrances to a single explanation
                  of human biology.  there is extensive overlap.

 covid-19 infection and subsequent pathology are
                        caused by


                        low dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) 




(new
                        support: low dhea in covid-19)



(â© copyright 2020-2024, james michael howard,
                    fayetteville, arkansas, u.s.a.)



new research, 2022, regarding dhea has been
                    published that supports my hypothesis that covid-19 is
                    caused by low dhea: âcovid-19 patients with altered steroid
                    hormone levels are more likely to have higher disease
                    severity,â ( endocrine
volume 78
2022
                  jul 30. doi: 10.1007/s12020-022-03140-6.) âdhea was an
                  independent indicator of the disease severity with covid-19.â
it is my hypothesis that covid-19 infection and
                    subsequent pathology are caused by low levels of
                    dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) which are affected by aging,
                    testosterone and cortisol levels, and antagonism of dhea by
                    cortisol as in stress, all of which reduce effects of dhea
                    (â© copyright 2020, james michael howard, fayetteville,
                    arkansas, u.s.a.). it is already known that dhea provides
                    protection from pathogenic viruses. âin this study it was
                    shown that dhea protects mice against wnv, svni and sfv
                    lethal infection.â (arch virol. 1991;120(3-4):263-71. doi:
                    10.1007/bf01310481.) high testosterone levels affect dhea
                    levels by decreasing available dhea by reducing conversion
                    of dhea sulfate to the active form, dhea, and low
                    testosterone levels reduce intracellular dhea; both reduce
                    dhea. this is why high levels of testosterone in males and
                    high levels of testosterone of blacks compared to whites
                    increase covid-19 virulence, therefore, drugs such as
                    dexamethasone, which is known to reduce testosterone reduce
                    covid-19 this is why reduced dhea and testosterone of aging
                    increases covid-19 virulence.  
regarding the âcytokine stormâ in covid-19
                    infection, a case may be made that these cytokines are
                    produced by cells / tissues to stimulate dhea production.
                    therefore, the reduction in dhea caused by covid-19 would
                    cause numerous tissues to produce cytokines to stimulate
                    dhea. individuals who do not recover significantly by
                    eventually producing dhea experience âlong covid.â
this is derived from my explanation of human
                    evolution involving dhea (mammalian evolution) and human
                    evolution involving dhea and testosterone. i suggest
                    testosterone directly affects levels of dhea and
                    testosterone is increasing throughout human history and is
                    ongoing. at this time i think testosterone has increased in
                    human populations sufficiently to adversely affect dhea
                    levels. i suggest this is why human populations are
                    experiencing increases in obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer,
                    infections, at this time, including covid-19. (note: some
                    consider obesity as the cause of the others; obesity is
                    simply the earliest sign.)
since i think these androgens and their ratio
                    control all aspects of the human life span, i think they are
                    involved in all aspects of normal ontogeny as well as
                    pathology. i suggest this is why covid-19 has been connected
                    with many pathologies as well as disturbances in cytokines,
                    including âhypertension, diabetes, obesity, copd, and cvd.â
                   
as i stated above, i think testosterone is
                    increasing with time within populations; an over abundance
                    of testosterone can reduce the effects of dhea and this is
                    why pandemics are occurring, such as the hiv and others at
                    this time. this is why covid-19 is occurring at this time
                    and is directly connected to other pathology. they are both
                    caused by low dhea.

                      the cause of down's syndrome (ds) may be low levels of
                      maternal dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) in utero. 
                      this includes dna associated characteristics as well as
                      the chromosome 21 aneuploidy.  ("dhea supplementation
                      to a significant degree reduced number (p = 0.029) and

                      for relevant covariates. short term supplementation (4-12
                      weeks) resulted in greatest reduction in aneuploidy

                      10.1186/1477-7827-8-140  )  dhea naturally peaks
                      around ages of 20-25 years, declining, thereafter, to very
                      low levels in old age.  ds is characteristically
                      found in offspring of women 35-years-old or later. 
                      the âdna associated characteristicsâ are the basis of my
                      explanation of ds.  (this is derived from my
                      explanations of mammalian and human evolution; citations
                      for these are at the end of this treatise.)

                      i think dhea is directly involved in all dna, gene,
                      activity.   a ratio of dhea and dna is disturbed
                      by increased dna, extra chromosome 21, in downâs syndrome,
                      that is, the ratio of dhea to dna is reduced.  this
                      may be demonstrated by dna methylation patterns.  i
                      first suggested dhea is involved in dna methylation in
                      2015.  "i suggest dna methylation is an evolutionary
                      consequence of reduced levels of dehydroepiandrosterone
                      (dhea) and is involved in cancer initiation." ("dna
                      methylation, dhea, and cancer," http://anthropogeny.com/dnamethdheacancer.html 
                )  again, dhea naturally
                      begins to decline in women around ages 20-25. reaching
                      very low levels in old age; i suggest it is the low dhea
                      of women around age 35 that is the cause of down
                      syndrome.  low dhea has been reported in down's
                      syndrome j neuroendocrinol. 2011 may;23(5):450-5. doi:
                      10.1111/j.1365-2826.2011.02118.x ).

                      a study of dna methylation in ds reported that "overall,
                      our results indicate that the chorionic villi cells of ds
                      [down syndrome] fetuses are hypermethylated in all
                      autosomes and suggested that altered dna methylation may
                      be a recurrent and functionally relevant downstream
                      response to ds in human cells."  ( clin epigenet 11,
                      180 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-019-0756-4
).  this means that all of
                      these chromosomes may be affected by the low dhea to dna
                      ratio in ds.

                      i suggest the low ratio of dhea to dna is the cause of
                      downâs syndrome aneuploidy and the resultant
                      characteristics of down's syndrome.  measurements of,

                      intending to become pregnant, should be performed on all
                      women.  (for sake of support, low dhea in young women
                      has been determined to reduce pregnancies.)

                covid-19 is cause of current increased virulence

of rsv and influenza




(â© copyright 2022 james michael
                  howard, fayetteville, arkansas, usa)
i suggest the basis of increased
                  virulence of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza at this
                  time is reduction of dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) caused by
                  covid-19. it is my hypothesis that covid-19 infection and
                  subsequent pathology are caused by low dhea. support of low
                  dhea associated with covid-19 virulence has recently been
                  reported. it has been determined that dhea stimulates /
                  increases antibody formation in aged mice: âwhen dhea was
                  provided either topically or was incorporated directly into
                  vaccine, vigorous primary and secondary antibody responses
                  were detected in the aged mice given a single administration
                  of dhea, regardless of the mode of administration.â (the
                  journal of infectious diseases no. 4 (apr., 1993), pp. 830-840
                  ). 
i submit the covid-19 pandemic
                  has reduced dhea throughout the world, which has reduced the
                  antibody response to rsv and influenza. i suggest this is the
                  cause of the ongoing increase in rsv and influenza. this may
                  also explain the common increase in covid-19, influenza, and
                  rsv in the united states at this time. we may have discarded
                  our prophylaxis of covid-19 infection too early.

â¦ and the increase in autism
                    rates reported around january 25, 2023. â¦ another case of
                    effects of low dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) caused by

                  it is my hypothesis of 2003 that high maternal testosterone
                  causes autism by reducing available dhea for growth and
                  development of the brain. âthe increase in autism in
                  california (which [was] is also occurring in other areas),â
                  https://anthropogeny.com/increase%20in%20autism.htm . at the
                  time a large increase in autism frequency was being reported
                  in california. it was also considered to be by enhanced
                  diagnoses. i explained that a mother of high testosterone uses
                  available dhea at the expense the child and that the 2003
                  autism increase in california was caused by increased maternal
                  testosterone within the population.
                  i am suggesting here that covid-19 reduced these mothersâ dhea
                  which is causing increasing autism at this time.
                  my identification of high maternal testosterone has recently
                  been supported.

 it is my
                    hypothesis mammalian evolution occurred because of selection
                    for dhea and human evolution occurred because of selection
                    for testosterone because it increases intracellular dhea
                    primarily in the brain. i suggest this occurred in homo
                      erectus females. it is visible in the fossil record;
                    sexual dimorphism diminished in erectus when females
                    increased in size without change in male size and caused
                    "gracilization," in hominids wherein brain size increased at
                    the expense of body size, a hallmark of hominid evolution.
                    the effect occurs in utero, and is mainly effective
                    during "minipuberty," which occurs at birth. minipuberty is
                    characterized by a large production of testosterone at
                    birth. most literature reports concerning minipuberty
                    suggest this period is designed for testiscular development.
                    since i think the testosterone / dhea synergy evolved for
                    general cellular growth and development, i agree with this:
                    "during mini-puberty, males' external genitalia is more
                    related to somatic growth than to reproductive hormones, but
                    this relationship is not observed in girls." (eur j
                      pediatr (2023).
                    https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-023-05393-3 ).
 the
                    large production of testosterone at minipuberty causes the
                    large, available dhea to enter cells to stimulate growth and
                    development ... of myelin. female testosterone increased in
                    female homines erecti and they were selected by
                    males.this causes dhea to literally be used one; hence the
                    large decline of dhea of period a.
 i think
                    the foregoing increases the effects of minipuberty on early
                    brain growth and development and myelin. increased myelin is
                    the basis of our larger, faster brains.
 myelin
                    is directly affected by testosterone and dhea. every aspect
                    whereby we, as enhanced testosterone producers and males and
                    females, shows the positive effects of testosterone / dhea
                    on myelin.  
 "comparative
                    studies have noted that the white matter tends to take up
                    more and more space in larger-sized brains compared with
                    smaller brains. the proportion of white matter to total
                    brain volume ranges from an estimated 11% in mice to 27% in
                    macaques to 40â41% in chimpanzees and humans" (logo of

 for sake
                    of brevity, i suggest human evolution occurred because of
                    increases in testosterone and dhea which produce increases
                    in myelin and myelin effects. (the literature is replete
                    with effects of myelin and differences in myelin that
                    support my foregoing hypothesis. look it up.)

                    directly supports my hypothesis and was reported in the
                    literature  
 this
                    chart represents the availability of dhea during the human
                    life-span. (it is derived from two separate charts which i
                    have combined from âadrenal androgens,â a.r. genazzani,
                    raven press, 1980.) (i was able to post the chart just above
                    this.) period a is the first postnatal year (minipuberty),
                    period b is a period of very low dhea, period c is the rise
                    of dhea of childhood prior (adrenarche) to the onset of
                    puberty, period d is the reproductive period, period e and f
                    are early and late aging. this chart represents the
                    availability of dhea during the human life-span. (it is
                    derived from two separate charts in adrenal androgens, a.r.
                    genazzani, raven press, 1980.)  
 i
                    suggest what i call âaâ is minipuberty. testosterone
                    increases postpartum in minipuberty. as i stated above, i
                    think testosterone increases dhea primarily in the brain.
                    âaâ demonstrates the large decline of dhea because of the
                    testosterone. dhea, i suggest, is literally âused upâ in
                    stimulating myelin. (i will add these connections of myelin
                    characteristics of the brain soon; i submit it is this
                    powerful stimulation of testosterone and dhea that âcausesâ
                    homo sapiens.

                    of myelination is observed during the first post-natal
                    year." (neuroimage. 2019 jan 15; 185: 349â360.

                    the chart of life span of dhea shows a very large amount of
                    dhea at birth which falls dramatically during the first year
                    which is, i suggest, used during this dramatic increase in
                    myelin.
