the 2023/24 season marked a historic milestone for upper thames’ senior women’s squad! 🚣‍♀️ 

this year, they proudly fielded three boats at henley royal regatta for the first time ever, with two eights in the wargrave challenge cup and our debut crew in the town challenge cup.

from having just five athletes in 2021, to qualifying a boat in the town cup this year, our squad’s growth has been nothing short of incredible. we’re honored to be among well renowned names such as thames, molesey, and leander, as one of the few clubs with three women’s crews at hrr this year. 

cheers to an even bigger 2024/25 season! 💪

🔵⚪️ henley royal regatta round up ⚪️🔵

~ wyfold challenge cup ~ semi finalists ~
our men’s 4- started strong on tuesday and wednesday, showcasing dominant performances with quick starts. they came across molesey in the quarter finals, beating them by 1 1/4 length. unfortunately their racing came to an end after coming up against a strong thames crew in the semi finals on the friday. 

~ wargrave challenge cup ‘a’ ~ quarter finalists ~ 
after an exciting race against tyne a.r.c, our wargrave ‘a’ boat made it through their first heat, to race against a seeded crew from switzerland. after fast starts from both crews, with belvoir up at the 1/4 mile, our crew got onto their rhythm by the barrier to win by 2 1/4 lengths. unfortunately they were knocked out in the quarter finals by a strong crew from london rc, who proceeded to the finals. 

~ wargrave challenge cup ‘b’ ~ heats ~
for the second consecutive year, upper thames qualified a ‘b’ boat in the wargrave! they faced marlow ‘a’ in their first heat on the wednesday, and with a great row they won by 1 1/2 lengths. they then went on to face a strong seeded 8+ from sydney rc, in their next heat who beat upper thames by 1 length. 

~ town challenge cup ~ heats ~
this year marked an exciting milestone for our senior women’s squad, as they qualified for the town challenge cup for the first time ever. after making it through qualifiers the previous friday, utrc raced against brooke’s in their first heat on thursday. despite gusty conditions and a tight race, our crew narrowly missed victory by 2/3 length.

~ britannia challenge cup ~ heats ~ 
our brit 4+ had a nail-biting journey, needing to be in the top 2 out of 13 crews at qualifiers to advance. successfully making it through, they faced a strong london crew. leading at the barrier and fawley markers, our crew engaged in a thrilling race, ultimately missing out on the win by just 1 foot—the smallest margin of the day.
