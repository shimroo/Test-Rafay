we believe that respectfully preserving and accessing history opens the doors to the annals of time, which helps us all to appreciate the story, sacrifices and challenges of the human race.

in 1827 the pirate spanish slave ship guerrero sank off the florida coast while being pursued by a british warship. through rough weather, cannon fire and deception began a three-year saga involving 561 captive africans and five nations. now as expeditions search for the shipâs remains, the guerrero project dives headfirst into this lost piece of history and explores why anyone wants to find this ship and what implications it has on us today.
 
for two centuries the engaging stories of those aboard the guerrero were lost in a few obscure historical pages â until now. this feature-length documentary fuses history with high-seas adventure, modern-day expeditions, heated archaeological debate, intense emotions concerning today's race relations, and ultimate hope.
