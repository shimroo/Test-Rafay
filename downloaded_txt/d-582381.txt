challenges











over-exploitation of natural resources has resulted in degradation of ecosystems worldwide with serious implications for the well-being of people and the planet













with 90% of india’s current workforce in the informal economy and rising unemployment, the need to redefine 'work' has become inevitable













the world consumes more than what earth can produce. the 'take, make, and throw' approach has led to resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and high pollution levels

testimonials




















kudos to your team at the development alternatives for organizing such an amazing immersion program of the taragram yatra 2024. it was insightful and inspiring to be part of this experience. thank you for sharing a certificate. 
participating in the climate yatra was a wonderful experience, particularly understanding the impact of communication, my core area of research and sustainability, a recently explored area of research. it will be great to connect and explore this integration of communication and sustainability and understand the role of communications for social impact based on the elaborate work done by you and your team. 



christal ferraoacademic associate in general management and public policy, gim












i am writing to convey my sincere congratulations on the successful organization of the taragram yatra 2024.
it was an absolute privilege to participate in the thought-provoking sessions, and engaging discussions that contributed to making this event so impactful. the experience provided a wonderful opportunity for immersive learning and connecting with like-minded individuals, which i found both valuable and inspiring.
i greatly appreciate your efforts in bringing together diverse perspectives and creating a platform to address critical issues.
thank you once again for your dedication and hard work in organizing such an outstanding initiative.



dhanshree chavansr. programme manager, under the mango tree society












"what an incredible three-day journey it has been! it was a pleasure connecting with each one of you during the taragram yatra. the event was a perfect blend of knowledge and activities—it was the result of the hard work of the amazing organizing team. this experience not only enriched us with valuable insights but also gave us new networks and friendships that we will cherish. kudos to the entire team for making this flagship event such a grand success! we look forward to crossing paths again and collaborating on meaningful ventures in the future. until then, stay inspired and keep making a difference!"

ms. heena ludhanisr. manager strategic interventions, end poverty












"i wanted to express my gratitude for the incredible experience over the last three days in taragram yatra. initially, i wasn’t sure what to expect when my manager recommended the program, and coming from the northeast, i wondered how well i’d blend in. however, this journey has been truly enriching—i had the opportunity to connect with amazing individuals and gain invaluable insights. thank you for being such wonderful hosts and creating a welcoming and inspiring environment."



rachel aierprogram associate, wri












"following the green agenda, on which we have had very fruitful discussions at the trialogue2047, will prove to be immensely beneficial for every one of us, from governments and corporate organisations to civil society and individuals. there are many positives that we can take away from the conference."



dr. ashok kumar ghoshchairman, bihar state pollution control board (bspcb)












"regarding the experience of 2 days of  taragram yatra,  it was a one of its kind learning experience with all the participants and the members working towards the same agenda. the first hand experience about the on-ground realities and workings regarding the waste collection and management was extremely elaborating and educating and gave us a new dimension to our research project. really appreciate the da team's efforts to make all this a success."



mandavi singhproject associate, centre for resource efficiency & governance division, teri












"this was the first time i attend the yatra and found it to be informative and a learning experience. , i learnt the basic of setting up enterprises in a rural set up and how the community led action helps in creating more jobs i also participated in the comic play in bhatewara village along with women from the community? those women were with women, who have aspiration to become an empowered individual entrepreneur, a full time businesswoman… and able to analyse what is lacking and what is needed to reach that stage.  i also got an opportunity to interact with fellow yatris and learnt about their work!!!!!"



k rathnacoo, cibart












"it is incredible to experience the reality of the green economy, climate change, inclusive growth and sustainability on the ground instead of just reading in the research paper. i am so grateful to da for inviting me as one of the yatri in tgy 2022, bundelkhand. during the three days event, we were exposed to their participatory information, and knowledge development models built for natural resources management and community resilience, such as the locally owned community operated (loco) model and check dams. i discussed the idea and implementation of happiness in economies and what we owe to society. with stuart worsely and i thank him for his valuable insights on the topic."



shruti aggarwalph.d. research scholar (mnit jaipur)












“the world is going through a polycrisis. we really need effective solutions to mitigate the problem of climate change. there is much coming out of india right now that gives us hope in the fight against climate change. da has been very much in this fight.”



mr shombi sharpthe united nations resident coordinator in india
