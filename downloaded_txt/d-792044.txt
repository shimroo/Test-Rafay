the waynes books rpg reference missionthis is my ever-expanding reference of role playing games (rpgs). in earlier days, i called this site krakow rpgs and wayne's world of books, but i have since settled on wayne's books. i sell science fiction (sci-fi) & fantasy books, but my passion is the world of games. rpgs are both book and game. this site is where i post documentation of games that pass through the shop. it is first and foremost a reference for my own day-to-day work. for many obscure games, this may be their only photo and summary available on the web. i focus on pre-2000, out of print rpgs and board games that can be so hard to find now.most entries will have noble knight, amazon and/or drivethrurpg affiliate links to items or pdfs for sale. put a few coins in my tip jar; costs you nothing - the sites pay for it.
