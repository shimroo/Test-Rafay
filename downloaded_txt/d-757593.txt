 frequently asked questions

how can i purchase a flight or gift voucher?


 flight and gift vouchers can be purchased online from the menu above.
alternatively, you can contact our reservations team 
on 1300 fly hot.
we look forward to hearing from you!
 


what time of the year is best to fly?


 the gold coast is one of the only locations in the world where flights are scheduled all year round. so any day is a good day to fly!
 


what if the weather is no good on the day?


 if your balloon flight is cancelled by us due to unsuitable weather conditions we let you know, then you are welcome to re-book anytime within a 12 month period. we confirm all our flights the night before around 7pm.¬†
 


why do you fly so early?


 balloon flights take place at sunrise on the gold coast as this is when the weather conditions are at their most stable. ideal conditions for ballooning consist of light winds and cool, calm atmospheric conditions.
 


how safe is ballooning?


 hot air ballooning is one of the safest forms of aviation in australia. go ballooning.com boasts the gold coast‚Äôs most experienced operator and we simply will not fly if the conditions are not safe to do so. we are governed by casa (civil aviation safety authority) the same as qantas or virgin australia and fly strictly to the guidelines set down by them.
 


how long does the balloon flight take?


 our flights vary between 30 and 60 minutes with an average flight time of 45 minutes. the total time you are with us on the morning of your flight is approximately 4 hours. this includes a flight briefing from your pilot, completing some paperwork, travelling to and from the launch and landing sites in one of our shuttle buses and the 5 star buffet breakfast at the sheraton afterwards.
 


how high will the balloon go?


 balloons are incredibly versatile, so on the morning of your flight you might find yourself flying anywhere between tree top height and up to 7.5 thousand feet.
