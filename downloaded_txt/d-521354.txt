our mission and vision



the huntington district is a thriving team of nationally-respected, values-driven, professionals collaboratively pioneering solutions to our nation’s toughest challenges, encompasses 45,000 square miles in parts of five states, including west virginia, ohio, kentucky, virginia and north carolina.  it is responsible for 311 navigable miles along the ohio river and 98 navigable miles on the kanawha river and includes the nation’s second largest inland waterway port, the port of huntington. 
our program includes the operation and maintenance of nine locks and dams on the ohio and kanawha rivers, 35 flood damage reduction projects preventing $21.6 billion in damages and dredging on the ohio, big sandy and kanawha rivers.  in addition, riverfront improvements, flood risk management initiatives, environmental mitigation, and infrastructure activities make up the district’s robust civil works program.
history of the huntington district

solid as stone - history of the huntington district (1974-2021)
men, mountains and rivers - history of the huntington district (1754-1974)



over the years, hundreds of huntington district employees have stepped away from their homes and regular duties in support of over 1,500 emergency development missions around the world. during federally declared disasters, we work with fema and other federal agencies to assist in response and recovery efforts of state and local governments. the corps provides professional engineering expertise and materials to support public health and safety.
our disaster missions include flood response and recovery, temporary housing, critical public facilities, blue roof, debris cleanup, and emergency power generation. our temporary housing team is recognized as one of the best in the corps of engineers


operations division is the steward of 223,802 acres of federal land, 98,413 water acres and 813 shoreline miles. as stewards of this land, we must follow all required laws and regulations.
we manage, conserve and protect natural and cultural resources with ecosystem management principles, while providing quality public outdoor recreation experiences to serve the needs of present and future generations. this includes management of species of concern, cultural sites and environmentally sensitive areas supporting unique ecosystems.
the mission of the corps’ regulatory program is to protect the nation’s aquatic resources while permitting reasonable development through a fair, flexible, and balanced decision-making process. the regulatory division regulates more than 2,000 miles of navigable waters under section 10 of the rivers and harbors act of 1899, as well as countless miles of smaller non-navigable streams and acres of wetlands across west virginia and ohio under section 404 of the clean water act


reducing flood damage risks to citizens within the huntington district’s 45,000 square miles is one of our primary objectives. we lead national efforts for flood risk reduction as the dam safety modification mandatory center of expertise (dsmmcx) and the regional dam safety production center (dspc). operations division operates and maintains 35 dams which have prevented a cumulative total of more than $15.6 billion in flood damages.
the dsmmcx provides oversight, technical advice, review and production capability for all aspects of dam safety modification projects throughout the corps of engineers. the great lakes and ohio river division’s dam safety production center is responsible for all regional dam safety modification reports, complex non-routine dam safety products, and provides lead engineers for dam safety modification projects.
additionally, the huntington district operates and maintains 12 levee systems and inspects and provides technical assistance for 30 levee segments that are operated and maintained by local sponsors. life safety is the paramount objective for the usace levee safety program. accurate and timely information about associated levee risks enables those affected to make informed decisions about their safety and take appropriate action.
