automation zone removed a old assembly line and replaced it with inline
conveyors. we put together a team of 8 contractors to complete the project 
and installation in 10 days. shutting down this line effected 4000 people working
on and supply the line, it was misson critical to have it running in 10 days.

panel shop
our ul508a panel shop has been providing custom industrial electrical panels since 2001. our panel shop has created stringent quality standards through years of experience. 
 
however, we are not just a panel shop; our completed panels are quality checked and tested by experienced engineers. all of our panels ul and non ul go through a 3 step check out process to ensure quality, all documentation for the panel including pictures are stored on our servers.  our panel wireman and engineers work closely with our customers to design and build panels to your needs with the quality craftsmanship you expect.

the hvct tests your cables more than just a regular multi meters continuity check. it finds failures before costly installation into the field. it ensures all connections, conductors and insulation are intact prior to field use. the hvct tests opens, shorts, and miswires. it also performs a hipot test for insulation resistance and dielectric failures along with the normal low voltage continuity test.
 






 
 
ul definition of a panel 
an assembly incorporating two or more pieces of industrial control equipment or related control circuit devices, provided with interconnecting wiring and terminals for connections in the field. to allow the installer to properly install the panel in accordance to national electrical code and other codes, electrical ratings and instructions are to be clearly explained on the panel.
installation can be completed in two ways: in an enclosure as "enclosed type" equipment, or arranged onto a mounting panel as "open type" equipment. for "open type" equipment, the assembly is installed in an enclosure provided by others, or at the installation site.
 
what are the benefits of ul listed panels? 
the ul listing mark on an industrial control panel provides evidence of third party certification to the municipal inspection authority and to the purchaser of the panel. it shows that the panel complies with an acceptable safety standard. the listing mark may be applied to a wide variety of designs -- ranging from custom built, one-of-a kind panels, to standardized designs with only minor variations. 
 
what is covered by the ul listing mark? 
the ul listing mark on an "enclosed type" control panel only covers the enclosure and the components that are installed within the enclosure or to the enclosure at the manufacturer's facility.
the ul listing mark on an "open type" control panel only covers the mounting panel and those components that are mounted to it at the manufacturer's facility.
please note that the ul listing mark does not include coverage for externally connected loads, even if provided by the panel manufacturer. also, the ul mark does not include coverage of any components shown on the wiring diagram that are indicated as being customer provided or as not being in the panel. if a complete equipment listing is required, please contact us regarding our factory automation equipment program.
 
please give us a call with any questions.

plant tracker

plant tracker is a building block to your oee and data collection needs with in a unique package that makes it heads and shoulders above the competition. 
it differs from other software packages in many aspects with the first being cost. after seeing how much other packages cost (some starting close to a hundred thousand) we decided to develop our package to be cost effective so that the customer would receive maximum return on investment. 
the first way we did this was by producing plant tracker in indusoft. indusoft is a full development software program that rivals wonder ware and factory talk. by going with indusoft we were able to keep plant trackers initial cost low with giving you the customer maximum flexibility to expand and grow the database and remove those pesky yearly licensing fees. we have a scheduler, downtime codes and archived data within microsoft access which will allow you the customer to easily export your data into excel. once in excel you will be able to build custom graphs that meet your demands.  
one other major option we give our customers is the ability to be portable with plant tracker within a pelican brief case. this will allow you to receive your oee on machines that move around a lot or even during start up periods where you want to get them running at peak performance. this portability can be networked in by either hard wire or by weidmuller wireless. having the wireless option will continue to keep your cost down and allowing you to expand plant tracker in the future. the best thing about plant tracker however is the ease in which you will be able to expand and grow it by yourself without the help of us. this final option along with all the other stated above will give you the tools to take your plant to peak performance and growth long into the future. 
 
it is a data collection tool that will allow you to see the machine performance (oee) for the last three shifts plus the current one at a touch of a button. 
 
data is always being stored to a access database in which you can run reports, trend charts, graphical analysis and any statistical transformation of the data
 
 
how will the plant tracker help you improve our equipment output?
real time data
archived data
operator performance
machine performance
the plant tracker will allow you take a in depth look at what is making your equipment not perform up to it’s optimal output through specific data. this data will enable you to take quick corrective action to reduce these issues.
 
what will you be able to look at with the plant tracker?
total number of parts
reject parts
downtime
oee
cycle times
event log
archived data 
actual part cost vs. quoted part cost
 
 what is oee?
overall equipment effectiveness
data driven monitoring system of the manufacturing productivity loss’
availability
performance
quality
calculating oee… 
               availability - takes into account down time loss’ and is calculated as:
operating time / planned production time performance.

performance - takes into account speed loss’ and is calculated as:
ideal cycle time/ (operating time / total pieces)

quality - takes into account quality loss, and is calculated as: 
                                           good pieces / total pieces
