fountain square

the crane is down, and the square is often packed. one of the coolest events is the weekly movie on the square on saturday nights... it's free and often packed with people. it's a great concept with the early movie being kid friendly (finding nemo this week), and the later movie being focused on adults (jaws was the movie).head on down and check out the new square, grab some dinner, and just enjoy the urban setting.coming soon, via vitte (on the square - wine bar by the owner of nicola's in otr). also coming soon is potbelly's sandwich shoppe to be open by november. when it's all done it should be great for the holidays!check out the pictures:labels: fountain square

development in the last few months

so, while i've been relaxing there sure has been all kinds of development occuring downtown and around the city... here are some highlights:- cadillac ranch - opened on the back of fountain square across from cac. a little cheesy and not really my scene, but they did a great job with the outdoor seating area.- lodge bar - opened up next to mcfadden's. great little bar, and great to work with, have already had two parties there for katrina and give back.- nada - the owner of boca is opening an 'upscale' mexican restaurant in the old bella space across from cac.- boi na braza and morton's - both opened at the corner of 5th and vine, and boi na braza is amazing, a bit pricey but really awesome.- graeter's - opened on monmouth a block up from the levee and will be soon open on the square.- steamboat bagels - about ready to open on foutain square.there are soooo many more around town, but downtown is really turning the corner... great to see!labels: development, downtown

where did the summer go

wow.... just went back to look at the blog for the last several months. it's a pretty horrible showing, sorry about that. i guess things just got away from me... lots of great things on the personal (family), work and volunteer front just put this blog on the backburner.it's been a great summer with a successful paint the town in college hill (heading to northern kentucky in 2008 with 40+ houses in covington), a fantastic trip to new orleans with katrina collaboration, and a great win for lily pad at the airport.now the next few months are going to keep up that progress. lots of great new things with give back cincinnati, a 2nd year event for washington park music festival (wpmf) which will occur the saturday of mpmf. this years event will be bigger and better, with support from the mayerson foundation and all proceeds going to the school for the creative and performing arts which should begin construction later this year at the foot of washington park.

back from nola

check out the nola blog for full details later this week, but thought i'd put up a photo of the team for now. it was an amazing week, and i think it's safe to say give back and habitat cincinnati will be heading back to nola again in 2007, there is more work to be done.the 2007 team was absolutely amazing. they endured the heat, a broken down bus, and some re-work without batting an eye, it was an honor to just be a part of the team!labels: katrina collaboration

new orleans here we come

well.. june is always crazy for me with paint the town planning and execution in early june. this year it's been even more crazy, as i have been helping to plan the second trip of katrina collaboration (coalition of give back cincinnati and cincinnati habitat for humanity young professionals).but the time is upon us, so whatever hasn't been taken care of isn't going to... i have created a blog that i will be tracking our progress as we make the trip down... check it out:http://givebacknola.blogspot.com/i'll try to update it during the week with pictures and stories...as we get ready to leave, i've created a playlist on lala.com to occupy me for at least part of the 16 hour bus ride to n'awlins. check it out:labels: new orleans
