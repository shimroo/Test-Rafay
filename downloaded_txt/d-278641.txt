obama bans offshore drilling off atlantic coast





woo hoooooo! yay for the ocean!

the obama administration is reversing course on opening atlantic waters to a new generation of oil and gas drilling, after a revolt by environmentalists and coastal communities that said the activity threatened marine life, fishing and tourism along the u.s. east coast.
the proposed offshore leasing program being released tuesday eliminates the administration’s initial plan to auction off drilling rights in as many as 104 million acres of the mid- and south-atlantic in 2021, according to an interior department statement. the proposal also sets the stage for selling oil and gas leases in the arctic waters of the chukchi and beaufort seas, as well as alaska’s cook inlet and the gulf of mexico, where 10 auctions were tentatively scheduled from 2017 to 2022. bloomberg
oceana wants more: 

today, the obama administration made a historic move to protect the east coast from offshore drilling. in the newly proposed five-year program for oil and gas development on the outer continental shelf, the bureau of ocean energy management removed the atlantic ocean for leasing from 2017 to 2022. while oceana applauded the obama administration for listening to widespread opposition along the east coast, it continues to urge the government to stop seismic airgun use in the atlantic and not to hold new lease sales in the remote and unforgiving arctic ocean. oceana

obama on cuba: time for something new









panama — president obama and president raúl castro of cuba met here saturday, in the first face-to-face discussion between the leaders of the two countries in a half century.

seated beside mr. castro in a small room in the convention center downtown where the summit was being held, mr. obama called the event “an historic meeting.”

the president cast his decision to seek normalized relations with cuba after 50 years of estrangement a bid to reverse a failed policy.

“it was time for us to try something new,” mr. obama said. “we are now in a position to move on a path toward the future.” he added: ”over time, it is possible for us to turn the page and develop a new relationship between our two countries.” nyt

obama's speech on syria aug. 31





action is not time sensitive, obama said. but even though he's convinced striking syria will help deter syria's government from using chemical weapons in the future, he's made a second decision -- to seek authorization from congress. the ickiest congress ever might be an advantage in this situation, for those of us who don't want to see any military action.
nice move by obama to throw the ball in congress's court. they were too busy playing in the sandbox. now obama's welcomed them to behave like adults and make a decision.
