   coral reefs support over 1 billion people worldwide, and harbour the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planet. 
unprecedented global warming and anthropogenic impacts such as pollution and coastal development have made coral reefs one of earths most threatened ecosystemsaccording to unesco, the coral reefs in all 29 reef-containing world heritage sites would cease to exist the end of this century if we continue under 'business-as-usual' scenario.now more than ever, coral reefs need our help.

   coral cay conservation is a renowned conservation specialist and  
expedition provider dedicated to providing the resources to help protect coral reefs throughout the developing world and committed to creating real-time solutions to the many plights suffered by our ocean.we have over 30 years' experience of operating successful marine and terrestrial conservation projects, providing opportunities to budding-scientists, collectively protecting biodiversity, empowering local stakeholders and building a sustainable future. throughout this process we have taught lifelong skills, and provided practical conservation experiences, to thousands of volunteers allowing them the opportunity to take action against environmental impacts, strengthen their cv, or undertake thesis data collection. all those who join us have a shared passion; to protect the natural world.


   "providing resources to help sustain livelihoods and alleviate poverty through the protection, restoration and management of coral reefs and associated ecosystems​" 


    




     

our story




   volunteer to take action the ocean, its inhabitants, and the local communities that depend on it, are at the centre of all of our conservation projects. we provide in-depth training to volunteers from diverse backgrounds to create efficient and competent survey divers who collect essential marine ecological data, engage with local stakeholders and drive the ethos of our projects.    
the actions of our volunteers have been critical in the protection of some of the worlds most threatened ecosystems, working with local communities to protect the natural world
 
we engage local communities through education and capacity building initiatives to empower stakeholders to take action and catalyse conservation;ensuring sustainability
 
through the protection and promotion of coral reefs and their associated ecosystems, you will help to build a sustainable future, where humans and the environment thrive in harmony 


  

take action




   we believe in a future where our choices today will benefit the generations of tomorrow, where coral reefs will sustainably provide for local communities in the face of growing demand, allowing these systems to thrive in harmony with humankind.   we believe in a future where our choices today will benefit the generations of tomorrow, where coral reefs will sustainably provide for local communities in the face of growing demand, allowing these systems to thrive in harmony with humankind.   



   conservation;what's our approach? 

we understand that successful conservation hinges on a holistic approach where equal measure is given to the collection of scientific data, education, and capacity building. our volunteers are critical to this approach and for over 30 years, they have been at the centre of our work, using a citizen-science framework. our projects successfully operate with volunteers and the three-tiers at their heart.

  🐠today is world manta day 🐠⁠
⁠
manta and devil rays are threatened globally, and numbers are dropping in many regions.⁠
⁠
both manta and devil rays are targeted for their gill plates, which are used in pseudo-remedies in china and east asia.⁠
⁠
manta and devil rays, like many other large marine animals, get easily tangled in fishing nets and ghost nets. ⁠
⁠
climate change is changing the availability of phytoplankton in the ocean, and unregulated tourism can push manta rays away from critical cleaning and feeding habitats.⁠

  coral reefs first appeared 485 million years ago, at the dawn of the early ordovician.⁠
⁠
throughout  their 485 million year existence they have adapted to natural changes in our environment, and have thrived in the ocean. ⁠
⁠
global coral bleaching events were first recorded in the 1990's, and the occurrences of bleaching events have increased in prevalence since. ⁠

  anemone fish and their hosts are synonymous with coral reefs🪸⁠
⁠
anemone fish have evolved to live symbiotically with anemones, meaning that they both benefit mutually from the relationship. ⁠
⁠
clownfish are protected from predators by the stinging tentacles of the anemone, and in return, they keep the anemone clean and tidy!⁠

  sea turtles migrate thousands of kilometres between foraging and nesting habitats 🐢⁠
⁠
the high seas are full of migrating animals, but they're also full of longlines and abandoned ghost nets, both of which threaten migratory animals 🐋🦈⁠
⁠
longline methods are indiscriminate and attract animals with baited hooks, whilst ghost nets capture and entangle marine animals as they travel through the ocean.⁠

  whales migrate thousands of kilometres every year across the high seas, travelling through 'whale superhighways' to get to critical feeding and breeding habitats 🐋⁠
⁠
whales may be protected for certain parts of their migration, but a 2018 study highlighted that 50% of a migratory whale's life is spent in areas of the high seas beyond national jurisdiction. ⁠
⁠
only 1% of the high seas are protected, leaving whales and other migratory animals unprotected and vulnerable. ⁠

  the high seas make up 63% of the ocean, but less than 1% is protected🌊 ⁠
⁠
high seas will be hugely impacted if deep sea mining plans go ahead. dredging the ocean floor and moving minerals to the surface disturbs and displaces sediment, as well as destroying habitats and creating noise and toxic chemical pollution. ⁠
⁠
the deep sea is often portrayed as a desolate abyss, but this is far from the truth. the deep is sea is teaming with life, and intrinsically linked to the high seas and health of our ocean.⁠
⁠
if we take from the deep sea, we take from the whole ocean 🐋⁠

there is an estimated 300 species of squid and a huge size difference between the smallest and largest. ⁠
⁠
the biggest species of squid is the colossal squid, which is also the largest invertebrate species on the planet, reaching up to 14m in length! 🦑🦑⁠
⁠
the smallest species of squid is the southern pygmy squid, with males reaching a maximum length of 1.6cm! 🤏🏽⁠

  🦈shark awareness day🦈⁠
⁠
⁠
sharks have been misunderstood and vilified for centuries, and this has had a huge impact on shark populations globally. ⁠
⁠
⁠
the media portray sharks as monsters, beasts and killers, but the reality is quite the opposite. shark bites are responsible for a yearly average of 10 human deaths. a number considerably lower than the 100 million sharks are killed every year by humans... 🩸⁠
⁠
⁠
like all predatory animals, sharks should be respected, but they do not need to be feared 💙⁠

⁠
who has been lucky enough to dive with sharks?!⁠

  earlier this week, a shark killing tournament in florida legally took place with protests, petitions and scientific opposition 🦈⁠
⁠
sharks are apex predators and play an important role in the oceanic ecosystem.  sharks indirectly maintain habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows by shifting the spatial habitat of their prey🐟️⁠
⁠
here's an example... if we lose sharks, larger predatory fish will increase in abundance and more herbivorous fish are eaten. 🐠 less herbivorous fish means an increase in macroalgae on coral reefs and corals can no longer compete for space/light, shifting coral reef ecosystems to unhealthy, algae-dominated reefs.⁠
⁠
⁠
if we lose sharks, we lose ocean stability 💙⁠

  a 2022 study has shown that reef-building corals are not developing adaptive mechanisms to cope with plastic pollution🐠⁠
⁠
this long-term study (15 months) showed that corals do not discriminate between plastic particles and natural food, feeding rates didn't slow after consuming plastics nor did they show any defence mechanisms (mucus production) to prevent plastic uptake.⁠

  corals are extremely specialised animals and can only grow in very specific conditions:⁠
⁠
🌡️ temperatures between 23°c and 29°c⁠
⁠
🧂 salinity range of 32 to 42 ppt⁠
⁠
🦠low nutrient levels (oligotrophic) ⁠
⁠
☀️sunlight for photosynthesis ⁠

when these parameters fluctuate  corals are at an increased risk of disease, bleaching and death.⁠

  globally, we catch an estimated 200 million tonnes of fish each year. a staggering 40% of this is caught unintentionally 🐟⁠
⁠
⁠
the accidental capture of non-target species has a huge impact on ocean health. bycatch is unmanaged and not part of landing quotas for fisheries, and animals caught accidentally are thrown back dead or dying 🎣⁠

  an estimated 250,000 turtles are caught as bycatch and die unnecessarily every year. ⁠
⁠
how? indiscriminate fishing methods entangle non-target species like turtles, cetaceans and elasmobranchs, as well as non-target fish species 🐬⁠
⁠
ghost nets (abandoned fishing gear) are also very dangerous, and in the mediterranean alone kill an estimated 50,000 sea turtles a year 🎣😢⁠

  coral reefs globally are facing extinction, with 90% of reefs predicted to be dead by 2050 😔⁠
⁠
increasing sea surface temperatures as a result of climate change are pushing corals into dangerously warm waters. corals are spending extended periods of time in temperatures outside of their thermal maxima, and this leads to mass bleaching.⁠
⁠
unless something changes now, the future for coral reefs is bleak. ⁠
⁠
however, corals in the gulf of aqaba in the northern red sea are a beacon of hope for coral reefs. these resilient reefs are withstanding temperatures that have bleached coral reefs around the world. while other reefs are dying, this reef system is thriving. ⁠
⁠
scientists are calling for the gulf of aqaba to be named a unesco marine world heritage site 🌏⁠

  ⁠💙world ocean day 💙⁠
⁠
⁠
the world is aware that our oceans need action fast, but sometimes it can be overwhelming and difficult to know how we can help.⁠
⁠
the biggest changes will come from governments, but that doesn't mean individuals cannot play a significant role. simple everyday decisions when replicated by millions will make a huge difference.⁠
⁠
💦 conserving water - this is especially important when living near rivers/coastlines⁠
⁠
🧽 reduce pollutants - switch to eco-friendly, biodegradable cleaning chemicals⁠
⁠
♻️ reduce waste - only purchase what you need, and try and buy sustainably⁠
⁠
🚲 reduce emissions - cycling and taking public transport when possible⁠
⁠
🎣 eat less seafood - taking pressure off fisheries⁠
⁠
🥡 go plastic-free - take steps towards a plastic-free lifestyle⁠
⁠
🗣️talk about the issues!⁠
⁠
👊🏽 influence change - stand up and advocate for the environment⁠
⁠
👚shop sustainably - buy recycled fabrics and clothing rather than fast fashion⁠

  healthy coral reefs are vibrant,colourful and diverse 🐠 

coral reefs that are declining or suffering are less colourful, less diverse and considerably less resilient 🎣

  happy world turtle day 🐢 

technically, today is about marine and terrestrial turtles……but we prefer the salty kind 

there are 7 species of sea turtle in the world! 💦 

the biggest threat to sea turtles is incidental capture/bycatch but fishing vessels 🎣 

coastal developments frantically reduce available nesting habitats for female turtles 🏝 

climate change is skewing the sex ratio, with considerably more females than males now being born.

⁠
but did you know that chromatophores are also responsible for the vibrant pigmentation in fish?⁠
⁠
colour changing in fish acts as a mechanism for camouflage and inter-species communication. colour change in fish is also a great example phenotypic plasticity! ⁠

these incredibly colorful sea slugs can also change their pigmentation like cephalopods, and have a complex arrangement of chromatophores ⁠
⁠
iridiphores are a specialised chromatophore that are iridescent and reflective. iridphores create an optical effect known as rayleigh scattering; rayleigh scattering is responsible for colourful sunsets/sunrises and blue skies ☀️⁠

⁠
cephalopods are admired for their intelligence and beauty. but how do they have such varied pigmentation? ⁠
⁠
chromatophores are specialised cells that produce colour. they are found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods (mammals and birds have melanocytes for coloration) 🐙⁠
⁠
chromatophore cells contain pigment within an enclosed sac. muscular contraction distorts the shape of the pigment-containing-sac, changing the opacity, reflectivity or translucency of the animal.⁠

  international women's day - 8th of march 🌎 

women are increasingly being recognized as more
vulnerable to climate change impacts than men, as they
constitute the majority of the world's poor and are more
dependent on the natural resources which climate change threatens the most.

women and girls are effective and powerful leaders and
change-makers for climate adaptatin and mitigation.
they are involved in sustainability initiatives around the world, and their participation and leadership results in more effective climate action.

coral cay conservation wouldn't be the organisation we are today without the women who have contributed
towards our ambitious conservation goals over the last 36 years. thank you 💙

  earlier this week, the ipcc released its climate change 2022: impacts, adaptation and vulnerability report 🌏 ⁠
⁠
"approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change"🧑🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏻⁠
⁠
"if global warming transiently exceeds 1.5°c in the coming decades or later, then many human and natural systems will face additional severe risks, compared to remaining below 1.5°c "🔥⁠
⁠
ipcc analysis suggests that maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services on a global scale will depend on the effective conservation of approximately 30 - 50% of earths land, freshwater and ocean areas. 🐋⁠
⁠
...currently, 15% of earths land and less than 5.7% of our oceans are protected.... ⁠

  there are 38 known species of moray eel found in the red sea 💦⁠
⁠
moray eels (gymnothorax) are characterised by their large mouths, muscular physiology and numerous teeth. moray eels inhabit tight crevices in coral/rocky areas which limits manoeuvrability when catching prey🐟⁠
⁠
moray eels overcome this issue by using an impressive set of pharyngeal jaws, which they use to pull prey into their gullet. many fish have pharyngeal jaws to help crush food, but the pharyngeal jaw on a moray eel is unique and equipped with a second set of sharp teeth!

  the red sea is home to 3 species of anemonefish, but the most common is by far the red sea anemonefish (amphiprion bicinctus)🐠⁠
⁠
like most anemonefish, it is associated with several anemone species and is never found more than 2m from its host anemone. anemonefish have a symbiotic relationship with their host anemone; the anemonefish provides its host with nutrients (from waste) and protection from predators, whilst the anemone provides shelter 🐠⁠
⁠
the red sea anemonefish is only found in the red sea, the gulf of aden and chagos archipeligo. 🌍⁠
⁠

  sharks - should we be afraid?

for the first time in almost 60 years, a shark has killed a human in nsw, australia. beaches in sydney are now closed and locals are asking for a shark cull...but will this help?🦈

hunting for a particular shark is almost impossible, and rather than improving the situation, it will reinforce the message that sharks pose a risk; making people more afraid.

fatal shark attacks are very rare, but when they happen they receive emotive global media coverage.  shark attacks are incredibly upsetting, but the chances of a shark attack are not as high as you may think.

coral reefs are structurally diverse habitats; they are made up of potentially thousands of species of coral with varying morphologies. ⁠

  surveying coral reefs gives us an image of reef health at that time. we want this 'snapshot' to be as accurate as possible, with as much information as we can get.⁠
⁠
point-intercepts or continuous measurements of benthic cover are traditional methods; these methods rely on diver knowledge and can be time intensive.⁠
⁠
photo-quadrats can be used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of surveys, but photos and videos need to be analysed after dives, and this can take a long time! ⁠

  bleaching is a term often identified with coral reefs, but bleaching isn't isolated to corals 🤡⁠
⁠
anemones are in the same phyla as corals (cnidaria), and like corals they have symbiotic dinoflagellates in their tissue called zooxanthellae 🦠⁠
⁠
when the temperature is too hot, or too far outside the normal range, zooxanthellae are expelled from the anemone. it is the zooxanthellae that give anemones colour, and when they are expelled the tentacles are left white 🌡️☀️⁠

  we've all heard of coral bleaching - but what actually is it and why is it bad?🐟⁠
⁠
if sea water temperatures stay high for a period of time, corals will bleach. it is the symbiotic zooxanthellae within corals that provide them with pigment, and when it gets too hot these symbiotic will be expelled/leave ☀️⁠
⁠
this photo shows a healthy reef on the left; a bleached reef in the middle, and an 'algaeified' reef on the right.⁠
⁠
dead reefs are taken over by algae; nutrient production spikes and the presence and activity of microbes increases. this increased microbial activity reduces available oxygen in the water, reducing the remaining diversity of the reef and making it harder for organisms to survive 🌿⁠

  there are several ways to measure coral cover/coral genus.⁠
⁠
measuring random points, or set interval points along a transect is a traditional way of measuring coral, with divers recording the genus/species of coral onto a slate🐠⁠
⁠
this method can be made faster and more accurate by using cameras and taking standardised photographs ⁠
at points along the transect. similarly to the svs, these images can be analysed on a computer⁠
⁠
quadrats can also be used by divers to record % cover of corals in 1m², as well as photoquads (photographs of quadrats which can later be analysed)⁠

  when it comes to counting fish, things can get a little more complicated...and there are several methods used 🐡⁠
⁠
5m wide belt transects are commonly used for visual surveys of fish, with divers often counting large fish first, and following up with smaller fish such as damsels. divers counting fish will be the first along the transect 🐟⁠
⁠
stereo video surveys are another way to survey fish abundance/size. divers swim along the transect holding a pole with cameras on each end and film the transect. this data is then analysed on computers using software that records the number and size of fish! 📹⁠

  manta tow surveys are a great way to provide a general description of coral reefs and to detect broad changes (e.g. overall increase/decrease of coral bleaching) 🚤⁠
⁠
a surveyor holds on to a rope and is towed behind a boat and makes a recording of what they've observed ⁠
at 2-minute intervals (e.g. crown of thorns starfish or general coral cover) as well as the gps. ⁠
⁠
depending on the speed of the boat, manta tow surveys can cover kilometres of the reef in hours!⁠

  our science development programme is designed to prepare volunteers for survey dives.⁠
⁠
surveys are a snapshot of the reef at a particular time, so the better our understanding of the reef, the better the data 📸⁠
⁠
traditional survey methods are reliant on solid id skills and require divers to write down exactly what they see whilst travelling across a transect. a basic survey team will be split up into sections and measure fish abundance/species, coral cover/genus and impacts/disease along the transect 🐠⁠

  if seagrass, mangroves and salt marshes are such amazing carbon sinks...why are we destroying them?🤨⁠
⁠
40% of the worlds population lives within 100km from the coast, and with our global population rising, coastal areas are more in demand than ever🏄🏿⁠
⁠
🏨hotels and resorts often remove seagrass habitats in order to create white sandy beaches for guests.⁠
⁠
🌴mangroves are cut down for wood/charcoal and coastal developments.⁠
⁠
🐦 salt marsh habitats are removed to make space for coastal developments, and the soil is often disturbed to access peat.⁠

⁠
as well as sequestering huge amounts of carbon, seagrass habitats are also critical habitats and sources of food for marine animals 🐢⁠

  just like mangroves, salt marshes sequester (store) carbon in soil and remove co2 from our atmosphere 🌎⁠
⁠
globally, 50% of our salt marshes have been degraded, and the rest remain threatened 🐦⁠
⁠
carbon is stored at a faster rate in wetlands and salt marshes than in terrestrial grasslands, and when carbon is stored in these natural habitats, the effects of global warming are reduced 🌡️⁠

salt marshes also protect coastal areas from floods and storm surges, and help stabilise soil 🌊⁠

  mangroves store more carbon than tropical rainforests, but cover less than 0.1% of the planets surface. 🌴⁠

they sequester carbon from the air and store it in mineral rich soils, where the carbon stays trapped for thousands of years. it's currently estimated that our mangroves store 10 billion tonnes of carbon globally 🦕⁠
⁠
1-2% of mangroves are being lost annually 😥⁠

🦕 jellyfish have been on this planet for 500 million years, making them the oldest multi-cellular organism alive.⁠
⁠
they have an important ecological role in our oceans as both voracious predators and tasty prey. jellyfish feed on the planktonic larva of commercially important species such as fish and crustaceans, and jellyfish are predated by turtles and sea birds!🐧🐢⁠
⁠
jellyfish have no brain, gills or lungs, and they absorb oxygen directly through their tissue. they can therefore adapt quickly to our changing oceans, and many species are predicted to thrive in our increasingly warm, acidic and polluted oceans 🧠⁠
