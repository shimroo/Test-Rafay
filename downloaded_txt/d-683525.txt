what sets us apart 



your success is
our priority 



we believe strongly in the power of building relationships, not only with the companies we partner with, but the individuals who run them. since our inception in 1998, through our close personal relationships with a range of excellent manufacturers, we’ve cultivated a thorough familiarity with their cabinet collections and the ability to secure special requests on behalf of our clients. 











 































 







 






inside delivery

we save our customers time, money, and manpower by offering inside delivery on local orders. using our own trucks and professionals, we transport, unload, and safely deliver the product inside the site, so that contractors don’t need to be present or spend their time handling delivery.







urban enterprise zone

our office in new jersey isn’t only convenient because of its centralized proximity to the tri-state area – we’re also strategically located within an urban enterprise zone, which means all of our customers pay a reduced sales tax (3.125%) in the state of new jersey.







customer services

we’re proud to have developed a reputation of providing exceptional customer service. we’ll guide you through the best cabinetry options for your project, measure and re-measure your space, and assign a dedicated designer to bring your project to life.
