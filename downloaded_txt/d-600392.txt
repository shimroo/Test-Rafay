						"we did our own internal research to measure the effectiveness of dreambox, with correlational analysis. students that completed more than 100 lessons on dreambox saw an average of 12.43 percentile point growth. number of lessons was directly associated with map growth within our district. it was especially pronounced for our k-2 students."					





a.j. swentoskyexecutive director of educational services, teton county school district #1 






						"the dreambox [reading] student growth data is helpful to not only share with parents, case managers and other colleagues. it’s even more useful to share with students in order to create and track goals throughout the course of the school year."					





mary christoffteacher, hononegah community high school 






						"teachers report that our kids are much more equipped to go into a new grade level when they’ve had not only classroom instruction but also the support of dreambox to further refine the skill development that we’re looking for."
