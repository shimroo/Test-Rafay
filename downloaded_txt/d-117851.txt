letterbox history
today, we have a lot of mailbox options available to us. where did it all start?
in america, free mail delivery began as early as 1863 for cities and towns. it started in 1896 for rural addresses. the first free-standing mail collection box did not come along until 1894. by then, most delivery mailboxes were very utilitarian and made by homeowners themselves. it was not until 1915 that an engineer and postal clerk named roy j. joroleman created the first tunnel-shaped post boxes. even though his basic design has remained a standard, we now have almost too many post-box options to choose from.

amco, european home, blomus, bobi, gaines, architectural, streetscape, and whitehall are some of today’s top residential post box brands. whether you are looking for a classic letterbox or something more contemporary, our experts can help you find what you need. you can also shop online by mailbox brand or by type.

wall mount mailboxes
