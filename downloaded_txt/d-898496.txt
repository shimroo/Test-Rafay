yay! yet another layout! i htink i need to join a layout-whore club or something. i'll probably change it again soon as well. something about it dosn't quit sit well. if anyone could take a look at it and comment that would be great :)apart from that i got back from outward bound on thursday. it was alright but i didn't overly enjoy it. i don't know whether it's because i'm prissy or because i found some people in my group annoying. for me ten days with the same people is waaaaaaay too much. i also hate having dirty hands. so, yes, it was frustrating most of the time.adrian was mentioned a lot. like, everyone at school knows about my little *cough* crush. hehehe, it was so funny. for some reason we were talking about people with big hands, then jess w said something like "youknow who has big hands..." and then she stopped because, well, anytime his name was mentioned i'd strat going on and on and on. but i so knew what she was going to say so i just looked at her a burst out laughing. and that was one of those "you had to be there moments."i also got to know the new girl chloe pretty well which was good. she's just arrived from karratha and she was only at school for four days before we went on outward bound. my admiration for michelle also grew because all throughout it she was so happy and cheerful. i htink i might beciome a christian. i also found out that brodie (the guy i went to the ball with) is an arrogant asshole. this gives me every reason to say "no way." when my mum asks me when if i'm going to go out with him.which brings me onto another subject. i have been talking to joel someone on msn and he asked me to go to the movies. well, not straight out, but he's like "if you're not going to the movie marathon can you tell me because then me and you can go see the ring2." porblem is i don't reeeaaally know who he is, even thought he goes ot my school. i htink my excuse will be "i heard it's pretty gay." which is actually true because caitlin ((</span>pumpkinpasties</span> ) said it was pretty boringother than that, eod is going well. i've got to get in touch with rei and see if she still wants the job as an admin. jeez, i havn't talked to her for months. i'm also thinking about having another charrie, i'm thinking hufflepuff 3rd year with mika boorem as a pb. but i want to make her some special power or something, though at the moment i'm not sure what. if anyone's got any ideas, please comment ^^one last thing. i have a bump developing between my eyebrows and it hurts, but it's not a pimple. it's like the crap is too far under the skin for it to be one. so i tried to squeeze it and it hurt, so now i've got a glob of toothpaste on my forehead. also, who thinks i should make this a friends only journal?

i'm a sucker. i said i was over adrian when i'm not. i'm far from it. it shits me something terrible. like, i'm away for five days so i htink "no longer thank god.". but then i get back to school and it starts again.</p>
other than that luke got his hair cut to a number three. i've been telling him to shave it and raise money but i suppose it wouldn't work as he's already got cancer. but with his new haircut you can really see it's falling out. there aren't any major bald patches, but it's really thin.
mum got a mole cut out of her arm and they sent it off to the lab. she got five stitches. she has also been oddly happy.
it's my school ball tomorrow. i'm slightly nervous, for the fact that i'm taking two partners. and before you scream s.l.u.t! i'm only taking the second because his friend wants him to come and he needed me to invite him. really, in my heart (lol) i'm going with brodie who is really sweet (and has hair like ron! xd)
and yay! i made icons! all emily browning, coz she's cool.

meg -
i loveth raph
adrian (who will never read this) -
i'm over you
mum -
i loveth you
luke -
i wish you'd actually drink the amount of water your supposed to instead of keeping yourself sick, which means mum has to look after you. and i know i'm a sad,twisted,bitter,spoilt,stuck-up little bitch for saying that.

w00t! new layout. 'tis a bit autumn like i know and it's still summer where i am, but i do love coldplay and so stuff it. plus i had inspiration. it came form kayleena of  hogwartsirt.com . it came from one of the super-sweet icons she made so credit goes to her. you can see the icons if you go to the index page and scroll down.
anyways, my day today was good. i actually spent it away from my computer -le gasp- and spent it at my friend temily's house; we had a sleepover last night. we painted this little room inside her shed and made it into a proper hangout place which is pretty cool. her little sis jess also had gotten a puppy two days before so i gave it lots of cuddles. tis so cute cept it's name is gus o_o
so my day was pretty good. then i get home and mum's in a shit coz luke's in hspital. i accidently drop an olive on the tabel while we're having tea and she starts yelling at me telling me to be more grown up. so i fucking walk out coz i don't want her shit. when i come back she tells me that they don't even expect luke to live two years. yeh well thanks for fucking telling me this before you prudent bitch!
so yes, good good times.

you know, i'll admit it. it's been a long time since i actually -enjoyed- doing a thread. for the last few months i've been feeling as though it was mor eof a responsibility then anything else. but since i've been rping with meg and em i've started to enjoy it again. their character are crazy and so damn loveable lol. i've also got characters i like. dreamer imogen and slutty blythe. by the way, i'm loving the name imogen right now. and taht's all i can be bothered writing right now. i need ot make a new layout though. this one is so old and boring.
