the mountain rose inn has officially closed.
we wanted to thank all of you for your patronage and support for the past 26 years. we have made many dear friends through meeting all of you and each of you have touched our lives. we wish you all the best on your future travels and hope that you remember us with a smile, as we do you.
it has truly been our pleasure.
your innkeepers,
amy & joshua mitcham
and the owners, karen rhodes and the wolcott family.
 
 
a romantic getaway on 100 acres in beautiful southwest virginia.
 
take a step back in time when you stay at the mountain rose inn.  owned by the same family since 1968 with historic touches and heirlooms of the original builder, joe dehart. 
close to the blue ridge parkway, between the towns of stuart and floyd, the mountain rose inn is a hidden gem off of charity highway (rt. 40).
let each morning begin with a three course gourmet breakfast, scenic views on 3 balconies surrounding the home and rock castle creek flowing just past the iconic boxwood hedges.  
just look for signs to direct you around the grounds from american sign letters.
relax.  unwind.  recover.

don't forget your swimsuits!  our solar-heated pool is open in the spring and summer!  

relax and take a dip while enjoying the summer sun!
make sure to pack your food and drinks. bring your special drink glasses site back and have a great time.
bring all your lawn games as well!

in the fall, our pool will close, but we'll still have bonfires and s'mores for your enjoyment!

a note to our guests:
we do have limited cell service due to being in the mountains.  if you need to reach someone during your stay, we are happy to let you use our landline.  
we would also like to note that because we are a romantic, quiet getaway for many of our guests, we do not allow children under 12 years old to stay at the inn - with the exception of when the entire inn is rented as a group.  we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
