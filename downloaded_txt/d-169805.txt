animal omnibus



 
welcome to the animal omnibus
the animal omnibus began 
  as part of the website of the city of birmingham zoo in birmingham, alabama. 
  the staff of the zoo believed in the importance of education as part of the 
  mission of the zoo. sadly, the zoo went private on september 1, 1999 and making 
  money became the only thing of importance at the "new birmingham zoo." 
  therefore, this site today is totally independent and separate from the birmingham 
  zoo. if you have a web site with animal information and want to be included 
  in the animal omnibus, drop a note to webmaster.
