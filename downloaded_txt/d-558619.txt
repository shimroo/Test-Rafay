"the people of eritrea will
      always make you feel welcome and the country will always provide a
      diversity of activities and experiences that will have you wanting to come
      back for more."
"asmara is, by any standards, a
      very safe, picturesque and relaxed capital. "
eritrea - the bradt travel
      guide
"constructed almost
      entirely between 1936 and 1941, asmara was effectively a blank canvas on
      which its italian colonizers were able to design and build their own urban
      utopia in east africa...... owing to asmara's relative obscurity and
      distance from europe, the architects and engineers who came to practice
      there could escape the constraints imposed on their activities in the more
      conservative european environment, making it an even more exceptional
      city"asmara
      - africa's secret modernist city
