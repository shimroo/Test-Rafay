 artist of the blue ridge    


 

  teresa pennington is a self-taught colored pencil artist with a talent she says is god-given. often spending as much as four months on one drawing, she meticulously renders the scenery, landmarks, flora and fauna of western north carolina with an emphasis on the blue ridge parkway.
 teresa has been commissioned by the biltmore estate and has completed four series of drawings capturing the grandeur of the house and gardens. the newest biltmore rendering is the first drawing in the st nicholas series. other scenes she has captured include grandfather mountain, cold mountain, and mabry mill, one of the most photographed features on the blue ridge parkway (mile marker 176)
 she records the large and small, with a tender regard for the details of chickadees and hummingbirds, as well as orchids and fruit.
 welcome to her online gallery, and feel free to explore all the images here.
