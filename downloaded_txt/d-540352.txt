"i
know my harp as my best friend and confidante...for me, the passion and
emotion of living is accessible through music...i hope that my
harp music holds you in its heart." (michelle)
"michelle
sell's harp stands out amongst a sea of...harpists!"
(billboard magazine)
"i
felt a
little embarrassed asking you to play at our little wedding
when
you have played at so many impressive events.
after talking to
other harpists, we really wanted to go with you because you truly
cared about making our day special...i had a good feeling after
talking to you...!" (thuan t)








"heavenly
harp: no musical
theater score uses the harp

more imaginatively than the orchestrations by robert russell bennett
for south pacific.

harpist michelle sell is playing the glorious
glissandos..."

 (john
fleming, st. petersburg times performing arts critic)













michelle
is a professional event harpist based in the san francisco bay area of
northern california, performing weddings, wedding
receptions, special events; concerts
and theater; and recording albums
throughout
the united states. she also maintains a harp teaching and sonic therapy
practice in marin county, ca. in addition to san
francisco and marin, michelle's local bay area venues encompass
alameda, contra costa, san mateo, santa clara, solano, and wine country
counties napa and sonoma.


                                   
michelle
enjoys an
extremely active career as an acclaimed harpist.
since 1977,
michelle has played thousands of professional
engagements. she
has performed for the queen and king of thailand, the grand duke
and duchess of luxembourg, former president jimmy carter, academy
award winning director francis ford coppola, rock legend sammy
hagar, and former sf 49'er quarterback steve young.

                                   

although
michelle is
an alumna and former faculty member of san
francisco conservatory of music, where she studied classical
music with marcella decray, she is also an award winning "pops" and
jazz harpist. her instrumental styles are diverse and extensive,
ranging from bach to cole porter; rock to new age. michelle is also a
composer for omni music
in new york. her original music compositions have been used on television, radio, and in
motion pictures. she has worked with big bands, vocalists,
instrumentalists, and recording artists, including, among many others:
frank sinatra, sr., ann margaret, k.d.lang, tony bennett, tom jones,
gladys knight and the pips, the temptations, juliet prowse, rudolf
nureyev, linda ronstadt, stevie nicks, sheryl crow, norton buffalo,
joni mitchell, trisha yearwood, and henry mancini. she was casted as
the wedding harpist in the sony pictures' movie, "rent." 
                                    
whether
it be wedding music
for your ceremony, wedding music for your reception, or wedding music
for your rehearsal dinner, michelle can provide harp music as a solo
harpist, or accompanied by flute, cello, or violin duet or ensemble
musicians. tailored to the event, classical flute
or violin and harp are beautiful accompaniments for your ceremony or
other event, while soprano saxophone and harp are fabulous for your
lively, "jazzy" wedding reception.
most
recently, michelle has been working on harp and violin duets with
wieslaw pogorzelski, an amazing musician, composer, and music producer.
his performing credits include assistant principal viola with the
warsaw philharmonic, the san francisco symphony and the san francisco
opera. mr. pogorzelski is the co-founder of the new century chamber
orchestra and stratos. he received his masters degree from the warsaw
academy of music and continued postgraduate studies at indiana and
boston universities. a few of their sample mp3s can be found here.

whatever
music you require - whether it be wedding music, or event music for a
fund raiser, event music for a reception, event music for a birthday
party, event music for a retirement party, harp music for a memorial
service or funeral service, even harp music for a simple afternoon tea
or holiday affair - michelle can provide the event's musical
accompaniment. many more samples are here.

                                    
for
outdoor weddings & other private or public engagements,
michelle frequently uses a camac
electro-acoustic harp. every string on this harp has a pickup
or small microphone. this allows the harp to be heard clearly in venues
seating 500 people or, in contrast, at venues with just a few people.
it can he heard as an intimate background instrument. at large venues
and at outdoor functions, a traditional acoustic harp may be difficult
to hear if not amplified. michelle believes that her clients are
entitled to professionalism, punctuality, courtesy, and above all, the
ability to hear the music for which they are paying. there is no extra
charge for using the camac electro-acoustic harp and its amplification
system.

                                


 for
over
twenty years, michelle has been teaching harp
to students ranging from kindergarten through adult; from beginning to
advanced.
she is an alumna and former faculty member of he san
francisco conservatory of music. if you are seeking a harp
teacher for any area of harp study, whether it be classical, pop, jazz,
or
composition, michelle welcomes your interest. she gives individual harp lessons
in her private studio in marin county, california.
