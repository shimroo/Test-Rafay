new on the wj & cei site



            january 25, 2025 - a recent update to the watkins-johnson and cei board and asssembly index now includes the major circuit boards from the dsp receiver line which includes the hf-1000a, wj-8710, wj-8711, wj-8712, wj-8721 and wj-8723. this is to help indentify raw circuit boards and subassemblies that may be found at surplus outlets, hamfests and other places or to help with people who are piecing together a radio from parts..
the current version of this spreadsheet can be downloaded from the wj & cei document index page under "misc technical information."



            january 13, 2025 - the index of different variations in the watkins-johnson dsp receiver family is regularly being updated as information flows in. these radios include the hf-1000, wj-8710, wj-8711, wj-8712, wj-8721 and wj-8723 and all the dash numbers and variants.
if own one of these receivers and are willing to pop the top cover and read the numbers from u1, u12, u37, u56 on the controller board, and the printed circuit boards numbers, your contribution will be much appreciated. if that is too much and you own a wj-8711 or wj-8712p, simply reading the firmware number(s) on boot up and the model & serial number from the back panel would be helpful.
the current version of this spreadsheet can be downloaded from the wj & cei document index page under "option lists."

january 23, 2022 -  - in 2016, a chapter i wrote on the life of wj   founder dick johnson was published in the national academy of   engineering's memorial tributes book series. 
dick johnson partnered with dean watkins to form   watkins-johnson in 1957. in 1967 they purchased communication   electronics, inc and financed the building of the gaitherburg facility   for their new division. most of the radios covered on this website were   made by this division.
links to this chapter can be found on the my publications page. 



              january 21, 2022 - a full scan of the (1988-1989 watkins-johnson rf and microwave components catalog has been buried on this site along time. it has been added to the master document index to make it easier to find.
be sure to check out the data sheet for the wj-g1, which contains a running joke on phase of the moon that persisted in the catalog over a number of years. (p. 421 or pdf p. 407)
this catalog can be downloaded from the wj & cei document index page



january 10, 2022 - a scan of a photocopied manual for the wj-9188a-18, the companion signal monitor for the wj-8716 & wj-8718 series of receivers. can be used with other receivers having a 455 khz if frequency. this manual is not suitable for troubleshooting the half rack width wj-9188a which has completely different circuitry.
this manual can be downloaded from the wj & cei document index page



december 27, 2021 -  twelve data sheets have been added covering most of the 300 series of early radios that communication electronics, inc designed and built prior to and shortly after their acquisition by watkins-johnson. these radios covered hf, lf, vlf and elf.
these data sheets cover the 301a, 301a-1, 302, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 371a, 373a and 377a radios.
many of these were wideband receivers intended for rfi testing, tempest and subcarrier intercept. the notable except is the 357 which most often came with the narrow bandwidths one would expect for receivers in these frequency ranges. not included is the developmental data sheet for the 358 receiver, which when finally developed was sold as the dms-105 demodulator.
these data sheets can be downloaded from the wj & cei document index page



              december 14, 2021 - twelve data sheets have been added covering most of the 500 series of early radios that communication electronics, inc designed and built prior to and shortly after their acquisition by watkins-johnson.
these data sheets cover the 501, 501a, 504, 504a, 519, 521a, 521a-1, 555, 560, 565a, 595 and 601a radios made with both cei and wj name plates.
the earliest versions of the 501 receiver had rounded meters like the pictures of the 701 and 901 and data sheets listed below. meter and knob types changed unpredictably depending on the size of an order and the amount of  inventory in stock. other than initial radios being made with rounded meters and gray knobs, there is no linear sequence, no direct correlation between appearance and date of production.
these data sheets can be downloaded from the wj & cei document index page



december 13, 2021 - ten data sheets have been added covering most of the early communication electronics, inc 700 series of uhf receivers. these radios have excellent sensitivity, competitive with many modern radios and fare better than most sdrs, doing so with nuvistors and ceramic planar tubes.

november 28, 2021 - the wj-8809a microwave receiving system extended the miniceptor concept into microwave reception. covering 0.1 to 18.5 ghz in a small package with low power usage was quite an accomplishment in 1993.
the data sheet for this radio is now available for download from the wj & cei document index page


november 27, 2021 - the wj-8969 microwave receiver came in three types. the wj-8969 was designed and built in gaithersburg. the project was then moved to san jose which redesigned it as the wj-8969b and wj-8969c. thee data sheets for all three versions of these radios have now been uploaded.
these data sheets can be downloaded for free from the wj & cei document index page


november 24, 2021 - the wj-9548  demodulator was the last and best of a long line of demods made by wj. full of dsps and ups, it was available with many different options. introduced in 1989, it did not appear in any catalog until 1997. after a trade show, engineers hooked a wj-9548 to an antenna and, while tuning around on shortwave, realized the 9548 contained the nucleus of a potentially new kind of radio, a revelation that led to the wj-8711.
the manual and data sheet are now available for download from the wj & cei document index page



            november 22, 2021 - three additional manuals for the (in)famous rs-111 series of cei and wj receivers. there's a full rs-111-1b-2 manual. in addition, two supplements,  the rs-111-1b-17 and  the rs-111-1b-26. both of the supplements were appended to the stock rs-111-1b-12 manual which is already available from this site. these manuals offer enough to service almost any rs-111. the rs-111-1b-2 manual covers the main parts of the earliest radios. the rs-111-1b-7 covers the main parts of versions from -7 to -11. the rs-111-1b-12 manual cover the main parts of all the versions from -12 on. the two supplements show how relatively minor the tweaks usually are.
            these are now available for download from the wj & cei document index page



november 9, 2021 - here's a complete manual for the wj-9026 and wj-9028 vhf/uhf receivers, all 600+ pages in a huge file. a popular radio with 30-1000 mhz coverage including a spectrum display and digital frequency readout in a 3u package, the same form factor as the fabled rs-111. the wj-9028 is a re-engineered version of the wj-9026, primarily for higher intercept points. the fcc was a major customer. the wj-9028 also sold in the netherlands, israel and as the wj-8734 in germany. this manual also may be of use for working on the wj-8735, wj-8736, wj-8737 and wj-8738 radios.
the manual is now available for download from the wj & cei document index page

please help - documents sought for research



do you have or know where to find newsletters, annual reports, sales literature and other documents from black radio manufacturers?

newsletters are incredible historical resources.
if you have documents like these please contact me.

until the company dissolved..



                  an employee published newsletter from  wj gaithersburg.



                  i  seek annual reports from cei and other companies.




  short-lived publication from wj gaitherburg.  well done and containing good historical information on this plant's work.



                if you have documents like these, i only need good scans or photocopies for my research. please contact me.
