database, information
about & images of polish film posters



























 this site covers the work of 426 known designers of 7163 film posters with 4229 uploaded images (so far). it contains a database of polish film posters and a number of browsable sections, as shown on the navigation bar above and as described below.
as much as i'd like to (eventually) provide
all available information on all polish film posters ever
printed and every artist who ever designed one, my emphasis is on the best period of the mid 50s to early 70s. polish film posters practically ceased
to exist at the end of the 80s, having been replaced by standard issue foreign ads. all these are absent from the database. the site is about posters rather than films, so my primary concern is to provide the most complete
information available on each individual poster : its designer,
date, existing versions and variations, circulation, rarity and
value. i also tried to identify original films and find basic info for each title.
the most valuable information comes from the
poster itself. while there are some variations in actors' or
director's names spelling - especially in the earlier works -
the artist's signature, date and circulation numbers are indisputable.
if there are no such markings (or a poster to read it from),
a variety of sources often made identification possible.
first in importance are "roczniki filmowe" ('film annuals')
: an erstwhile monthly polish trade publication that dealt
with all films entering distribution. apart from actors' photos and reviews of upcoming premieres, it often also showed (or at
least named the designers of) posters for them. the only unreliable
aspect was the sometimes-inflated, intended poster circulation,
usually greatly reduced in actual printing.
posters could also be dated by censor
codes - a series of numbers printed at the (usually) bottom edge - very reliable method if applied to the nowogrodzka 64-a (warsaw) printing house output, but useless with others (lublin, gdansk, kielce). then there are various albums and show fliers, official artist biographies, etc. etc.
still, authors of 168 posters remain unidentified (listed in database as "unk"(-nown), and 45 others (pre-war) as "anonymous". some more are missing such basic data as the country of film production (7), year
(2) and original film title. another 23 are dated by approximation.

 site map :





- database


: search fields are : artist's name, poster (=polish film) title, original film title & country, poster date (usually same as polish film release date) , original film release date, director, cast, poster size and type of print, circulation, price, producers and additional remarks.


    

- artists
   

	  : start with the full list of all 424 names showing the artist's
creative period and a number of film posters designed. there
are lists for a particular decade ("50s", 



 "60s",







      etc.) and "available images". i have also included
      highly subjective "classic" 



and "undervalued" 




      categories. since the work of many poster designers spanned several
      decades, you'll find some names repeated.

each name is linked to a corresponding individual poster pages page containing a brief cv and a table of all authored posters, grouped by the year of the poster's design (not the movie release date) & polish title (with original film title if a well-known classic). the third column lists size, signature info (if any) and the country where the film was produced / film's original language. titles in bold type are available for
sale / trade.







from there, further links lead to biographical page containing a brief cv and a table of all authored posters with pictures and additional information (exact size, circulation, value of poster + original film title,
producer, director, actors and the year of original film release).


if more than two images by a particular artist
are available, the "bio" page has a link to an individual "gallery" of all available images of posters designed by that artist, all linked back to their separate pages.




- gallery


: pages are divided by years, decades
(with groups of posters by different artists from a given period),
as well as "classic" and "undervalued" categories.
the yearly section ("1956", 



 "1963", 



 etc.)
could be a good place to see the trends for a particular time.
the decade sections ("50s", "60s", etc.)
are more of a 'best of' presentation. the "classic"
is the 'best of the best' and "undervalued" is a self-explanatory,
albeit highly subjective category.




- country


: for films from a particular country, or - in case of coproductions
(especially of frequent french / italian) - the film's original
language




- theme


 section might appear a bit whimsical with subsections like
'fear' ,



 'love' 



 and 'dream' 



but it also has 'erotica'..








- genre
: drama

polish poster design overview :
a lot of patronizing drivel had been written
about the 'polish school' of poster design being a 'product'
of a 'resistance to communism' or some such (and by extension,
of an overwhelming desire to breathe free under learned guidance of a drumpfster and first ladyboy melanie, leaders of the free world). that view, espoused by western
writers who don't know any better, and polish ones (who should
know better) has been more or less omnipresent. no matter that the
idea of art as an expression of political circumstance is par
excellence a classic communist one.
in fact, quite the opposite seemed to happen
: free from commercial stranglehold, these artists produced brilliant
works over an extended period of time. a lot of talented people
found themselves in the right place at the right time. like any
artistic movement (or 'school'), it had its own dynamics, peaks
and valleys. indeed, some of the most accomplished works were
political (pro-socialist). and now the fact that polish film
poster is dead (and had been so since shortly after 1989
 when "freedom dawned", and more to the point, film distribution was privatized) is further evidence of that.


the censorship debate seems irrelevant; aside from some agitprop films, it's hard to argue that the men with scissors had much to concern themselves with. one exception was the 1948 to 1954-55 period, when actual presentation mattered and "modernistic" style was frowned upon; even then however "social-realist" images were few and far between.the results this hands-off policy produced were often brilliant, sometimes dreary and self-indulgent, often mediocre, but seldom boring and - as a rule - deeply personal.
the uniqueness of polish film posters (and to a lesser degree,
      theatrical ones) lied in the fact that for 3 decades the artists
      controlled the content and form of an ad. it allowed unprecedented
      freedom of expression, created new sensibilities and divorced
      the medium from immediate and often depressing concerns of their
      western counterparts : who gets the top billing, what font is
      approved and which side of johnnie the star's face
      is better than the other. it might have well been the longest
      period in modern commercial art history that the keepers gave
      away the key (albeit in a limited and marginal market), with consequences even now.
the essence of polish poster school was a desire to create a graphical synthetic view of an idea expressed by the advertised event. waldemar swierzy summed it up so : "here's how i understand the idea of ââthe poster: ... the theatrical poster has to be a synthesis of two hours, because it can not be told as in the theater, where we have the two hours sitting in comfort in the warmth. the poster is looked at in the passing, in the rain, in winter at the bus stop, in the crowd, so it must be only a signal, suggestive character for the passer-by to register.."



the golden decade of polish film posters,
from approximately the mid 50s to the mid 60s was preceded by
the pioneering work of a trio of artists in the 1940s. 

henryk tomaszewski, 

tadeusz trepkowski
and 

eryk lipinski
 

were the original graphic designers commissioned in 1946 by film polski (a state film distribution monopoly) to design film posters. their work soon revolutionized this particular form of advertising. 
rather than use the stereotypical images of movie stars and exclamation points, they employed a whole new arsenal of graphic interpretation to convey a shorthand essence of the film. two terrific early 
(1948)     
 examples are : 

tomaszewski' citizen kane
 and 

ostatni etap
 by trepkowski.



in 1948 the political climate changed, social realism was introduced and other styles were severely restricted.
few works from the 1949
-1953

period retained the high standards established earlier. in the meantime though, more designers were drawn to the field : wojciech fangor, waldemar swierzy, jan lenica,
jerzy treutler, roman cieslewicz, wiktor gorka, jan mlodozeniec,
julian palka, franciszek starowieyski, jozef mroszczak, wojciech
zamecznik - to mention the absolutely essential names. 

by 1955


the stalinist policies were history and - with the restrictions gone - the field exploded with brilliant, classic works.




the golden period extended until 1965,
 more or less. designs from the late 60s, while by no means regressing
to the corporate hack of hollywood, generally lack the freshness
and boldness of the earlier pieces. at the same time, the variety
of styles widened. many new designers brought with them their
own vision, spanning the spectrum from the lyrical impressionistic
style of maria ihnatowicz, to the pop designs of andrzej krajewski;
from the cyberpunk montages of ryszard kiwerski and maciej raducki,
to minimalistic expressions of bronislaw zelek and mieczyslaw
wasilewski.
in the mid-70s to mid-80s, the "polish
school" of poster design was suffering from atrophy of fresh
ideas. apart from the works of few artists who basically continued
the previous trends, most posters from that period seem uninspired.
in the 80s, the designs became politicized, with hardly any new
designers entering the field. some interesting trends emerged,
signified by some works of stasys eidrigevicius and wieslaw walkuski,
but overall quality of designs went rapidly downhill.





then came 1990
 and the state monopoly ended.
suddenly the distribution of movies in poland was taken over
by warner, paramount, etc., and the polish poster as we knew
it ceased to exist. nowadays, most films are released with the
same sort of ad display as in the us - essentially a photo montage
of stars with approved typeface. very few designers try to continue
their work, rarely issuing a very limited series of posters (300
to 500). these are never displayed on the streets but are sold
in galleries.
the way it worked
money not usually being their main consideration*, the artists strove to show off and the pool of talent was large enough to assure artistic quality. of the 7000 + polish film posters, at least a quarter could be described as very good, "awesome", 'cool' or whatever the vernacular of the times. indeed the overall standard (despite some duds from the 70s and 80s) was consistently high.
   * the economy of the field in socialist poland is a subject for another article. it will not be too gross a simplification to say that poster artists, while well paid, could not hope to get rich by producing more, since commissions were divided more or less equally. posters provided recognition leading to other work, making quantity less important.
the established designers who had the first pick of titles
      were constantly nipped at knees by young upstarts who delighted
      in the opportunity for their work to be showcased in public places
      all over the country. the seniors were accomplished enough to command artistic respect though. the process was self-policing and here's how zuzanna lipinska - daughter of eryk, one of the founding fathers of the movement - described it :

"i worked as poster designer in poland in the early seventies,
      mainly designing film and theatre posters. to become a film poster
      designer as a young art graduate, you had to become a member
      of the artist union, to start with. then get your name on the
      list of potential designers and attend the screenings of the
      films, before they were released. after each screening, you put
      your name down on the list of people who saw the film, and then
      mister rog, who was responsible for giving commissions, would
      choose the designer."
"the designer would be given a set of films stills. obviously
      american, french and italian films were more popular and the
      screenings were crowded. if the film was very well known, the
      commission was given to a well known designer, even without him
      having to attend the screening. we, young unknown artists, were
      left with bulgarian, romanian and similar films, but every opportunity
      to design a film poster was thrilling."
"we had 2 weeks to do it. posters were produced in 1:1
      scale. in most cases the lettering was done by hand."
"so once the poster was done, it was presented in front
      of the panel of 4-6 well known poster designers and they would
      either accept it or reject it. sometimes they would give a "distinction"
      if the poster was very good - which meant an additional 50% on
      your fee. a fee for poster design was just below a monthly average
      salary in poland, so it was quite good."
"sometimes they would ask for some corrections and changes.
      sometimes they would reject it all together. all this was necessary
      to assure a high level of the design. if it was totally rejected,
      a new project was presented in a week."
"in case of polish films, the directors often would choose
      a designer themselves to do the poster, and they had the final
      word."
"posters were mounted or done directly on a stiff background,
      so they could be displayed in front of the judging panel. each
      designer was given 10 copies of the printed poster. i am talking
      here about late 60s - early 70s - afterwards things were different."

despite the plurality of styles the posters shared a common characteristic : rather than ads they were a variation on a theme, an interpretation, a commentary. as an ironic reaction of sorts to so many 'arty' designs, there was even a short-lived, tongue-in-cheek trend with
      posters deliberately stylized to resemble hollywood playbills.
it is hard to speculate whether this form of advertisement
      was more effective than the garden-variety kind. for one, no
      pressure existed for the exclusive state distributor to push one film over
      another. the system worked by word of mouth and the typical blockbusters
      (westerns and swashbuckling capers in the 60s, big war movies
      of the 70s, action thrillers of the 80s) would find their clientele
      no matter what the poster looked like. many posters for the likes
      of "guns of navarone" were quite pedestrian; or ironic,
      as befitting a serious artist in need of a challenge presented
      by more sophisticated films or, perversely, by unwatchable ones.
      in fact, the best posters were often for very obscure titles.
of course, "2001", "the birds", the
      whole westerns collection, could suggest otherwise,
      but in the end it wouldn't matter. selling or not, it was not
      the main concern. it is arguable whether "the cabaret" would
      have a bigger audience if it was advertised with lisa's 2 legs
      instead of four, or if the fact that the film was a huge hit
      had anything to do with any promotion or lack thereof. 
      there was one exception though : the horrors. while pretty tame
      by today's "centipede" standards, they were a novelty
      then and the posters reflect the fascination. some designs for
      the genre by krajewski, kiwerski, zelek and karczewska would
      fit on the streets of then-new york as well as warsaw.

.. nowadays..
for a medium increasingly divorced from street presence, polish
      posters enjoy an unexpected following lately and are being
      rediscovered in strange ways.  on this (rather serious) site, there are more hits from art blogs than from anywhere else. one such net article: "50 incredible film posters from poland" might have done more to popularize the subject than any show in moma. then there's a blog which lets you design your own polish movie poster, with the added benefit of hilarious machine translation.
      another challenges the viewer to "match the polish poster with the film" and comes complete with priceless comment section. as long as the kids are having fun with them, they live..
the images
i included first are of (subjectively) the best posters, even
if by more obscure artists. the 50s through the early 70s figure
most prominently here. worth seeing are works by many lesser-known
artists, who nevertheless deserve much better recognition. check
out the undervalued link in "gallery" for some wonderful surprises.

 prices :
price / value info (at individual poster
pages) has been compiled from many commercial galleries &
auction results for each individual title. some posters (especially
indicated in bold print) are available for
sale / exchange by individual enquiry.
"recent price" : most current offering

"value" : subjective evaluation
based on collector value (artwork, rarity, particular interest,
prevailing prices of similar works by the same artist, film status,
etc.)
"+" indicates rising value
polish posters didn't fare too well in the
west. due to lack of commercial interest in the early period,
these works were virtually unknown outside of poland. most were
released in small, 3000 to 12000 first runs (4200 - 8000 average),
with only a few ever seeing additional printings. the great majority
were used for actual advertising and very few found their way
to private collections. there was no way of buying these works
anyway; they had to be obtained from a friendly theater manager
(or a guy who'd put them up on public billboards).
as a result, most are extremely hard to find.
i personally know of no more than 40 large private collections
worldwide, mainly in the us, poland, japan, uk, the netherlands,
germany, switzerland and france. paradoxically, the rarity makes
them wonderful collectibles : cheap because not well-known, yet
with prices nowhere to go but up. there is no surplus of these
classical works in poland or anywhere else in the world.
prices vary from $100 - 250 (inexpensive,
mostly 70s and 80s posters), to $250-500 (moderate, 60s and some
50s works of the better-known designers), $500-1000 (expensive,
well-known pieces of very well-known designers), $1000-7500+
(the best-known, rare individual titles). in each category there
is enormous growth potential. most polish film posters remain
on the cutting edge of poster design even now, and are not just
nostalgia pieces.
the best works should reach the $10 k range
within a decade, and an average price may easily quadruple. right
now, they are still a bargain : at a 4-8-98 sotheby's auction,
a swierzy "midnight cowboy" poster sold for $690, well
below its replacement value of $1800-2200. a fall 1999 christie's
london auction brought £450 ($900 ) for anczykowski's "kanal"
poster, listed at $2000 by a new york commercial gallery in 2003.
these works are in the "expensive" category. a gallery
in england lists zelek's "ptaki" ('the birds")
1963 poster at £1500 ($2900+), and in ny it could be had
for $ 3500. ditto janiszewski's "moulin rouge" 1955
poster ($4500), and swierzy' "sunset boulevard" ($7500+).
these are exceptions. the bulk of polish
film posters are sold by commercial galleries in the $150 - 350
range. check out links for
a list of some such establishments. most of these vendors are
not well versed in the subject. on the many dealers' internet
sites spelling mistakes are the rule, posters are misdated and
presented "all over the place", without any chronological,
thematic or logical order. many (especially us) collectors seek
their favourite movies and/or stars, which explains sometimes
wildly diverse prices. as an example, a wonderful 1958 a1 size
reissue of 1948 "ostatni etap" trepkowski poster lists
anywhere from $800 to $2600, depending on the knowledge (or lack
thereof) of the gallery appraiser. it should be worth at least
$4000 within several years.
 collecting tips / things to avoid :
1. stick to the golden age (mid 50s to late
60s / early 70s) and pick a favourite designer(s) or a theme.
some artists continued their best efforts well into the 70s and
beyond, but generally : late 60s seem tired, 70s - flat and uninspired,
80s - repetitive and boring and the 90s nailed the coffin shut.
anything pre 1955 will be worth having, if only for serious trades.
2. almost all collectible pieces are in the
a1 format. some of the 40s original well-known b1-size classics
have been reprinted in a1 in the 50s, and these second runs are
actually more valuable. the format switch occurred again at the
end of the 70s, and - almost without exception - all the 80s
and 90s posters are b1. it'll be years before the (very) few
of these will gain real value - now they are just wallpaper.
3. in the 80s, the matte paper on which most
earlier posters have been printed was substituted with cheap
glossy stock reminiscent of the western "movie posters".
also, there was a logo switch, from the earlier "cwf"
to "poltel". stay away !
4. in addition to the above no-no's, a presence
of english, french or german titles (sometimes coupled with the
absence of polish ones) is an indication that the poster was
intended as a promo for foreign release, usually in the 80s,
always in the b1 format. these posters are generally much less
valuable than the polish originals.

... and bargains :
almost anything by the following artists
is very likely to be a bargain : baranowska,
bochen, bodnar,
butenko, cherka,
dabrowski, m.
heidrich, janczewska, janiszewski,
jaworowski, karczewska,
kiwerski, koscielniak,
krajewski, mann,
niklewska, srokowski,
stryjecki, syska,
szaybo, wasilewski,
zagorski and zbikowski.
even the works of such well-known names as
baczewska, flisak,
gorka, hibner,
hilscher, huskowska,
ihnatowicz, lipinski,
mlodozeniec, opalka,
stachurski, swierzy,
treutler, wenzel,
st. zamecznik, w.
zamecznik and zelek tend to
be very undervalued (apart from a few individual pieces).
about the only posters realizing their full
value now are the posters of cieslewicz,
fangor, gronowski,
lenica, j.
mroszczak, palka, starowieyski,
tomaszewski and trepkowski.
 sizes :
many posters, especially before 1954 and
after 1980 were issued in the b1 (26.4" x 38.4" = 67
x 97.5 cm) format, as opposed to the standard a1 (23" x
33" = 58.5 x 84 cm) size. as the latter is easier to manage
and most of the best works were issued in a1 anyhow ( even some
reissues of the original b1 posters, such as "citizen kane"
or "ostatni etap"), they usually command higher prices.
during the "golden age" of 1955-1965 , virtually all
posters were released in the a1 format, with occasional a2 (16"
x 23" = 40.5 x 58.5 cm) and b2 (19.2" x 26.4"
= 48.8 x 67 cm) versions.
there were also some oddball sizes, such
as narrow vertical (rarely : horizontal) strife : half of a1
(11" x 33" = 28 x 84 cm) or 1/2 of b1 (13.4" x
38.6" = 34 x 98 cm); b2 square (about 20.5" = 52 cm
+ variations thereof); and a-0 (double a1 = 117 x 84 cm) consisting
of 2 standard size (usually vertical) parts, that - combined
- form a horizontal banner-like poster (such as lenica's "krzyzacy"
or zamecznik's "lotna" and "pociag"). these
are very rare and highly collectible.

circulation :
most posters were issued in small quantities.
some (especially in the early and mid 50s) had larger intended
circulation (12000 to 22000), usually greatly reduced at printing
time. standard runs were : 4200 - 6000 - 8000 - 11500, with most
in the 4200 - 8000 range. now, often just a few copies survive.
these posters were never intended (or available) for sale, being
used all over the country in 1200+ theaters, and stuck on billboards,
street fences and advertising kiosks. to obtain a film poster
someone involved in their distribution had to help.
collections :
as a result, large holdings (1000+ titles)
are surprisingly few in poland (+-10 private, another 10 institutional).
in the us, i am aware of about 15, even less in the uk, france,
the netherlands, germany, switzerland and japan, though there
are a number of small (200-400 titles) collections. most commercial
galleries have at least a few polish posters for sale, usually
the less desirable 70s to 90s pieces in the $150-300 range. only
a few deal in the truly classic - check links
for dealers, galleries, etc.
this is an ongoing project. please email
any questions, comments, corrections, suggestions, requests to
buy/ sell/ trade, etc.
