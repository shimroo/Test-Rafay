help keep a veteran out of jail 
— funds are needed to complete analysis of five years of veteran arrest data and integrate arrest data with court outcomes in order to develop more effective interventions than current 
“catch, convict, and release”
 practice that destroys so many veteran's lives.

all work is done by volunteers and we have no paid staff.





 

the equal justice foundation is a nonprofit organization of citizens from all walks of life working to:


•	restore due process.

•	reverse the loss of our civil liberties.

•	ensure equality for all citizens before the bar. 

•	establish judicial accountability.

•	reestablish the rule of law.

•	maintain property rights and enforcement of contracts.

•	define marriage as a contract between men and women to provide for the upbringing and education of their children without collectivist interference.

•	preserve the secret ballot.

•	ensure open, fair, and honest elections.

•	make the bill of rights a living document in our time.


our viewpoints and findings are presented by an eclectic array of male and female authors from a wide variety of fields, backgrounds, and viewpoints. 

 

fundamental liberties


top


the equal justice foundation works to insure that:


•	citizens shall 
not
 be torn from their homes and children in the middle of the night based on nothing more than hearsay.

•	men and women shall 
not
 be presumed guilty until they can prove their innocence.

•	a secret tribunal shall 
not
 have the power to force a man from his home without notice or hearing.

•	police shall 
not
 have the right to enter and search a citizen's home without a warrant.

•	citizens shall 
not
 be imprisoned based only on hearsay.

•	citizens are 
not
 more afraid of the police than they are of criminals.

•	a legal system exists that does 
not
 tolerate perjury or the subornation of perjury.

•	citizens shall 
not
 be censured by public officials for crimes they have not committed.

•	men and women are 
not
 made to work as indentured servants or held in thrall to others for acts they have not committed.

•	a marriage license does 
not
 make men and women servants of the state or give courts possession of their children.


these actions are occurring in america everyday. if you haven't yet personal experience with such sordid injustices we invite you to explore the following pages. look at the evidence and laws behind these despicable acts. you will find numerous personal stories of men and women who have suffered under these draconian policies, often losing everything they loved and owned in the process. the persecution of 
dr. tim emerson
 is but one contemptible example. see why so many find suicide their only escape. and join the equal justice foundation in providing help and succor to many desperate men and women.

 

basic findings


top


make no mistake, we are engaged in an epic battle between two incompatible ideologies with fundamentally different views of the rights of the individual and the power of the state, with the future of civilization at stake.

in studying the problems of children, families, and marriage that are the bedrock of our society, some simple facts emerge from study after study:


•	the safest place for a child is with their biological father.

•	the safest place for a woman is in her home married to the biological father of her children.

•	while biology requires sex to create a child, civilization requires marriage and families to raise the child.

•	men and women are equally violent in domestic relationships.

•	
“any country that has tried to create a political solution to human problems has ended up with concentration camps and gulags.” — 
erin pizzey


yet radical ideologues have successfully campaigned to pass laws that contravene these findings and act to destroy children, families, and marriages on a previously unimagined scale. no one of us can combat these evils, but standing together we can, and have made a difference.

these are not battles that will be won overnight and victory will never be complete. but we are turning the tide on repression and darkness. please join us, for your sake, and the sake of your children.

 

research areas


top


the essays, papers, articles, and illustrative vignettes of the research areas of interest to the equal justice foundation are organized into six general areas: 


•	
civilization
 — the umbrella under which we currently exist but that is under attack.

•	
families and marriage
 — the basic building blocks of civilization that extremists are rapidly destroying.

•	
domestic violence
 — family violence has become a tool in the hands of ideologues for the destruction of families and marriage. to provide balance the ejf also maintains and supports the 
domestic violence against men in colorado
 web site. the 
emerson story
 tells how the life of one medical doctor was maliciously destroyed by these draconian laws but we know of far too many more professionals whose children and careers have been destroyed by false allegations.

•	
courts, veteran courts, and civil liberties
 — the crusaders attempting to destroy families and marriage depend heavily on corrupt 
“family”
 courts and the destruction of civil liberties to achieve their objectives. the ejf has also been a pioneer in establishing veteran courts to deal with the walking wounded of our current conflicts whose disabilities bring them before civilian courts.

•	
prohibitions and war on drugs
 — tyrants have always depended on distractions and the inculcation of fear to accomplish their goals and for the denial of civil liberties. the ejf stands behind the rights of citizens to make their own choices without draconian oversight by collectivists.

•	
vote fraud and election issues
 — the federally-funded stampede to computer voting and mail in elections has greatly enhanced the potential for election fraud and undermined the faith of citizen's in their elections. the ejf has been at the forefront of the defense of honest elections using a secret ballot and has been constantly documenting the problems of incompetent and dishonest election officials and voting machine vendors for more than a decade.
