our storyvolunteerhow to adoptavailable cats
























adopting a cat can trigger so much positivity. the initial positive benefit is in helping the siamese cat; a life is saved as the number of euthanized animals will be reduced dramatically when shelter cats are adopted.
learn about adopting


























southern california siamese rescue does not have a center, all rescues are fostered in private homes. because of this unique situation, we have found that our wishlist is a very useful way of receiving donations as items can be easily shared with foster parents.
visit wishlist


























have you checked out our featured felines? every month we will showcase a couple of our favorite rescues available for adoption and let you know why they stand out to us. 
take a look at our features


























our cats cannot tell us when they feel unwell, it is up to us as pet owners to ensure their health with preventative care.
