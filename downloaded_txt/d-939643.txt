hd.3015: an act relative to health insurance coverage for hearing aids 



feb 7, 2025




hearing aids not only help people hear better, but they decrease isolation, a proven issue in prevention of dementia. prescription hearing aids can cost around $10,000. most health insurance does not cover any portion of the cost. if they do cover any portion, it is only a couple thousand dollars at most. over the counter hearing aids cost between $300 -$500 from major drugstore chains, and are not covered by insurance at all.
