gig harbor yacht club is an active boating and social club that celebrates camaraderie, and boating activities.  we have a positive environment of sharing knowledge and sharing good times.  our social calendar is full of cruising, racing, and land-based activities that are 100% volunteer in their organization and support.

we have monthly dinner meetings, tgif casual evenings, men's lunch, ladies night out, special balls and themed parties.  we are active on the water as well.  check out our boating link to explore our monthly cruises, and our participation in the puget sound’s sail racing and power boating competitions.

ghyc is an active part of our community with the holiday “lighted boat parade”, the gig festival celebration,  as well as being a part of the grand 14 yacht clubs of puget sound.  we currently offer reciprocal privileges with nearly 100 yacht clubs along the pacific coast and beyond.
