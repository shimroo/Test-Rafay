          (6:08 pace).

            steady and quickly going through 5 miles in 30:27 and the 1/2
            marathon in 1:20.11. her second 1/2 marathon was an amazing and even
            1:20.18
        



             
        



            congratulations to caitlin! sitrac will be honoring her at a
