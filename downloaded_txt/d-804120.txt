 a local legacy


 it all started back in 1985. through hard work and deep dedication to the community, founder jacob weglarz took what once was a site filled with abandoned and condemned factories and created the weglarz legacy. “jack” as he was called - used both his vision of what could be achieved and simultaneous attention to details to set the redevelopment plans in motion - and the midway hotel center took flight!

the current owners, sons mark and jon, are dedicated to carrying on this legacy of their father’s exceptional standards, meaningful relationships, and an overall love for chicagoland.  this is reflective in the weglarz hotel collection’s consistent high guest scores. within their brands, they are consistently earning top ranking and awards for great satisfaction.

to welcome and send off folks from around the world traveling through midway’s international airport brings great joy and meaning to their work and of the great team that has been assembled here.  it’s the goal of midway hotel center to facilitate an environment where your dreams, too, can take flight!
