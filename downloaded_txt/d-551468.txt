   rich heritage with astrong tradition. having a heritage rich in history, culture, quality of life, while having a desire to adapt to the times and staying true to its founder’s values, the ogle foundation is something that we can all be proud of in southern indiana, but such a heritage doesn’t just happen overnight. over the years, the ogle foundation has played an important role in accomplishing this by dreaming big and by having a willingness to take action where others would not.  providing leadership and vision when the efforts are not just on a beginning but a focus on building and sustaining vision for the future.
