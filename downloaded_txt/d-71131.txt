daytrip to the rice field terraces (e.g. jatiluwih) and a stop at the temples tirta empul or goa gaja, closing the day with a traditional dance performance in ubud with a dinner in one of the many amazing restaurants in ubud.

can i visit and climb bali's mountains and volcanos?


yes, you can visit bali's mountains and climb volcanos. you might have heard in the news, that bali's former governor koster issued a decree, forbidding climbing baliâs mountains. this came as a response of several social media posts, were tourists gravely misbehaved, disrespecting the holy sites and bali's cultural integrity overall. yet, this decree has not been enforced and as it turned out, was not based on legal ground. there is no ban on visiting the mountains and volcanos. some mountains might be temporarily closed at times, but the reasons will be usually weather conditions, volcanic activities, or ceremonies.

what's the best itenerary for 2 or 3 weeks holiday vacation in bali?


travel itinerary suggestions for visiting bali for the first time

a few days inâ sanur, jimbaran or nusa dua, easy arrival and chill.
then ubudâ to discover the culture and natural sites of central and north bali (tours, chilling, health, yoga).
hop over toâ lembongan and ceningan islandsâ for the tropical and more simple life style as bali offered 30 years ago (and great diving).
conclude your trip with some going out, party, shopping, sunset chills inâ kuta, legian, seminyak or canggu.

with that set of choices you will discover a lotâ¦in 2 or 3 weeksâ¦and when you come back to baliâ¦there is more, much more to discover and explore. travelers have been coming to bali for decades and return every year; they still discover new things and gain new experiences.

yes, bali's nightlife is a real treat. kuta's reputation among the young and wild, mostly coming from australia, is legendary. in high season and in november kuta feels at times like a spring break fantasy. seminyak offers the widest range of places to go out, also more upbeat and classy, while canggu is catching up, even though the vibe in canggu is more relaxed and less "crazy".

bali's guide to how to behave and cultural guidelines





is bali still a paradise?


depends on how one defines a paradise
let's start with the challenging aspects. for one, bali is not a paradise like the picture postcards of maldives or the bahamas suggest. the beaches of kuta up to canggu are quite stunning, and wide, and with fun waves to surf, but less tropical than one might expect. mass tourism has left its mark on some places n the south, such as kuta, seminyak, and even ubud. but many travelers love this aspect of bai, because it comes with a wide variety of restaurants, bars, shops and with lots of accommodation options. traffic can be a problem in the dense areas, such as seminyak and canggu,. where development was faster than roads were constructed,. in peak season such as christmas, traffic can be quite challenging overall. ...that's all not matching the idea of a paradise.
but, in many aspects bali is and still is a paradise, and one of the best destinations in the world. why? because it is tolerant and inviting and lets you be who you want to be. it has an incredible variety of almost everything any traveler wishes to explore or experience. it offers great value for money, and an art and culture that is unique in this world, authentic, and alive. if you want to leave the mass tourism behind, all you need is a short drive and you will enter a bali that has almost not changed in decades. there are countless areas and sites that are absolutely remote, quiet and almost untouched, where magnificent nature shows her beauty.
bali is a paradise because of the whole package it offers, and not because it looks like a "white sandy beach coconut tree postcard" wherever you go.





is bali safe?


yes, for sure it's safer than other places. and single women can travel freely and safely. of course, like everywhere else in the world, where there is tourism, there is crime and scam. but if you keep a normal level of common sense and don't fall into the traps of senseless drinking and drugs, you should be fine.the biggest threat is probably when untrained drivers rent a scooter and overestimate their skills and underestimate the complexity of the traffic.â
