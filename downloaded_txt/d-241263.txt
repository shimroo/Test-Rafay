sustainability & stewardship

ensuring a bright future for our land and the next generation
 
 

at pedroncelli winery, we are committed to preserving the environment for future generations. as a family-owned winery farming in the dry creek valley since 1927, we understand the importance of sustainable practices in ensuring a long-term future for our business. our vineyards are certified sustainable, and we have made significant efforts to reduce water use, improve soil health, and protect the vineyard environment. our approach to vineyard management is comprehensive, encompassing all aspects of farming including human resources, viticulture, wine quality, soil management, water management, pest control, and habitat management. by taking an environmentally sensitive approach to farming, we are proud to produce wines that are not only delicious but also sustainable.
 
 
 
 
 
 




1927
 

in 1927, giovanni and julia pedroncelli purchased the hillside property west of geyserville, which included 25 acres of zinfandel vines and a former winery building that had been used as a barn during prohibition. this majestic property has been in the pedroncelli family for generations, and today it is run by the third and fourth generation. visitors have the opportunity to taste the epitome of winemaking and learn about the history of the pedroncelli family.

							"one of the old, iconic italian families of sonoma, the pedroncellis have been farming vineyards since 1927. they obviously survived prohibition and consumers are all the better for it. moreover, they have always had a humble philosophy in terms of pricing. dollar-for-dollar, the pedroncelli wines consistently offer both character and quality for their prices, something consumers should never forget."
