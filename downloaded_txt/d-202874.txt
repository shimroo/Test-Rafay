since 1933, greenwood has been enriching the lives of young people, encouraging them to realize their musical, intellectual and social potential.

senior campers perform the world premiere of reena esmail’s “this is it,” written for greenwood as part of the deborah sherr commissioning award.

greenwood music camp is a summer chamber music program for middle and high school students. located in the hills of cummington, massachusetts, greenwood seeks to enrich each camper and inspire our community with the joy of making great music and creating life-long friendships.we invite you to explore our website and learn more about our programs, our people and the special place that more than three generations of young musicians have called home each summer. "greenwood clearly changed my life, directed me towards my ultimate goals and provided me a foundation for my musical life. and it has given a 'present' to my three wonderful children of the joys of music."—gilbert kalish
