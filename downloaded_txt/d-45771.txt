digitizing for embroidery is both a skill and an artform. i have spent many years learning and perfecting my talents and abililities. each design represents hours of work to design, digitize, test, and present. i take great care to ensure to eliminate unnecessary trims, jumps and color changes. 
i provide designs in dst, exp, hus, jef, pes, and vip formats. other formats are available upon request.
