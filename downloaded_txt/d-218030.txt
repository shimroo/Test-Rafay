june 14, 2024/



ben wicker





introductionas scallop season kicks off in florida’s coastal communities, a new tool is revolutionizing sustainable harvesting practices: the scallop sorter. developed by florida sea grant in collaboration with the university of florida’s ifas and the florida fish and wildlife commission, this pocket-sized device ensures only mature scallops are harvested, promoting ecosystem health and boosting local economies.










unfortunately i don’t have a picture of the sea grant sorter. it look similar to this.





innovation and collaborationthe scallop sorter originated from stakeholder feedback, evolving from a simple idea of using milk jugs to its current form—a smooth, circular tool with a handle. it’s designed to be user-friendly and effective, helping scallopers distinguish between small and mature scallops easily.impact and distributionsince its introduction, the scallop sorter has gained widespread popularity. in 2023, over 1,500 sorters were distributed across 13 counties. this year, thanks to support from the coastal conservation association, over 10,000 sorters will be available, helping to protect scallop populations and ensure a sustainable future for this beloved activity.conclusionfor scallopers along florida’s nature coast, the scallop sorter is a must-have tool. it not only supports sustainable practices but also enhances the enjoyment of scalloping by ensuring better catches and healthier marine ecosystems. for more information and to find out how to get a scallop sorter, visit florida sea grant’s website.

psa: scallop sorters – what they are, why they’re important, and where to get them

june 12, 2024/


ben wicker















as scallop season kicks off in steinhatchee, it’s essential to ensure we are practicing sustainable scalloping. one crucial tool in this effort is the scallop sorter.what is a scallop sorter?a scallop sorter is a simple but effective tool used to measure scallops. if a scallop fits through the hole in the sorter, it is too small to harvest and should be returned to the water. this helps ensure that we are only collecting mature scallops, allowing the smaller ones to grow and reproduce, contributing to future populations.why are they important?in florida, the limit for scallops is based on volume, not count. early in the season, scallops tend to be smaller, meaning you can legally harvest a larger number of individual scallops within the volume limit. using a scallop sorter helps prevent over-harvesting of immature scallops, promoting a healthier scallop population for years to come. although not required by the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (fwc), using a scallop sorter is highly recommended.where to get themscallop sorters are available for free at many businesses throughout steinhatchee. be sure to pick one up before heading out on the water to ensure you’re scalloping responsibly. for more information, you can visit the cca florida website or contact danielle norwood at sea hag marina at thehag@seahag.com or by calling 352-498-3008.if you own a business in steinhatchee and are handing out scallop sorters, please share this post! let’s work together to promote sustainable scalloping practices in our community.thank you, cca floridaa big thank you to cca florida for providing these essential scallop sorters and supporting sustainable scalloping practices in our community,

the contrast of calm and destruction

september 05, 2023/


ben wicker





the beauty of nature always finds a way to shine through, even in the darkest of times. this photo of the reflection of the sky in the steinhatchee river is a testament to that. the contrast between the calm and peaceful water and the destruction left behind by hurricane idalia is striking. it is a reminder of the power of nature and the importance of resilience.this photo was taken at roy's restaurant, which was severely damaged by the hurricane. the restaurant is closed, but repairs have already begun and will reopen as soon as possible. in the meantime, this photo is a reminder of the beauty that can still be found, even in the midst of destruction.
