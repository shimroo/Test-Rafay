				ginger sencha 
									







			i've been monitoring your site for a re-issue of your 'green ginger' tea, so thank you for sending me a sample of ginger sencha to try.  i found the ginger sencha to be a ginger forward, smooth tea that was perfect for digestive sipping post-meal and late afternoon indulgences.  i'm guessing here, but i don't think it's a strong caffeine tea; preferable for afternoons rather than the first drink of the morn.  it's lovely and i'm adding it to my next tea haus purchase.  thank you for the opportunity to try it!

				breakfast tea in time for breakfast!
									







			so yesterday i did my morning walk and came home to brew some tea. noticing it was low, i decided i needed a new order. today i was out earlier. my tea was here when i came back, less than 24 hours, i’m brewing fresh and i’m a good distance from london.quick, easy and fast, with debit payment that means you can enjoy your tea without worrying about the credit card bill coming!my teas are the blackest of black teas, but i’m not going to review the tea. i have learned. they do not have anything in tea that isn’t perfect. i just don’t like some. the descriptions are very accurate, so if it sounds good, order a 50g and try. must have more than one cup to really test. in no time you’ll have too many to choose from!
