st. paul’s lutheran church






































we seek to strengthen christians and to bring others to christ: to present jesus christ intentionally and truthfully through the verbal and life witness of individual members, congregational worship, education, service, and fellowship.

on tuesday morning at 10am in the narthex we are studying "ten questions to ask every time you read the bible," by andrew r. jones. engage with god's word in a new way as you investigate the meaning, context, and application of the bible.﻿
