the trading game and gary stevenson

          i just finished reading gary stevenson’s book the trading game 📚 and i wanted to offer some thoughts about the book.
i watched this interview with gary on novara media:
and it’s what pushed me to buy the book. i thought that the book was going to be about economic theory. i expected it to explain how the economy works. it definitely was not that. instead, it was a superb story about a young poor boy with a knack for numbers.

leaving another social media account behind

          with the coming tiktok ban, i’ve realised that i’m doing something that i’ve done since 1997, which is leaving another social media site.
my online social media prepense since 1997: aol community (1997), livejournal (2001-2004), friendster (2003-2004), myspace (2004-2006), tribe.net (2005), facebook (2006-2019), twitter (2008-2024), youtube (2011), mastodon (2018), tiktok (2020), peertube (2024).
this was never a linear event cycle, i just kind of floated from one app to the next with a lot of bleed over.

abbey asks a very good question! what is posse?


jan 13, 2025


          my mutual abbey (openbookshelf), asked on tiktok what “posse” is. posse stands for “publish (on your) own site, syndicate elsewhere”. you start with your website. for me, i start with my blog on micro.blog, but you can use wordpress too. you can cross post or “syndicate” yourself automatically to most sites (you can find this post on mastodon, linkedin, bluesky, threads, tumblr, and nostr) you can spin up your own social media sites like mastodon (think twitter) or peertube (think youtube/tiktok) yourself effortlessly.

          i don’t really like doing new year’s resolutions, for a few reasons. a. i don’t see the new year as the beginning of something. yes, it’s a chance to reflect, but there’s nothing “new” about the year apart from the year i’m printing on forms. b. i save resolutions for when i get depressed. even then, it’s not really resolutions, it’s more like goal setting. when i get depressed, i feel like i don’t see a way out.

book favourite: a demon haunted world

          the demon-haunted world: science as a candle in the dark by carl sagan 📚
this is one of my favourite books. so much of what is wrong with the world is within the pages of this book. nostradamus would have been proud of sagan.
 “i have a foreboding of an america in my children’s or grandchildren’s time – when the united states is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness…

          i'm reading "not your rescue project: migrant sex workers fighting for justice" there are books that i get a hold of that i have to read more than once, and this is one of those books.
 "when most people think about migrant sex workers, they think of them not as humans, but as objects of grave moral concern. not as powerful and capable community members, but as social problems."

keeping my posse local: working on social media workflows


dec 12, 2024


          i’m working on new social media priorities, using the posse (post on your own site syndicate everywhere) scheme.
 you can read about it [here](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon). the focus is bringing back social media out of the hands of big corporations. judging from the way people jumped from twitter to bluesky, it will take a while for people to get away from being the product. so, this is a strategy to leverage the social media platforms that are out there, but keep the ultimate focus local.

alice thomson on class and society


dec 12, 2024


          after the shooting of united health's ceo, this image has gone viral. like most people, i saw it, and laughed and moved on. but after seeing a remix today of it, and i was curious about what the underlying context of it was. alice thomson is a journalist, as is her husband. a quick google search reveals the journalist's squalid living conditions:
 "chevithorne barton" was taken by alison day and licensed to use under creative commons license cc by-nd 2.

mastodon reports 


dec 8, 2024


          i’m quite amused at the moderation of my mastodon instance. i’ve been reported by exactly two different factions: zionists, and democrats. that just about tracks. silencing, for having opinions contrary to the narratives of both factions, is a tactic that’s been disastrous for both democrats and zionists. but i guess when it’s all you have, that’s what you go with.

who owns bluesky and why it matters

          my initial reservations about bluesky were that it is algorithm-based, it is a closed platform (you can’t run your own bluesky server), and it was first created by twitter’s founder jack dorsey.
 reading cory doctorow’s bluesky and enshittification i had many questions. simple questions centered around bluesky seem hard to answer. they are hidden under layers of complexity. a question like, “can i run my own bluesky instance?” is an example.

          i haven’t seen too many people talk about one angle of the donald trump win. they did awfully after getting advice from the labour party. you can never tell how much advice they actually listened to labour advisors like jonathan ashworth, but the advice he gave publicly:
he said democratic operatives were “interested in how we made the arguments [on border security], because they intend to make the same arguments as well.

what trump&#8217;s election tells us about global politics


nov 11, 2024


          i’m an american living in the uk, and my wife is brazilian. in both the uk and in brazil, i’m seeing people say they can’t believe that trump won the election. this is an extremely myopic view.
fourteen million voters picked the reform party in the uk just a few months ago. many brazilians would vote for jair bolsonaro if they could (he’s been barred from running for political office until 2030).

the rise of the 4b movement post-usa election and how it&#8217;s transphobic

          since the election of donald trump in the usa, there’s been a resurgence of the 4b movement online. from wikipedia: 4b (or “four nos”) is a gender critical, radical feminist movement. it first emerged during the south korean gender wars during the mid-to-late 2010s on the misandric website womad and related subcultures on twitter.
the name refers to its defining four tenets which all start with the korean bi 비, roughly meaning no.

understanding introspective vs. emotionally reactive people


nov 7, 2024


          i’ve experienced two kinds of people in my life:
introspective
adjective inspecting within; seeing inwardly; capable of, or exercising, inspection; self-conscious.
similar: self-conscious involving the act or results of conscious knowledge of physical phenomena; — contrasted with associational. examining one’s own perceptions and sensory experiences; contemplative or thoughtful about oneself.   introspectives are people like socrates, who said “the unexamined life is not worth living”. these people self-reflect constantly. they engage in reflective judgment.

debating sex work: centering real experiences


nov 2, 2024


          i see countless videos on tiktok and youtube saying things like “is sex work, work” or “is sex work empowering?” without platforming sex workers themselves. if sex workers respond in comment sections, content creators often block them. if they make response videos, they often get deplatformed.
i’m not a sex worker myself. but i am not trying to build a platform by speaking over sex workers for clicks and views. they are considered debate topics, rather than human beings with lived experience.

the only way forward is peace – and that means negotiations with the people who we’ve seen doing and saying evil things.
if you think israel continuously saying “let’s bomb our way to peace” is stupid, remember that cuts both ways.

democratic phantasmagoria

          phantasmagoria
noun
phan· tas· ma· go· ria (ˌ)fan-ˌtaz-mə-ˈgȯr-ē-ə 
an exhibition of optical effects and illusions a: a constantly shifting complex succession of things seen or imagined
b: a scene that constantly changes a bizarre or fantastic combination, collection, or assemblage   

a trip around the blue maga fediverse this morning wielded an odd conglomeration of posts:
 and
  the absurdity of demanding that the media cover biden and trump the same, when they obviously are different, is a special kind of gaslighting.

swerfin' and terfin'


mar 4, 2024


          when it comes to the sex work industry commentary on social media, it seems like the critics are big on speaking about the dangers of trafficking (many times conflating trafficking and sex work) but very quiet when it comes to the underlying causes of why the most toxic parts of it exist.
i really can't give much space in my head to those who voice their concerns about coercion in sex work but refuse to acknowledge the primary pillar of that coercion.
