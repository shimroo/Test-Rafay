brazilian embroidery is a wonderful 3 dimensional stitchery technique that can be used alone to create wonderful
pictures, pillows, linens, wearable art, personal accessories and what ever else
your needle can stitch through.  other stitching projects can be
"spruced up" with the addition of some 3 dimensional flowers. 
quilts can be embellished with the wonderful brazilian stitches. 
absolutely beautiful floral sprays can be added to clothing and you won't have
to worry about the fibers withstanding the frequent washing. 
"brazilian threads" are 100% rayon z-twist threads that 
endures a lifetime of laundering on clothing. jdr specializes in 
 brazilian
embroidery , but this raised embroidery can be incorporated into your 
 stumpwork
embroidery , hardanger, 
 silk ribbon embroidery, quilting, craft projects, clothing embellishments and other stitching techniques.



brazilian
embroidery is hand stitchery done predominantly with dimensional stitches using
the "z" twisted rayon threads; with the original fine growth &
field flowers encouraged."
