intro 



personalized breast cancer screeningsmilow breast center at ipark, part of norwalk hospital, offers breast cancer screening and advanced breast imaging services to help detect even the smallest of breast cancers.
 

we offer a complete range of breast imaging options to detect breast cancer and you’ll typically get your screening results in 24 hours or the next business day. the services and procedures that may be included in your plan include:

3d mammography (tomosynthesis)
    3d mammography allows radiologists* to view the breast in extremely thin layers, slice by slice and from multiple angles. these more detailed high-resolution images have been shown to significantly improve cancer detection and reduce radiation exposure.


breast biopsy
breast biopsy may be done using ultrasound, mri or low dose computer assisted mammography (stereotactic guidance).


breast ultrasound
ultrasound imaging uses a transducer or probe to generate sound waves and produce pictures of the body's internal structures. it does not use ionizing radiation, has no known side effects, and provides a picture of soft tissues that don't show up well on x-ray images.


osteoporosis and bone density scans
the bone density scan is the most complete evaluation of a person’s bone density status, requires little to no special preparation and is less expensive than other methods.

radiology & imaging services
imaging and radiology at norwalk, main avenue offers a full suite of imaging and radiology services, backed by the expertise of a team of board-certified radiologists. you have access to convenient, comfortable imaging tests, close to home:

x-ray
