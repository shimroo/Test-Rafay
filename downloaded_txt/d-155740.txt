nfl community | nfl.com














football is not only the foundation of the league, but also the vehicle through which our teams build lasting connections within communities nationwide. the nfl embraces its role as a unifier, addressing key social issues and serving as a constant force for positive change.




























every kid can be somebody, if they have somebody to show them the way.


the nfl is committed to ongoing support of a variety of programs that demonstrate what strong leadership looks like and recognize the power of positive, healthy adult relationships in the lives of youth. this year, the nfl family dedicated resources to more than 50,000 different organizations that reach young people across the country and around the world. this comes to life through mentorship programs, coaching development, unified athletics, and more, ultimately empowering millions of young people to reach their fullest potential.
