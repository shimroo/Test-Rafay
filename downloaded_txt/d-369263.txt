[reunions]

peace! it's still a good idea!

the alumni sandstorm is dedicated to all our fallen classmates.
they would get as big a kick out of it as we all do.
they live again in the sandstorm by the stories we share
here and they are missed.

this is an alumni sandstorm entry from the widow of fred segrest ('57-
rip):

"fred enjoyed his years as a subscriber to the
sandstorm. he often
shared photos and stories from your mailing list with
his family
and friends about richland and hanford in the "old
days." our
standing joke, from the time we first met in 1959 was
that we
never needed a night light because fred glowed in the
dark, being
a downwinder of the first order. he was very pleased
to be able to
re-connect with classmates and old friends [via the] 
sandstorm.
he was proud to be a bomber and really enjoyed
reminding his
"uberliberal" friends that the liberties they
cherished and sought
came in no small part because of the scientific
achievements that
came from hanford and the dusty little town in south
central
washington called richland, with the mushroom-shaped
cloud as its
lasting symbol."
