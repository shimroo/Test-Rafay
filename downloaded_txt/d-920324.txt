      ragdoll cats have been selectively bred to have a sweet disposition. our ragdolls 

      are gentle cats, they play without extending their claws. this makes them 

      ideal family members in households with other pets and children. the ragdoll 

      is a very devoted cat, mine love to play fetch... come when they are called... 

      and follow me everywhere. the ragdoll is a slow maturing breed, sometimes 

      not reaching full maturity until 3-4 years old. altered males may grow as 

      large as 20 pounds or more with the females weighing about 5 pound less.

      the ragdoll coat is soft, silky and requires minimal care. it is often described 

      as feeling more like rabbit fur than a cat. the ragdoll is a pointed breed, 

      which means that all ragdoll cats and kittens will have blue eyes. the breed was 

      named for the cats tendency to "go limp" (like a rag doll) when they are picked 

      up. 

ragdoll kittens are incredibly trusting in nature. it is not unusual to 

      find ragdoll cats and kittens sleeping on their back with their furry belly 

      exposed. ragdolls love to flop on their backs in front of people to get belly 

      rubs. our kittens learn to do this as soon as they are able to walk. as with 

      all living things, every ragdoll has their own cat personality and each one 

      is a little bit different, but each is very lovable with their own ways.

i will be eternally grateful 

      for the guidance and friendship of eileen pickett of

      villaroyal ragdolls. 

      without eileen's never ending love and knowledge of the ragdoll breed, and 

      the quality of the cats she has trusted to me, bellapalazzo ragdolls would 

      not exist.  ragdoll cat breeders of this impeccable stature  are 

      rare and precious.... few and far between. 




this is 

            bellapalazzo destiny as a kitten at 3 months old in 2001. destiny is a daughter of 

            villaroyal rocksanne and inherited her mothers incredible coat 

            texture and large boning as well as her fathers size and bravado. 

            she weighed over 7 pounds when this photo was taken and made all other litters look small 

            in comparison. i kept both destiny and her brother dylan because of 

            their impressive ragdoll qualities. destiny and dylan are both now 

            retired from breeding... 




 




beware.....

      cant have just one!!
