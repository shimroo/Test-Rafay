who is cyc?since 1956, chicago youth centers (cyc) has been the place where possibility lives: a trusted partner on chicago’s south and west sides, ensuring that kids have a safe place they can go to explore, to discover, to process, and ultimately to envision a bright future that they can create for themselves. in early learning classrooms, afterschool programs, and summer day camps, youth ages 15 months to 18 years find joy in learning, grow socially and emotionally, and build skills for the jobs of tomorrow. cyc children are deeply engaged, with many attending our hands-on clubs five days a week, 48 weeks a year. cyc envisions a chicago where every child has equitable access to the resources, experiences, safe spaces, and mentors that they need to live each day as their best selves.
