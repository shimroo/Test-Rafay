good materialby dolly alderton


 
                    (1 review)
                    every relationship has one beginning.
this one has two endings. 
andy loves jen. jen loved andy.
and he can't work out why she stopped. 
now he is...1. without a home;
2. waiting for his stand-up career to take off;
3. wondering why everyone else around him seems to have grown up while he wasn't looking.set adrift on the sea of heartbreak at a time when everything he thought he knew about women, and flat-sharing, and his friendships has transformed beyond recognition, andy clings to the idea of solving the puzzle of their broken relationship. because if he can find the answer to that, then maybe jen can find her way back to him.
andy still has a lot to learn, not least his ex-girlfriend's side of the story...

the paper lanternby will burns


 
                    (1 review)
                    set in a shuttered pub - the paper lantern - in a village in the very middle of the country adjacent to the prime minister's chequers estate, an unnamed narrator embarks on a series of walks in the chiltern hills. as he charts and interrogates the shifts in mood and understanding that have defined a transformative period in his own history and that of the surrounding area, he reveals a past scarred with trauma and a present lacking compass. traversing local raves in secret valleys, to climate change and capitalism, the paper lantern creates a tangible, lived-in complicated rendering of a place, at the moment when the very sense of place itself is being questioned...

laughter is the best medicine 
					by peter sykes


 
                    (1 review)
                    it is said that a surgeon must have âthe eyes of a hawk, the heart of a lion, and the hands of a lady,â but have you ever wondered how a surgeon learns to operate, how he âcuts his teethâ progressing from naive newly-qualified doctor to competent surgeon?
in this collection of medical tales, the training of one slightly naive young trainee is viewed through the experiences of the patients he treats as he embarks on this most challenging of careers. we share his joy when things go well, his anguish when they donât and learn that, at the end of the day, compassion and a sense of humour make wonderful medicine...

                    john rebus stands accused: the once legendary detective is on trial, facing the rest of his life behind bars. how does a hero turn villain? or have times changed, and the rules with them? detective inspector siobhan clarke tackles edinburgh's most explosive case in years, as a corrupt cop harbouring huge secrets goes missing. but is her loyalty to the police or the public? and who can she trust when nobody is truly innocent - including her former mentor rebus - and a killer walks among them? as the time comes to choose sides, it becomes clear: after a lifetime of lies, the truth will break your heart...

funny girlby nick hornby


 
                    (1 review)
                    make them laugh, and they're yours foreverâ¦ 
barbara parker is miss blackpool of 1964, but she doesn't want to be a beauty queen. she wants to make people laugh. so she leaves her hometown behind, takes herself to london, and overnight she becomes the lead in a new bbc comedy, sophie straw: charming, gorgeous, destined to win the nation's hearts. 
					funny girl is the story of a smash-hit tv show and the people behind the scenes. but when life starts imitating art, they all face a choice. how long can they keep going before it's time to change the channel? 
insightful and humorous, nick hornby's latest does what he does best: endears us to a cast of characters who are funny if flawed, and forces us to examine ourselves in the process...

lessons in chemistryby bonnie garmus


 
                    (1 review)
                    chemist elizabeth zott is not your average woman. in fact, elizabeth zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing.
but it's the early 1960s and her all-male team at hastings research institute take a very unscientific view of equality. except for one: calvin evans, the lonely, brilliant, nobel-prize nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with - of all things - her mind. true chemistry results.
like science, life is unpredictable. which is why a few years later, elizabeth zott finds herself not only a single mother, but the reluctant star of america's most beloved cooking show, supper at six. elizabeth's unusual approach to cooking ('combine one tablespoon acetic acid with a pinch of sodium chloride') proves revolutionary. but as her following grows, not everyone is happy. because as it turns out, elizabeth zott isn't just teaching women to cook. she's daring them to change the status quo.

and then there were noneby agatha christie


 
                    (1 review)
and then there were none topped the international online poll held in agatha christie's 125th birthday year to discover which of her 80 crime books was the world's favourite. 1939. europe teeters on the brink of war. ten strangers are invited to soldier island, an isolated rock near the devon coast. cut off from the mainland, with their generous hosts mr and mrs u.n. owen mysteriously absent, they are each accused of a terrible crime. when one of the party dies suddenly they realise they may be harbouring a murderer among their number. the 10 strangers include a reckless playboy, a troubled harley street doctor, a formidable judge, an uncouth detective, an unscrupulous mercenary, a god-fearing spinster, two restless servants, a highly decorated general and an anxious secretary. one by one they are picked off. who will survive? and who is the killer? copies of an ominous nursery rhyme hang in each room, the murders mimicking the awful fates of its 'ten little soldier boys'...

red side storyby jasper fforde


 
                    (1 review)
                    finally, after 14 years, the sequel to
					
					shades of grey is here. it's the uk, but not as we know 
					it: civilisation has rebuilt after an unspoken 'something 
					that happened' five hundred years before. society is now 
					colour-based, the strict levels of hierarchy dictated by the 
					colours you can see, and the economy, health service and 
					citizen's aspirations all dominated by visual colour, run by 
					the shadowy national colour in far-off emerald city. out on 
					the fringes of red sector west, eddie russett and jane grey 
					have discovered that all is neither fair nor truthful within 
					their cosy environment, and currently face trumped up 
					charges that will see them die of the fatally soporific 
					tones within the green room. negotiating the narrow 
					boundaries of the rules within their society, jane and 
					edward must find out the truth of their world: what is it, 
					where is it and even when it is.
					red side story delves into the strictures of a society imposed on itself by itself, immovable dogma and the spirit of humans trying to love and survive...

murderabiliaby craig robertson


 
                    (1 review)
                    the first commuter train of the morning slowly rumbles away from platform seven of queen st station. and then, as the train emerges from a tunnel, the screaming starts. hanging from the bridge ahead of them is a body. placed neatly on the ground below him are the victim's clothes. why?
detective inspector narey is assigned the case and then just as quickly taken off it again. winter, now a journalist, must pursue the case for her. the line of questioning centres around the victim's clothes - why leave them in full view? and what did the killer not leave, and where might it appear again?
everyone has a hobby. some people collect death. to find this evil, narey must go on to the dark web, and into immense danger...

time sniffersby c. s. lakin


 
                    (1 review)
                    in the near future, a desperate race for new sources of energy pushes bria harrison's mother - nobel prize-winning scientist - to experiment with unstable compounds to harness dark energy. the result is disastrous... 
bria refuses to believe her mother is dead, even though dust chokes the site where the top-secret laboratory once stood. a strange symbol keeps showing up: on the dry erase board, in a pile of leaves, even in the milk her brother drips on the table. bria has no doubt her mother, somehow, is sending her a message. but how? and where could she be? to find out, she has to do something dangerous, but she sees no other option.
while re-creating her motherâs last experiment in her basement, bria, her autistic brother dylan, and four friends cause a rip in time-space 
					- and out of the resultant black hole tumbles k-six, a time sniffer who has come to get them. 
this doglike alien creature takes them back through the rip to his training world, where bria, her brother, and her friends must be altered to adapt to dangerous time confluences and worlds they must traverse to save the scientists trapped in a time eddy. if they aren't rescued soon, dark energy, now streaming into the galaxy at an alarming rate, will cause horrific destruction - including the end of all life on earth...

dangerous illusionsby joseph j. gabriele


 
                    (1 review)
                    in a beguiling tale of deception and murder, desire and theft, seduction and betrayal - where nothing is what it appears to be - a man is murdered and an iconic musical instrument is stolen during a gathering at eliot sextonâs park avenue apartment. the stolen item - an object of desire worshipped by millions - is the key to solving the crime, or so the detective brought in to investigate believes. the murder, however, is not nearly as straightforward as it seems - nor is the theft. 
though the island of manhattan presents no shortage of suspects - many of them capable of killing to satisfy their appetites - eliot, a young economic historian and writer, soon becomes the prime suspect. as he draws closer to the truth behind the theft and murder, he also becomes the killerâs next target. 
irreverent, provocative, and utterly unpredictable, 
					dangerous illusions is a week long polyrhythmic journey into contemporary new york that will keep readers guessing right up to its thrilling conclusion...
