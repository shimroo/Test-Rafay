the voice of the turtle
























songs for simple minds

above the clouds above the pinethe haloed moon rides high.or clouds cavort unseemly whilethe moon stands idly by,just as it did so long ago.the moon was just the same.the same light filtered through the pine,whose needles made no claim.tonight the wind is just as brisk,the air is just as cold,and everything is much the same,except that i am old.this moonlight metaphysics workswhile luna rules the sky,but everything looks different whenthe solar bark sails by.the philosophe retires indoorsto wrap himself in gloomand there await the fall of nightwhen icy winds resume.set candles up in every sconcewhile servants draw the blinds!we’ll while away the daylight hourswith songs for simple minds.as sunrise on the canopysets golden bark aglowa tranquil chill of morning fillsthe silent world below.a frosty stillness claims the pine,the dead grass even more, each waxy needle lightly rimed,each blade white-shagged in hoar.the springhead froze last night. todaymy winter’s tale is told:by light of dawn all things have changed,except that i am old.

hors d’oeuvre

the intellect of man is forced to chooseperfection of the life, or of the work,and if it take the second must refusea heavenly mansion, raging in the dark.— w.b. yeatsescaping from december’s coldyou flee the sleety street,push past a door of hammered goldand there your footsteps meeta carpet marvelously madeas if with precious stones inlaid,sapphires and porphyry and jadewinking beneath your feet.the foyer just inside the doormakes winter disappear.the glow of warmth, a polished floor—the arrases draw near.a mirrored ballroom lies ahead,the fabled place where all who treadanticipate with awe or dreada blazing chandelier.you gaze up from the door to seewhat no one could forget:gold leaves where no tree ought to be,a branching coronetwhose whorls of burnished light ascendto meet and blur and meld and blend,and from those wrought-gold arms dependthe jewels of indra’s net.refulgent webs of nothing twistabove the startled guest.copies without a copyistin multiples attestthat every winking bauble theresuspended in the very airtranscribes the glow of everywhere,reflecting all the rest.you enter brazen, unafraid,that place of great renownwith underfoot baroque brocadeand overhead a crown,to find behind the tapestrya window where no pane should be,and there on tiptoe stand to seethe nothing sleet come down.out of time and out of mind,excited and annoyed,in lieu of what you came to findyou contemplate the voidand interlope in fancy dressan opera of emptiness,a dénouement no one can guess,with absence fully cloyed.perhaps in all these phrases lurkthe hard truths of our time:that nothing lies outside the worknor aught outside the rhyme.a skein of gems encloses allwhile earthly kingdoms rise and falland mirrored creatures flit or crawlthrough luminance sublime.you who would reflection makemust all reflections sendtill every bone within you break,refractions without end.a mnemonist may learn to facethe subjunctivity of graceand be curator of that placewhere bones and memory mend.at last the time has come to quitthe well-appointed roomwhere from the bench on which you sita waft of rare perfumeleads you to one last place to see,a courtyard where no space could be, to find in fragrant unitythe nothing tree in bloom.kingdoms come and kingdoms go.you keep an open mind —an organ lately loath and slow,by death of sense refined.enraged by truth, inflamed by doubt,as one by one the lights wink outyou find the strength to do withoutthe work you leave behind. september 7, 2018<< previousnext >>

a nocturnal upon st. hilda’s day

through sunlit hours the day went well,a bright-hued swirl as the leaves fell.then on the road the clouds moved in,cool and grey in a fading sky.i watched the night and rain beginas leaf-soaked streetlamped curbs flipped by.lights in the trees. the leaves came down.a rainy night, a rainy town.through the wet night a box office glowpatterned the rain-slick street below.ticket in hand, a seat in the stallsfor a parvenu with an open mind.from overture to curtain callsi hoped the night’s five acts might findthe larger structure of the day,but all the hours got in the way.the curtain rose. a spot came on.a backlit backdrop mimicked dawn.the cast filed in from either wing,each in turn to strut and fret,each in turn to stand and sing,repeat the words and not forget.the stage was lit, the house lights down.a diva sang in a sequined gown.a six-week run. the seasoned castconsigned old tensions to the past —a firm resolve to cauterizethe one who loved and one who spurned,cool and fey with her lambent eyes.and from their lines i might have learnedthe larger structure of the play,but all the weeks got in the way.lights in the flies. the play went well.the heroine stood where the spotlight fell.i watched the leading man glide byand kneel before that icy backin a pleated shirt with tails and tie —a sad tableau in gold and black.how often was this seen before?and here again, yet one time more.and which was drama? which was fact?the question haloed every act,and every season, year by year,through bright-lit day and howling night.each in its turn must disappear.a raging dawn might bring to lightthe bed wherein the structure lay,but all the years got in the way.the stage is dark. the cast is gone.audience members stretch and yawnand file out under the bright marquee.yet one more time the night must come.the leaves must spin from a sodden treeto pattern the continuum.the past outside rages and stormswhile here inside the future forms.yes, all the years got in the way.what else is there left to say?the trees were lit. the rain came down.leaves and hours went drifting byin forty different shades of brown,cool and slick in a borrowed tie.so what else is there left to say?ring down the curtain on this play!

these our wintry days

leaves by the door on these our wintry daysascend a windswept stairway and assailthe traveller who comes but never stays.the rising sun sets icy trees ablazeand lights the drifted snow a morning galeleaves by the door on these our wintry days.filigreed windows mark a change of phasefor one who pulls the curtains back to hailthe traveller who comes but never stays,whose vagrant footprints leave the path and raisefestoons of paler snow among the paleleaves by the door on these our wintry days.a pair of shaken boots sheds melting glazeand puddles in the entryway that trailthe traveller who comes but never stays.bright warmth, a moment’s rest, the urge to phrasea plea to linger, all to no avail:the traveller who comes but never staysleaves by the door on these our wintry days.

schrödinger’s chair

the coffee shop of things we have not seen:all those fragrant surprises new and oldinvite the feet to step in from the coldand rainy street, with just the door betweena roomful of people, those who are there,and those who are not. voices fill the room,bright over there, while here we find the gloomin conversation with an empty chair.close by the window, something hot to drink.and opposite — is that a second cup?a plume of steam is curling gently up,with no one there to cause a spoon to clink.a faint disjunction in the ambient lightoutlines an absence in the curling airbetween the table and the present chair.someone sat there before, or someday might.a truant tablemate can only shrugat what we might not see, or might forget,disdaining any need to be, and yetnothing is realer than that steaming mug.drain the last drop and then out to the street.close by the doorway stands a dripping tree,a shelter from the urban lunacyand weary rain that puddles round the feet.turn back towards the window — could it besomeone has occupied that empty seat?no: only a reflection turns to meeta rain-blurred face, and nothing else to see.how shall we parse this day of absent friends?inside, the shadows fill a truant’s cup.outside, the morning wind is waking up.the branches move, and then the movement ends.

patchwork music

when nothing here is certainbut that time is rolling on,ring up your eyelids’ curtainand greet rosy-fingered dawn,and ivory-footed sarahin her floor-length purple gown,tapping time on polished floorboardswaiting till the sun goes down.let’s forget the slings and arrows,and we’ll rosin up the bow!call the tune and pay the piperso he’ll play a song we know.pay respect and pay attentionwhen you pay a living wageto the slatterns in the kitchenand the yokels on the stage.if you’ll be my two-bar pickup,i’ll play rhythm to your lead,and we’ll truck across the ballroomas our righteous feet take speed.cut a rug or cut a caper,if you’ll just cut to the chase –  get your picture in the paperwhere the footling folk embrace.you can cross my palm with silver,since i’m easily led to gold,and i’ll be your major minertill the kingdom’s keys are sold.here’s a penny for your thoughtsand a dollar for your day,but that’s what you get for thinkingwhen you dance the night away. march 28, 2006<< previousnext >>

goodbye to pete

the floodlit fountain in the winter pondlighting the water from underneathlifts a plume of chill spray into the teethof a sleety wind across the trees to the road beyond.the same road, the same sleet, and the same nightunroll before the wheels of your decrepit car.the radio is on. you’re content where you are,with a hand on the wheel, at the edge of my sight.the lighter flicks to a cupped cigarette underyour face, and the smoke blows out the window vent.you turn and grin. it makes me wonderhow you could be gone, and where the years went.the words will come, but words are no good.you were patient and loyal and good and true.the heart must go where no words could:on this side of the veil is no likeness of you.the ground has been closed now, and there you lie,breathing the sod from underneath,while above you grass blades bend in the teethof a chill wind, with a few flakes flickering by.the ground has been closed; the world waits for the sun.some have tomorrows. some must wakeand roll away the stone. it is for their sakethe verses continue, the song not quite done. february 28, 2006<< previousnext >>

song of determinance

the early leaves must steal the sun;the roots must drink the rain.so call the tune for everyoneto sing the sad refrain:as prescience in retrospect,the seasons must unfold.the word devolves to dialect;the new brings forth the old.as footprints to your snowy bootyour wandering steps precede,noble events along their routethe churlish moments lead.so things must be the way they are;there is no other choice.no use to wish upon a star.no need to raise your voice.                                        decide instead to make believewhat freedom would provide.decide to practice to deceive.pretend you can decide. february 28, 2005<< previousnext >>

the love song of anne hedonia

i vow that i will learn to love dysphoria:you surely will become my latest craze!the question must be: how do i adore you?it’s too much work for me to count the ways. so here’s to misery! i salute you,a succotash of suffering to behold,and pray that no morsel of joy pollute you,nor ever turn my woeful lead to gold. bring on the armies of lugubriation!each gloomy foe i will embrace as friend,and so await with dread anticipationthe melancholic dirge that knows no end. my head is in the sand. my ass is in a sling.discomfort, ‘tis of thee! of thee i sing.  february 23, 2005<< previousnext >>

temporal jigsaws

look back at one whose whole life lay ahead,the tolerant master of unfolding time,a future locutor of words unsaidnot yet supine in any unmade bednor revenant to uncommitted crime.look back and claim a prize now judged complete.see,  instead of a looming ouverture,an oeuvre borne by an oaf on stumbling feetheadlong downstairs to crash into the street,a fallen egg past any hope or cure.will men and horses put this puzzle righthere on the table? and under a chair:the missing piece! a wedge of summer lightslips into place. observe this gorgeous nightand depart, to take refreshment elsewhere. october 15, 2004<< previousnext >>

remembering shelagh

of the many who knew the many of youthere were few enough who knew you well,and of the stories that are ours to tell,a myriad versions, and all of them true:a gutsiness of life and love,an eyebrow arched, a toss of the hair,the level gaze and the withering stare,a fist of iron in a velvet glove.mother and daughter, sister and friend:how shall we cope with your laughter gone?too lately begun to have reached this end,a spring afternoon on a shaded lawn.accept if you will this bitter rhyme,and be with us here this one last time. may 8, 2003<< previousnext >>

vernal rebus

translucent gold in the canopy;raspberries and cream at eye level throughout the woods;damp underfoot and damp overhead;the necessity of a verb:a newly-awakened tree frogbalances on a flimsy branch, while belowthe coil of a black racer unwindsan iridescent rivulet across the asphaltin search of the warmth froma newly-emergent sun.                                     just down the hillthe scattered petals of peach blossomseddy in a placid pool before drainingin a trickle between twin banks of new growth.read it from the script; chant it; shout it;celebrate in counterpoint with the wrenall the secret blessings of the light! april 10, 2003<< previousnext >>
