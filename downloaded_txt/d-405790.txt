one family one passion

 











we are familyfrom the beginning larkin was built with both love for dance and family core values. and after 74 years, nothing about that has changed. each fall it's thrilling to see so many children and grandchildren of former larkin dancers beginning their own journey with dance.larkin has been and will continue to be committed to the integrity of learning, loving and teaching the art of dance. through discipline and hard work in a loving family environment is how our dancers achieve their goal.
