casting pearls before swine



“do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. if you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces." ~ matthew 7:6. i'm just casting pearls of wisdom before swine liberals, knowing in advance they think they're too smart to agree.

we need to march







"words without actions are the assassins of idealism." ~ herbert hoover

i've been thinking. i was listening to the alan colmes radio program a few days ago, and he was literally laughing at a liberal caller who mentioned she was planning on joining a "march on washington". he asked her what she hoped to accomplish by marching on washington, and the poor, misguided woman couldn't answer his question. she didn't know. she just wanted to be part of something. he went on to explain that these marches and rallies on washington never accomplish anything. 

that started me thinking.

alan colmes is wrong! actually, it was the anti-war marches and rallies in washington that motivated nixon to surrender in vietnam. they really do work! 
with that in mind, i've decided that possibly, if we can get enough people involved, we could motivate congress to start impeachment proceedings against obama, and maybe even convince them to repeal obamacare, do whatever is necessary to prevent illegal immigration, stop this reckless overspending, etc.liberal mobs have been marching and protesting since at least the 60's and they have been effective at making changes in governmental and public policies, and they are still making big differences. look, for instance, at the "gay rights" movement. how else could 1-2% of the population force lawmakers into passing laws that effectively violate our first amendment right to free exercise of religion?mobs. you'd think after 5-6 decades conservatives would learn.it's high time conservatives adopt these tactics. we need to march on washington. we need to stage rallies, we need to break windows. we need to make noise. we need to do whatever it takes to turn our country around and return it to the constitutional republic the founders envisioned. we need to hound our representatives until they acquiesce. 

the squeaky wheel gets the grease.yes, i know we have the tea party, but frankly, the tea party is too polite. that's why they are marginalized. we conservatives need to get rude and loud, and force these lawmakers to do the job we elected them to do.

some thoughts on the zimmerman trial





george zimmerman is a dead man.

whether he is killed by some racist thug in retaliation for the death of trayvon martin, or by his own hand, he is, effectively, a dead man.

the new black panthers have placed a $10,000.00 bounty on his head (dead or alive), his address, phone number, and even his social security number have been posted on the internet.

obama, eric holder, jesse jackson, and al sharpton have pronounced him guilty regardless of the verdict, and all their willing accomplices in the media are fanning the flames.

he can run, and he will, but he cannot hide.

he will probably not live to the end of the year.







this is a photo of george zimmerman taken when the verdict in his trial was announced.

 is this the face of a man who is happy?

does he look haughty or proud?

 does this look even reflect relief that his ordeal is finally over?

no, this is the face of a man who knows his trouble is just beginning.

i would say all these idiots that still proclaim his guilt will someday have to answer to their creator for their arrogance in presuming zimmerman to be guilty in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, but they don't care. all they care about is fomenting racial hatred and division.

i feel for george zimmerman.

 george zimmerman dated a black girl in high school. he even took her to the prom. he defended a homeless black man against the police. he tutored black children in his home in his free time.

that is not the face of a racist.

however, thanks to the race baiters and our racist president all the way down to the prosecutor and judge that tried him, along with their willing accomplices in the media, he might well be a racist now.

who would blame him?

 anyone who still believes george zimmerman is a racist or a murderer or a racist murderer in spite of all the evidence to the contrary is an idiot.

god is love, but love is not god





"thou shalt have no other gods before me." ~ exodus 20:3

neil simpson, of eternity matters blog, often blogs opposition to gay marriage, or, as he calls it, "oxymoronic same sex marriage", a more accurate description. he correctly points out there are no verses or passages anywhere in the bible that refer to homosexual relationships in an affirmative way. the only times the bible mentions homosexuality is to call it sin.

  god is love, but love is not god. neither should love ever be confused with lust.

homosexual activists' (and their supporters) argue that god would somehow approve of the homosexual lifestyle as long as it is a "loving" relationship. and, they are right to say two people in love have every right to get married. 

the problem with that argument is this: two men or two women cannot love each other in the way a heterosexual couple can. what they're doing is confusing love with lust. in romans 1, paul testifies that because men had iniquity in their hearts, and rejected god, "god gave them up unto vile affections: for even the women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another."

read that again. they burned in their lust.

just as there is no verse or passage in the bible that refers to homosexuality favorably, there is no verse that equates lust and love. none.

lust should never be confused with love. they are not the same.

but this is exactly what homosexuals and their enablers do. 

i have often said homosexuality violates seven of the ten commandments. what is the first commandment? 

"thou shalt have no other gods before me."

when anyone places more importance on their own selfish desires than they do god, they have made those desires their god. that violates the first commandment. 

homosexuals make lust their god.

 i have often said i don't care if homosexuals marry each other or not, as long as they don't insist i approve.

why do i say that? because, marriage is a union between a man and a woman. it is never a union between anything else. be it two men, two women, man and animal, more than two of any gender, etc, therefore, what homosexuals do is not a marriage, no matter how many times they insist it is.

all this is not to say i personally hate homosexuals. i don't. i don't even dislike them. in fact, the ones i know personally, i like very much. i consider them friends. i will go so far as to say i love them, as i should. with brotherly love. and, yes, agape love.

but i do not lust after them.

what person, if he sees his friend about to willfully commit an act of self destruction would not do whatever he can to prevent his friend from destroying himself? 

what kind of friend would encourage, and even help his friend destroy himself? 

yet that is exactly what homosexual activists and their supporters are doing when they encourage homosexuals to continue to violate god's precepts. 

i'm sorry, but that is not the actions of a friend.

when i write these posts, i am not writing out of hate for homosexuals. i am under an obligation to god to reach homosexuals for christ, and to save them from themselves.

god is, in fact, love. but, love is not god. 

those who support the homosexual agenda need to understand that concept.

an inspirational poem





my mother passed away on march 28 this year at the age of 92. my oldest brother, who is a retired foreign missionary,  preached her memorial service, and, during his sermon, he mentioned a poem my mother had written.

today, another of my brothers sent me an e-mail. he had found mom's poem, so i thought i'd share it with you here:



song of the butterfly



i crawled upon a mirror

and sighed, in deep distress.

but mama said, "remember,

god's not finished with you yet!"



and so i waited, day by day,

but thought 'twould never be

that god could e'er make anything

of a miserable worm like me.



but then, one day, would you believe?

my ugly coat, so dull and dry,

fell off, and underneath were wings

and i found that i could fly!



and now, the sky's my limit

i praise the lord on high!

his perfect plan completed--

now i'm a butterfly!



even if you think you've failed,

be patient. wait and see

what god can do, for he alone

knows all that you can be.

obama's silence






"a liberal is a person whose interests aren't at stake at the moment." ~ willis player 

three times, while a state senator in illinois, barack hussein obama, voted against the born alive infant protection act. this act would have provided medical care for  babies who survived abortion attempts. not only did obama vote against the legislation, he argued passionately in favor of killing live babies.

you'll no doubt remember how quickly obama rushed to make a statement after a black university professor complained of police harassment, saying the police, "acted stupidly". 

then there was the trayvon martin case. it only took a month before obama inserted himself into that case. remember? he famously said, "if i had a son, he would look like trayvon martin", which inflamed racial tension, in spite of absolutely no evidence there was any racism involved in the case. 

after the sandy hook massacre, it was a mere four hours before obama launched himself into the gun control controversy. 

 unfortunately, every time obama makes a statement, he comes down on the wrong side of the fence.

the case of the murderous kermit gosnell has been covered by conservative media and conservative blogs for twenty seven months, and his trial is ongoing. conservatives have been asking ad nauseum, "why isn't obama saying anything about this tragedy?"

the answer to that question can be found above in the first paragraph. and, yes, it is that simple.

richard armour defines a "mugwump" as  someone who sits with their mug on one side of the fence, and their wump on the other. 

obama isn't a mugwump. he's just a wump.

gun control






"the one clear thread that unites all the mass murders currently being exploited by the democrats is that they were committed by visibly crazy people who were unaccountably not institutionalized." ~ ann coulter

i think many times, certain legislation introduced by liberals is too often dismissed by conservatives simply because it was proposed by a liberal. just like a broken clock that is right twice a day, sometimes liberals have good ideas. such is the case with asking for background checks before a gun purchase.

 background checks wouldn't prevent gun violence, of course, but they couldn't hurt.

i also don't think anything in anyone's background should prevent a gun purchase except for a history of mental illness.

guns, as we have often been reminded, don't kill people, but crazy people use guns to kill people. ann coulter, in her latest column, points out that the sandy hook shooting is only the latest in a series of mass murders that have been carried out by crazy people. 

all of these latest mass murders have been committed by crazy people. 

if crazy people can be prevented from buying guns, there is a chance that some mass murders can be prevented. not a big chance, i emphasize, but a chance.

now. imagine that there is a background check to check for mental illness required to purchase a gun. even if the prospective gun owner doesn't have a history of mental illness, that would require a waiting period.

a waiting period is a minor inconvenience, but it could prevent other types of shootings

 now imagine a disgruntled employee who gets angry enough at his boss  to want to kill him.  he goes to a gun shop, purchases a gun, and shoots up his place of business.

many of these types of crimes are committed by someone who is not necessarily crazy, but is angry enough to suspend reason. that kind of angry subsides in time. a waiting period would prevent some crimes committed in the heat of passion. 

no doubt mass murders will still happen. crazy people can get guns in other ways, and in fact, usually do. adam lanza stole his mother's gun. guns can be purchased on street corners illegally. and, guns can be stolen. 

so, mass shootings will still happen even with background checks. 

at the worst, requiring a background check specifically for a history of mental illness is an inconvenience

but, it can't hurt.

what's happening






"when peace, like a river, attendeth my way. 
when sorrows, like sea billows roll. 
whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say, 
'it is well, it is well with my soul'" ~ horatio spafford*

some of my readers likely already know this, but since last november, i have neglected my blogging in favor of posting my thoughts on facebook. facebook has allowed me to get in touch with old friends and acquaintances from my past, such as high school friends and people who grew up in the same neighborhood as i did. it has been, overall, a wonderful experience, and many of those long lost acquaintances have become close friends. many of them i didn't even know well back then.

on the other hand, posting my thoughts, especially my thoughts on religion and politics, on facebook have made enemies of some of my old respected friends and relatives, and that is an unfortunate consequence i never intended.

recently, my brother told me he wouldn't be surprised if i wasn't on the secret service's "people to watch" list for all my political facebook posts. 

so, i'm back blogging. my blog doesn't automatically appear on everyone's newsfeed  whether they like it or not. i think a blog is a better medium for political thoughts.

ok. this is what's been happening: my short term memory is not so good, so i won't go all the way back to november, and will only highlight the major events in my life since march. 

in march of this year, two major events were going on around here. one good, one not. 

1. the men's basketball team from the college i attended, wichita state university, earned a spot in the ncaa basketball tournament, and actually advanced all the way to the final four teams before finally losing to louisville university, thanks to a couple of bad calls by the referees near the end. we lost by a mere 4 points. louisville eventually won the championship by six points over michigan. personally, i believe that tells us something. i leave it to my readers to ascertain what.

2. my 92 year old mother, who has been in a care home since last year, took a rather sudden turn for the worse. while her memory has been slipping somewhat for the past few years, she suddenly began getting more and more confused. i visited her at the home every week. up until march 14, she had been almost as sharp as ever, but on that day, i found her wheeling her wheelchair out of the care home dining room as if she were going back to her room, but she was going the opposite direction. when i tried to wheel her back to her room, she placed her hands on the wheels and said, "no!" but, she couldn't tell me what she wanted, she would start to say something, and then it was as if she forgot what she started to say.

this was distressing for me, because she had always been so strong, so smart, and now, she was slipping. fast. she was awake and talking, but the light in her eyes was no longer there.i finally got her back into her room, and conversation between us was short. she wasn't thinking clearly. i told her i loved her and she told me she loved me, too, but when i attempted to leave, she pleaded with me to stay. "don't leave me", she said. but i really had to go, and i felt horrible about having to leave. in retrospect, i guess i should have just stayed there until she fell asleep. under the circumstances i know my wife would have understood why i wasn't home in time. i still feel a little guilty about that.

the next week she seemed improved, and we had a better conversation. twice, though, she said, "i want to go home." i didn't know if she was talking about her earthly home or her heavenly home and she didn't explain. all i could think of to say in reply was, "i know,  mom." at this point mom had a moment of clarity. she kind of smiled and looked me straight in the eye, and said, "oh, how do you know that?"

the next week, i received a call from my brother, telling me i had better come to the home, because it looked m  like mom might not live through the day. i went, and found her lying in bed comatose, and, except for occasionally squeezing my hand, unresponsive. she didn't die that day, in fact, she lived another week, and finally, on march 28, she passed quietly into eternity to walk with jesus. 

i am not sad. i am rather envious of her, in a way.

the same evening my mom passed away, the shockers defeated the ap number one ranked team in the nation, gonzaga, propelling them into the "elite eight" in the ncaa tournament. i watched it on television. that was fun.

 immediately after the game, i heard strange noises coming from my bedroom. investigating, i found my wife lying across the bed, flat on her back, her head tilted back, her eyes and mouth open, and she was making noises, alternately snoring with each intake of breath, and a kind of whining sound with each outtake. i couldn't wake her up, and i began to be concerned so i called 911. shortly the paramedics arrived, and, in short order, determined her blood sugar was dangerously low. it registered 31. they administered glucose or sucrose or some kind of sugary substance through iv and brought her around, and then, transported her to the hospital. 

i lost my mother, and nearly lost my wife in the same day! my wife spent the next three days in the hospital and i was able to bring her home on easter sunday. she was able to attend my mother's memorial service with me the following thursday.

mom's memorial service was a celebration service. she was so close to the lord throughout her lifetime that no one has any doubts she is in heaven now, and  my entire family is happy for her. there were no tears shed at her service except tears of joy. my oldest brother, a retired foreign missionary and pastor, officiated at her graveside service. all of my 5 brothers and sisters came from all over the country to participate in mom's last farewell.  

it was the first time since 1979 all 6 of us were together at the same time in the same place. what a blessing it was to be able to get together and swap memories and jokes with them all!

all in all, a very eventful march. 

let's hope april and the rest of this year go better. i will resume my introspective political posts later.

*i requested "it is well" be played at my mother's service. it is my favorite hymn, and i want it to be played at mine.

america is doomed








"all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing" ~ edmund burke


unfortunately, mr. burke's quotation was a prediction that has come true. good men have done nothing, or at least, not enough to change the inevitable. i have recently come to the conclusion that conservatism is doomed. there will be no more conservative republican presidents. evil has triumphed. 

here are my reasons:

 1. illegal aliens. the democrats are within reach of legalizing illegal aliens. it is only a matter of time. there aren't enough conservative voices out there to stop them. polls show illegal aliens, if allowed to vote in the united states' elections, would vote overwhelmingly democrat. democrats have been pushing "immigration reform". this is a term meaning illegals attaining american citizenship without having to go through the legal process. legalizing illegal aliens will create a block of democrat voters that will make any and all democrat candidates unbeatable.

 2. voter fraud. even without the illegal alien vote, democrats have the majority of the votes in elections sewn up, as long as they can prevent any more states from instituting voter id laws. in the last presidential election, the only states with majority votes cast for the republican candidate, mitt romney, were the states that had voter id laws. every state that obama carried did not have them. the reason democrats are so opposed to voter id laws is because those laws make it much more difficult to commit voter fraud. if an individual voter is allowed to vote multiple times for one candidate because they aren't required to prove who they are, and required to prove they already voted once, especially if hundreds, or even thousands are doing it, their candidate will win. thus, democratic candidates are assured victory.

 3. public school indoctrination. even if, somehow, democrats fail to legalize illegal aliens, and even if all the states have voter id laws (which won't happen), there are other guarantees that voters will vote democrat candidates into office. many of the current voters are baby boomers, or older. the voters who actually understand why communism is anti-liberty are dying out.the government school system has been working diligently to create democrats in numbers unparalleled. they use revisionist history and push socialism as a preferred system of government. public schools have been teaching students what to think and not how to think for a couple of decades now. they are turning out low information and democrat voters in astonishing numbers.

 4. the media. the media are complicit in this re-education of america. if they report anything detrimental to democrats at all they twist it and spin it to make it appear as if the republicans are the bad guys. any news that would harm the democrat agenda is either under reported or ignored. the only way the conservative message will be heard by the under informed voters (which is rapidly becoming the majority), is by accident. political facebook posts and posts on other social media such as twitter, etc, are the only way the truth is getting out there and getting any exposure to the public. unfortunately, people who participate in such social media are free to "unfriend" or ignore messages that are unpleasant. if they'd rather read recipes and look at pictures of cats, they can do that and never have to think at all.

 i hate to say this, but it appears the only hope for this country now, is to let socialism win. once this country is totally communist, these same low information democratic voters will finally understand what oppression and loss of liberty and freedom really means. once the realization of what the people have done to themselves sets in, the only ultimate solution is revolt.

a change that offers no hope






“the government consists of a gang of men exactly like you and me. they have, taking one with another, no special talent for the business of government; they have only a talent for getting and holding office. their principle device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they can’t get and to promise to give it to them.” – h.l. mencken

all of these opinions and theory's of why obama won and romney lost are getting us nowhere. the whole and only reason why romney lost the election, clearly, is massive voter fraud. 

the evidence is ubiquitous. 

incidents of voter fraud are like cockroaches. if you see one, you know there are thousands more behind the baseboards. and, so far, there is evidence of massive voter fraud nationwide.

 there's the facebooker who bragged that he's already voted 5 times for obama and plans on voting more. 



then, the thousands of votes cast over and above the number of actual registered voters in several states (states which, coincidentally, did not enact a photo id requirement to register), and, curiously, mostly for obama. 

entire precincts that, strangely, had no votes cast for romney at all! 

not to mention those polling places that had armed black panthers standing at the entrances intimidating voters. 

these cannot be mere coincidences.

unfortunately, there is little recourse. there is  little chance the votes will ever be recounted. 


there is no chance the system will ever be fixed so long as the election boards are controlled by a government that is corrupt from the president all the way down to the local dogcatcher.

that's my opinion.



so far, you can still feel free to disagree with me in this country, but one wonders how long we will still enjoy that freedom, and the others freedoms we currently take for granted, such as freedom of religion (not from religion) and the right to bear arms.

enjoy your rights while you still have them.


if the unscrupulous can already control the election outcome, there's no stopping them from total control of the electorate

what i don't understand part 2






what i don't understand is why so many otherwise intelligent american citizens don't get a simple concept: 

people who earn over $250,000 a year are the business owners; the ones that create the jobs. if taxes are raised on these business owners/job creators, they will not continue to offer their goods and services at the same prices. they will not accept losses in their bottom line, no matter how patriotic they are! and, that bottom line is profit. 

there are only two ways a business can recoup the loss of profit due to higher taxes: 

1. they will raise the prices on their goods and services. they will have to to keep their profit margin at the same levels as before the higher taxes were levied upon them. 

do you think they will give themselves a cut in pay? dream on, little liberal. 

and, when they raise the prices on their goods and services, the consumer will not buy those goods or services as readily as they would have if the prices were still low, thus, making it necessary for the business owner to raise the prices yet again to compensate for the loss of sales. this cycle  will continue on and on and on until the business goes bankrupt and/or out of business, or, 

2. the business owner will begin to lay off employees because he can no longer afford to pay them. if that happens, there are less people employed and, consequently,  less people who can afford the higher prices started because the business owner had to pay ever increasing higher taxes. this will undoubtedly happen to enough business owners that it will have a lasting impact on each and everyone of us, the taxpaying public.

in the end, due to ever increasing taxes, higher and higher prices on goods and services, and more people on the unemployment rolls, the government is all that is left to provide for the people. 

now, here's a question for all you big government loving liberals:

how does the government provide for the ever increasing number of newly unemployed and newly impoverished citizens? where do they get the funds? 

naturally, by increasing taxes on the rich again, which merely exacerbates the problem the government was trying to solve in the first place.

then, what do we have? government trying to stretch all the revenue generated by less and less taxes collected from the few businesses fortunate enough to still be in business despite such a heavy burden of taxes and redistributed to take care of the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, that the government itself put out of work. 

it will mean breadlines every bit as long as those that afflicted the soviet union in the mid 20th century.

do you understand, liberals? if you do, will you be so anxious to vote for a tax and spend liberal again?

sadly, i still don't think you get it yet. 

that's what i don't understand.

more hope and change





for the record: i don't believe the re-election of obama is the end of america as we know it.

 i do believe we are in for some radical changes now that he has "more flexibility".

 in spite of our fears and apprehensions, i think the majority of congress is still patriotic, and will only stand for his attempt to "fundamentally transform america" for so long, and then, they will see the what direction he is going and will stop supporting his socialistic-islamist policies.

 he cannot fundamentally change america into either of those anti-american states without the cooperation of the congress, and while he has the support of most of the democrat representatives and senators, there is only so much he can do and still have the amount of support he needs to accomplish his goal.

 of course, he can still issue executive order after executive order to bypass congress, but there is a limit to what he can get away with. even the congressmen who actively support his liberal socialistic agenda will not let him continue to make congress irrelevant.

 they have their pride and aspirations, too. they won't take to being ignored for long.

 then, there's all the allegations of corruption festering just outside the white house doors. he and his willing accomplices in the media can only fend off the truth for so long, and four years is a long time.

 the old adage, "give him enough rope,and he will hang himself" comes to mind.

 we can no longer vote him out, but we can still impeach him out.

truths about liberals

1.  always expect the worst from a liberal and you will never be surprised.2.  never try to reason with a liberal.  they disregard any evidence that conflicts with their beliefs.3.  you can always tell what liberals are up to by what they accuse you of doing.4.  liberals don't debate, they argue.5. the only standards liberals have are double standards.6.  liberals feel, conservatives think.7.  whenever you don't understand a liberal's motives, just look for the money.8.  liberals cannot be embarrassed.  they lack the gene to blush.9.  the liberal creed is, "do as i say, not as i do.10. liberals get older, but they never get smarter.11. there are no honest liberals. if they were honest -- especially to themselves -- they would not be liberal.12. a liberal's business is nobody's business, but everyone's business is a liberal's business.13. liberals have an inflated sense of self-worth. they are like house flies that criticize the air-worthiness of a stealth fighter. (sarah, palin, george w. bush, ad infinitum are morons.)14. liberals lack a sixth sense that is standard equipment in conservatives -- common sense.15. liberals never stop hating.16. there are only two types of liberals -- the deceivers and the deceived.17.  every time liberals get on their high horse, they get bucked off.18. liberal programs are so wonderful that they have to be forced on people.19. liberals always choke on their own medicine.20. when given a moral choice, liberals always come down on the wrong side of the fence.21. the only way liberals can build themselves up is by tearing others down.22. liberals not only refuse to admit their mistakes, they refuse to learn from them.23. liberals can dish it out, but they can't take it.24. liberals are incapable of attacking the message, so they always attack the messenger.25. liberal diversity is only skin deep.h/t lone ranger
