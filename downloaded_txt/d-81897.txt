the back story -

        in the spring of 2014, i spent a few days in massachusetts completing
        an instructor's course in the "art is 4 every1" teaching technique for
        painting in acrylics.  this is a method that mimics my own style of
        painting, but in a greatly simplified way that truly anyone can learn
        to paint by.  beginners enjoy the fact that they do not need to know
        how to draw nor mix colors to create an impressive original of their
        own.  for students with more experience, i utilize my own painting
        experience to bring the detail of my instruction up to a level they
        can better benefit from.

        in order to complete my certification in the "art is 4 every1" course,
        i needed to select a half-dozen new students and work with them until
        they each completed an original painting.  during the summer of 2014,
        i invited six adult friends to challenge themselves and become my
        first students in private lessons.  they succeeded magnificently!

see paintings here!

        since that time, i have also worked with a student as young as age 11,
        luly - who has completed 4 excellent original paintings and is still
        going strong.  the young ladyâs mother and aunt are so impressed with
        her progress that now they are both students of mine, as well, and
        producing wonderful artwork of their own.

about mike...
a self-taught artist, mike enjoys making a career of what comes naturally; the care and passion he puts into creating his acrylic and oil paintings are echoed in their high realism and fine detail. landscapes of the northeast are those he most prefers to capture, and his artwork is representative of his desire to preserve and share those moments of beauty we too often overlook.

          the home and studio of fine artist mike mayone lie nestled in east middlebury, vermont, where the green mountains meet the lake champlain valley. surrounded by such abundant subject matter, it's little wonder that the majority of mike's refreshingly peaceful paintings involve scenes of rural vermont and often include local architecture as well.

          mike offers original artwork, limited edition prints and fine art note cards directly and through his website, as well as art galleries, selected retailers, and solo and group shows. mike also exhibits with several vermont associations, and his work has appeared in international publications and the collections of many satisfied fine art customers coast to coast and internationally.

testimonials -
        following are the testimonials from my first 6 students:

howard's testimonial -

        being a self-taught artist myself for the past 20 years, i'm amazed at
        what i learned from mike in a short period of time during my classes
        with him.

        specifically, i learned patience, dry brush technique, blending to
        soften, paint mixing and attention to detail.  my class time flew by
        because mike made the whole experience so enjoyable.  needless to say,
        i am pleased with my finished product and can't thank mike enough for
        teaching me.

linda's testimonial -

        the highlight of my summer has been my art class with mike mayone.  i
        was a total beginner and somewhat skeptical that i would be able to do
        a painting that would be any good.  much to my surprise, my painting
        of an iris far exceeded my expectations and i surprised myself that i
        had done it.  of course, under mike's teaching i was able to do this.
        he was instructive and very patient, which was good for me because i
        had much to learn.  i feel he is an excellent teacher and will
        recommend him for future classes.

        i am very grateful for this experience and love my painting.  thanks mike!!!

lorrie's testimonial -

        an afternoon delight

        i recently learned how to spend very enjoyable afternoons in mike
        mayoneâs studio.  i was taking painting lessons.  i learned how to mix
        colors for shading and highlighting, what brushes would be best for
        each task, how to clean a brush properly, the dry brush technique of
        shading.  so many things that go into making a beautiful piece of art
        work.  under his watchful eye, i came home with a satisfactory piece
        that he has named lorrieâs lilies.  i would encourage anyone to give
        it a try.  he has a lot of patience and helpful suggestions that can
        make a neophyte feel like a true artist!

anne's testimonial -

        mike has been a long time friend and neighbor.  when he offered to
        give me painting lessons as part of his art teaching course, i eagerly
        accepted.  i felt i knew nothing of painting from school art classes,
        and remember distastefully getting a d in jr. high.  we met weekly for
        a couple months, working on our piece.  mike was very good about
        scheduling our time in advance, and being prepared when the time came.

        as a new instructor, i found mike to be very encouraging, supportive
        and guiding, and knowledgeable about what he was teaching.  mike
        guided me in the selection of what i would paint, following my
        interest.  he had a simple and clear method for approaching the
        overall painting, and gave specific instruction, for example, on
        different brush techniques,  that would best capture our topic.
        several sessions in, i realized that painting with him felt easy, as
        he gave guidance and gradually released responsibility for me to take
        more lead, as i was ready.  mike gave support or scaffolding, such as
        with mixing paint color and words for what strokes would work best,
        which passed his painting expertise on to my painting.  when i entered
        each day, my painting's amazing progress was displayed.  what a
        remarkable painting mike's teaching allowed me to create.

becky's testimonial -

        learning to paint

        i would like to thank mike mayone for opening my eyes to the
        possibility and joys of painting. before mikeâs help, i had no clue
        where to begin with a painting: top, bottom, foreground, background,
        or upside down. i had no understanding of layering techniques; how to
        make a tree a tree. mikeâs encouragement, enthusiasm, and patience
        made the lessons fly by. i have a new perspective for everything
        around me. i look forward to continuing learning how to paint,
        something i never dreamed i could do.

        thanks, mike

        such a welcoming discovery,

        - becky h.

paula's testimonial -

        it is with great pleasure that i write this testimonial on behalf of
        mike mayone.

        painting is an activity that i always wished i could do.  i recall
        watching bob ross on the television, admiring what he could create in
        such a short time.  his "happy little trees" made me smile.  i thought
        he made it look so easyâ¦.. "why canât i do that?"

        despite my hearing from many, over the years, "anyone can paint", i
        never tried it.  instead, i filed it away in the back of my mind until
        my thoughts were challenged over it by mike mayone.  i could be one of
        his six students, a perfect opportunity.

        at the first lesson, i looked at many of his pictures in the studio.
        quietly thinking i could never be able to paint like this, i quickly
        dismissed the thought.  i am just starting with zero painting
        experience.

        by the second lesson, i found myself looking at the world and nature
        differently.  i looked at flowers and leaves, flowing rivers, the
        billowy clouds, the sunsets, and trees on the top of mountains.  i
        mentioned this to mike, who smiled and told me that now i had begun to
        see things through artistsâ eyes.  indeed, an awakening to the
        simplest things in our beautiful world.

        the time working in his studio flew by very quickly.  it was a
        pleasure to learn from him.  i feel fortunate that i was given the
        opportunity to be one of his students.  i could not ask for a better
        coach, a true professional and a delight to work with.

        mike instilled a confidence in me when i needed it and gentle
        corrections, many gentle corrections when needed.  he is a kindhearted
        and patient teacher.  unruffled, he has an ability to suppress
        annoyance, for example, when having to tell me many times "look at the
        (reference) photo".

        i learned that i could paint my own "happy little trees".  now, some
        were more of a challenge than others to do, but still, not that hard
        to do.  what a joy it was to receive mikeâs guidance on my first,
        lovely painting of a covered bridge.  there is no doubt in my mind, he
        will be an excellent painting instructor.

        mike, thank you so much.  whenever i view my picture, i will think of
        you and how you helped make it possible.  please know that i am most
        sincerely grateful to you for your generous time, traveling this road
        and making the journey together.

        warmest regards,

        paula m.
