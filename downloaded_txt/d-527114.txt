aabp president, dr. dave sjeklocha
is there any way you can do better?













the american association of bovine practitioners (aabp) is an international association composed of over 5,000 veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and veterinary students interested in bovine (cattle) medicine. aabp was founded in 1965 as a not-for-profit 501c6 organization. the vision of aabp is to serve society as leaders in cattle health, welfare, and productivity.
 




the mission of the aabp is to provide support, continuing education, and advocacy for current and future veterinary professionals and the cattle they serve.
 
   

     







as leaders in the cattle industry, we encourage all veterinarians, credentialed veterinary technicians, or veterinary students with an interest in cattle to join aabp. we welcome and support any veterinary professional, regardless of race, ethnicity, color, national origin, sex, religion, sexual orientation, or any other demographic, to participate in all opportunities that our organization provides.
