an ultrawide monitor is far better than the average 24” and 27” monitors and we’ll explain why below.
why ultrawide monitor?
one is obvious: a wider screen. a wider screen means you get more screen space and a wider aspect ratio (21:9 compared to 16:9).
and more workspace means you get more work done at the same time. editing music is a very delicate and complicated job and this means every little bit of detail helps. but exactly how big is the difference?
