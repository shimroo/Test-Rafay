welcome to the toc’s website(click here for spanish)toc is march 8, 2025 at del oro high school, loomis, ca  welcome to the 56th annual northern california tournament of champions wrestling tournament. organized and founded in 1969 by paul mello and dick harrah, the toc was originally sponsored by the georgetown rotary club. the nor cal toc was conceived to bring together the very best young wrestlers in northern california. over the years, several high school state champions and place winners, ncaa champions and place winners, and even olympic wrestlers have experienced the excitement of participating and succeeding in this prestigious tournament. recognized as the most competitive junior high tournament in california, we at georgetown school, northside school, golden sierra junior/senior high school, and del oro high school are proud to welcome you to join us in celebrating the camaraderie and personal challenge that has made the toc such a fun tournament to host.  while everyone entered does not win the championship or one of our special custom medals, all of these competitors are truly fine athletes who deserve our highest respect for their efforts. please remember to applaud and cheer their efforts and to congratulate them for choosing to participate in the outstanding discipline of wrestling. few sports require the hard work and dedication that it takes to become a wrestler, with one-on-one competitions that test your strength of body, mind, will, athletic skill, and personal pride to do your best as you stand out on the mat alone for all the world to see. wrestlers truly are unique. thanks for coming and enjoy the tournament. rod hedlundtoc director
