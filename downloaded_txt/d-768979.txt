labyrinth walk for peace
                  by pam fichtner
can you imagine stepping into the past but being fully in the present? moving through space, with intention and focus, one breath and one footstep at a time? or, just allowing your body to start at a beginning, following along into the centre and back, without much thought at all? to me, that’s what it feels like when walking in a labyrinth, connecting into an ancient ritual, yet within a contemporary space. it is a walking, waking meditation, a prayer, a modern-day pilgrimage.  it can be done silently or with music. labyrinths are ancient, archetypal symbols that have been found throughout the world in diverse shapes and sizes, dating from earliest times, although the exact origin is unknown.   it is an unicursal path that leads to a centre, both physically and metaphorically. one aspect that intrigues me about the labyrinths is the spiral, such an ancient symbol of life, death, and rebirth. it reminds us all of growth, expansion, change, and inter-connection. it is  also a circle which creates a space for containment, to allow for inner exploration, self-discovery, and enlightenment.  dawn guenther, who made a labyrinth, is drawn to these words from the internet, “as an ancient symbol of wholeness, the labyrinth combines the imagery of the circle and the spiral, into a meandering, but purposeful path. it represents a journey to our centre and back again out into the world.”

understanding the complex world of carbohydrates
                    by judith graile
for decades, carbohydrates have been at the center of dietary debates, often vilified as the enemy of weight loss and health. however, the reality is far more nuanced. like characters in a story, carbohydrates can play either hero or villain roles in our diet – it all depends on their source and processing. the good: complex carbohydrates and their essential role. our bodies, particularly our brains, rely on carbohydrates as their primary energy source. complex carbohydrates, found in whole, unprocessed foods, provide this energy while delivering a wealth of additional benefits: fibre-rich whole grains support digestive health and maintain steady blood sugar level; vegetables and legumes provide essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant; starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes, peas, potatoes, and squash offer sustained energy and vital nutrients. these "good carbs" work as your body's natural fuel system, releasing energy slowly and steadily throughout the day. they also support a healthy gut microbiome, which research increasingly shows is crucial for overall health, immunity, and even mental well-being.

conscious movement 
                    the key to health and body alignment
                    by lorrel elian
beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself. — coco chanel. conscious movement is a term i use often.  it’s through the verbal cues i use when teaching yoga, or in workshops, that reminds students to get back into their body and become aware of their alignment before proceeding. incorrect, or bad posture, and unconscious movement can be a damaging combination, and often is the root cause of physical and emotional pain. people are surprised by how much pain they’re actually carrying because they’ve become so used to suppressing it. what can be even shocking, is when they discover how it looks on them. not realizing that the price they’ve paid for years of grinning and bearing it has cost them their youth. 

crystals: the secrets of energy, frequency, and vibration
                    by maritza cano
nikola tesla once said, "if you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration." this statement captures the essence of crystals and their magic. these natural wonders formed deep within the earth are not merely beautiful objects, but powerful tools for connecting to the energetic essence of the universe. the science of crystals: crystals are a testament to the physical world's vibrational nature. all matter, including crystals, consists of atoms, which are made of smaller particles vibrating at specific frequencies. this vibration creates the physical manifestations we can see, touch, and feel. what makes crystals extraordinary is their ability to harmonize with the cosmic frequencies that surround us. their unique molecular structures allow them to receive, store, amplify, and transmit energy. crystals act as conduits for high-frequency energy, channelling it onto the earthly plane.

what is a doula and why do you need one?
                    by elisabeth van der wilt
what is a doula? dou·la /ˈdo͞olə/ – comes from the ancient greek term meaning a woman who serves. but now if you look up the meaning, it defines a trained woman who provides support during different times in a reproductive journey. a doula is never there to judge or provide bias to the choices you make. rather, we serve as a loving companion, encouraging, empowering, and supporting you during some of the most life-changing events. whether you're dealing with issues related to infertility, the difficulty of childbirth, adjusting to life after giving birth, or the menopause season, a doula can help you feel informed, confident, and cared for. often doulas are compared to a midwife, which couldn't be further from the truth. this is why it's best to share that a doula is a blend of roles: a coach, cheerleader, educator, ally, guide, comforter, and team builder all wrapped into one nice and neat package. 

open spaces: a place to rest, receive, and restore
                    by jenn paustian
it was always a part of her, continually expressing itself and drawing her attention inward in awe, wonder, and fascination...what was it? her incredible imagination; brimming with so much curiosity and depth that most often it was misunderstood as something uncontrollable, and thus it became a battlefield between safe havens, or dark underworlds. yet her imagination needed to soar, nonetheless, and it was truly magical. this surreal world would carry her through a journey too vast to comprehend, yet too brilliant to ignore; the journey of life! jenn is an extremely creative individual who loves stories, the beauty of nature surrounding her, whose fibres are interwoven into her heart, especially as it relates to water and the magnificent healing properties of it. 

caravan counselling can help you rewire your eating habits
                    the hidden hunger: unpacking the mystery of emotional eating
                    by giti caravan
picture this: it’s late at night, the world outside is silent, and your heart feels a little heavy. maybe the day wasn’t kind. a tense meeting at work, a misunderstanding with a friend, or the quiet weight of loneliness pressing down. you find yourself in the kitchen, the soft glow of the refrigerator light spilling onto the floor—your hand hovers over that tub of ice cream or bag of chips. you’re not physically hungry, but there’s a gnawing emptiness inside—a yearning for comfort, connection, something. this, my friends, is emotional eating. emotional eating is a deeply human experience. it’s not about weakness or a lack of self-control. it’s about filling a void that food can never truly satisfy. let’s dive deeper into this compelling, often misunderstood phenomenon.

editorial
                    by melva armstrong
another new year has arrived and i’m convinced it's going to be an exciting one. i’m looking forward to it, and i hope you are too. this past year has been quite a wild ride with lots of ups and downs. especially with the weather that has been acting like a yo-yo, going from one extreme to another. it’s been a challenge to make plans for travelling anywhere, with such uncertainty in the forecasts. all in all, the year just past has been a very interesting one, with lots of shifts and changes in the world consciousness, as well as with individual consciousness. i think more people are waking up and realizing the extreme importance of taking care of oneself, if we want our lives to be more balanced and whole. this issue we feature another series of articles that will hopefully provide much valuable information to help you in many positive ways on your life journey. it’s always an absolutely divine experience and pleasure working with the people who grace the pages of this, and each issue.
