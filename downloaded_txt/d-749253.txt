we invite you to share the unforgettable experience of christian worship and musical celebration at church in the forest. 



 



we are a multi-denominational church. our sunday worship draws on the christian traditions of our members and clergy. sermons are informed by scholarly and contemporary concerns. liturgical seasons are celebrated with splendor and mindfulness. music on sunday mornings stimulates another dimension of the experience of being in god’s light.
