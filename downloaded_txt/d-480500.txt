germany travel tip - the english garden in munich





the englische garten or english garden is a large urban public park that stretches from the city center to the northeastern city limits of munich, bavaria. with an area covering 3.7 square kilometers the english garden is one of the world's largest urban public parks. one of the most famous beer gardens of munich is located in the english garden at the chinese tower, which was built during the years 1789 - 1790. another very popular beer garden is the seehaus, lake house. it is beautifully situated next to the big lake, the kleinhesselohe see, in about 1 km distance to the chinese tower, also in the english garden. why not rent a pedal boat to discover the lake kleinhesselohe?




since 1789 munich, in bavaria, owns his english garden, a green oasis in the heart of the city. munich owes the english garden to an american, benjamin thompson. he was a bavarian minister of war and a social reformer. what a combination! originally the northern marshy land of the river isar was intended as a military garden; invested by the gardener friedrich ludwig von sckell. however, the thought of a national park was soon realized. agricultural use and education was given to the people in the park. thus model farms, tree schools, a sheep farm and an agriculture school were founded. in 1989 the english garden celebrated his 200 year old existence with a spectacular cultural program. the english garden has retained its natural beauty and romantic wildness as a garden for the citizens.

one of the most famous and popular beer gardens of munich is located right in the heart of the english garden, around the chinese tower or pagoda. this is also the most colorful beer garden and has a lot to offer for ones eyes and ears. often you will hear the sounds of a brass band playing live from the first floor of the chinese tower. as soon as the warm sunbeams appear, local folks will enjoy their first maß beer of the season. (in bavaria it is common to order beer by a maß and this means a liter!) as it gets warmer, more and more visitors from the nearby university, locals and international guests will enjoy the weather, companionship, the great local food and off course dive into the ancient tradition of the bavarian beer drinking style.


take a walk to the nearby kleinhesselohe see, a large lake and the next, beautiful beer garden with the name seehaus, lake house, awaits you here. in the old days, the gardener and investor friedrich ludwig von sckell enlarged this lake and a small beer garden, as the forerunner of the current one, was established on the edge of it. today, after restructuring, it can host up to 2,500 guests and is an all year round popular place to see and to be seen. especially on the weekends you should come early, if you want a prime seat at the lake side and intend to stay a couple of hours. overall it is the bit younger crowd that prefers this beer garden and families will enjoy sun-bathing, paddling on the lake, or feed the swans and let the children play with the corsair in the backside of the garden. this is also the first address in winter during foehn periods, where all the seats at the lake might be taken although the lake still carries ice. in summer you might like to sit in the shady backside of the beer garden or come later in the evening, after exploring the beauty and tranquility of the english garden.

this is an example of what you can do in munich while traveling in germany. if you want learn more about munich we compiled a more comprehensive munich travel guide in collaboration with local residents that provides unique travel insider tips which you can use during you germany vacation.

germany travel tip - passion play in oberammergau





from the 15th of may until the 3rd of october 2010 the eyes of the world will once again focus on oberammergau, the small town in the ammengauer alps, upper bavaria. the preparation for the 41th world renowned passion-play is well on its way and if you like to witness this mega event, it is time to make your travel preparations and bookings now!

the play runs for 5 consecutive months at the end of each decade and every performance runs for 6 - 7 hours with a meal served during intermission. the passion-play is a dramatic reenactment of the passion of christ. the history of the oberammergau passion-play started in 1633, in the middle of the most destructive thirty years war and after months of suffering and death from the plague, the citizens of oberammergau swore an oath, that they would perform the play of the suffering, death and resurrection of our lord jesus christ every ten years. legend has it, that thereafter not one more citizen died of the plague.


it all started back in 1633 when the black death reached oberammergau during the thirty years war and the citizens turned to god for help. nearly every other family had deaths to mourn and so they all came together at the cemetery and swore an oath to portray the suffering and death of the lord every 10 years. they also erected a symbol of christ on poles and crossbars, etching by the oberammergauer artist hans schwaighofer. at pentecost, in the year 1634, they fulfilled their pledge for the first time on a stage, constructed above the fresh graves of the plague victims.

the passion-play shows the trial, suffering and death of jesus christ in a dramatic fashion. the play is linked to the lent, an important time before the easter celebrations for christian denominations, primarily in the catholic church. what makes this passion-play so outstanding in the world is the fact, that it is only held once every 10 years. the actors, directors, scriptwriters, stage set coordinators, technicians, musicians and all other supporting members of the production are solely citizens of oberammergau and in this way still honoring the pledge of their ancestors, given nearly 380 years ago. over 2,000 people take part in this play and auditions start 2-3 years before the actual event. the men start to grow their hair to look the part when applying for a role and the most prestigious part is of course the role of jesus christ.


in 1830, the 22nd passion play year, ludwig i granted permission for the play under the condition that the stage would be no longer erected over the cemetery. this is when the stage was set up on a meadow on the northwestern edge of town. its ground plan determined the structure of the passion play theater to the present day. at that times 5,000 spectators could be accommodated in front of the stage. from 1830 to 1850 a more romantic view of the play was discovered in line with the zeitgeist and widely publicized. since 1870 people from all over the world started to come and witness the passion-play in oberammergau and an ever growing popularity turned it into the mega event, which it is today.

in the year 2000 the passion-play was sold out and the same is projected for the year 2010. if you like to join this event, you should make a decision soon and maybe you like to combine your trip to germany with other, great destinations and things to explore in bavaria.

this is an example of what you can do in oberammergau while traveling in germany. if you want learn more about oberammergau we compiled a more comprehensive oberammergau travel guide in collaboration with local residents that provides unique travel insider tips which you can use during you germany vacation.

bullfighting in madrid





while there's no doubt that it's a big difference from watching a knicks game or cheering on manchester united, that is precisely why you should head to a bullfight when you're in spain. once you get past that whole cruel-to-animals thing, you really have to look at bullfighting as the art that it is.

madrid's bullring's official name is la plaza de toros de las ventas. it is amazing from an architectural point of view, an impressive red brick and ceramic tile múdejar-style structure exploding out of the ground in a residential neighborhood.

from the suits the matadors wear, to the whole spectacle with the audience waving their white handkerchiefs, to visit a bullfight is a great opportunity to have an up-close encounter with a very unique and extraordinary (albeit somewhat barbaric) tradition. when you go to a bullfight you will either be very interested and jump up and shout "olé!" along with the die-hard locals, or feel that the whole thing is a barbaric and unjust setup that you would want to distance yourself from. many tourists visit the bullring only to leave after half an hour.

las ventas is located at they eponymous metro stop (ventas, l2). you literally can't miss it. bullfights take place every sunday from march to october.

a ticket to a bullfight can be very expensive. the closer to the bullring you are sitting, the more expensive it is. the price range is usually 200-15 euros. the cheapest tickets are towards the top of the stadium and there is no shade. but, you get a great overview of the whole spectacle.

bullfighting in madrid's las ventas bullring is a bloody spectacle which is heavily covered in the budget travel guide dirt cheap madrid [http://www.dirtcheapmadrid.com/].

don't forget about berlin





berlin germany is one place that many people know about but tend to forget about when trying to plan a vacation. planning a vacation can be very time consuming and difficult and certain places can tend to leave people's minds when they plan.berlin is one of those places that can tend to be left off the list because many people don't know what is in berlin. they simply don't realize what berlin has to offer. berlin has food, shops, attractions and history what more could you want on your vacation?

first off the trip has to include a visit to the east side gallery. this gallery is actually a piece of the berlin wall it is now used as a large art gallery. this gallery hold over one hundred pieces of art and is free to the public. this section of the wall once divided east berlin and west berlin, but is now the largest open gallery in world. if you enjoy museums then perhaps museum island is a good stop for you, this island holds five incredible museums and a cathedral. it is truly a site being right on the river and is a treasure that berlin visitors usually miss out on.

if you would like to pay tribute to holocaust victims berlin is the place to come. they have the most impressive and moving memorials to the holocaust victims. the site is over 4 acres and over 2,000 pillars. and underneath the ground is the name of every known holocaust victim. remember when visiting while this is an attraction it is also a memorial. the memorial church in berlin is also another historic site. this church was damaged by many air raids in world war ii. this is what caused it to lose its' tower, now this church stands as a memorial to world war ii.

the last place that you must see in berlin is a gate, but not just any gate, this gate serves as a symbol to the "new" germany. the brandenburg gate once stood dividing east berlin and west berlin in the cold war. when the wall came down the gate remained standing as symbol to the past, present and future. the gate itself is free to see, and is a highly recommended stop. technically this gate was not a part of the berlin wall but definitely held great value to the wall and its' purpose.

berlin germany may be forgotten by many tourists when planning trips, however, this is a mistake. berlin has so much to offer visitors it's hard to see why anyone would want to pass it up. heritage, art, and history this city really does have it all, and this is only a taste of what this place has to offer. berlin may seem like it would be an expensive trip and for many travelers it will be however, these few must sees that you just learned about are all free and open to the public. meaning that to see these great monuments you only need to be in the great city of berlin.

sea turtles in costa rica





sea turtles are found in all the oceans (except the arctic ocean) worldwide. there are essentially seven species of these animals. of these seven (viz. leatherback, olive ridley, flat back, hawksbill, loggerhead, kemps ridley and green turtle), the leatherback variety is found in costa rica. however, since the species of the leatherback are on swift decline, they have been declared as an endangered species on this planet.

when edward r. mercer, one of the largest real estate developers, made costa rica his home, he pledged to stop the illegal poaching of the sea turtles as well as ensure the safety of the crucial nesting beaches where the turtles return year after year.

the leather back sea turtle is the largest and the heaviest of the sea turtles with the scientific name, dermochelys coriacea. it draws its name from the leathery skin that envelops it. the leather back variety lacks the hard shells present in the other turtles. so, in order to compensate for it, the leatherback bears a mosaic of bony plates.

the leather back species has a life span of about seventy years on an average. they are found close to the sources of food and have a distinctive feature of exclusively feeding upon the jelly fish most of the time. deep divers of costa rica, the female leatherback turtles return to the protected nesting beaches every year between october and march to lay 100-150 eggs on an average at the caribbean coast of costa rica. the biggest threat to the endangered sea turtle species is a wide range of factors starting from loss of critical nesting beaches, predation by humans and over fishing for the purpose of turtle eggs and meat.

the main reason for the capture of the leather back sea turtle in costa rica is basically for its eggs and high price for functioning as the aphrodisiacs. when edward r. mercer, one of the largest real estate developers, made costa rica his home, he pledged to stop the illegal poaching of these endangered animals as well as ensure the safety of the crucial nesting beaches where they return year after year. the entire island was strictly cordoned off by the guards; they were guided to the new nesting beaches in protected national parks.

this ensured that population of sea turtles which has decreased to dangerous levels started rising again and now sea turtles are no longer endangered.
