welcome 
					to the astroworld employee's web site.
            		
it all began back in 1965 - 1968 when 
					judge roy hofheinz and others built the astro domain 
					complex. the astrodome, astro hall,  astro hotel and 
					then astroworld.
astroworld joined the six flags theme 
					park family in 1975. it was not until time warner bought the 
					six flags parks when astroworld became six flags houston. 
					when premier park bought the six flags parks they changed 
					the name to six flags astroworld. because of financial 
					problems with premier parks, it was decided by them to close 
					astroworld. the land had became prime real estate.
we the employees at astroworld took pride 
					in what we did. we had a lot of professional and talented 
					people working there. most of all, we became a family. for 
					over 37 years we have enjoyed watching our guest laugh, 
					scream and taking them to a place where they could escape 
					from their daily routines.
it is our pleasure to continue bringing 
					you smiles and memories through this web site. we want to 
					share with you pictures, who we are, what we did, and the 
					stories within astroworld.
have a fun ride.
