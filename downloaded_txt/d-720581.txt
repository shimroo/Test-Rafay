bankruptcy may be the right choice
if you’ve heard of bankruptcy, you probably know that there are two main types that are useful for consumers: chapter 7, and chapter 13. we’ll work together to choose which is most efficient for your individual needs (if bankruptcy is indeed the best solution for you), but rest assured that both protect you from creditors throughout the process. repossessions, foreclosures, and collection attempts must all be stopped for the duration of your case.
is chapter 7 bankruptcy or chapter 13 bankruptcy the right answer for you? talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney in an absolutely free discussion about your financial problems. get the answers you need.
 top 10 myths about bankruptcy



  









chapter 7 bankruptcy
chapter 7 bankruptcy is known for its ability to have all qualifying debts discharged, which simply means you will never have to pay them. many of our clients that qualify for chapter 7 specifically report that they feel like they’re buried in debt, and climbing out from under it seems impossible. at this point, a fresh start feels like the only way out.
in order to qualify for a chapter 7 bankruptcy specifically, you’ll first have to take part in what’s called a “means test” to make sure it’s a valid option for you. each state has different rules and regulations for qualifying, so it’s best to have a knowledgeable attorney at your side to handle this for you. it takes into account things like your house and car, which you may be able to keep after completing the process.

chapter 13 bankruptcy
chapter 13 bankruptcy is the type of bankruptcy perfect if you’re struggling to pay the minimum payments on your credit cards, your car payments are behind, and you can’t seem to pay your mortgage on time.
one of the most common types of bankruptcy filed, chapter 13, allows you to reorganize your debts entirely. the moment chapter 13 is filed, harassing phone calls will stop, as will mailed notices to your home. actions filed against you like foreclosures, wage garnishments, and repossessions will stop as well. we’ll work together to create a payment plan that will have you caught up on all of your debts within 3 to 5 years.
