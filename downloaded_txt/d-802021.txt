according to the greek philosopher plato, necessity is the mother of invention. sharing that philosophy, stan bingham

                        salisbury streets in the heart of downtown denton. bingham, a prominent community leader, purchased and restored the building
                        so as to preserve its historic value and architectural beauty. it made the perfect home for a small town newspaper.the first issue of the denton orator hit the stands in december of 1995. weekly publication began in january of 1996 with
                        a circulation of 300. today, the denton orator has grown to a circulation of 2,200, providing community news to readers in
