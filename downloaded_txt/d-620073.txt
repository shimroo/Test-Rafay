fpds builds the foundation of a christian education based on the infallibility of scripture. the school fulfills the mission of training a child up in the way of the lord.  my hope is that my children will build on these core values the rest of their lives. 

mary allyson lowry, parent







i am flooded with joy knowing that fpds is anchored in truths that don't change: namely its unwavering commitment to the bible and the gospel of grace. additionally, the history and generations of faithfulness, the outstanding quality and warmth of the faculty, the godly character of the leadership, and the intentional care we receive from the school community has made our time at the school a sweet mercy and delight.

david felker, parent







when you have a child at fpds there is peace in knowing that they are being loved and prayed for daily.  every one of their teachers and staff are rooting for their success.  it's ok to mess up and try again.  grace is given, love is given, and academics are superior.
