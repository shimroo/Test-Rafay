my retirement plans entertainment schedule
i will be organizing periodic shows for special occasions like christmas, st. patrick’s day, memorial day, and who knows, maybe st. swithen’s day and april fool’s day. they will be few and far between but they will be announced by email and here on my website.
travel schedule
we have been to germany, austria, italy, france and canada, alaska, new orleans, the grand canyon, and so many more wonderful places, but it all started back in the ‘80’s with a cruise to bermuda and a tour of ireland. since then, we’ve hosted as many as five cruises or tours in a year.  we’ve cut back significantly on that number, but for now we’ll still feature at least one a year, so make sure you keep in touch through this site and by being on our email list. click “travel & tours” above for details of our latest.
