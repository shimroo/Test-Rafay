a leader in digital avionics
for nearly 50 years, davtron's 811 series clock has set the standard in aviation timekeeping, trusted by the highest authorities. originally designed for aircraft and famously installed on air force one aircraft sam 26000 and sam 27000, davtron clocks have been featured on every air force one since 1974. with over 40,000 units in the field, the 811 series remains in production today—its quality and reliability are proven beyond question.
now, you can own a piece of this legacy with the enhanced digital desk clock, perfect for aviators and enthusiasts alike. featuring a long-lasting display and a coin cell battery backup, this iconic timepiece is available in limited supply at a special price. add the 811 series to your collection and make history part of your everyday life.
 the davtron technology has recently been integrated into gambling softwares, to enhance 3d simulators and improve the gaming experience of new generation online slot machines. if you want to know more, it's possible to try the free online slot games offered by onlinecasinoselite.org to test them, and have fun at the same time.

900 series - navigation
a computer based product that brings digital vor information to the pilot at the push of a button. the unit displays the radial position of the aircraft, both to or from the vor station. the radial readout is the actual one the aircraft is on and is updated every 0.8 seconds. the display makes vor step down fixes and intersections easily read with a quick glance by the pilot. the pilot can see how fast they are approching the fixes rather than having the needle on the obi hard over to one side. one model of the 903 comes with a channel that sequentially displays the morse code indentifier of each vor station or localizer.  check out the “narrow product search” page, this will allow you to select specific features and installation sizes. products will display immediately on your selections.
