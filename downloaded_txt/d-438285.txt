welcome to rose of sharon baptist church! we are an inter-generational baptist church focused on discipleship and service. we have been committed to serving the people of metro vancouver and the fraser valley since our humble beginning in 1963. we were first established in richmond, bc and moved to langley, bc in 1995.
at rose of sharon, our mission is to seek god and his truth, and then in love obey him together. we believe in the importance of community and caring for families. whether you are involved in aldergrove christian academy, new life christian counselling, awana clubs, or attending on sunday mornings, you are part of this community. rose of sharon values and focuses on bringing up the next generation to know and love god and his word. our programs focus on equipping every member to have a growing, committed and contagious relationship with jesus.
we invite you to join our church family and look forward to seeing you.
