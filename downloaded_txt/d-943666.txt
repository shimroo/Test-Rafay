c.l.i.c.k. for justice & equality



c.l.i.c.k. for justice and equality is an agent of change alerting our social community of injustices and inequalities among the underserved, disadvantaged, and disenfranchised individual or group. a disadvantaged or disenfranchised person or group is anyone who is socially, culturally, and politically deprived of or oppressed from life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. change takes place through our legislative body of senators and state representatives, not from the judicial bench.
