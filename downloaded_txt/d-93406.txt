learn how the mosquito works here







the mosquito works by exploiting a medical condition called presbycusis â or more simply put age-related hearing loss. as we age, our ability to hear higher frequency sounds is reduced.
the mosquito works by emitting an alternating high-frequency tone at 16-18.5 kilohertz.

is the mosquito legal?








prevent and disperse the problem in 20 minutes









8.00pm teens start to gather, and their behaviour becomes a nuisance or threat.





8.05pm discreetly positioned mosquito ultrasonic alarm is switched on via a timer or remote control.





8.20pm teens pick up on the high-frequency, repetitive tone of the mosquito.





8.25pm teens disperse as they become irritated by the highly annoying sound.





is it harmful?







mosquito at the corner shop
location: small corner shop in bradford
problem: the shop front was attracting large groups of teenagers that although did not always cause trouble, they did make the shopâs owners feel intimated.
on installing a mosquito device:
there has been a huge reduction in the numbers gathering outside the shop. there have been no complaints on the device being used. it has significantly reduced the illegal behaviour the shop owner has had to contend with over the years.

we had the mosquito put up by a friend of ours and first off, the instructions were excellent. everything is so clear. the job was done in less than forty minutes. thanks to you we now have a respite from the awful problems that we were having. your device does not harm, just moves the youngsters on allowing innocent people to carry on with their lives unimpeded.
