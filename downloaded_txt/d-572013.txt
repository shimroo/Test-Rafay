my jackson salesperson does a fantastic job. he comes to the job sites to measure for us. he not only deals with me, but with my subcontractors as well. if a home buyer wants specialty millwork or custom doors, i have them work with my jlm rep and the millwork is manufactured exactly to their specifications at the jackson mill.
