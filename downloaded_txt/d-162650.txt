everything was absolutely delicious, the service was wonderful, and the vibes were immaculate. porch seating overlooking the golf course is everything you could ask for from a restaurant in the south. the cocktails were perfect. the leftovers were amazing the next day. great for an afternoon bite in winter park/college park, and absolutely a hidden gem.food: 5/5service: 5/5atmosphere: 5/5
