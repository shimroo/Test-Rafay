homeopathy offers wellness for complete health

homeopathy is a popular form of alternative, holistic healing as it treats the person as a whole. homeopathy, as a deep treatment that covers the totality of the individual's physical-emotional-mental state & while it takes time to achieve a total cure, healing through years or layers of symptoms, it can also be a very good, safe vibrational medicine for treating acute ailments as well. homeopathic medicines have no harmful side effects as it uses a very small and diluted amount of the active ingredient that treats the illness. so the treatment may take longer but the outcome is usually more effective and long-lasting.
with more and more people taking to homeopathy all over the world, it comes as no surprise that saratoga is also walking the same path. homeopathy has been embraced by people from all walks of life to treat a range of ailments, starting from lifestyle diseases, to allergies, headaches, anxiety, depression, add, chronic fatigue, pms, menopause, endocrine, immune, and nervous system disorders and everything in between. it is also most helpful to have a homeopathic physician that was trained in the traditional world of allopathic (regular) medicine, as well as classical homeopathy. one  homeopathic doctor in the bay area that has carved out a niche of her own to assist people in seeking wellness of body, mind & spirit is sandra kamiak, m.d.
