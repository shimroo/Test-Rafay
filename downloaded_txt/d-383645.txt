nassau lions athletics
from baseball, to softball, soccer and lacrosse; to track and field, football and
                           basketball– the nassau lions athletes consistently perform at an elite level athletically
                           and academically.
ncc student-athletes are ambassadors for the student body, working just as hard in
                           the classroom as they do in competition.
