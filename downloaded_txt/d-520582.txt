fifth annual weblog awards: the 2005 bloggies
where can you find the most interesting weblogs? which blogs have made their mark this year? who will do anything for a nomination? those questions will be answered in the one and only...
the bloggies™ are a set of 30 publicly-chosen awards given to weblog writers and those related to weblogs. this is the fifth ceremony, with previous winners listed on their respective sites: 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. everyone's invited to take part in the awarding process, so read below to find out how you can nominate and vote for your favorite blogs!

read the rules

a "weblog" is defined as a page with dated entries.
the contest is open to any weblogs that existed for a period of time during the year 2004, so weblogs that were discontinued during 2004 are also eligible.
only one nomination form and one finalist voting form may be submitted per person.
e-mail addresses are required to vote. you must use your own address.
if you attempt to submit a second ballot, your first one will be erased.
in the nomination phase:
urls are required (where applicable).
the maximum number of weblogs you may nominate for a category is three (3) for most categories and four (4) for weblog of the year.
at least three (3) different weblogs total must be nominated.
you may nominate your own weblog, but the total nominations for your own weblog must be less than one third of your total (legitimate) nominations.
there is no limit to the number of categories a weblog may be nominated for.
nominees have to fit the category they are placed in.

the system alerts me of suspicious ballots, and i also may exclude ballots when i suspect the voter isn't following the rules. this means no bots.

these rules may change at any time, but they probably won't.


learn about the procedure
from saturday, january 1, 2005 to monday, january 10, anyone was able to nominate their favorite weblogs.
on tuesday, january 18, three panels of 50 voters received an e-mail. it listed the weblogs that received the most nominations in ten categories. they had until 10:00 pm est on saturday, january 22 to privately submit their five favorites (six for weblog of the year) for each category. the five (or six for weblog of the year) receiving the most votes became finalists. i (nikolai nolan) only voted for the panel in the case of a tie for fifth place.
on sunday, january 23, the finalists were announced and voting was open again to choose the winners.
voting closed at 10:00 pm est on thursday, february 3. the winners were posted on monday, march 14.


come to the ceremony
the weblog awards™ ceremony will be held at the south by southwest interactive festival for the third time in austin, texas, usa on monday, march 14 at 12:30 pm. webloggers including previous bloggie™ winners and prize contributors will present certificates and prizes to those present.
those who aren't attending may join the excitement on irc, in #blogirc on irc.turlyming.com. winners will be announced live and a play-by-play of the ceremony will be given.
after the ceremony, the results will be posted on this page.


admire the prizes
because of the large amount of categories, i won't personally give a award to every winner, but the weblog of the year owner(s) will receive 2,005 us cents (us$20.05).
also, contributors can donate their own prizes to the category of their choice, and if the contributor has a site, it will be linked from this page. if the contributor is going to sxsw, he/she can also have the privilege of announcing/presenting the category sponsored at the ceremony. to donate one, the contributor can bring it to sxsw, mail it to the winner, or send an online gift certificate or cash to the winner. prizes that are more creative than my $20 are encouraged.
send me an e-mail to get your prize added. sorry, "to be announced" prizes to reserve categories won't be accepted this year. i'll send out a list of winner's e-mails to the contributors after they're announced, but all other prize arrangements will be handled by their respective donators.
since i intend for the weblog awards� to remain an independently-produced ceremony without corporate sponsorship, starting this year i'd like to restrict the contributor links to individuals, non-profit organizations, or companies that contribute to the blog universe in some way.
south by southwest interactive offers bloggie™ finalists a special discount to attend the ceremony in march. the cost of interactive registration for bloggie™ finalists is $175.
the webby awards offers bloggie™ finalists free entry in to the webbys' blog category.
lulu will award each bloggie™ winner a book made from their blog entries.
t-shirt humor will award each bloggie™ winner a "blog" t-shirt.


be current with the categories
most categories will remain as they've always been. but because of revision or removal, it's time to bid farewell to:

best weblog directory or update monitor
best programming of a weblog site
best weblog about music
