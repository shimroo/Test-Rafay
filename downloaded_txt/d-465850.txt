welcome to marinemax nisswa & crosslake
 marinemax nisswa & crosslake has a rich history of helping families just like yours enjoy the water in the brainerd lakes area each summer. formerly known and loved as nisswa marine and c&c boat works, our two stores have teamed up with one mission: to provide the world’s best pleasure boating experience to boaters on the gull lake and whitefish chains.

experience boat-buying the way it was meant to be! request boat service from our skilled team of technicians with over 120 years of combined expertise. after a long day on the water, simply stop at our gas docks in crosslake to refuel and explore our pro shop full of water toys and boating accessories to enhance your summer fun. enjoy peace of mind in the off-season while we winterize and store your boat at our expansive facilities. come spring, we’ll summerize it and deliver right to your lift or landing!

get ready to make unforgettable memories with your crew this boating season our passionate and knowledgable staff is looking forward to earning your business. we can’t wait to help you make the most of your lake lifestyle.
