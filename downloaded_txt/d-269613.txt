and who says that you have to give
up things you enjoyed, in order to grow up? 

tango
papa decals was started as a one-man shop providing reproduction out of
print decal sets and high quality waterslide decal paper. now under the
control of cmr products, we maintain the thought process that your
hobbies shouldn't have to be left behind as you move into adulthood. 

whether your interests lie in trains, planes, rockets, tabletop games,
cars or trucks; we're here to help you enjoy your hobby. 





with the update to our redesigned website live, we are continuing to
update the print files for decal sets to our printing process, as well
as uploading them to our online store front. the transition to this
store page will allow for a smoother checkout process, displaying
preview images of decal sets, as well as up to
the minute stock updates on ink cassettes and other supplies.

as always, we welcome questions, concerns, or comments on our website,
store, and ordering process to be brought to our attention.
