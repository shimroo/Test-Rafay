dep's invitation to bid: speed permit review 
the pennsylvania department of environmental protection (dep) is seeking to engage qualified professionals to review permits on an expedited basis as part of the streamlining permits for economic expansion and development (speed) program. 
dep has begun implementing the speed program, which was included in the 2024-25 budget signed by governor josh shapiro.
the speed program offers increased flexibility, allowing permit applicants to have a dep-verified and qualified professional conduct the initial review of the application, with dep making its decision based on the qualified professional's recommendation.
applicants for eligible permits will agree to pay any review fees incurred by the qualified professional, in addition to permit application fees.
permits eligible for the speed program include:

air quality plan approvals (state-only) (chp.127)
earth disturbance permits (chp.102)
individual water obstruction and encroachment permits (chp.105)
dam safety permits (chp.105)

bids are due by december 31, 2024. questions can be directed to brian franklin at brfranklin@pa.gov or (717) 787-2471.


continental drifters events huge success
pcpg has been holding continental drifters networking events over the past few months, and the events are a huge success. one remarkable aspect to these informal events is the networking opportunities, whether a member interested in a more personal experience, or someone who is curious about what pcpg is all about joins us.
pcpg professionals, students, corporate members and associate members gather and enjoyed refreshments and conversation. business cards are passed, contacts are made, and information is exchanged.
future events will appear on the home page calendar and in our eblasts.
