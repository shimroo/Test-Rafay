first swimming lesson





pictures to follow soon....

jack had his first swimming lesson today at holden park pool in wake forest.  his instructor is megan.  this is a class for kids 4-6 and jack is by far the biggest kid there.  he also has one of the shortest attention spans too. he had a great time and kicked his little heart out.  he dunked his head under the water and made swimming arms with little cups.  he had fun and is looking forward to going back tomorrow.  this is monday through thursday for two weeks.  if it storms, we'll meet on friday.  good times. 

pics tomorrow.  promise.

children learn what they live





children learn what they liveby dorothy law nolte, ph.d.
if children live with criticism, they learn to condemn.
if children live with hostility, they learn to fight.
if children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive.
if children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves.
if children live with ridicule, they learn to feel shy.
if children live with jealousy, they learn to feel envy.
if children live with shame, they learn to feel guilty.
if children live with encouragement, they learn confidence.
if children live with tolerance, they learn patience.
if children live with praise, they learn appreciation.
if children live with acceptance, they learn to love.
if children live with approval, they learn to like themselves.
if children live with recognition, they learn it is good to have a goal.
if children live with sharing, they learn generosity.
if children live with honesty, they learn truthfulness.
if children live with fairness, they learn justice.
if children live with kindness and consideration, they learn respect.
if children live with security, they learn to have faith in themselves and in those about them.
if children live with friendliness, they learn the world is a nice place in which to live.

going through recent pics






i thought these were taken at the fairgrounds early june, but they we are actually at artsplsure.  i'll post more pics from that.  when were at the fairgrounds we checked out the people and their wares and jack asked an excellent question:  why do they call it furniture?  bryan and i didn't know so we looked it up.  we learned that furniture comes from the french word: fournir. furnish. furniture.

blueberry picking 6/19/2011





strawberries were ripe for picking on mother's day and blueberries were ready just in time for father's day.
we went with ray and allison to snikroc farm on sunday.  when ray is out saving the world, well, at least parts of the country hit by disaster, he works with mr. corkins.  we really enjoyed picking blueberries on a gorgeous day.  we picked 10 pounds.   at $2 per pound, this was a very yummy, affordable, and fun way to spend a few hours. jack loved picking the berries.  it's interesting, with strawberries, we leave the field covered in juice.  there is a lot more work in picking blueberries and we have a greater appreciation for why they are so expensive in the stores - fresh or frozen.  it was really fun to see our fingerprints on the berries and listen to them fall into our buckets.  
jack really enjoyed talking with spencer, mr. corkins' 10 year old son who handled the weighing and sales transactions.  spencer told us that the blueberry bushes are 15 years old and how this is the earliest the blueberries have ever been ready.  he told us about the irrigation system they have set up that takes water from the pond and delivers the water that's full of fish poop and how that is the secret of why their blueberries are so tasty. jack had lots of questions like:  do you like being a farmer?  why is your house so close to the farm?  what other plants do you grow?  would you like some water to drink?  how do you cut your grass?  do you ever have any snakes in the bushes?  
of course we made a pie.  we've eaten blueberries all week, and we are enjoying smoothies with the rest.  i'm sure we'll be back soon.

maker faire nc 2011 06/18/2011





last weekend was a very fun and busy one.  on saturday we attended the nc maker fair and had a blast!  we watched the inflation and launch of a weather balloon, and pet some beautiful greyhounds, viewed all things made from the extremely geeky to the fantastic artsy.  our favorite part of the event was the thinker linkers exhibit.
jack loved this interlocking system.  bryan loved it.  i loved it! once we found it, jack started creating and did not want to stop (and he played with these for about 2 hours).

he made a dragon, a firehouse, a home for his brothers:  mitchell cormack and skookum jim.  (imaginary brothers)

when it was time to leave, jack was not happy.  he wanted to keep building.  we left the building at the fairgrounds and started the mile trek back to the car, stopping at a picnic table to let him calm down (mostly so we didn't have to coerce and drag a screaming child through the nc fairgrounds).  jack calmed down and drank some water.  after a few minutes it was like he had a rush of the fun he had had and wanted to go back.  we don't get to see jack's passions flare often, but this was one of those moments.  we'll be investing in some thinker linkers for sure.

good bye facebook, hello team covington





i googled myself a few weeks ago and found one page from a blog started in 2006 meant with every good intention to chronicle the fabulous lives of kenna, bryan, and wee baby jack covington. 

it didn't stick.  and he is no longer a wee babe.

i've recently stepped away from facebook and the hours of mindless facebookery that went with it.  my mom was sad about my departure because there would be no more pictures of jack.  thanks mom for the inspiration to start this blog. 

peace my loves, peace.
