who benefits from private lessons?

of course this is valuable to all students because in this individualised domain, there is much space to fine tune your practice to your needs.
maybe you just want to familiarise yourself with the movements, terminology and poses before taking a group class.
or, you may have specific goals or areas of the practice that you would like to dive deeper into which cannot be done in the group practice.
whatever your reasons, you will be guided personally with the utmost attention and competence.

about





since my childhood, i have been on a quest to understand the essence of being human. i would often find myself sitting by the ocean, armed with a notebook and a pen, my mind brimming with questions and awe. the vast expanse of the sea and sky instilled in me a sense of a force much greater than myself, fueling my curiosity about our place in the universe. 
this intrigue led me to pursue studies in sociology at university. after completing my degree, i ventured into roles as a family counselor and early childhood educator. however, it was the discovery of yoga that truly ignited a passion within me. embracing iyengar yoga, i learned the vital importance of alignment, starting from the physical body and extending to the innermost aspects of the self.
from 2011 to the present, i have devoted myself to exploring the expansive realm of hatha yoga. i have completed 500 hours of yoga alliance-certified teacher training and am a registered teacher for children and teens, specializing in yoga for post-traumatic stress. my education also includes courses in ayurveda, plant-based nutrition, and pranayama (breath work). i am deeply grateful to my mentors—stephen thomas, vasilli vlachos, maya vlachos, claire dalloz, and doug keller—who continue to enrich my yoga journey.
yoga has been a pillar of support for me over the past two decades, especially during my recent battle with an aggressive form of breast cancer. this challenging period brought me to my lowest point, yet i was reminded of the critical role that yoga and meditation play in maintaining balance. the practices of yoga have been instrumental in supporting both my physical and mental well-being during this time.
my goal is to share the insights and relief that yoga has brought me with others, hoping to alleviate some of the stress that life can bring. i invite you to reach out to me so we can discuss which yoga class might best meet your needs, whatever they may be.  my classes are taught in my mother tongue; english.  my classes can be adapted to all students of all levels. 





my journey






2005


my yoga journey began in 2005 when i took a pre-natal yoga class. with breath and asana i discovered how i could support myself through a difficult labor and birth. in the next 5 years i used these tools repeatedly in various difficult life situations.




2011


after the birth of my second child, in 2011, i began practicing iyengar yoga, where i learned the importance of alignment, precision and creating physical and mental space.




2016


in 2016, i started attending different workshops on ayurveda and pranayama becoming more intrigued with yoga as a whole system. around this time, i had also begun finding profound results from the practice that were manifesting throughout my life.




2019


in 2019, i completed the 200 hour (yoga alliance) teacher training. in 2020, i completed rcyt (registered children and teen yoga teacher) certificate program with a focus on teaching yoga to children and teens who are experiencing post-traumatic stress.




2022


in december 2022, i received the 300 hour (yoga alliance) advanced yoga teacher training certificate. with deepest appreciation and gratitude, i honor the teachers who have, and still guide me in cultivating my yoga practice…., stephen thomas, vasilli vlachos, maya vlachos, claire dalloz and doug keller.




















how my practice works


asana practice
slowly, we begin to move in the body. after gradually warming up, we move to a sustained flow. standing asanas bring strength and endurance moving us to the peak of the practice. then we twist, invert and back bend, until reaching the place where we can finally rest in savasana where we untether ourselves from the world of all that defines us.










pranayama
we arrive on the mat, find a relaxed and comfortable position and then begin with a short pranayama practice. in our current lives the mind is in a state of constant stimulation and stress. by practicing pranayama or controlled breathing, we can quiet and regulate the mind. in addition to this, we are opening and unblocking the pathways where the energy or “prana” travels.




meditation
the asana and pranayama will prepare us for meditation. in meditation we can better focus the mind and cultivate a sense of inner peace and clarity. in meditation we discover the inner space, where there is no duality, no conflict, only unity and connectedness with everything.










philosophy
finally, in the yoga practice we embrace living a mindful and ethical lifestyle. this includes practices such as cultivating gratitude, compassion, non-judgement toward oneself and others. through yoga philosophy we are given a personal context for getting the most out of asana, pranayama and meditation.
