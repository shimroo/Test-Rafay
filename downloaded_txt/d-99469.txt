william fisher obituary





william fisher 1928- 2013




william fisher, of old chatham, new york, retired journalist and international development consultant, died at berkshire medical center in pittsfield, massachusetts, on june 11th, 2013. he was eighty-four. 

he is survived by his daughters victoria fisher of new marlborough, massachusetts, julie fisher of ashfield, massachusetts, a son in law, ronald gorevic of ashfield; and a granddaughter, kezia, of ashfield.

bill fisher was born in brooklyn, new york, and attended schools there. he was graduated from stetson university, deland, florida, in 1950, with a major in journalism. he served as president of the florida intercollegiate press association, and was editor of the college newspaper, the reporter.

he served in the u.s. army military police during the korean war, 1950-52.

fisher's early work life combined his two loves-newspaper writing and jazz. he worked his way through college playing jazz piano, preparing arrangements, and conducting a thirteen-piece swing band. soon he added newspaper reporting to his schedule, landing a job as cub reporter on the daytona beach news-journal.

he returned to the news-journal in 1952 as a bureau chief, at which time he also began reporting for the associated press. fisher was also the first white correspondent of the baltimore afro-american, for which he wrote a series of investigative articles dealing with police corruption and racial bigotry in central florida.

in the mid 1950's, fisher began a career designing and managing public relations programs for not-for-profit organizations in the hospitals, health, and welfare fields. his clients included montefiore hospital, the new york citizens committee for children, care, and the korean-american foundation. he subsequently formed his own public relations firm in new york city.

in 1961, fisher was recruited by the john f. kennedy white house to join the administration as a speech writer and public affairs specialist. he served as a member of the white house committee on trade expansion.

following the death of president kennedy, fisher joined a major new york public relations firm, and moved to london to head the firm's first international office.

in 1973, he formed his own public relations firm in london, and joined his wife, the late florence zucker fisher, in founding environmental resources ltd. (erl), the first environmental consulting firm outside the united states. erl won several queen's awards for service to her majesty.

in the mid 1980's, fisher began yet another career in international development. he served as a consultant to the u.s. agency for international development, the united nations, and the u.s. state department; and managed economic development programs in more than a dozen countries in north and sub-saharan africa, the middle east, central and south america, and southeast asia.

over the last few years of fisher's semi-retirement, he reported on political and economic issues for various internet publications.

in lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions to the innocence project, reporters without borders, or the columbia county humane society.

fore!






by william fisher
it must have been the late 1950s and i couldn’t have been more than 18 – i hadn’t yet finished undergrad school. but i had a job on what was widely thought of as one of the most progressive dailies in the south – the daytona beach (florida) news-journal.
and if this wasn’t enough for a kid from brooklyn, there was a bonus: i was to be the paper’s “overhead man” for the associated press. let me explain. the ap, representing pretty much all the newspapers in a given area, tries to cover all the news in that area, down to bake sales, church dinners and, of course, sporting events.
the ap’s jacksonville office, where statewide news was assembled from a team of eager young journalists like me, was particularly a great fan of golf. and with central florida’s reputation as a retirement home for seniors, several major universities in our area, and even large high schools getting into the golf tournament business, there never seemed to be shortage of scores, personality snippets, and suchlike to satisfy the endless needs of even the most gluttonous golf buffs.
so with all the credibility i could garner from my one golf game with my dad when i was nine years old, i dove into my new mission with the zeal only an 18-year-old could sustain. and things went well. folks were reading my stuff. even more importantly, my editor, tip davidson, a veteran of the bare-knuckled chicago news bureau, was reading my stuff.
the ap even paid me. the amounts were so tiny that it’s my recollection that the “overhead guys” were allowed to keep their pittance.
anyway, since those days, the ap has enjoyed a very special place on my journalistic memory lane. i haven’t had much direct contact, but i was very pleased when the ap‘s washington office chose to interview me for a recent piece they did on us aid’s field operations.
but what really caught my attention was the news, as reported by sari horowitz of the washington post, “in a sweeping and unusual move, the justice department secretly obtained two months’ worth of telephone records of journalists working for the associated press as part of a year-long investigation into the disclosure of classified information about a failed al-qaeda plot last year.”
the ap’s president said the justice department’s actions were a “massive and unprecedented intrusion” into newsgathering activities.
two things i found particularly galling. first, we have a bill of rights that’s part of our constitution. they’re the first ten amendments to that document and the very first one is called the establishment clause and covers the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and of assembly, and the right to petition the government.
in very straightforword language it begins: “congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”
politicians and those who try to buy their votes have been trying to use freedom of the press as if it were a criminal act. it isn’t. it’s right all of us are supposed to enjoy. and it’s worth noting here that this particular right is one where the rhetoric of the obama administration has been splendid and the enforcement cusping on shameful.as a former constitutional law instructor, the president knows all the right words and all the right body language to look like the most conscientious civil libertarian.
over the years, this and practically every other u.s. administration has sought to have congress pass a “press shield” law – one that would protect the nations media from tampering by government or those who wannabee government. but these efforts have always come just so far and then fell like a stone in the potomac.
one oughta finally get passed. with teeth.
the second thing i found particularly annoying: when i was that kid writing up golf scores for the news-journal, i remember how the ap guys in jacksonville – real newsmen – badgered me without reprieve about (a) accuracy – double source it or throw it away; (b) objectivity – be sure to tell both sides of every story (as if stories had only two sides); and institutional track-record (the press is the fourth estate; it has over the years earned the right to be paid attention to.i remember how hard we young ones worked to fulfill these mandates. they were really important to us. and they still are – no doubt also to those who do these little jobs today.this may seem a bit simplistic in today’s internet world, but it’s not a bad place to start. if you do (a) and (b) well, you ought to be able to capitalize on (c).so what’s happened to the government’s respect for the freedom and accuracy of the press? aw.o.l.
of course, the media has made and will continue to make mistakes. with some awful exceptions, most news outlets try to correct their errors in a timely way.
writing about this ancient subject makes me feel a little like the granny inveighing against the government, a la, “i hate government interference, just make them keep their hands off my medicare!”*        *"fore!" the shouted word by which golfers warn others on the course that they are in danger of  being struck by a ball.

georgia justice







by william fisher

in 2002 u.s. supreme court ruled 6-3 that executions of mentally retarded criminals are "cruel and unusual punishment," violating the eighth amendment to the constitution. 
some time in the very near future – as soon as a new execution date is established -- texas will execute warren hill, who is mentally retarded with an iq of 70. 

how come? texas find a back door somewhere?

well, yes and no.

on april 22, the u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit denied warren hill’s appeal to halt his execution based on new evidence of his intellectual infirmity.

the court ruled that hill’s claim of intellectual disability (mental retardation) was presented in an earlier petition and could not be presented again, despite the new evidence. the judges also held that, even if hill's claim is a new one, it only challenges his eligibility for the death penalty, not his underlying guilt, and is therefore improper in a second petition.

on april 22, a divided u.s. court of appeals for the eleventh circuit denied warren hill’s appeal to halt his execution based on new evidence of his intellectual disability. 

the court ruled that hill’s claim of intellectual disability (mental retardation) was presented in an earlier petition and cannot be presented again, despite the new evidence. 

wha? “presented in an earlier petition and cannot be presented again?” did we hear correctly? 

yes, we did. and so did appeals judge rosemary barkett. in her dissenting opinion, she said, “there is no question that georgia will be executing a mentally retarded man because all seven mental health experts who have ever evaluated hill, both the state’s and hill’s, now unanimously agree that he is mentally retarded.” 

she also stated, "the idea that courts are not permitted to acknowledge that a mistake has been made which would bar an execution is quite incredible for a country that not only prides itself on having the quintessential system of justice but attempts to export it to the world as a model of fairness.... 

[the federal habeas statute] should not be construed to require the unconstitutional execution of a mentally retarded offender who, by presenting evidence that virtually guarantees that he can establish his mental retardation, is able to satisfy even the preposterous burden of proof georgia demands."

the state argues that the claims for habeas relief should be barred because georgia law requires that any claims not made in the initial petition should be barred from review, and this is hill’s third such request.

so hill will be put to death because a court chose a gaggle of legal technicalities while ignoring the larger issues.

but, in a dissenting opinion, judge rosemary barkett said, “there is no question that georgia will be executing a mentally retarded man because all seven mental health experts who have ever evaluated hill, both the state’s and hill’s, now unanimously agree that he is mentally retarded.” 

she also stated, "the idea that courts are not permitted to acknowledge that a mistake has been made which would bar an execution is quite incredible for a country that not only prides itself on having the quintessential system of justice but attempts to export it to the world as a model of fairness.... 
at the supreme court’s initial ruling, justice john paul stevens wrote the opinion for scotus. it was joined by sandra day o'connor, anthony kennedy, david souter, ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer. 

"we are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty," the court said. 
if one favored the death penalty, darell hill would be right up there among prime candidates. this cognitively challenged miscreant has committed some of the most heinous crimes we can recall. but if he couldn’t tell right from wrong, should he lose his life? the appeals court ruling doesn't address the constitutionality of capital punishment in general. 

the majority cited a growing national consensus on the issue since the high court ruled in 1989 that such executions may be unacceptable. in the past 13 years the number of states that do not allow the execution of mentally retarded death row prisoners has grown from two to 18. 

"it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it," stevens wrote. 

in a blistering dissent, justice antonin scalia scoffed at what he called "the 47 percent consensus." he said the 18 states represent less than half of the 38 states that permit capital punishment in any case. 

"if one is to say as the court does today that all executions of the mentally retarded are so morally repugnant as to violate our national standards of decency, surely the consensus it points to must be one that has set its righteous face against all such executions," scalia wrote. 

chief justice william h. rehnquist and justice clarence thomas joined scalia in dissenting. 

according to a report by the associated press, the three dissenting justices, the court's most conservative members, telegraphed their views when they complained about reprieves the court majority had granted to two texas inmates who claim they are retarded. 

the most immediate effect of the ruling will be in the 20 states that allowed execution of the retarded up to now. presumably, dozens or perhaps hundreds of inmates in those states will now argue that they are retarded, and that their sentences should be converted to life in prison. 

the state also argues that the “new evidence” – the doctors’ statements – is not credible. these doctors met with hill and reviewed extensive documentation in 2000, and they haven’t seen him since and didn’t have new information, the state argues. the judge agreed, writing that the new petition is procedurally barred and that the “new evidence” does not establish a miscarriage of justice.

this is an example of the level of technicalities being invoked by the state of texas. 
so unless the u.s. supreme court agrees to hear a further appeal of this legal nightmare – if the defendant decides to mount one -- texas will have its way with warren hill. 
and this will accomplish what?

freedom and high anxiety in the usa 






this analysis (23 april 2013) was written by lawrence davidson, who is a university history professor. it is well worth a read.

_________________________________________________________________________________

part i - high anxiety
americans may assume that public insecurity is a condition you find under dictatorships, where the agents of the state can burst through your door and cart you away without a warrant. that can now happen in the usa too, but only to those the government calls “terrorists.” perhaps naively, ordinary folks see themselves as immune from that sort of treatment. however, public insecurity has many roots. americans actually experience, but almost never acknowledge, the fact that there is a correlation between u.s. democracy’s relatively broad array of freedoms and public high anxiety. here are some of the ways this works:

economic freedom can, theoretically, break down class barriers and open up opportunities for enterprising citizens. it also leaves you free to become abjectly poor and produces a socio-political environment in which ideologically driven leaders hesitate to use the power of the state to solve the consequences of poverty. being poor is, usually, a high-anxiety state.

political freedoms can become lopsided in favor of well-organized special interests with the financial ability to corrupt the political system. it might be that 90% or more of americans favor reform of the gun laws and would feel safer if there were universal background checks on those purchasing firearms. it does not matter, though, because this majority does not know how to effectively use its political freedom to achieve this end. as a consequence lobby groups that specialize in working the system (such as the national rifle association) can easily override the wishes of the majority and, as just happened, arrange for the most innocuous of gun reform legislation to be defeated in the senate. moved by the same lobby influence, the senate is expected to reject the recently created un arms trade treaty. thus the rest of us, and our children, are stuck in a situation that is very free for gun owners who can give their fantasies full play, but spells high anxiety for the rest of us.
media freedom, such as it is, is perhaps the greatest contributor to public insecurity because it has produced a consistent concentration on the negative. this occurs because either those who own the media outlets, and thus literally select the news we receive, hold an anxiety-producing worldview, or they see such an approach as good business. the spectacularly negative seems to sell newspapers and boost ratings.
at this point, one can ask who are those who are most inclined to use freedom, either as economic, political, or media policy makers, or leaders of special interest groups, to promote practices and policies that are anxiety producing to great majority? it is often rigid, single-issue protagonists who are anything but free in their own minds. in fact their single-mindedness has blinded them to broader community interests and needs.

take for instance, the christian and jewish ideologues making up such groups as christians united for israel and the american israeli public affairs committee (aipac). the former is an your classic christian zionist organization which claims to be “the largest pro-israel organization in the united states serving 1.3 million members.” aipac, of course, is one of the most influential lobby groups in the country. and just how do these groups “serve” their constituents? well, one way is by going around trying to convince the rest of us that we are in mortal danger from a nuclear iran (which happens to be a country at odds with israel). they have done a good job of implanting this anxiety-producing fantasy in the minds of both the public and many members of the u.s. congress. but, how do i know the claim that iran is seeking nuclear weapons is a fantasy? because every time the heads of our government’s intelligence services are asked about this they say it isn’t true. oddly, this gets very little press.

such zionist organizations also spread public insecurity through the promotion of islamophobia, another fantasy, which states that just about every muslim in the u.s. is an al qaeda agent. as one friend of mine, peter loeb of boston, has put it, “the word ‘terrorist’ has become equated with ‘arab/muslim’ in the american mind.” thus, referring to the recent boston marathon bombing, abc news reports that “the deadliest terror attack on u.s. soil since 9/11 has left many people anxious. but muslim americans await the identity of the perpetrator with particular dread.”
part ii - the example of the boston marathon

the recent anxiety that hit the nation over the boston marathon bombings is good example of just how exaggeratedly frightening a world our freedom (in this case media freedom) has created for us. if one bothers with the facts, one learns that terrorist attacks are not numerous in the u.s. and are in fact declining. most of them are not carried out by muslims but by animal rights advocates. finally, u.s. law enforcement is getting better at dealing with these incidents. but all of this good news makes no impact in the face of something made into a major anxiety-producing national event by the media.
the boston marathon affair was carried out by two young immigrant brothers of chechen ethnicity. the older brother, who was probably the leader in this escapade, appeared to be a disenchanted misfit. he was an aspiring and talented boxer who had his heart set on making the u.s. olympic team. however, he had recently learned that as a “foreign athlete” (he was not yet a citizen) he could not compete in the u.s. national championships. he had come to feel that “there are no values anymore” and that “people can’t control themselves.” by the way, these are feelings that no devout muslim would ever seriously entertain.

unortunately, freedom as practiced in the u.s. has its drawbacks. it has encouraged an often heartless individuality that disregards serious levels of poverty. it has allowed the evolution of interest group politics that often works against national interests in both domestic and foreign policies. and, in the guise of a free media, it has produced an environment that breeds exaggeration, fantasy, and a general concentration on the most spectacular, and most negative, of news stories.

does this make america’s freedoms, in principle, bad things? not at all. but it does call attention to the fact that such freedoms, practiced unconditionally, can give free rein to the less communal and more selfish aspects of the human psyche. the result can be a form of negative blowback. an intelligent, mature community will be aware of this fact and implement non-abusive regulations to assure that along with economic, political, and media freedom comes responsible behavior.
alas, america as a society is not particularly intelligent or mature, so such reforms encouraging responsible behavior are unlikely. the irony of it all is that it will be in the name of preserving freedom, in its peculiarly american radical individualistic form, that powerful elites and influential special interests will resist any effort to mandate the responsible use of those freedoms. as a consequence, high anxiety and freedom will continue to go along with each other.

system collapse





this email was written by elie housman, one of my oldest friends. he is a staunch supporter of israel , in a policy of quity and compassion.

dear friends: it seems that the framework that was in place in the usa is collapsing. five years ago our economy almost totally collapsed, and was saved only because of mass government intervention. we showed the world that capitalistic banking system, without strict government regulation does not work. last week we proved that out political system does not function as well. this is about five years that the grid-lock in washington now celebrates. a well-organized minority is able to choke the wheels of progress. 

it was not until this last week that we proved that hypocrisy reigns and democracy is a thing of the past. i doubt that in the history of the usa there was a subject that 90% of the people agreed on. all polls show that 90% of us advocate some legislation regarding some check on gun purchases. we can paralyze and lock down an entire city for hours (boston last week), but we can not wait a couple of hours to sell a gun until a background check is completed. if one is a convicted criminal or mentally deranged or child abuser or suspect by the fbi of terrorist activity or any thing else that will make him dangerous to the community, almost the entire country believes that he should not be able to purchase fire arms including magazines that allow him to shot dozens of bullets a minute. despite the unprecedented mass public support and the common sense of this proposal 90% of republicans voted against it, with the result of defeating the proposed legislation.

some say that unlimited gun ownership is protected by the second amendment. but who in his right mind intended to protect the right of deranged people to own guns? the 21st century assault weapons are nothing like the guns of the founding fathers' era, which were single-shot muskets and hunting rifles, for a potential invasion of the british, or an attempted takeover of individual states by our own federal government. 

and anyway, what's wrong with changing the second amendment given what it is doing to our society?

if there is no quick correction to the stupid rejection of the background check legislation washington lost any moral standing. this might be remembered as a landmark in the decline of the country that was supposed to be "the city upon a hill" (which, ironically, the puritans said about their proposed community in boston).

with the government's budget deadlock, immigration issues, continued waste of political time over the abortion debate, gun control, financial institution that are too big to fail, financial markets again flooded with derivatives that nobody understands, we are losing our grip of what made this country great.

how about a real peace prize?







by william fisher

so carried away with anticipation that they could no longer contain their enthusiasm, back in 2009 the nobel committee opted to award the peace prize to newly-elected president barack obama.

for many who took in this news, it sullied the reputation of the nobel awards almost beyond reclamation. but most of us forgave the committee for being carried away by the stark contrast between obama and the war-making george w. bush.

the nobel committee said “obama has as president created a new climate in international politics. multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position, with emphasis on the role that the united nations and other international institutions can play. 

in fact, obama had created next to nothing save hopeful rhetoric. he hadn’t had time. 

meanwhile, the nobel folks were garnering a ton of publicity not normally achieved by the awards in medicine, economics and so forth, whose titles often cause the readers’ eyes to glaze over. 

so how about a peace prize award for something that’s actually happened. think about this: since 1989, the innocence project has freed a thousand men and women from their unlawful prison sentences. that’s one thousand human beings, many of whom were set free only after rotting in jail cells or on death row for 40 or 50 years .

thanks largely to the development of dna and the incredible motivation of co-founders barry c. scheck & peter j. neufeld and their students and staff at the benjamin n. cardozo school of law at yeshiva university. 

thanks to these folks, there are now innocence projects all across the us. just their research into widespread prosecutorial misconduct would more than justify a nobel.

but by now we all know the blood-curdling stories of people sent to prison on the basis of faux, totally unscientific forensic “evidence.” we know about the police forced confessions from the innocent. we know about how law enforcement settles old scores with people they think should be in jail, whether or not they actually committed a crime. we know about our nation’s prisons using solitary confinement as a management tool, and people dying or losing their minds locked up in isolation for years on end.

and we also know that of the thousand people exonerated more than half were black and male.

for reasons that are tough to understand, i suspect the innocence project won’t be a popular choice for the peace prize. it’s going to take a groundswell of grassroots support to get some momentum going.

this is my project for the year. and i need your help to make it happen.
