l’union fait la force



sep 16, 2024




the united states is a collection of people fleeing from something or someone. christopher columbus and his friends did it to find spices, early settlers were trying to avoid taxation, some of our ancestors did it to escape death. my parents have lived out their american dream in this country and are now enjoying a successful retirement, but i am worried for them, as i am for all haitian people right now. haiti has been marred by political turmoil, natural disasters, and gang rule; getting worse every day.

kang the conqueror may be scary, but men that expect their woman to stand by their side before, during, and after being convicted of aggravated assault and battery are much, much scarier.
