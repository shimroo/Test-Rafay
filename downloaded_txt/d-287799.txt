adults at the calhoun campus
at our calhoun campus, we want to connect adults with opportunities to worship, build community, and serve. it’s our threads and it’s who we are. life groups are a great way to build community. these groups serve as the bridge to a deeper commitment to the life of the church. we have many groups for you to plug into. groups meet at our campus location on sunday and in homes during the week.
we also have ways you can serve. there’s a place for you! first west is here to help plug you in to helping us see to it that no one misses the grace of god.
