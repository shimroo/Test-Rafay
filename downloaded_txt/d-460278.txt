 "hotel planter is a lovely little refurbished 1907 hotel. we found it comfortable and clean. the room was pretty and simple, with a beautiful tall ceiling and large, tall windows. our room faced the street and we could see across the river, over the buildings. the sunset view was perfect.there's a lovely private courtyard with comfortably appointed seating. it has a nice sculpture collection and direct access to the gallery next door. great for reading and generally hanging out."zoe | google
