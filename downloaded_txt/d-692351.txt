delivery to install and cleanup, each process was communicated with clarity and ease which made our project a great success! highly recommend hsi for your dewatering needs!zach mobley00:50 27 nov 24great service and excellent product. support from hsi was top notch. if you need an affordable dewatering solution look not further!scott gray22:33 06 nov 24great product, great customer service. worked perfect for my boat ramp extension.vinay phirangi05:00 16 oct 249michael vossen18:27 14 oct 24in my line of work, we deal with water on a daily basis, so when it comes to canals and blocking water instead of using a dirt dike that could possibly blow out and cause more damage, we found aqua barriers they are simple to install and barely any clean up after your done using them.  they work perfect with blocking off any contour that the dirt banks have and sealing every possible crevice.  ordering them was super easy the main lady you deal with at hsi was awesome, super simple process and received them in a timely manner.  i highly suggest using these barriers, they will save you time and money.thank you aqua barriers and hsibradley joyce15:16 24 sep 24we use their products all the time, products have always showed up ready to work, their staff has provided valuable insight when contemplating which size would be the best for our project.balbir ballu07:19 14 sep 24google

good job. which makes it all the more disappointing that they openly support a presidential candidate who is all over jeffrey epstein's flight logs, all over jeffrey epstein's phone message logs, and has a lengthy list of child sexual assault allegations. with an entire list of children's families who were paid hush money. they also openly support a presidential candidate who has consistently praised the actions of communist autocrats like kim jong-un, vladimir putin and xi jinping. he promised a wall, he promised it would be paid for by mexico, he promised healthcare, he promised infrastructure, the list goes on and on of broken promises. but he did manage to pass a record tax break for the richest americans, further adding to the biggest deficit any president has ever rung up in this country's history. maybe that's what this company is all about after all. yet another tax break.oh, and he is also, and this has been corroborated by members of his staff during his administration, said absolutely disgusting things about our veterans and our active duty military members. he is exactly what ted cruz and other conservatives said he is back in 2015 and i pray that he loses again this november.this company claims to be christian. hopefully one day they will walk the walk when choosing who to support politically.sonu ali sonu ali08:26 26 jul 24purnima singha10:09
