prices & payment: 
we carry a large stock, and sometimes 
		things hang around longer than we would like or we simply are looking to 
		make some room so we reduce prices - we typically make a notation when a 
		price has been reduced, and these items can represent real bargains, so 
		check for them. also, we are not insulted by offers! if you see 
		something you really like, but feel the price is a little higher than it 
		should be or a little more than you can justify, make us an offer, we 
		will give you a simple "yes", "no", or "in between"! layaways: can't 
		afford to pay for an expensive item fully up front? we are happy to 
		arrange for payment plans of a few months to up to six months or more on 
		more expensive items. the terms are simple on layaways, we hold the item 
		until it is fully paid for, and if you find you cannot or do not want to 
		finish paying for an item on layaway we will buy it back at our normal 
		30% discount.
we are members of the musical box society international, 
		automatic musical instruments collectors association and the musical box 
		society of great britain.

mechantiques
				only sells antique mechanical musical devices that we 
				actually own - no consignments, no advertising other people's 
				property. we have been buying a lot of stuff during this 
				economic slowdown and currently have more than twice as much 
				inventory as we normally do, and are we having fun with it!
				click here to see some more views of 
				our enormous inventory. and it doesn't include another three 
				scarce and desirable upright disc boxes we have purchased (24 
				1/2" komet, 26 1/2" monopol, 27" symphonion) and three big band 
				organs that will be coming in in early march (wurlitzer 148, 
				wurlitzer 150, and a larger organ playing wurlitzer 165 rolls). 
				so come visit, see and hear what we have, and go home with a 
				full truck! click here for more shop 
				photos.

in 2006 the roenigks made 
		the latest addition to their group of properties in eureka springs - 
		purchasing a historic 1901 stone church and renaming it the gavioli 
		chapel. the gavioli chapel is being used for wedding ceremonies, but in 
		addition it houses a small collection of antique mechanical musical 
		instruments, highlighted by a fantastic gavioli fairground organ from 
		the tom fretty museum.  this is an 
		effort to provide a fun environment for weddings and to bring antique 
		mechanical musical instruments out in front of the public again.
