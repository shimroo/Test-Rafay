journal entry 20
i hate drama especially when it involves me. instead of destroying all of the bottles of alcohol, the spurs fort had stored away joshua, although under protest said we could give the bottles to hyatt’s arcade. hyatt could use the alcohol to increase his business. that way nothing was wasted or destroyed unnecessarily. marty was also given a few bottles to keep in the infirmary for medicinal purposes.
me, cecelia, matt and hemy loaded up most of the bottles of alcohol into a wagon. everything was going fine. matt and hemy were acting like goofy lovebirds. teasing and tickling each other. matt trips in a hole and twists his ankle, the dumb butt. hemy has to take matt limping back home to the spurs fort. cecelia and i continue to hyatt’s with the wagon of alcohol.
cecelia and i were making good time when suddenly our journey is interrupted by the hyenas. we tried to escape but didn’t make it very far. i even broke a couple of bottles of gin over hyena heads. it didn’t slow down their attack very much. poor cecelia was dragged off the road into a field. she was kicking and screaming fighting off the hyenas the best she could. i wasn’t doing much better fighting off my attackers. one of the hyenas managed to get my arm behind my back and shoved me to the ground. i hit face first. things went a little blurry after that. the next thing i knew tony and his gang came to our rescue. the hyenas were beat to a pulp and left for dead.
cecelia and i were walked back home. cecelia cried all the way home. she was so upset. my heart was pounding out of my chest but i did fine until i reached the front gate of the spurs fort. i started to cry and my legs turned into jelly. i nearly fell down. tony took me into his arms and hugged me. he kissed me on the forehead. he tried to calm my nerves by saying i would be fine. he then looked me straight in the eyes and said i needed to pull myself together. tony smiled and said i wasn’t some girly girl that would let some fight with a hyena get me down.

journal entry 19
it has been an interesting day. joshua called for a meeting. it was short and to the point. we all met in the yard in front of the main house and quietly chatted amongst ourselves as we waited for the meeting to start. kate was sitting in the rocking chair on the far end of the porch. she didn’t look very happy. her hair and clothes were a mess. she looked like she needed a drink. i’m thinking yesterday at the picnic area was the last drink kate had. joshua has not let her out of his sight since then. he even slept in kate’s room last night. neither one of them got much sleep. i know because i didn’t get much sleep listening to the two of them fight all night.
with a feeling of ceremony, cage opened the front door. joshua stepped out onto the front porch. he was wearing all black, his cowboy hat sitting square on his head. he was wearing his guns, both of them, he usually only wears one at a time. he looked like a man on a mission. his face was stern and there was a sense of determination in his voice. joshua laid down the law. there was no compromise. joshua allowed no vote, no debate, no chitchat, and no other opinions. joshua spoke his mind and he made a demand. he was protecting his own the only way he knew how.
joshua demanded that every bottle of alcohol be removed from the spurs fort. any one who didn’t want to comply with his demands could pack up and leave. there were a few rumbles from the crowd but no one spoke up against him. i think a few people wanted to but were afraid to try.
after the meeting, i asked joshua if i could help with kate. the answer was no. he would deal with his sister.  i asked if we would be sharing a room tonight. i would make it worth his while. joshua kissed me. thought about what i had said and then said “not tonight.”

journal entry 18
the day was beautiful and sunny. the picnic area in the southwest corner of the spurs fort seemed like the place to sit. at first, it was just hemy and me. we weren’t discussing anything in particular, just a lot of girl talk. over the next hour, our small intimate chat grew into a full-fledged gang meeting. it wasn’t a scheduled meeting or even a planned gathering. it just happened. i don’t even know how the topic was started but people started talking about kate’s drinking problem.
i don’t know when kate appeared on the scene or even how long she had been standing there listening to us discuss her drinking habits and other faults but she was not happy. we were all caught off guard. poor kate, she must have felt as if we were all ganging up on her. that was not our intention. at least the meeting didn’t start out that way. i admit the conversation did get a little out of hand. i feel bad for what kate probably heard, most likely did hear. people were mean with their criticisms.
kate shoved people aside and stumbled up on the table. she had a bottle of gin in her hand. kate was pissed, angry and hurt. she started yelling at us, stopping occasionally to drink from her bottle. i won’t mention everything that she said. most of it was vulgar. kate pointed out a few other people’s shortcomings. she was brutal but the reprimand was deserved. kate’s rant ended as joshua arrived on the scene. he pulled his sister off the table and demanded the rest of us disperse. i waited for everyone to leave. joshua sent me away. he wanted to talk to his sister alone.

journal entry 17
i was sleeping soundly. joshua was lying on his side in front of me. i was snuggled in close with my arm draped around his abdomen and my nose tucked into the back of his neck. life was good. i was comfortable. the chaos of the world was somewhere else. peaceful moments of bliss are far and few between so when you have one you savor every moment. i was doing that, i was savoring; which is why i was a little peeved when my peaceful slumber was suddenly interrupted.
i heard a crash in the hallway and then the door to our room is flung open by a very drunk kate. she stumbles in, lands on the foot of the bed and slides onto the floor with a thump. she starts laughing uncontrollably. i said a few things that i shouldn’t have but at the time, they seemed appropriate. joshua just sits on the bed and says nothing. that is until i mentioned that he should probably pick his drunken sister up off the floor and toss her into her own room.
after that moment, the day didn’t get any better. joshua took his sister to her room. the yelling and crying that happened after they got there could be heard over the entire fort. i covered my head with my pillow and tried to drown out the yelling. when joshua returned to our room, he was not in a very good mood. he was no longer sleepy so he dressed and went to start his day. i tried to have a conversation with him before he left but he wasn’t interested. he acted as if he was mad at me for what his sister had done.
i don’t think joshua said two words to anyone today. kate woke up mid afternoon to get something to eat. i wanted to say something to her but didn’t. i had nothing positive to say. i was angry and didn’t think that would help the situation.

i spent nearly all day long missing what used to be. i think i was daydreaming most of the day.  i was useless. i don’t think i accomplished anything.
a long time ago, back when there was television there used to be a show called “cops”. i think it was called “cops” but it might have been called something else. anyway, it was somewhat funny. criminals are caught by the police after they do something dumb. my dad would sometimes watch this show. i would sometimes watch it with him. on these days, my dad would wear pair of old shorts and a t-shirt. this was unusual because my dad was usually in a suit, even on his days off. my dad and i would pop popcorn and then we would sit on the living room couch and watch the truly stupid on tv. i miss those days.
any way, i was listening to daedalus on the radio this morning and he played the song “what you gonna do when they come for you, bad boys, bad boys.” before he announced the tony and his gang have set up an office near the center of town. the memories came flooding back. i almost cried i started missing my dad so much. it’s funny how a simple song could suddenly bring back memories you thought you had forgotten from the past.

journal entry 15
i went on a mission to the plaza for supplies with joshua, matt and hemy, just as we rounded the corner of the comp usa building a spear…yes i said spear, flew past us above our heads. we walked right into a gang war. the four of us ducked behind a garbage dumpster. we kept trying to leave the area but every time one of us peaked out from behind the dumpster, something else would fly our way. for a few moments, i thought we were going to be stuck there permanently. joshua got a little upset about being behind the dumpster so he shoots his gun off. people scattered. we left the way we came.
i don’t know what the feud was about but they were doing some serious fighting. people were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. it was crazy. the sad thing is, it was probably about something stupid. it’s always about something stupid. unfortunately, these things always escalate into something tragic. the war won’t stop until people die. i wish people would just be civilized. live and let live.
we had to take the long way around to the plaza.
the plaza was a quiet place. unusually, quiet, probably because the grapevine was at work warning people to stay at home. we didn’t find everything we needed. this isn’t unusual but it is annoying.

joshua had everyone awake at first morning light. the man is a slave driver. he wants it done today, not tomorrow, not next week but today. joshua had a list of things he wanted done around the spurs fort a mile long. no one was exempt, we all worked, every single one of us. you would think that i would get special treatment considering that i am joshua’s girl. i could get out of doing to dirtiest of jobs. think again. i think joshua makes me work harder than he makes everyone else.
it was a wonderful end to an extremely busy day. the night sky was clear. the stars were bright and the weather was gorgeous. we built a campfire in the center of the courtyard of the spurs fort. we danced, we sang, we told stories and then we ate until we couldn’t eat any more. joshua and i snuggled together practically the entire evening. it was so nice. i think he was trying to make up for making me work so hard during the day.
i love a good story. there was an assortment of tales told. joshua told a story, kate told a story, and then matt and hemy told a story together. the tales just kept flowing out of people’s mouths; it was a tremendous amount of fun. i think my favorite storyteller was cage. he is so very good and entertaining. he has a way of telling tales that sucks you into the moment. you can’t help but listen. you can’t help but imagine what he is saying in your head. i wish i could tell a story like that.

tony stopped by to talk to joshua again today. i wasn’t included in the conversation. i don’t understand it. why does tony not have a problem talking to joshua but he won’t even look at me or give me a smile acknowledging my existence. hemy thinks i should just corner tony the next time he shows up and talk to him. i’m not certain cornering tony is a good idea. i understand tony’s anger towards me. i would be mad at me too but i want to be his friend. i miss him…a little.
i don’t know if i should be sad or happy. pete has decided to leave the spurs fort and join tony’s gang. it makes sense to me. pete was the sheriff of bear country. he was an excellent sheriff too. law enforcement is in his blood. i always felt safe when pete and his deputies were around. bear country was one of the safest places to live. although, i’m not sure, if what tony is doing is law enforcement. i think it’s more like a form of vigilante street justice. i guess the life style here at the spurs fort isn’t really, what pete needs to be happy. i wish him luck.

tony and his gang are absolutely everywhere. me, joshua, pete, matt, hemy, jt, evan, cage, marty, cecelia and jonas went to hyatt’s arcade for a game of pool, darts and loud music. we arrived at hyatt’s establishment just in time to see tony and a couple of his gang members throw a couple of hyena’s out into the street. apparently, they were harassing some of the people inside and hyatt couldn’t get them to leave. i have to admit tony is very efficient. he is very good at throwing out the garbage.
anyway, hyatt’s was a lot of fun. we played, we danced, and we drank a little. ok, some of us drank a little. jonas and cage were a little over the top. at least they weren’t belligerent like kate has been this week. jonas and cage drank just enough to be humorous and make the rest of us laugh. although, i’m thinking cage is going to regret dancing on that table in nothing but his underwear. i have to admit it was a little warm inside hyatt’s arcade. i was tempted to remove my clothes too!

i went to the plaza this morning with joshua. we went for a couple of reasons. one of the reasons was that i just needed to get away from the spurs fort for a while. i think joshua needed a break from his chores too because he didn’t complain when i asked him to go. he usually gives me some excuse about having a ton of things to do and then gives me a list of other people to ask.
the second reason we went was for supplies. luckily, joshua knows exactly who to seek out when he is looking for something in particular. we don’t spend our time wondering aimlessly looking for a kiosk that might have what we need. the kiosk owner joshua was looking for didn’t set up today. we asked around and no one had seen or heard from rose in a couple of days.
on the way home, we ran into tony and his gang. they had a hyena pinned against a wall. the hyena was a bloody mess. it must have been a challenge to catch this one because tony and a couple of his people looked a bit tired and dirty. things looked as if they were under control so we didn’t interrupt the process.
