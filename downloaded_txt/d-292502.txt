sweet memories







blogging from changi terminal and the last i was blogging from this airport was 4 years ago in december 2009. so much has changed in this country and city since then. a number of new high-rises dot the singapore skyline with additional man-made wonders like gardens by the bay. had a fabulous 1 week here and thanks to family and friends for making this special. 

hope to be back where it all started for me sooner or later, only time will tell!!!

sandy 








there is hardly any stir in the air,
the yellow trees stand still, 
even the leaves are afraid to fall now.
the jack-o'-lanterns have all gone back inside the houses,
the play-ground lays barren and not a soul to see,
the shelves in the super-markets looks like they have been raided
the sky looks mostly gray,  a few black clouds dot the sky
helicopters buzzing all around probably monitoring the waters...
the dockyard is brimming with yachts and boats all tied securely
lady liberty stands alone with hardly anyone visiting her today
the phones are ringing, anxious friends and relatives wishing safety
and insurance companies too, reminding their presence and that it is never too late!
in the distant horizon the city that never sleeps patiently awaits...
the arrival of our beloved sandy!

joy time





the poem collector in me at work again... came across two really good poems which i liked. thought will post them here.joy : by rabindranath tagoreand joy is everywhere;it is in the earth's green covering of grass;in the blue serenity of the sky;in the reckless exuberance of spring;in the severe abstinence of gray winter;in the living flesh that animates our bodily frame;in the perfect poise of the human figure, noble and upright;in living;in the exercise of all our powers;in the acquisition of knowledge;in fighting evils...joy is there everywhere.time is too slow for those who waitby henry van dyketime is too slow for those who wait,too swift for those who fear,too long for those who grieve,too short for those who rejoice,but for those who love,time is eternitynow playing: vinnaithandi varuvaaya (karthik) - vinnaithaandi varuvaaya

happy deepavali 2009





standard fireworks, peacock brand, 100 wala lar grand, snake, stone, sparklers, vishnu chakram, thara chakram, buswanam, aerial color-out, morning idlis, patti-mandram, deepavali release.these are the only faint memories that i have of celebrating deepavali at home. it has been around 10 years, since i set forth out of home for college and work thereafter. in these 10 years i have been at home for deepavali only a couple of times. i know for a fact that in the coming few years, there are very less chances of me being at home for diwali.   so here i am at the airport on the diwali eve, taking a flight to chennai. this was a very impulsive booking on my part, and a last minute decision. but i dont repent it. i am sure i will cherish this weekend for ever!!so all you guys out there spending your diwali with your loved ones and family, you should feel very special and lucky!! and those who are far away from their loved ones, gather with your friends and have fun, for this is a season of lights and you should brighten your lives with this light, wherever you are in this world!!!

snapshot





quote of the monthமூச்சு விட்டு கொண்டிருப்பவன் எல்லாம் மனிதனல்ல.கிடைசி மூச்சு வரை முயற்சி செய்து கொண்டிருப்பவனே மனிதன்!a man is not defined by the fact that he is constantly breathing. one who persistently keeps trying until his last breath maketh a man!(heard this on vijay tv rendered by a tamil poet and lyricist called pa. vijay).----------------book recommendations: 1. unaccustomed earth - jhumpa lahirivery moving stories, but most of the stories have a sad undertone.2. my days - a memoir - rk narayanmy guru, my role model, my god, my constant companion. his life is as interesting as his books.--------------------------------------recent good movies : 1. unnai pol oruvan - kamal haasan - need i say more.2. kaminey---------------------------------------recent board game discovery:discovered an awesome game called risk. the objective of this game is to conquer the world. a board game with skills similar to age of empires.----------------------------------------restaurants :chutney mary (east coast road)---------------------------------------news of the month * sensex kicking some ass now.* 1 year anniversary of lehman brothers collapse and world economies showing some signs that the recession is coming to an end (touch wood, in fact touch an entire forest ).* signs of water on the moon discovered as part of the chandraayan moon mission.----------------------------------------highlights of the monthlooking forward to the singapore f1 night race this weekend!!!

the writer's block





my fingers are dancing over the qwertyi really want write something from the bottom of my hearti want to get my hands dirtyand make yet another start!there is either a famine or a flood of ideas in my cerebrumthere are times i cannot write a single wordand times where i disgorge incoherent ideas in cryptic conundrumthat are worth only to be interred!my fingers flop down on the keyboard due to lack of work in shamethey do what they usually do in such times without faili end up googling my own name, how lame,and set forth on my usual meaningless web trail.

about me

chennai & jersey city, india
i hereby herewith humbly introduce the author of this blog whose obscure existence you have stumbled upon now. this split personality who loves to sleep now lives very close to the city that never sleeps and is living the "so called" american dream . the primary identity lives a fast paced life and is still running the rat race in life. the split identity is already retired and living a  utopian life in an idyllic rural "wodehousian" or a "malgudian" setting.
