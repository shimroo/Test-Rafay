our quality
all memory lane prints are individually printed on archival paper using the highest quality long-lasting pigments. this process, called geclee (pronounced "gee-clay"), is the term used for what is currently the most advanced digital fine art printmaking technology.
the geclee printing process provides incredibly detailed prints that last longer (in excess of 120 years) and have a brighter, crisper gamut of color that is far beyond that of lithography.
 





100% money-back guarantee
if within 30 days you are unsatisfied with your memory lane print either do not approve your proof or return it for a full refund. damaged prints are immediately replaced at our expense. we ask that you package the damaged print in the same way that it arrived. we will email you a return shipper that you can easily print on your computer.
please understand that we work with the assumption that you are serious about your order and that you are awaiting your memory lane print. if you decide to cancel for any reason please let us know so that we redirect our time. separations and divorce after you have received and paid for your print are not acceptable reasons for reimbursement.
