"you can't surrender to melancholy; that's too easy. joy is a subject i go on and on about. it's one of the only emotions you can't contrive. it's impossible. despair and anger are easier to convey. joy is right next to happiness, which is not so interesting, and sentimentality. great rock 'n' roll, the raw stuff, is pure joy. it's that sense of being alive, of being grateful for your pulse." -bono, usa today 2001
