st. hope academy founded by kevin johnson

july 1989




  st. hope began in 1989 as an afterschool program in a portable
  classroom at sacramento high school


  after 13 years, st. hope realized that an after school program
  simply wasn’t enough to dramatically improve the academic
  outcomes of children, that it would be necessary to establish and
  run our own schools.


  in 2003, st. hope public schools was founded as a prek-12
  independent charter school district that provides high-quality
  education to nearly 2,000 students.
