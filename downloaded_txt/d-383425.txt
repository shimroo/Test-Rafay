fest folks,


at this time, team pro is going to continue with a few carefully selected events and working on 
developing some exciting new ones.
stand by for further additions to our 2025 schedule throughout the year.
it usually a minimum of six months to design and plan a large-scale event.
since we all depend on events for all our livelihood it will be great to have some additional and exceptional ones to share.
thank you for all the great years and hopefully many more to come.





information and applications for new events will be released as available
