website introduction...
this is a fansite archive for the best tv and movie, game and book science fiction had to offer. it is not maintained as regularly as i would like but you are welcome to browse and hang out. 
 if you like innovative, intelligently written sci fi with lots of 'gratuitous', you will most certainly enjoy the recommendations found in the reviews at sci fi sadgeezers.
this is a not for profit fansite and it may even be slightly and unintentionally offensive.
alas, we can't avoid spammers and so you aren't able to register to post in the forums, but please feel free to browse as much as you like. the forums contain posts from fans of classic sci fi shows predominently at the time they were aired - and before the moronic drivvel that is found in social media fansites (mainly :) ) - this is, after all, one of the oldest and most established cult sci fi fansites in the world with over 2,000 detailed episode reviews and 40,000+ forum posts.  some are over twenty years old!
although i can only post when i have time, i'll try and post reviews of worthy shows as soon as i can.
 the menu bar above helps you navigate the latest posts on news, tv shows, anime, movie, book and games reviews.  next, we have the sci fi sadcasts that were produced a few years ago and clicking on the guides link will take you to a structured menu of all our review content (some of the reviews are from the 1990's!). we're also re-engineering the infamous sci fi purity tests for fun and silliness. 
hopefully you will find something you like. i sincerely hope so.
welcome to sci fi sadgeezers!
