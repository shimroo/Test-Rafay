there is nothing more fascinating than collecting coins, all history is summed up in them... they are the story of humanity.
w.h. valentine, (1856-1927)
this site attempts to link coins to history and why they were made. because of this, i prefer "issued for circulation coins"
            rather than non-circulating made-for-collector pieces.  coins of certain countries are listed and what facts known about
            their striking or casting are explained.  when the pedigree or story of how the coin was acquired is of interest, this is listed.
            
areas covered: add page saying why not just greek but "pre & contemporary civs. and delineating my 3 periods of
            ancient "greek" civs.


greek states, egypt, carthage, persian empire.
ancients non-rome
roman republic & empire.
roman republic
early independent countries of latin america & brazil (brasil).
nations of south america
early talerstalers
poland

ancients  we would like classify the regions and periods issuing coins rather than the traditional listing of greek & roman.
            hopefully this can lead to a better understanding of how to link the coins and kingdoms, empires, city-states, republics, and peoples making them.
          
latin america  the early independent nations era is the period from the proclamations of independence (1810) until about 1860. a few
            significant spanish colonial issues are included. because of brazilâs unique history, almost the entire period
            of brazilian /portuguese coinage is covered (1693 - present).
