we envision a world where nonprofit leaders can focus on their mission.

 

from helping hungry children to building parks, all nonprofit organizations share a single unifying purpose: improving the lives of others.such a lofty purpose requires constant programmatic oversight to produce optimal results. unfortunately, that oversight creates a conflict that challenges any nonprofit leader: balancing the service of those in need with stewarding a donor base with equal attention and passion.

  











what we do
we build trust and excitement by offloading the daily tasks associated with the advancement and stewardship of an organization’s donor base.
