online poker is my vice



when it comes to online poker, i can't help myself. i guess it's better than going to the tracks or playing bingo with my grandparents. it can be expensive at times, but i have also won a few hands. that's for sure!

spending my christmas money online





yep. my grandfather gave me some money for christmas. i think i'm going to take it to the tables. though i have been playing poker for a while, i may try my luck at blackjack tonight. maybe i'll buy some champagne, so i can celebrate the new year and taking some suckers money. they are born every day.
