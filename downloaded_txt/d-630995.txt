maryee's sisterlock journey



welcome! i'm a writer from texas. i was locked by imani nash-bey of pomona, ca 11-28-03. i had my sisterlocks for about 8 years and cut them off in 2011. currently in the process of growing my hair back and getting re-locked soon!  i'm an avid blogger and decided to share my locked growth process with easier access to the masses. if you enjoy reading 1st person narratives and looking at photos and some videos, then you'll enjoy my blog.  *please do not copy my pictures without my permission.*

have you heard of gerrylocks?  thinning sisterlocks





i stumbled upon gerrylocks, who has sisterlocks and is a consultant.  

i wish i would have kept my locks.  i did mail some of my locks to a sl friend a few years back who had thinning areas.  not sure if it matched.  i guess on this second go around, since my back grows so fast, long and thick, i will be be "keeping" any extras...just in case.  what do you guys think of the gerrylock cranial prosthetic and hairline integration piece? i'm sure i would have done this had i known.  but then again, i did run upon this website a few years back, but couldn't find anyone locally who was creative and willing to give it a try.  i love sisterlock consultants like gerry who are innovative.  if gerry is your consultant, please share my page with her.  i already reached out to her and really want more than me being blessed enough to get their crown back. 

remember, if you are just starting to have thinning hair problems, i say get the uturn and give it a try.  i believe the company have a money back guarantee, so look into that if you chose to order the product.  if the top and edges are your issue, focus on that only, take good before pictures, eat right, watch your stress levels, and if you are not taking all natural supplements, definitely get with me.  i can help you!!  if you order it, i'm not worrying or wondering if you will be faithful.  no one wants to have  hair missing on top...male or female. #realtalk

where do i begin???




pamela bishop you are re - locking mary?? i have been thinking about it also!!

19 minutes ago via mobile · like




mary evans yes
 pamela! if you remember, my hair started thinning out on the crown 
years back and only got worse last year when i was at that stressful 
teaching job.  well, i went to the famous dermatologist in dallas, dr. 
blackburn, http://www.drraymondblackburn.yourmd.com/
  he was sweet as pie, but told me i had too much damage from scare 
tissue and that my hair would not grow back.  he gave me his "famous" 
salve and steroids shots in some places.  i was religious in putting it 
on with little to no improvement.  i changed my eating habits when i 
started taking all natural supplements and believe that helped some, but
 still, lots of scalp remained.  well, the health and wellness/weight 
loss company i am an associate for came out with this product that is 
"food for the skin" a couple of months ago.  i started using it and it 
has a began growing my hair back!  like a miracle!!  shirley williams,
 i will inbox you and pamela my before and afters.  they claimed it 
would work wonders for skin, like fine lines, wrinkles and acne, but 
scalp regeneration, too! praise the lord!!!

mama always be teaching





this has been the year from hell, in many ways than one.  i haven't had so much drama around me in all my 39 yrs on this earth. 

i wrote mama always be teaching three years ago.  now we have found out perhaps what the problem is.

what do you do when a loved one doesn't believe anything is wrong and is not willing to seek help?  please pray for our family.  we need it.

lockitup - lots of emails coming into your inbox or cell phone?





i've had this happen to me and on occasion, i'll have someone email me asking me to discontinue their relationship with the lhbe because of the insane amounts of emails they get in their inbox or cell phone.  the problem with that request is, the emails are not coming from the lhbe.

i think a lot of times when folks start researching natural hair, and especially sisterlocks, they are directed to either lockitup, which i often refer folks to, or the the locked hair blog exchange.  the main difference between the two is, the lhbe is not interactive, per se.  there's not a lot of back and forth posting and multiple posts about folks updates and hair issues and the such.  lockitup, on the other hand is par for the course.  

here's my recent response to a sister who wanted to make the emails flooding her blackberry go away:

they are not coming from the lhbe, but rather lockitup.   that's the yahoo group you must have signed up for around the same time  you became a member of the lhbe.  i'm a member of  lockitup and used to  get all those emails as well.  

in order to reduce/eliminate all the emails, all you have to do is  go into your yahoo account and click on "groups".  from there click on  lockitup.  then click on edit membership, where it has the title of the  group and your email address.  there, you scroll down to step 2 and  choose your message delivery.  i chose "special notices" because those  daily emails drop from 30 to 0, and one every blue moon.  hth. 

just know the emails are not from the lhbe, but lockitup.  if you  have any other trouble, email me back.   

blessings,

maryee

where are all the black locked people at?





over the years while i have maintained the locked hair blog exchange, i've often checked out my stat counter map of visitors.  for the longest i couldn't understand why the visitors weren't more evenly distributed across the nation.  finally today i figured it all out. the first picture below shows the visitors from america, europe and africa.  you can see clearly that the east coast and europe are heavy with visitors.

 
when you get a closeup of the us, you'll have a better glimpse of the breakdown.  i kept saying, "do no people of color have locks in other regions of the us?"   

then, i googled african american population in the united states and this is what i came up with.


  
well, i guess it all makes sense now.  i am sure in the states where the population of african americans is sparse, they may be some locked brothers and sisters, but the east coast and south/south east coastal states dominate.  when i visited the dc-maryland area in 2007 it was a love fest seeing all the locked brothers and sisters.  the more we blog about it, vlog and document it pictorially, the more ubiquitous it will become.
