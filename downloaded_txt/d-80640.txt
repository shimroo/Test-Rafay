about us  marcus moir and his wife have owned, operated 
		and managed this special travel merchandise business in bloomington, indiana since september of 1994. we decided to sell geographical and decorative world globes 
and maps from the finest globe and map manufacturers
in the world because we want to make sure that our customers received the 
		highest quality products. also, to complement our world explorer's theme, we've
added the geochron global time/map indicators, astronomy products, travel accessories, ameribag healthy back® totes, and more. 
		we offer free consultations to customers who wish to choose products 
		that complement the decor of their home and office. payment plans and 
		discounts are available for certain products. orders can be placed 24/7 
		on our website 
www.1ststoptravelstore.com. to 
		date, we've sold globes and maps to customers in over sixty countries. 
some of our 
		customers are kind enough to drop us a note, telling us what they 
		think of our customer service and the products we offer. in 2010 
		we decided to add some of these  

customer email testimonials to the website, as well as a 
		list of educational institutions and other organizations who purchased 
		our products recently, to give you a sense of who our customers are.  thank you for visiting our 
website and we hope you choose to do business with us.
marcus moir, 
		owner
