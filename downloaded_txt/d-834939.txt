2024 board of visitorsthe board of visitors is a group of individuals who simply commit to giving to camp mitchell once per year toward our selected “project”. all donations, small or large, are appreciated.  over the past 10 years, led by joanna and robert seibert, the group has raised funds for important work like paving the road to camp, rebuilding newport including the jackson chapel, and helping to fund the reopening of camp after the pandemic.  the 2024 bov project is to “paint the town!”  we plan to repair and paint the exterior of almost every building at camp mitchell, thus creating more inviting spaces for guests, and maintaining the facilities that are vital to camp’s mission.  renderings of the new color pallet have been designed by fennel & purifoy, architects.  check them out below! to give to the “paint the town” project, please contact us, send a check to our po box, or give online. be sure to select the bov fund from the dropdown menu or indicate bov in the memo line of your check.
