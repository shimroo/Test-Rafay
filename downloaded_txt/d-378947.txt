the florence, oregon relocation specialist
so you want to relocate….
moving is one of the ten most stressful events in a persons life. we humans are creatures of habit. any change large or small is difficult. but consider how difficult it is when every aspect of your life is suddenly turned on end.
you will no longer go to the same church on sunday. you don’t take the same road to work every morning. you won’t be shopping at the same stores, or see the same neighbours.
on top of all these things, you have to place your home on the market, move many miles to a new city, purchase another home, and coordinate the moving of your furniture. these are just the major issues, not to mention the thousands of details that must be dealt with. if it sounds stressful it is!
as a real estate professional, i am a service provider. yes i sell homes, but as your own personal realtor, i also provide many other services that will make your move to the beautiful oregon coast a lot easier.
so do what many others relocating to florence have done and just “scribble down sybil” and let me do all the work. you’ll be glad you did!
begin with an accredited buyer’s representative, someone to represent you.
