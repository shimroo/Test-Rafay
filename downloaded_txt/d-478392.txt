our promise
at dentpro we want you to be completely satisfied with your repair, or you will not be charged. service and quality is important to us, that's why we make this commitment to you.
×trust the originals
it has been brought to our attention there are people posing as employees of dentpro. the imposters are approaching customers in parking lots and at gas stations soliciting work. our technicians will never attempt to gain business by approaching people on the street.
make note of license plates and vehicle details and contact your local police department. in any dent repair situation, never pay a technician until you are completely satisfied with their work.
remember you can always call our office at (925) 288-8900 to verify if a technician is a member of our team.
