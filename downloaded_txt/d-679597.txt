welcome to city of washburn
                        city of washburn… a great place to live!
						
the city of washburn wants you to know how important you are to our community.  residents make washburn the one-of-a-kind community that it is and your home and family are our top priority.  we are conveniently located along the banks of the missouri river in central north dakota and offer all the best qualities of small town living.

washburn was identified as the perfect place over 200 years ago by lewis, clark and the corps of discovery. the banks of the missouri river, now the city of washburn and the surrounding area, have evolved from a frontier and gateway to the west into the energy corridor of today, providing homes to rainbow energy, basin electric and falkirk mine.
boasting a population nearing 1300 residents, we are privileged to enjoy thriving businesses, churches and an excellent school system. picturesque landscapes including the unspoiled prairie, agricultural fields growing food for the nation and the majestic missouri river are all daily sightings.
the community of washburn defines how life should be, rich in history, friendships, family, with the natural beauty of the world around us a bonus.  we are thrilled you have chosen washburn as your new home.
 
city commission meets on the 2nd monday of every month
