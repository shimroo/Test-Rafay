sup players? my name’s george donaghan, and i’m the author of this blog. you can probably guess that i’m a hardcore gamer, but how did the blog part come about? well… 



i’ve been gaming since my parents got me my first nintendo at 4 years old. from super mario to sonic, they’ve all been my favorites and i’ve followed their journey through different consoles. i did stop for a bit when i was at university completing my tech degree. but after i was done, i got back into this wonderful world, diving deeper than ever on the tech side of video games. then i figured, since i’ve got so many thoughts, might as well write them down for all my fellow nerds to read.
