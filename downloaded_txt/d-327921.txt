we love teachers !i was going nowhere in high school. i had no ambition and could not see beyond “today,” even “now.” i was happy in my experience just hanging out and doing things i shouldn’t be doing. a teacher changed/saved my life. james edge in birmingham is a man i owe so much. he taught me to play chess. i fought him at first but i started to clearly understand through the game there were consequences for every move i made whether on the chess board or in life. he taught me to make the right moves. thank you, mr. edge, because of you, i am someone! now, i have a debt to pay. -orrin ‘checkmate’ hudsonfounder/ceo, be someone inc.
