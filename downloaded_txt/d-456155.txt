empowering youth-led social change





























































with the right skills and resources, all youth can think deeply about difficult social problems and work successfully with others to create significant change.



















“i look forward to going to work every day and i’ve made friends that i care about a lot. being at te has been a good experience — no matter if i was having a good day or a bad day — it really does feel like a community.”— damani myanor, youth organizer


























our mission



to employ, train, and empower youth to, in collaboration with adults, create peace, equity, and justice.



our vision



we envision a world in which youth with adults, in mutually respectful and supportive relationships, use their voices creatively to inspire, lead, and empower their communities to achieve justice and peace.



























what we dothe center for teen empowerment employs and trains youth ages 14-19 to plan and carry out neighborhood-based youth organizing initiatives that promote peace, equity, and justice.through group facilitation, the arts, and collaboration with community members and leaders, we support youth as they process their experiences, heal from trauma, and then use their experiences as a platform to change the community for the better.

our impactte’s neighborhood-based youth organizing catalyzes multiple levels of change for sustainable impact.






















individual

confronts poverty through youth employment, on-the-job training, intentional group mentoring, building career-oriented leadership skills, and developing prosocial behaviors.











community

taps into the power of peer-to-peer influence to shift elements of culture that undermine young people and communities; strengthens relationships and supportive networks. example: teen anti-violence/peace initiatives.











institutional

builds social capital and positions youth as leaders to help adults craft effective policies that address the root causes of issues faced by youth. example: solutions, not suspensions.
