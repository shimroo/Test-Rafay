us v. ramos,
no. 21-10184 (4-10-23)(owens w/bybee; collins partial dissent and partial
concurrence)(note: this is an az fpd case). this appeal concerns a denial of a
motion to suppress statements as involuntary and, pertinent, whether the
district court properly adopted the magistrate’s report part and parcel
(including a key factual error and credibility determination) without
conducting an independent de novo review. the majority, over a dissent, finds
the district court did not abuse its discretion by wholly adopting the
magistrates’ record and recommendation finding the statements were not
involuntary, despite the defendant alleging he was threatened and coerced.  the 9th writes the court did what the federal
magistrate act allows. when a district court states, on the record, it
conducted such a review, the 9th takes it at face value, unless there is an
error of law or apparent contradiction. collins, dissenting on this issue,
would find this district court might not have conducted such a review given his
track record (concerns expressed in the past), and the sense that the same
templates have been repeatedly used. the dissent points out the absence of any
case specific or distinct facts in the order. the dissent uses the term
“rubberstamp” for the 41/2 pages. (“rubber stamp” is defined as a person or
organization that gives automatic approval or authorization to the decisions of
others, without proper consideration).

us v. salazar,
no. 22-50060 (3-8-23)(tallman w/schroeder & ikuta).  this is a significant “safety valve”
decision. on the government’s appeal, the 9th vacated a sentence and remanded
for resentencing because the sentencing court did not make a finding under 18
u.s.c. § 3553(f)(5) for “safety valve” relief from a mandatory minimum sentence
that the defendant had complied with the statutory proffer requirement. the
defendant relied upon the lengthy factual basis in the plea agreement (conspiracy
to distribute drugs in the la county jail system) to argue he gave all the
information he had.  the 9th writes that
the court, on the record, could not assume the defendant had truthfully
disclosed all the information he had about the drug conspiracy.  the finding it would have been “futile” is
not supported and the court’s conclusion that the prosecution already had all
the information the defendant could have provided did not excuse or obviate the
need for this finding. there is not a “implicit proffer” or “futile exception”
to the statutory requirement of a proffer. in practical terms, the defendant
needs to show they met or gave all the truthful information through an oral or
written proffer or a like opportunity. the plea’s factual basis on this record
does not suffice.

us v. taylor,
no. 21-10377 (3-1-23)(bress w/vandyke & restani). this is about a car stop
and whether the car stop was unreasonably prolonged. the 9th holds it was not.
the defendant here was stopped for driving without a license plate or
registration. the officers asked him if he had weapons (the defendant said
“no”) and whether he had been arrested before (yes). the officers asked the
defendant to get out of the car. the 9th states the asking of the defendant to
get out of the car did not unreasonably prolong the stop; neither did running
of a criminal records check. also, the defendant had an unzipped fanny pack,
which was reasonable to question given the lack of identification and the fact
the defendant was under supervised release. defendant’s consent to search the
car was not forced. the case was remanded to conform the written judgment of a
sr condition with the oral pronouncement (pay for programs if the defendant had
the ability).

1. us v. alvarez, no 21-50088 (2-16-2023)(r.
nelson w/m. smith & drain). the 9th affirms a 1326 conviction. the
defendant’s prior ohio assault conviction under ohio rev stat 2903.13(a) is a
cov. the 9th follows the 6th circuit.

2. us v. farias-contreras, no. 21-30055
(2-15-23)(wardlaw w/gould; dissent by bennett). the prosecutor agreed to
recommend a low-end gl sentence. however, the prosecutor undermines the
recommendation with an inflammatory sentencing memorandum decrying the harm and
pain drug trafficking visited on the community by “pumping poison” to the
streets. the majority, under plain error, concludes the inflammatory statements
violated the plea agreement.  bennett
dissents. he argues the prosecutor complied by stating the recommendation, and
as expressly permitted by the plea, could present other facts. bennett
concludes by calling for en banc or scotus review.

3. us v. michell, no. 19-10059
(2-15-23)(wardlaw w/garner; partial concurrence and dissent by baker). this is
a rehaif issue. under plain error, the 9th affirmed convictions for
unlawful firearm possession. the error was plain – knowledge of a felony is an
element – but here the 9th could take judicial notice outside the record of
other convictions, where the knowledge of felonies was clear. no prejudice
existed. baker dissents. he argues the defendant had a fighting chance of
arguing to the jury he really didn’t know.

1. 
us v. richards, no. 21-10190 (10-31-22)(callahan w/bybee & collins). the 9th
affirms two consecutive 24-month sentences for sr violations. the 9th
rejected the argument that sr violations for criminal conduction should be
proved beyond a reasonable doubt and not preponderance. justice breyer’s
controlling concurrence in haymond still rules the day; the 9th rejected this
in previous precedent; and all other circuits have rejected this argument. the
consecutive sentences are supported by the actions of two distinct offenses, at
different places and times (possession of a firearm and ammunition). the
sentences also flow from two distinct counts in the underlying indictment.
last, the violation and sentences are supported by sufficient evidence.

2. in
re jane doe, no. 22-70098 (graber w/friedland & koh). the 9th
reiterates that a defendant may agree to restitution in a plea agreement even
where there is otherwise no statutory authority for it.

us v. holguin, no. 19-50158 (10-13-22)(nguyen w/bea;
partial concurrence/partial dissent by berzon). 
it would be “prudent” to test expert witnesses under daubert, especially
with such expertise as gangs and when the experts were law enforcement.   such testing did not occur in this mexican
mafia case when the “experts”  were just
lay witnesses and officers. yet the  9th
affirmed  under plain error because of
the harmlessness. other issues include dual role of law enforcement  as experts and lay witnesses, adequacy of
jury instructions about how to use such testimony, and gang evidence.
berzon dissents on the harmlessness of introducing drug
jargon expert testimony.

us
v. saelee, no. 20-10209 (10/11/22)(collins w/nguyen & burgess). the 9th
affirmed convictions for attempted possession of ecstasy and conspiracy. the
9th find the “independent source” doctrine permitted evidence to come in
despite 4th amendment violations (the warrant was issued minutes after the
violations based on previous information). the 9th also held evidence was
sufficient evidence to support the convictions. co-conspirator statements were
not hearsay and admission of other evidence, such as showing a photo of a wad
of money, and testimony about ammunition, were not erroneous nor
prejudicial. the decision is here:https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/10/11/20-10209.pdf

1. us v. chen, no. 20-50333 (9-14-22)(navarro w/rawlinson & christen). “we hold that a district court may consider the first step’s non-retroactive changes to sentencing law, in combination with other factors particular to the individual defendant, when determining whether extraordinary and compelling reasons exist for a sentence reduction under 18 u.s.c. 3582(c)(1)(a).” p. 3.the issue was stacked 924(c)s. the sentencing court can consider the change in law.congrats to joshua weiss & kathryn young, deputy fpds, cal c (l.a.).https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/09/14/20-50333.pdf2.  us v. fowler, no. 21-30172 (9-13-22)(miller w/ikuta & pregerson). affirming denial of a suppression motion, the 9th upheld the cross-deputization of a montana state trooper to enforce tribal law when there is a gap in the jurisdictions. the trooper stopped the defendant, an indian, on a highway cutting through the reservation. the cross-deputization agreement was valid. the fact the deputy did not carry an identification card which clearly violates the agreement did not rise to a serious enough violation to cause the sovereign parties to seek a remedy.https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/09/13/21-30172.pdf3. us v. montoya, no. 21-50129 (9-13-22)(lee w/ikuta; concurrence by forrest). the 9th wouldn’t let appellant withdraw her guilty plea. the appellant argued the court’s saying it “rejected” a non-binding sentencing recommendation transformed the plea to an 11(c)(1)(c). “no,” says the 9th; the word didn’t make it what it wasn’t. the 9th also held failing to orally recite the standard conditions was not err. us v napier, 463 f.3d 1040 (9th cir 2006) does not require it. at the cop colloquy, the court’s failure to say the defendant had a right to a jury trial did not affect her rights. concurring, forrest regards napier as wrong. the “standard” conditions are too broad a definition.https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/09/13/21-50129.pdf

1.
us v. latu, no. 19-10069 (nguyen w/wardlaw & owens). the 9th
affirms a conviction for assault resulting in serious bodily injury that
occurred at a federal detention center. the victim, also a detainee, refused to
testify. his statements as to the injuries and pain came in, over a crawford
confrontation objection, because the statements fit into a hearsay exception
(medical treatment) and they were given in medical treatment as opposed to
questioning or law enforcement. this was true even though the medical nurse was
a bop employee. the primary purpose was treatment for traumatic injuries and
medical care. of note, the 9th emphatically states it is not
adopting a categorical rule or presumption that all statements to medical staff
or during treatment is admissible and not crawford barred. the 9th
emphasizes sometimes, the statements are testimonial and subject to crawford.
the factors here are the role of the nurse (treatment and not questioning), the
trauma, and the informality.

2.
wright v. alaska, no. 19-35543 (8-31-22)(murguia w/nelson; concurrence by
rawlinson). custody on a failure to register as a sex offender charge  is
not “custody” for habeas jurisdiction to challenge underlying state convictions
that gave rise to the requirement to register. the supreme court dealt with the
argument in alaska v. wright, 141 s. ct 1467 (2021). petitioner’s attempt here
to argue a “restraint-on-liberty” condition by registration also fails. he was
not in custody. rawlinson concurs, stating the court’s per curium decision
dealt with both theories and the “rehash’ in this opinion was not necessary.

us
v. anderson, no. 20-50207 (8-25-22)(rawlinson w/owens; dissent by fletcher).
the 9th considers whether a contracted private security guard threatened by
defendant is an “official” under 18 usc 115 through a cross reference to 1114
which extends to those assisting officials.  the majority says “yes,”
while acknowledging the ambiguity and confusion in the statute. the majority
concludes the term “official” in 115 is not meant as a limitation. the dissent,
fletcher, says: yes it should. the statute is ambiguous and the language must
be read as a limitation. it should not apply to this guard as an “official.”
the rule 29 should be granted. the majority joins the 3rd and 8th circuits.
interesting
statutory issue and one that may have appeal to scotus.

1. nguyen v.
frauenheim, no. 20-56284 (8-22-22)(m. smith w/bade & vandyke). the 9th
affirms denial of a habeas petition, finding no batson violation. the batson
challenge went to gender and mixed race. the 9th reiterates that
teague bars new rules being established in habeas. as such, looking at a class
of hispanic women would be a new class (hispanic and gender). there was also no
batson violation as to the hispanic juror.

2. us v.
ramirez-ramirez, no. 21-10127 (8-22-22)(paez w/hawkins & watford). summary
by ryan moore, afpd (appeals), d. az, who argued the case: “the ca9 holds on
plain error that the 6a public-trial right applies to the phase of announcing
guilt in a bench trial. only the ca2 so held previously. the district court
announced its findings of guilt about a week after the bench trial only in
writing, while the defendant sat in jail. the panel held that the 6a requires
findings of guilt be made in open court, even when the factfinder is the judge.
although the panel also held that the district court’s later reiteration of its findings at sentencing satisfied the 6a’s
open-court requirement,
it nonetheless remanded for specific findings of fact because the district
court had denied as untimely a request for specific findings made after the
written announcement of guilt, which was
“legally insufficient.”
unfortunately, the plain error standard doomed what the panel called “a strong argument” that the guilt by email scheme also
violated the rights to
be present under the 5a and rule 43(a). and we really should have gotten a new
trial for the 6a violation, in my opinion, because a mere reiteration at
sentencing of a decision made long after the judge has moved on is not a
substitute for the moment of truth when the judge faces a defendant in trial
and makes/announces the decision in open court. but the caselaw isn’t great on
the remedy for this structural error and a new trial was always a longshot.”

3. us v.
jaimez, no. 19-50253 (8-23-22)(bress w/fitzwater; concurrence/dissent by
owens). the 9th affirms convictions for rico, money laundering, and
conspiracy. there was sufficient evidence. owens dissents on money laundering,
arguing the defendant, a low level “foot soldier,” did not know the purpose of
the money laundering actions was to conceal financial transactions.

crespin
v. ryan, no. 18-15073 (8-19-22)(hurwitz w/hawkins & m. smith). the 9th
affirms a conditional grant of habeas. this presents a miller claim,
narrowed under jones v. mississippi, 141 s. ct 1307 (2021). petitioner
was 16 when charged with a capital offense. he pled to lwop, pre-miller.
the 9th held he could challenge post-conviction. the 9th
then held that miller and jones both require the court to
exercise its discretion. here, the trial court stated he had no discretion in
sentencing and had to impose lwop. the 9th rejects the state’s
argument that the court could have rejected the plea. rejection is not
discretion in sentencing, and did not comply with miller.

1.
us v. rodriguez, no. 21-50108 (8-17-22)(m. smith w/bade; concurrence by
vandyke). the 9th remands for resentencing. in sentencing for
importation, the court erred in denying a minor role adjustment by misapplying
the factors set out in 3b1.2(b). in denying the adjustment, the court failed to
recognize the comparison is with an average participant in a particular
conspiracy or enterprise; failed to consider a recruiter’s culpability in
luring the defendant; failed to consider the degree of involvement in the
factors; and failed to consider the totality of circumstances. the court tended
to have a stark choice about applicability.  upon resentencing, as to
certain factors, the 9th instructs the court to focus on the scope
of defendant’s knowledge of the entire criminal enterprise (which was limited);
the fact he was paid a discrete amount rather than a percentage; and the
receiving of instructions does not mean one plans or organizations conduct.
concurring,
vandyke agrees with the remand. he writes to stress a court can consider
evidence beyond the five factors listed in 3b1.2(b). he also states that
running large quantities of drugs across the border can indicate a knowledge of
participants involved.
this
is a good case for use of “minor role” and the factored approach.

2.
us v. carter, no. 19-10411(8-17-22)(bea w/murguia & berzon). this is a
first step act issue about what changes and facts can be considered in using
discretion to reduce a sentence in resentencing. the 9th states that
concepcion v us, 142 s. ct 2389 (2022) allows (1) district courts to
examine intervening changes in the law or fact in exercising discretion in
reducing a sentence; (2) the court must consider nonfrivolous arguments in
exercising discretion, and so changes of fact can be considered; and (3) the
court must explain its reasoning. the 9th holds concepcion
abrogates 9th precedent in us v. kelly, 962 f. 3d 470 (9th
cir. 2020). kelly limited the first step act to sections 2 and 3 of the
fair sentencing act and the changes there. concepcion expands the scope.

us
v. magdaleno, no. 20-10390 (8-11-22)(clifton w/m. smith & reiss). siblings
don’t qualify as an “intimate familial relationship”? at least not under plain
error, and on this record, which involves a sr condition for the defendant, a
member of the east las casitas norteno street gang, not to associate
with fellow gang members. his siblings and half-siblings are members of the
gang. the 9th  considers wolf child, which holds that
certain close family ties are fundamental liberty interests that need special
findings and proof. the relationship with brothers and half-brothers, on this
record, did not rise to such a relationship. the court did not procedurally err
by failing to make certain findings; and did not err in imposing this condition
on the record.

1.
fauber v. davis, no. 17-99001 (8-5-22)(bress w/forrest; dissent by watford).
the 9th affirms denial of a capital habeas. under aedpa deference,
the 9th finds no iac when counsel failed to object to prosecutorial
vouching. in closing,  the prosecutor
read the cooperating witness’s plea agreement which state the prosecutor and
court would assess testimony for truthfulness.
more
concerning, the majority found no error in the
exclusion from mitigation the state’s plea offer to life. petitioner sought to
introduce to counter the argument of future dangerousness. the majority
concludes there is no clearly established federal constitutional law that holds
an unaccepted plea is mitigating evidence. even if it were, the majority
concludes exclusion was not prejudicial.
dissenting,
watford points to the need to counter the prosecutor’s full-throated argument
the petitioner would kill again  if given lwop. watford argues federal law
is clear on this point and it is not harmless.

montiel v. chappell, no. 15-99000 (friedland w/fletcher & hurwitz)(8-5-22).
the 9th affirms denial of a petitioner for iac under aedpa

summary denial of a review petition was on the merits. even assuming counsel
was iac for failing to present expert evidence of diminished capacity due to
substance abuse and a history of substance abuse, the state court was
reasonable in finding there was no prejudice.

us
v. brown, no. 20-50313 (8-2-22)(daniels w/mckeown & ikuta). after such
knowledge, what forgive? sure, a bit poetic,
but it comes into play with this “safety valve” defendant and the first step
act. the first step act proscribes using information in a safety valve proffer from enhancing a sentence. the defendant
gave a safety valve proffer, which disclosed other drug courier trips. the
court referenced this as part of the 3553 factors, along with other
information, in sentencing the defendant to a 78 month sentence: below the
mandatory minimum and below the guidelines range, but higher than the
government recommendation (71 months) and what the defendant wanted. the court
focused on a variety of factors, including use of a minor in the transport, the
length of involvement with the traffickers, the impact on the community, and
the earning of considerable sums. the case thus turns on “enhancing.”
as
a first impression, the 9th holds the sentence was not improper. a
failure to reduce a sentence is not an enhancement. [the opinion cites
extensive authority that a failure to reduce is not an enhancement.] the court
considered a variety of factors – aggravating and mitigating – in fashioning
this sentence. the first step act does not strip the court of the ability to
consider the information in its sentencing discretion.

1. 
united states v. wright, no. 20-50361 (bennett (d. md.) with berzon and
bea) –- the panel affirmed the denial of a motion for a sentence reduction
under 18 u.s.c. § 3582(c)(1)(a), holding that error in treating the
guidelines’s policy statement on compassionate release as binding can be
harmless when the district court makes an alternative ruling based on the 18
u.s.c. § 3553(a) factors that is itself a proper exercise of sentencing
discretion.  the panel also held that the defendant had abandoned his
alternative request for home confinement by failing to separately argue it.

sansing v. shinn, no. 13-99001 (watford with callahan; berzon
dissenting) –- [this is an arizona chu case.]  the panel denied a petition
for rehearing and issued a revised opinion and revised dissent that does not
change the previous outcome of the appeal (no relief, but berzon dissented and
would order resentencing) but accounts for the supreme court’s recent ruling in
brown v. davenport, 142 s. ct. 1510 (2022), which discusses how to apply
harmless-error review (here, to a claim under ring v. arizona, 536 u.s.
584 (2002)) in habeas proceedings.  the panel did not allow further
petitions for rehearing based on the revised opinion and dissent.
