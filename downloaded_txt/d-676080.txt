da's office: felony probation violations: report for september 24-27





charlotte, n.c. –  the following is a summary of the felony probation violation cases scheduled 
during the week of september 24, 2012.  the cases were heard by the honorable james w. 
morgan, superior court judge and the honorable richard d. boner, superior court judge, in 
courtroom 5170 of the mecklenburg county courthouse.

one hundred seventy six (176) defendants came before the court.

25 were scheduled for a probable cause hearing after a recent arrest for a probation 
violation
56 had their hearing date continued after a motion by the state or defendant
12 were on for a review set by a previous judge, had an order for arrest issued for 
failing to appear, or fell within another miscellaneous category
77 admitted violating probation
1 denied violating probation, had a hearing and were found in violation by the judge
5 had their probation violations dismissed by the court.
0 denied violating probation, had a hearing and were not found to be in violation by 
the judge
22 had their probation terminated by the judge
13 were sentenced to a 90 day period of confinement (but revocation was not 
permitted pursuant to n.c.g.s. 15a-1344(d2))
18 were revoked from probation by the judge (if probation is revoked, the defendant is 
sent to prison to serve the previously suspended prison sentence)
24 were not revoked from probation by the judge; instead, they were continued on 
supervised probation under the same or additional conditions

notes about probation violations:  
generally, felony probation violation cases are scheduled every other week in courtroom 5170; the cases are 
heard monday through thursday.  each friday of these weeks the courtroom is used for felony guilty pleas or to 
hear motions for appropriate relief as allowed pursuant to n.c.g.s. 15a-1411 through -1422.

in response to a felony probation violation, a defendant may admit or deny the violation(s). if the defendant 
admits the violation(s) and the violation(s) are for anything other than committing a new offense or absconding 
supervision the judge cannot revoke probation and activate the suspended sentence; he/she may only sentence the 
defendant to a 90-day period of confinement pursuant to n.c.g.s. 15a-1344(d2).  however, if the defendant has 
already been sentenced to two such periods of confinement or if the defendant admits to being an absconder or to 
committing a new offense, the presiding judge can revoke the defendant’s probation. in lieu of periods of 
district attorney’s office
state of north carolina
26th prosecutorial district
mecklenburg county
charmeckda.com
news
release
r. andrew murray
district attorney confinement or revocation, the judge may choose to continue the defendant on supervised probation under the 
same or additional terms, or to terminate (end) the supervision. if a defendant denies the violation(s), a hearing 
is held in which the probation officer usually testifies. if the defendant is found by the judge to be in willful 
violation of his/her terms of probation, the judge will take one of the same actions described above that he/she 
would be permitted to take if the defendant had admitted to the violation(s). 

the da’s office does not have the power to dismiss, or negotiate the outcome of, a probation violation.  a 
previous sentencing judge has issued an order placing the defendant on probation and all violations of that term 
of probation are alleged by the probation officer and brought before a judge to determine whether a violation 
exists and, if so, what action should be taken against the defendant for the violation. 

in addition to the probation violation hearings, on monday of every week, hearings are held to determine whether 
probable cause exists to detain defendants that have been recently arrested for a probation violation.  if probable 
cause is found, a violation hearing is set for the next available date.  if, in lieu of waiting for a violation hearing 
date, the defendant chooses to immediately admit violation and request activation of his/her sentence, and if such 
request is lawful, he/she may do so.

da's office: two convicted of cruelty to animals; seven convicted of dwi





the misdemeanor appeals team for the mecklenburg county district attorney’s office held court in courtroom 5170 for the week of september 17, 2012 before the honorable linwood o. foust , superior court judge.  in addition, cases were also called in courtroom 5150 before the honorable richard d. boner, superior court judge, in courtroom 5130 with the honorable richard a. baddour, jr., superior court judge, and in courtroom 5370 with the honorable eric l. levinson, superior court judge.

monday, september 17, was designated as an administrative day in courtroom 5170. in the morning, the state called the trial calendar for the week. the court then heard felony probation violation probable cause hearings and arraignments for misdemeanor appeals cases. 

the following trials were done throughout the week in three courtrooms:

alvin jasper, 65, and javaris black, 23, were tried together for cruelty to animals. the jury found the defendants guilty in that both jasper and black failed to provide the necessary sustenance to 6 horses when they did not provide adequate food and water for the animals. five of the six animals have made a full recovery. judge levinson sentenced black and jasper to 30 days in the county jail, respectively; both sentences were suspended pending the successful completion of 18 months of unsupervised probation.

jereme david lukoskie, 27, was tried for driving while impaired. the jury returned a verdict of guilty. judge foust sentenced lukoskie to 30 days in the county jail; that sentence was suspended pending the successful completion of 12 months unsupervised probation. 

danielle micaela gaddy, 28, was tried for injury to personal property. the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. 

note:  misdemeanors and infractions are originally prosecuted in district court in north carolina.  in criminal district court, a judge determines guilt, not a jury; this is commonly referred to as a “bench trial.”  however, defendants have a right to appeal a conviction from the district court to the superior court for a trial de novo.  the new trial in superior court must be a jury trial, not a bench trial. in a de novo trial, the jury cannot be informed that a district court judge previously found the defendant guilty; further, a record of any evidence, including testimony, from district court may not be introduced. while the da’s office prosecutes nearly 225,000 misdemeanors and infractions each year in district court in mecklenburg county, each defendant is entitled to exercise his/her right to appeal to the superior court.  when a misdemeanor or infraction occupies the limited time available in our superior courtrooms, it the intent of the da’s office to keep the public informed of the results through news releases like this one.  due to the volume of misdemeanors and infractions prosecuted in district court each day, reports like this are not possible for all of those cases.
