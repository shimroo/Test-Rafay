living heritage events 2025




a year full of your favourite events at some of the uk’s top venues. 
the game and country shows are full of country sports and pursuits with arena entertainment running throughout the day. watch the fast-paced horse boarding, scurry driving, the majestic falconry and gun dog displays.
in the world of dogs there is plenty to see and do with a gundog clinic, lurcher showing and racing, a gundog multi-scurry and the fun dog show that any pet can enter, so don’t leave your dog at home.
please see individual show pages for further information and schedules.
the sandringham food, craft and wood festival is a combined event of two of our shows incorporating the wood and craft fair and the sandringham food festival.
this event offers value for money with two shows wrapped into one and features the sandringham cup, a chainsaw competition, and celebrity chefs on stage in the main cookery theatre.
our final show of the season is our ever popular sandringham christmas craft, food and gift fair – november 14th, 15th & 16th 2025. this show is full of christmas shopping ideas and entertainment for the whole family to enjoy for a great day out. it attracts visitors from not only the local area but also further afield with many tour operators offering coach trips to this event, please contact your local operator if this is of interest to you.
regular show updates will be published on our website and facebook pages.
dogs are more than welcome at all of our events.
in the meantime, we look forward to seeing you at an event near you.

kind regards
