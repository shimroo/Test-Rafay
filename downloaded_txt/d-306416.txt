overview

promote information and services based on trending content, location, seasons, and more
surface relevant content based on user needs and actions
easily update websites using design and content templates
use the insights dashboard to make real-time, data-driven website changes based on user needs




“our expectation is you shouldn’t have a different experience working with your government than you do with retailers. our constituents push us to innovate and that’s why the work we’ve done with opencities and granicus has been so important to us.”  
todd shanley
cio, cabarrus county

respond to resident needs
communities are always changing. websites need flexibility to keep pace. easily adjust the website look and feel with design and content templates that allow quick response to user needs and interests without a full website redesign.

functionality
government agencies of all sizes are partnering with opencities to redesign the way they do business. with a population-based subscription model and minimal website set-up time, opencities empowers customers to create useful and proven digital interactions today and into the future.








industry-driven framework and tools


while every government is unique, residents share many common needs: easily finding information, connecting to their government, and accessing services. opencities provides best-practice templates and layouts to effectively reach constituents and meet their needs.




shared website management 


low-code, no-code templates and tools make it easy for staff to play a role in updating and improving websites, without needing technical knowledge. the opencities cloud-based solution provides standardized templates and customizable approval workflows, and is accessible whether working from home, the office, or on the road.




reusable content


intuitive tools simplify website editing and allow content to be published once and used anywhere on websites, including webpages, social media, maps, calendars, email notifications, and more!




dynamic content discovery


connect and engage users by helping them easily find content of interest. website visitors can discover nearby services and activities through location-based information, enjoy personalized content suggestions based on recent transactions, and be supported by a smart search engine that simplifies the complexity of government.




data that makes sense


while analytics data is powerful, it can be difficult to translate into strategy. the insights dashboard integrates with google analytics to translate numbers into actionable insights that guide you in optimizing websites to meet user needs. built-in feedback forms also allow content testing and enhancement.




best-in-class security, maintenance, and support


opencities customers can count on support from security experts who, armed with best-in-class security measures, guide platform development and ensure that data remains protected. enjoy ongoing technology, accessibility, and security upgrades, all included as part of the website subscription.








“we knew we wanted to provide a better user experience for our residents, but in order to do that we needed a platform that was also a better user experience for our staff. the second we started creating content with opencities we knew it was so much more intuitive.”
tj barttelbort
purchasing manager, city of cheyenne, wy
