on-demand charterwe stand ready with our fleet of light jet and turboprop aircraft to fulfill your mission with unmatched efficiency and comfort. call to book your flight today!



jet card membershipif you fly more than 20 hours a year,  a jet card membership can be a wonderful fit, combining ease-of-use with maximum flexibility and minimum commitment.



 aircraft managementfor total control of your schedule and experience, whole aircraft management is a great option to fly without compromise while realizing efficient cost savings.














your schedule is our itinerary. 



maxair has been providing private air charter service to the fox cities and surrounding midwest region for nearly 50 years. throughout our history, our commitment to provide charter service with the safest aircraft, the best trained crews, and at the most affordable rates has remained unchanged.now offering multiple flight programs, we’re guaranteed to have the most efficient solution to service your needs. with maxair share or aircraft management, you can own your aircraft asset and enjoy the flexibility and potential tax advantages that entails. if you don’t fly enough to justify that kind of commitment, our maxair jet card and on-demand charter services can meet your needs on an ad hoc basis.maxair has you covered.



















your safety is our #1 priority.














safety isn’t optional.



yes. that means your satisfaction is technically our second priority, but we think you’ll understand our logic. whenever you charter an aircraft, what you’re really paying for is the operator’s safety expertise and judgement. if you can’t go safely, you shouldn’t go. “get-there-itis” is one of the leading causes of aviation accidents, and all good crews know it.luckily for maxair customers, safe operations are integral our culture. we fly the most capable aircraft, maintained to exceeding standards, all operated by experienced crew who know when to go, and when to wait it out. our crews are trained to fly conservatively and not take unnecessary risks for all operations. the result is an impeccable safety record that we’re proud of. for you, that means peace of mind no matter the weather.



















 training is key.



all maxair crews specialize in one primary aircraft type, but maintain a second type to keep training fresh and complacency out of the picture. this technique yields crews with exceptional fundamental flying skills and rigorous type-specific knowledge from cross-training between common systems and techniques.



















“maxair has handled some pretty tricky trips for us. whether it’s been flying the family to our walleye spot up north, or going all the way to alaska to fish for king salmon. maxair gets us there with ease.”
