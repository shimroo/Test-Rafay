aquadiamonds is a unique space age super absorbent copolymer, also known as, soil polymers, water
crystals, or polymer crystals that is completely safe for the 
environment!  it is a
  free flowing white granular   copolymer of polyacrylamide,
that  absorbs hundreds of times it's weight in water and can
last for years!  soil polymers have a wide variety of uses in agriculture
as well as in home and garden applications.  water management
concerning houseplants, gardening and turf have always
presented challenges to all, from the layman to the experienced gardener. 
depending on soil types, climate, rainfall and an individual's
gardening habits determine how
and when you will use them.  obviously, plant life that require
large amounts of  water naturally require larger concentrations of soil
polymers in the growing medium mixture.  these mediums include;
all  soil  types, (including clay), sand, gravel, mulch, cactus & succulent
mixes, bark and woodchips.  if
you've ever purchased bamboo plants, in fine gravel, there's a good
chance that the grower added some  soil polymer  to the gravel before planting.  
    the uses for  superabsorbent

soil polymers are wide spread: in seed germination; for root dipping; as a
transportation and transplant aid for turf, bedding plants,  trees and shrubs.
gardeners often recommend adding  soil polymers to  container plants, especially
hanging baskets and window boxes. you can find testimonials from gardeners on
the internet in any of the "gardening forums".
    aquadiamonds can be used in
 container plants, hanging baskets, flower beds, ornamental  gardens and for
shrubs, trees,
vegetable gardens, turf and lawns for   water management and  erosion  control. 
    

with aquadiamonds you can grow plants without soil. 
see our, "ordering" page for more information, or go directly to the,  

"directions
-pack" page.)  on
the, "soil applications page,
you'll find basic ways to dry mix aquadiamonds with growing mediums such as , 
soil or sand, as well as a chart for  bulk mixing. 
there is also plenty of
useful information for, dry mixing and applying aquadiamonds for  irrigation and
anti-erosion uses on the, "technical spec's page.  
       aquadiamonds is decorative, as well as functional. you can float candles in
it, the wax won't stick to it and it can't burn. you can color it any color that you
want with food coloring, and or, glitter. (for
great candles, and other decorative home items, don't forget to visit our,
"resources" page.)  you can suspend solid, non ferrous
objects in it, and by adding back, or leaving in, a little excess water,
you can accomplish that "clear look", after stirring out the bubbles.
(this method is not used for growing  houseplants. for  houseplants we always drain well.)  please visit the,     "display
photos"      page, to get some ideas on what you can
do, or go straight to our, "projects"
page.  
    for freshly
cut flowers, aquadiamonds can't be beat.  you will be able to
arrange and stagger them on diagonals while prolonging their lifespan. 
when the  flowers eventually die, you'll simply rinse out the aquadiamonds
in a colander, allow to drip dry and then store them for future cut flower
use.
