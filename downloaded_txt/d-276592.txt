be alive. be strong. be happy. just be.
g-pact is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides services to patients who suffer from digestive tract paralysis including gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and colonic inertia. we reach out to over 35 countries and all 50 states. we focus on a variety of options and provide services and information completely free of charge. we are staffed completely by volunteers, so 100% of donations go to support our activities.






meet hope the panda




you’re not alone. and i’m here to help!
on g-pact’s 15th birthday on august 23, 2016, we introduced hope, a giant panda, to our family. she is helping us educate others as we march toward a cure! giant pandas have a lot in common with people who have any form of digestive tract paralysis
we are striving towards a brighter future of treatment, knowledge, and a cure. hope is what carries us through when things get tough, and hope will continue to move us forward.
hope has a story too. she has a lot in common with us.
