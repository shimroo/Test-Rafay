okay, let's get something straight right now ... i'm not a bad guy. i didn't ask for bounty hunters to shoot at me, imperial enthusiasts to hunt for me, hutts to torture me, and i certainly didn't want to involve any jedi masters in this mess. who knew everyone would get so up in arms about ancient death star blueprints? so, when the blasters start blasting and lightsabers start swinging, just remember ... this is not my fault.
