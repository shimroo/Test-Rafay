moyamoya disease - internet support group for moyamoya families













internet support for those 
    diagnosed with moyamoya disease









"maui 
        maui? what the hell is that!!??"

        those were my exact words when i first heard of moyamoya in june 2001. i 
        spent the next two months searching the internet for everything i could 
        find on moyamoya disease. my name is dj and i've been "blessed" with 
        moyamoya.if you're here, it's probably 
        because you're like me and came to the internet to find out more about 
        this rare disorder. if you're like me, you also didn't have much success 
        looking through the search engines. there's not a huge amount of 
        information out there huh?
well, that's all 
        about to change!
probably the worst part about being diagnosed with 
        a rare disease is thinking you are the only one in the world who is 
        dealing with the problems associated with the disease. i hope to change 
        all that!estimated prevalence of moyamoya 
        in the us from a study in the mid 1990's was approximately 1 in 
        2,000,000 people. updated numbers have recently been reported in a study[1] 
        that looked at moyamoya cases in us hospitals between 1988 and 2004 that 
        puts the prevalence at more like 1 in 119,000[2] 
        people.
 





i would like to build 
        the world's largest support group for family members and those that 
        suffer from moyamoya.never again do i want 
        someone to have to come to the internet and have as much trouble as i 
        had finding information on moyamoya. i hope to save you the time by 
        putting all of the links here that it took me months to find.
        i've successfully come through from my second 
        sta-mca bypass surgery at 
        stanford university and am concentrating on building a bigger and 
        better support site for those diagnosed with moyamoya and their 
        families.
