manny will stay with dodgers, according to local website





according to local website impacto deportivo manny ramirez will stay with la and will make it official this friday after returning from brasil."this wednesday was informed to impacto deportivo that ramirez had already decided with the dodgers", said the local website."ramirez is on vacation in brasil and as soon as he returns this friday will make his deal official, tha last offer from the dodgers was 15.0 millions for 2009, 22.5 for 2010 and 27.5 for 2011, but this offer will be improved, why? manny wants the dodgers and the dodgers want manny".well, i personally don't give any credit to this report from this source, sometimes they make big impact with news from dominican players because the good relations they have with them, but in this case i'm sure they are wrong.

so the dodgers are in the playoffs, but for how long?





the dodgers finally made it to the playoffs, thanks in some part to manny ramirez, but how far will they go this year? will they get another post-season victory so jose lima will shut about it? are they any good to compete? or they are here just because they played in the worst division of baseball? personally i had lost any hope of the dodgers getting any series victory.

trying to keep up





i've been away from blogging for a while, a lot happened in my absence, winter baseball ended, the mitchell report was on the news, dominican republic threatened not to attend the the 2009 baseball classic, yeah right, the 2008 season started, and of course, the dodgers are struggling... no surprise there.

need cash, bet against your favorite team.





what can you say about a country that gambles on everything? from sports to politics, casino and rooster fights.but gambling in sports is pretty amazing here; you can say that betting in baseball can be a common thing, maybe basketball too, but what about hockey? or college football? neither of those two sports are popular here or anyone can practice them here, but they bet on them anyway, how? well, here in the dr there’s a gambling place or “banca de apuestas” in almost every corner of the country.even in sports shows they give you hints for bets, 1900 numbers, cell phone text messages, and all kind of things to facilitate your bets.the difference between bets in the dr or the united states is in the internet, in the us you have websites like www.betus.com and here you have to go the nearest “banca” and make your plays, some people go for the safe bet and put their money on one or two teams, but many waste their money on 4 and even 6 teams, sometimes they get very lucky and collect a good amount of money, but in many cases they loose their money.it’s amazing to see people in the morning reading the sport sections to see if they collected or if they loose, check on the upcoming games to see at what time they have to be on the “banca” to see the “lines” and place a bet, sometimes making their evening plans counting with the money they will collect.they follow stats, but not to see how the teams is doing, but to bet against the team on a hot streak.if you ever had the chance to go the ballpark in the dr, you’ll see people betting on the next hit, the double, and even on the strike.
