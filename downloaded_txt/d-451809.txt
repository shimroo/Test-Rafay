our events we offer not just races, but full weekend experiences that allow athletes to be part of a community of like-minded individuals and a way of celebrating together their accomplishments. we believe everyone in our events has a story of what inspired them to race and each had their own journey to reach this destination. it’s our job at the races to offer a way for them to share their story, create incredible long-term memories and inspire others along the way. we have a passion for being there to welcome them like they are family, provide a top-notch complete race experience and celebrate with them as they finish the race with more than just a medal. we feel we are in the business of changing lives as much-if not more-than simply producing a race.

we are back!
 
 




we're coming back!many of you have been asking for months, and we hope it won’t be long until we can all raise our hands and cheer as we bring wildflower back in under the direction of colleen bousman of see & be productions (formally co-owner and race director 20+ years for tri-california).  wildflower experience buzz was everywhere in 2018 and we can’t wait to show you what we can do when we are passionate about making sure wildflower can return for at least one more hurrah.  2020 - 2022 was a challenge for the entire world, but especially hit the event industry hard.  the pandemic challenges, on top of low water levels at lake san antonio, has kept us away longer than expected… but we want to come back and celebrate with each of you.  we are already at work to make sure this is a 36th anniversary wildflower that we can all shout about!  reach out to as many people as you can to spread the news!  important note: many were confused by an event copy falsely claiming to be bringing back wildflower under new ownership - we are in no way related to alpha win and all registration will be fully refunded if you were tricked into believe they had the capability to bring the wildflower experience and renown history to lake san antonio.
