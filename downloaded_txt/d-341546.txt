our story



it all started with an unhappy housewife… in post wwii europe, the american military prepared for the long occupation of the continent by building small american style cities on us bases. for the first time in us military history soldiers sent overseas for their assignments were allowed to take their families with them. attempts were made to make these bases small enclaves of american culture to feel like ‘back home usa’ for the warrior and his family. schools, stores, recreation areas and even chapels were set up to make things easier for the three and four year tours of duty they were expected to endure.
