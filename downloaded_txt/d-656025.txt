story behind logo  



 


 
svayam is a sanskrit word that means self and one's inner quest to realise the self. the logo embodies this spirit.



 
the red open-ended chakra is an energy field representing space and constant movement denoting limitless possibilities.



 
the symbolic head indicates a human being, the spread wings denote acceptance and celebration of diversity with open arms, and each human being, irrespective of physical ability, is a free soul ready to achieve their best potential.



 
the v in the name denotes victory and is underlined in red to emphasise that svayam utilises all its energy and resources to achieve its goal of dignity for people with reduced mobility.
