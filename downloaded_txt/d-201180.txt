welcome to the pentagon ski club!
 

















































the pentagon ski club is dedicated to skiing
the psc offers winter sports vacations to resorts around the world for skiers and snowboarders who want the fun, companionship and convenience of group travel.  our members have one thing in common: they like to ski! on any given trip you'll find psc members waiting for the lifts to open in the morning and on the last lift up at the end of the day before the lifts close down.  although our focus is primarily on skiing, we also offer non-skiing summer vacation trips to europe and other destinations.
our members also share another trait: they like to socialize, either on the slopes skiing together or over good food or drink.  the psc doesn't run weekend trips or trips to local resorts.  we concentrate on vacation ski trips to destination resorts.  our trips typically run 6-7 days.  as a group, we can bargain with travel agents to keep costs reasonable.  we normally stay in quality condo or hotel properties located near the slopes with nearby shops and restaurants.
why the name pentagon?the psc is based in the washington, dc area, but we have members from across the u.s.  the club was founded in 1966 in the office of the secretary of defense, located in the pentagon—hence the name pentagon ski club.  our club continues to have members that currently serve or have served in the military, plus many current or former federal civilian employees. however, the club has no official connection to the pentagon, the military, or the u.s. government.  many members work in private industry and have never been in the military or even inside the pentagon.
join us!the club is open to the general public.  anyone can join!  read the letter from the president on the about us page and see the join us page.   these will give you a good introduction to the club.

monthly meetingsthe club holds monthly meetings, usually on the 2nd or 3rd tuesday of the month, not far from the pentagon at fort myer, virginia, in patton hall (the building formerly known as the officers' club).  you do not have to be in the military to enter fort myer and attend the meetings.  upcoming meetings are listed on the meetings page.  see directions to meetings page for driving directions and a map, and review the item on entry to ft. myer.
membership has benefitsclub members also enjoy the benefits of membership in the blue ridge ski council and the national ski council federation.  our members may participate on ski trips that have been "sanctioned" by other brsc member clubs without having to join the other clubs.  this gives our members access to a wide range of trips to choose from.
