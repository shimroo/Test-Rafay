homearka acorn urn

the ecopod
sadly the ecopod is no longer in production. we are internationally known for making this revolutionary and beautifully designed coffin, that brought together artisan skills with style, elegance and a respect for the environment. made by hand from recycled newspapers, it was hand finished with paper made from 100% mulberry pulp.
the ecopod was available in a range of colours with screen printed motifs, plain white, or gold. sadly it is now out of production. price competition from other biodegradable coffins and a resistance to the introduction of change from the funeral industry, meant that we had to either close the workshop, or lose money. commercial reality had to take precidence. please follow the links around the website to find out more about how beautiful, inspiring and unique the ecopod was.

we are continually exploring new manufacturing possibilities, including a hand made operation in north america with the natural burial company.
