the certificate

what is the "disney collectible shareholder certificate"?


the walt disney company decided to offer a collectible non-negotiable certificate that best represents the experience of being a disney shareholder. many of our shareholders also enjoy giving the gift of disney shares and this collectible certificate can help commemorate such gifts.

what is the difference between a "collectible" and a "negotiable" certificate?


negotiable certificates are actual securities representing underlying share ownership. like many companies, disney no longer offers stock certificates. owning shares in "book-entry" or "direct registration" (also known as drs) has become the preferred form of stock ownership. this type of ownership eliminates the loss of certificates, and subsequent shareholder cost of replacement, as well as simplifying the transfer or sale of shares.
disney collectible certificates are not actual securities and may not be sold or traded as securities or on a stock exchange.




why did disney eliminate stock certificates?

escheatment and unclaimed property

what is unclaimed property?


unclaimed property is any financial asset being held for a person or an entity that either cannot be found, or with whom contact has not been established for a fixed period of time (generally 3 or 5 years). financial assets include uncashed dividend checks, shares of stock, and other investment assets.




how does property become âinactive?â


in accordance with unclaimed property laws, property may become âinactiveâ (and presumed to be abandoned by the owner) when the owner of the property (in this instance, shareholders in the walt disney company) has either not cashed dividend checks issued to them, not been in contact with disney or its transfer agent, computershare investor services, for the last 3 to 5 years and/or has changed addresses without providing notification, thus resulting in the return of mail being sent to the shareholder through the u.s. postal service.
												

												states require that business entities review their records each year to determine whether they are in possession of any unclaimed funds (including uncashed dividend checks), stock or other securities or other property which is inactive and presumed to be abandoned, and to report and deliver such property to the states for safekeeping. the state(s) holds the property, or its cash equivalent, until such time as they are claimed by the owner or legal claimant. 
												

												in general, property that is presumed abandoned is transferred to the state of last known address of the shareholder according to the companyâs shareholder records. after property has been transferred to the state as abandoned property, shareholders must directly contact the state in order to reclaim their property. links to individual state unclaimed property programs may be found by visiting: www.unclaimed.org. 
												




can the state take my shares if i hold a certificate?


yes, your stock and any uncashed checks in your account are reported to the state if the account is not kept active.  such reporting causes outstanding certificates in your possession to be cancelled and reissued in the name of the state. if this happens, the state may sell your shares. states may not notify you prior to selling your shares, and you may only be entitled to receive the sale proceeds from the state when you claim the property. 
												




how should i respond if i have received a due diligence letter?


in accordance with the statesâ unclaimed property laws, efforts to locate owners are generally required prior to the transfer of property into a stateâs custody, typically by mailing what is known as a âdue diligenceâ letter to the last known address on the companyâs shareholder records.  upon receipt of this letter, it is very important that you immediately communicate with our stock transfer agent (computershare investor services), in order to re-establish contact between you and disney, update the status of your account, and stop the transfer of your assets to the state. if you do not respond to the due diligence letter or otherwise demonstrate contact with your account, your stock and any uncashed dividend checks previously issued to you will be required to be turned over to the state, which may sell your shares without any further notice to you. 
												

												you can contact computershare by responding to a due diligence letter via first class mail or other priority mail service, contacting a client service representative by calling 1-855-553-4763, or logging onto www.disneyshareholder.com to authenticate your identity and demonstrate your control over your account and that it remains active. you can also request replacement of any uncashed dividend checks previously issued to you by calling 1-855-553-4763.
												




how can i keep my account active in the future?


it is recommended that you periodically make contact with computershare to keep your account status current. this is particularly important for accounts with shares deposited in the walt disney company investment plan, since the automatic reinvestment of dividend payments is not recognized by the states to be an owner-initiated transaction that will prevent the shares from being presumed abandoned. you can keep your account active and avoid presumed abandonment of your stock in a number of ways, including:
												

contact our call center to request a statement be mailed to the address of record;
log in to your online profile by visiting www.disneyshareholder.com and review past transactions, download tax information, or update your account information;
vote your proxy;
cash a dividend payment;
make an additional investment in disney shares.






adjusted cost basis

how can i determine the cost basis for my investment?


cost basis information will be included on your substitute form 1099-b following a sale of "covered" shares.
 you will need your annual plan statements to calculate your adjusted cost basis. if you do not have your historical statements, please contact our transfer agent, computershare investor services, for assistance. contact information is available in the contact us tab on this website.
