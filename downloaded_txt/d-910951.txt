at holy angels, we love, we live, we learn. however different, we are all able.














“i love being a part of a mission that believes in the possibilities of the people we serve. a mission that believes in saying “yes” to those in need, just as the sisters of mercy did over 69 years ago when they said yes to our first resident, maria. a day doesn’t go by that i’m not thankful for the opportunity to serve at holy angels, and as the ceo, i am even more grateful to serve our residents and staff who do exceptional things every day.”

— kerri massey, president/ceo

licensed, equipped and committed, holy angels, located in belmont, n.c., provides specialized, round-the-clock care for children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and delicate medical conditions. in an environment that fosters loving and compassionate care, opportunities for dignified living and innovative learning programs, we strive to empower those who are differently able.



like the individuals in our care who are dependent upon us for our services, holy angels is a nonprofit organization that depends on the support of others to provide the highest quality of medical, educational, vocational, spiritual, and emotional support and healing. as such, we welcome every corporate contribution, each individual financial donation and all the gifts of time, love and labor from our volunteers who afford us the opportunity to be of service to those who need us most.
