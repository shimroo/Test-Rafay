welcome to my anne carroll george fan 
      sitesadly, anne passed away on march 14, 2001, but her memory 
      lives on in the words she wrote and those she touched on her journey 
      here.anne wrote the fabulous southern sisters mysteries. the final 
      book in the southern sisters series, murder boogies with elvis has just
      been published.  it will be a bittersweet read 
      for me. it was sad to say goodbye to anne, but now we will have to say 
      goodbye to aunt sister and mouse as well.anne was also a 
      pulitzer-nominated poet, with several published volumes of poetry to her 
      credit. her latest volume of poetry, a 
      map that lies between us, has just been named book of the year, by the 
      alabama state poet's society!anne lived and wrote in 
      alabama, and her talents have given me and her other fans many hours of 
      tears and laughter.i put together this site so that other fans, 
      and new readers of her books could stop by and find out more anne and her 
      wonderful works.                                 enter
