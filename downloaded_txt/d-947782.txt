usagem is a non-profit, member-run organization of christian entertainers and musicians who are dedicated to sharing and proclaiming the good news of jesus christ throughout the world.
based in nashville, tn, the organization was formed in 2003 when a group of approximately 15 artists met to explore ways in which they could enhance their individual ministries by bonding together with other christian ministries.  from that small group of artists, today the organization has grown to more than 200 professional members.  these artists represent five genres of christian/gospel music, including southern gospel; black gospel; christian country gospel; contemporary christian; and bluegrass/acoustic/folk gospel.   each of these musical genres are represented by three board of director members who advise artists/members of their particular genre.   currently, the organization is experiencing a season of rapid growth.
