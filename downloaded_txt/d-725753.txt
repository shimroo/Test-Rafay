the kate spade new york niko glitter & suede booties are so hot that they are literally selling out all over the internet. marked down to $250 from $450, they are going fast. so far, i have only been able to find a few online stores that still have a few pairs left. if you want them, get them now or lose out.

jimmy choo vendetta high heel sandals are hot

thursday, october 03, 2013


now its no surprise that jimmy choo has some killer heels in his fall/winter 2013 collection, but i still find that my eyes are glued to some of them. for instance, this embellished cage style sandal called the "vendetta". the straps are covered in crystals, it has a height of 4.7 inches and the smoke colored fabric is made of suede.











i originally saw these high heel sandals in two colors a few months ago, but the only one up for sale right now are the smokey heels. to be fair, they do look better than the lilac pair.

check out nicole kidman wearing the jimmy choo vendetta sandals and many other pieces from his 2013 fall/winter collection below.

gorgeous spiked bow stilettos

wednesday, october 02, 2013





can you say drool worthy? regardless of the fast moving fashion trends, i have always loved stiletto heels. the heels pictures are even better, due to the fact that they come in two colors and both colors blend well together. it makes it hard to leave the store with only one pair.

what do you think about this pair?

devilish heels is still here and i still love my high heel shoes

monday, september 30, 2013





hi everyone. i'm still here and still love my high heels blog, but i have been sick for a while now and was not able to work on it. i'm in a better place and hope to bring you new posts weekly and i aim to eventually post daily. after all, there are so many heels and so little time to love them all.

bye for now





















gladiator heels


gladiator high heel collection

friday, april 17, 2009


some hate them, others love them and i simply adore the gladiator heels. to be fair, i can't stand flat gladiator shoes, but add some heels to them and i'm in love. what i really like is that many designers are creating even more of these types of heels. proving that they are not an overnight fad, and will continue to stick around for a while.
