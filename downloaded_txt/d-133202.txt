in 2017, the ocean wise conservation association (ocean wise) was created as a new global non-profit ocean conservation organization focused on protecting and restoring our worldâ€™s oceans. in the spring of 2021, after an incredibly difficult year due to covid-19, ocean wise transferred ownership of the aquarium to a new operator, herschend enterprises. ocean wise will continue as an independent charitable non-profit. its important work will continue to be supported by the vancouver aquarium through a commitment by herschend to make an annual donation of 1% of gross profits towards ocean wiseâ€™s conservation and education programs.
