mark siu: 
turning failure into fuel for success


                                    in a world where success is often glorified, it is important to remember that failure is an inevitable part of the journey. 

mr mark siu, an alumnus of the department of computer science, has emerged as a successful entrepreneur through persevering in the face of both failures and successes. starting as a junior employee at a corporate, mark made a bold decision to leave a stable job and founded his own security solutions start-up, which has become a leading pioneer in its field. he credits much of his success to valuable life lessons learned from setbacks and challenges along the way.
