luis, francisco, and noe did a beautiful job on our fence. not only was our final product installed to our liking, but also the communication from the team was spot-on. the team level-set our expectations about what was going to happen, when, where the equipment would be, how long it would be there, and there was absolutely no mystery about any part of the process. the team also relayed a clear set of instructions about how to care for our fence moving forward. we almost did not go with this company because they were the lowest bidder, but i am so glad we did!gina r. n.

absolutely in love with how our yard looks! we went back and forth about hiring someone vs doing a split raid fence on our own and i am so glad we went with tyson. the materials took longer then expected to come in because of the pandemic but i was kept updated through email. as soon as they shipment arrived they were here to install it within that week! the three guys that came out to do the job were great. they kept us updated and made sure we knew about any problems (stones, wires, drainage pipes) that they anticipated before they dug. it took them a day longer than expected because our ground is full of rocks but we’re here to finish it as soon as they could. 10/10 - recommend! thank you!!alexandria e.
