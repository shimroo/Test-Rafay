book collection: cats are people, too
 “it’s a bit painful reading dave’s cat cartoons, because i keep thinking, ‘darn, i wish i’d thought of that. darn, i wish i’d thought of that. darn . . .’” —jim davis, creator of garfieldcats are people, too is a hilarious and affectionate collection of dave coverly’s brilliant cat-themed cartoons from his reuben award–winning, nationally syndicated panel speed bump.this full-color compendium of hilarious cat cartoons has all the charm of its companion, dogs are people, too. divided into fun chapters such as “cats and their humans,” “domesticated,” “reigning cats and dogs,” and filled with cat clichés, pop “capture,” as well as reflections from six other award-winning, cat-loving cartoonists, this new collection is a surefire purchase perfect for animal-lovers of all ages.please purchase at your local independent bookstore or herechristy ottaviano books












book collection: dogs are people, too
over the years spent creating his nationally syndicated panel speed bump, reuben award–winning cartoonist dave coverly has seen trends in which themes are the most popular. the perennial favorite, though, is dogs.with categories like working dogs, techie dogs, badly behaving dogs, and profiles of dogs both famous and not-so-famous, this hilarious cartoon collection is perfect for animal lovers.sadly, this book is now out of print but you may be able to find used copies online.












the french collection
finally, what all smart, decent, french-speaking people have been waiting for: a speed bump book in their native and/or learned tongue! these are better because they were translated by marine, who’s funnier and more intelligent than me, so grab a copy here. merci!












chapter books
a speed bump & slingshot misadventure series is a chapter book trilogy about a couple of bird buddies who get themselves into, um, "situations."this school library journal review sums it up nicely: "this first chapter book series from coverly, an internationally syndicated cartoonist whose “speed bump” cartoons appear in more than 400 newspapers, and the winner of the prestigious reuben award for best cartoonist, focuses on the travails of a bird named speed bump. speed bump’s brother is the illustrious early bird, the one who always gets the worm. this isn’t speed bump’s only problem. he has a hard time waking up, his wings are tiny, his tail feathers are short, and his head is larger than his body. fortunately, he has a great friend, slingshot, who knows how to brighten speed bump’s days. together they have a life-changing adventure deep in the nighttime forest. filled with subtle irony, wordplay, and gentle pokes at life, the text is accompanied by appealingly large, cartoon-style, black-and-white line drawings. verdict this story will have students laughing out loud and reluctant readers asking for the sequel."all three books are 120-130+ pages and written for kids ages 7-11.notlw may be purchased here.notls may be purchased here.notlzb is available 10/17 and may be pre-ordered here.

picture books
picture books i've illustrated, all brilliantly edited by christy ottaviano, all published by macmillan. if you'd like to purchase these, please try your local bookstore first. if you don't have a local bookstore, well, that's a sad thing, so here are some links where these may be purchased online:how to care for your t-rexthe very inappropriate wordsue macdonald had a book
























speed bump books
there are four collections of speed bump cartoons: a collection of cartoon skidmarks (2000, andrews mcmeel), cartoons for idea people (2004, ecw), just one %$#@ speed bump after another (2005, ecw), and laughter is the best medicine (2014, sellers).the first three are out of print, but you can still find them at the usual places online or on the not-so-black market. 






























barkbox
do you love dogs? yeah, me too. and i'm lucky enough to be the primary illustrator for bark & co, the cool people who bring you barkbox. take a peek at their manhattan office (and my murals) here.their very kind article about me is here.




























































bell's beer
besides family and friends, my three favorite things in the world might be cartoons, coffee, and beer - and not necessarily in that order, depending on the time of day.creating the java stout label for bell's beer in kalamazoo was the perfect storm of those three things. hell hath no fury was also a blast, and there are more beers in that series coming soon...




































parade
cartoons that appeared in parade magazine are also available as prints.for more samples, click here.


































































the new yorker
i've only had a few cartoons in the new yorker, but this one was turned into a mini animation, which i really like. not sure the gag works as well as the static panel, but you can decide for yourself here.
