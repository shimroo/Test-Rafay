a note from the publisher's desk - 


whether you are searching for that documentary proof to complete your jamestown family record, pursuing the trail of a lost freed slave ancestor after the civil war, or trying to understand the role of your family in historical events, you are a genealogist. and for the past forty-two years, iberian publishing has dedicated itself to providing the source records for these searches. although technology has introduced dna and online sources to the field, books are still the mainstays for the researcher. technology has introduced us to electronic books in the past two decades, and they form an important part of the genealogist's tool kit.

iberian began as a family publishing company with four titles in 1981; today that number has grown to more than 1,100 and we remain dedicated to providing the best possible product to our customers.
