what makes our dolphin tour different from the competition? 











our boats have the higher horsepower engines which produce a wake (waves behind the boat). dolphins just love to jump in our wake. (if dolphins are mating or feeding we will not attempt to get them to jump) 







we allow you to bring your own food and drinks on board. for those of you who don‚Äôt want to bring your own, we have drinks and snacks for sale at our dock house.¬† 







we never take a boat to capacity unless a private group has consented for us to do so. when you book a tour, we want you to be comfortable and not packed in like sardines!¬† 







we do not force you to stand for the duration of the tour. everyone gets a seat, and you are welcome to walk around once the all clear has been given. there is plenty of shade on each boat as well as uncovered areas for those who like the sun.

a few of our boats are handicap accessible, but please call before booking to let us know you have a disability which requires the handicap accessible boat. we will be happy to check availability and will add a note to your booking that you will need assistance.if you or a member of your party is handicapped, we do have parking close to our dock. our handicap parking entrance is directly across the highway from the welcome to tybee island sign. the driveway is marked as private property, but it is ok to park there if you are handicapped and if you are booked on our tour. 







we are pet friendly as long as the pet is people friendly. if your dog is a ‚Äúbarker‚Äù please be considerate of your fellow passengers and do not bring the dog on board. also, we ask thatyour pet be up to date on all his or her vaccinations. and our pet friendly policy is for dogs only, and it certainly does not include pet reptiles. yes, we had an albino python once, so we feel forced to amend our pet policy. üôÇ 







one of our captains is fond of saying ‚Äúthis is the real world not sea world!‚Äù we would love to say that we find dolphin on every tour, but dolphin are wild animals, and every now and then we get‚Ä¶ well, we get ‚Äúskunked‚Äù. if you don‚Äôt find dolphin on a tour, you are welcome to go again for free. and, we go one step better! if you are on a tour and the captain feels that the dolphin sightings aren‚Äôt up to par with our usual dolphin experience, we will also honor our dolphin guarantee. weunderstand that people may be going back home after their tybee island vacation, but rest assured, our dolphin guarantee has no expiration date! we flagthe trips that do not find dolphin so that there is no hassle when you take us up on your guarantee.
