light bot walkthrough



light bot is a fun puzzle game.  simply 'program' your robot to move to each of the blue squares and light it up.  you need to learn to be efficient, but each you get two functions along with the main program to play with.  so, it's just a matter of learning how to put those repeatable steps into the functions and use those when you can.

if you get stuck, there's a walkthrough below.  if you want to try it on your own, play light bot at armorgames.

walkthrough:  do not read below this line if you want to do it on your own!

in each level, your program consists of three sections.  the main, function 1 and function 2.  the programs you can put in are left, right, forward, light, jump, function1 and function2.  i don't claim this is the most efficient to any of the levels, but it will get you by.

level 1:
main program: forward, forward, light
function 1:
function 2:

level 2:
main program: right, forward, left, forward, forward, forward, forward, left, forward, light
function 1:
function 2:

level 3:
main program: forward, jump, jump, forward, light, left, forward, light, forward, light.
function 1:
function 2:

level 4:
main program: forward, jump, jump, forward, right, forward, forward, forward, forward, forward, light.
function 1:
function 2:

level 5:
main program: jump, f1, f1, jump, jump, jump, light
function 1: forward, forward, forward, light
function 2:

level 6:
main program: f1, right, f1, light, jump, right, f2, right, right, f2, f2
function 1: forward, jump jump
function 2: forward, forward, forward, light

level 7:
main program: f2, light, right, forward, right, light, f2
function 1:forward, light, forward, light, forward, light, forward, light
function 2: f1, f1

level 8:
main program: jump, forward, light, f2, right, f1, f1, f2, right, f2
function 1: f2, f2, right
function 2: forward, forward, light

level 9:
main program: jump, left, jump, f2
function 1: jump, light, forward, light, jump, light, right
function 2: f1, f1, f1, f1

level 10 (i found this to be the hardest one):
main program: f1, f2, left, jump, right, f1, f1, f1, f1, left, f2, f1
function 1: jump, jump, jump, forward, forward, forward, light, right
function 2: left, jump, left, jump, forward, right, jump

level 11:
main program: f1, jump, right, f1, jump, right, f1
function 1: f2, f2, left, jump, left, f2, f2, right
function 2: light, forward, light, forward, light, forward, light, forward

level 12:
main program: forward, jump, light, f1, f1, f1, f2, light 
function 1: jump, light, jump, light, jump, light, right 
function 2: jump, light, jump, light, jump, f1, f1, f1

applicate ver.0



a new game from the creator of the grow series is out and it's called applicate.  very short simple game of dropping apples.  there's no directions, but it's not that hard to figure out.the objective of each of the five levels is to get an apple eye guy (see the image... the apples with eyes in them are apple eye guys) to the door.  every time you click on an apple that is already on the screen, you take a bite out of it, dropping a new apple where the arrow is currently located.  if you drop an apple on an uneaten apple, an apple eye guy will appear.keep in mind, he will always try walking to the right first.  you may need to block his way to get him to turn around and go back to the doorway.it sounds weird, but the graphics are as good as always.  if you need any hints, ask below in the comments and i'll try to walk you through each level.with only five levels, this is a short game to play if you're interested.play applicate ver.0 at eyezmaze.

brute wars



brute wars is a pretty good rpg game just released on kongregate.  pick your team of brutes (animals) making sure to balance your magical prowess as well as your brute force.  then get out there and conquer the castles in an attempt to reach mount asio.really, the story line isn't all that exciting, nor is it all that pertinent to the game play.just put together the best team you can.  you'll  have to take into account several different factors to advance.first, there's a front and a back line.  keep your power hitters up front, and your distance hitters in back.  but if someone's taking a beating, it's helpful to have another power hitter to switch in for him.you only get so many actions a turn, so replacing someone in the front line may use up all your actions for a turn.  later on in the game, you'll have more actions per turn to play with, making it easier to switch men in and out.the gameplay is not intuitive, so read through the directions.magical spells are stronger if you have more of the same type of character (water, fire, brute, etc...)  but it also makes it more likely you could go up against someone who's in a great position to hit you in your weak point.  i liked to balance things out more.you can replace some of your characters by getting to a shop and buying a randomizer.  that's the only way to get shadow creatures.  this option will not be available right away.you can travel back over spots you've already fought for to engage in random battles and build up points to buy food, syringes (to wake up those dozing creatures -- they've been knocked out) and randomizers.  you also need the points to buy the upgrades (treasure chests on the map).play brute wars at kongregate.

meet in ver.0 walkthrough



the famous author of the grow series is back with a new game after a prolonged sickness (i'm glad to see he's feeling better!).  the new game, meet in, is like his other puzzle games, but also unlike them.  it's cute, short and fun, but definitely has the same feeling to it as his other games.for a complete walkthrough, look below, but in the meantime, go play!play meet in ver.0 at eyezmaze.walkthroughin the first box, i'm going to label this one dad.  the second box (top right) is going to be mom.  the bottom left is baby and the bottom right is kid.move the baby onto the blue button.  mom is now free to move down into the hedge maze.  move her onto the button at the bottom of the maze.switch to dad and move him onto the moving platform that mom just engaged (just head south in the hedge maze).  move the baby onto the other button on it's screen to move dad to the other side.move dad to the right and sit on the bottom of the two buttons to change the stone maze the kid is in.  keep switching the stone maze back and forth and moving the kid around until he is free and in the upper left corner.  move the kid up until he steps on the orange button to remove the orange square for dad to pass through.dad can step on the green button to remove the green obstruction from the kids way.  have the kid step on the purple button to remove the purple block from the baby's way.dad, kid and baby can now enter the room with meet on the floor.  place each of them on their respective color to allow mom to enter as well.  switch to mom and bring her in and put her on the final t.  you win!

warlords: call to arms



warlords is a strategy war game that just isn't all that strategic.  build your army one guy at a time and send him across the board.  the bigger your guy is, the longer it takes for him to be sent.  the number of men (or demons or elves or ...) you can build is very impressive.unfortunately, as i already said, this game isn't that hard to beat.  here's how to do it in 4 steps1) always choose the hardest level to beat.  while it may make sense to beat the easier levels first, it actually makes it harder in the long run as the difficulty increases with each level.  buying upgrades is nice, but not key to winning.2) set your options to auto release.  either that or get used to holding the space bar down.3) send 95% of your guys along one row (as you can see from the picture).4) select charge when you can.and that's it.  you'll beat every level by overwhelming that one row of attackers.  the only exception is when you face off against the troll giants, as they can stomp right along that one row.  in that level, just send your speediest guys along every row (in other words, spread out your attack).by beating the harder levels first, you'll have an easier time completing the game at the end.i had fun playing this game, it's too bad i figured out such an easy way to beat it.  playing as the demons isn't all that different from playing with any other race, so i'm not sure how much of areward they are.play warlords: call to arms at kongregate.

boxhead: the zombie wars



boxhead, that zombie shooting series has it's fifth game out and this one just keeps getting tougher and better.  in zombie wars, you have more weapons, more zombies, more of everything waiting for you in this shooter.this game is tough.  the number of zombies quickly gets out of hand.  you need to learn how to react quickly, strategize (barrels, barricades, etc...) and more within the first few levels or else you will be dead and buried before you know it.there are plenty of battlefields to choose from, but it all comes down to your reaction time.play boxhead: the zombie wars at kongregate.update: now that i've played this game for a few weeks, i have a few pointers and tips.  first, the basics.there are two scenarios as you start out.  on the left side is the basic, and on the right side is defense.  they are the same game, it's just the 'defense' is how things should look for you after a five or six rounds (if only a little bit neater).  you have a defense set up, with turrets and barricades.  you also have access to some more weaponry (as if you had worked your way through the earlier rounds). the difficulty ratings also place you further along.  it's as if you start off at round 10, instead of round 1.  you have access to more weapons, but the demons are already out to get you.  so if you're a newbie, place at beginner until you can get past the first few rounds.  then up the difficulty.  it's as if you're restarting at a later level.scenarios.  the scenarios don't really matter all that much to me.  different landscape doesn't really affect gameplay all that much.  the smaller the field, the faster you have to deal with the hordes that come upon you.  also, you don't want to get trapped behind your defensive bulwarks, so the direction they come at you isn't all that important either.basic walkthrough strategy: set up a defensive perimeter using turrets and barricades.  place more turrets and barricades as you can.  replace those that fall.  other than that, stay outside of your own perimeter and blast away.  if you stop for even a moment, the devils will flame you to death.  it only takes two quick shots from them to finish you off.  plus, you need to get out there and pick up the boxes to restock and replace your health.  with a good defensive perimeter, you can last for a very long time.  once i have a good setup going, the only reason i lose is because i end up setting turrets around myself, trapping myself.barrel laying is great.  if you start laying out barrels in a trail behind you and set them off (or they get set off by the turrets or by the devils), you can lay waste to hordes at a time.  it's also great as a more offensive weapon.  once the barrels are placed behind you, they can set off the next one in line (sort of like dominoes).  if you keep running ahead and placing more barrels, you can basically charge into a crowd and clear them out with explosions.the minigun is great at clearing out a line, but i find it hard to select it.  instead, i usually use the barrels then the shotgun (once it's been sufficiently upgraded).  the air strike is fun (it will clear the whole screen).  the handgun is actually quite useful for a while, but won't help once it becomes too crowded.

even more bloons



in case you didn't get enough out of bloons and more bloons followed up by bloons world and then by bloons tower defense and bloons tower defense 2, now ninja kiwi has released even more bloons for your entertainment.aim with your mouse, and hold down the left button to set the power.  one nice addition is the last shot (power and angle) will be shown so that you can adjust accordingly.  one annoying things is how the clouds float by, making it harder to judge where you left your last shot when you have to try again.  the later levels can be very, very tough to complete.i'm not going to post a walkthrough for this one in the comments, but you can certainly ask me if you get stuck anywhere.  i'll be happy to help you out, as long as i've figured out how to do it.i find bloons to be very frustrating, but i keep going back for more.  how about you?with more bloon types and more levels to work your way through, if you enjoyed bloons, you will enjoy even more bloons at ninjakiwi.

vector td 2



if you played vector td or tdx, then you've played vector td 2.  in other words, it's not really worthy of it's own review, other than to mention a couple of changes.there are more types of games, with a normal, time attack, lightning and a puzzle/sandbox mode.  normal mode sends out the creeps as per normal. destroy each wave, then set up for the next wave.  time attack keeps sending creeps out.  your objective is to keep going as long as you can.  lightning speeds up the vectors (creeps) and the puzzle/sandbox mode gives you 50,000 to start with and two bonuses, but that's it.  in other words, you can try out various strategies for each of the new maps.there are new maps to conquer, and if you liked vector td you'll like vector td 2 because it's the same game.  i guess since they called it td 2 i was expecting more, but ...play vector td 2 at candystand.
