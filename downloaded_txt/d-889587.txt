guess who's back!!!

hello! it's me artlad. i'm twelve!, i know i haven't been on in forever but i have got some new artwork and lots of other things. i haven't posted anything because i just moved, twice! and before i moved i was getting into third and fourth grade, so wow! a lot has happened in a couple of years, so i'll try and describe it in a few paragraphs.first, i started making things called stop motions, it's were you take a bunch of pictures and then edit them together. it really cool watching. this brings me into my second thing. i have an alternate blog i created for movies and stuff. i have a few posts up so here is a link, belowyou can go and see it here at here. check it out.second, i haven;t been drawing as much as usual, this is because i got into writing. i still draw things but not as frequently. i do have some things to post.third, i started middle school this year so i have been getting bucketfuls of homework so i've been much busier than usual. but the good thing is i've finally got the hang of managing it so i only have about an hour of homework a night.fourth, i still draw so this means i'll still be posting things, but they may be different than usual. like today, i drew a halo reach picture, it's a game i got about a month ago, it's pretty cool.fifth, brownie, e-claire, and blaze have changed a lot. here they all are. see if you can figure out who is who.so that's all i really have to say. remember to check out the other blog, it's called art lad theater.gotta run, my cousins are here! bye.artlad

stop motion videos!

hello everybody.i just wrote a long homework story over at dad's blog.i still draw and take pictures but the thing i like to do best now is stop-motion animation. i have like 100 clone troopers and justice league guys and i do stories with them on dad’s old camera. it is hard work because you have to take really short shots, then move the guys a little, then shoot again. and then when you’re all done with that you have to edit them on the computer so it looks like they’re moving. i’m trying to learn how to add in special effects like in real movies and just figured out how to do lazer blasts and music. i put them up on youtube so you can see. i helped my sister do one too. i wish i was as good as the other videos because they look really good. i just need to practice.bye!your friend,thomas

guess who?

who is that?could it be???yes! it's me, art lad! i'm back!i'm sorry i haven't done anything a while, but i've got a lot of new artwork to put up, so prepare for the return of art lad!!but first, a catch-up.well it's been a long time and since my last entry, my mom had a baby girl named the éclair (well, her real name is elizabeth but we have to give her a cool secret identity for online). know why she is called that? because she is really sweet, but really gooey and messy. she has really grown since then. her first word at two weeks was "hooray." her first trip was at 11 days of age because my papa and grandma got in a terrible car accident and died at the same time. i am still very sad about it, even though it seems like a long time ago. everyone else in my family is all safe and good and i will be featuring things about them, like pictures and stories i've made up about them. i've changed a lot too. i'm now 57 inches tall, and i'm ten years old (i added a lot of stuff to my profile update) and in the 4th grade so i am old enough to write my own blogs, but dad willstill check my spelling and punctuation.things got moved around in the house. if i didn't tell you already, i got a loft bed a little before eclair was born and my other sister, the brownie, she got the old guest room and she got a new bed. it's the softest bed in the house. the new guest room is down in the basement, near my new headquarters. it is called......the art cave!my art cave is the coolest. it's really just the basement, but still cool.i can hang my art up for display or to let dry if it's paint.know what this is that i'm working on?it's a deinonychus baby. to give it scale i will draw in a big nose of a mother sniffing it. dino mommies could chomp babies up if she wanted, and sometimes dinosaurs had to fall back to cannibalism when times were tough and food was scarce. know how they know that? because they found fossilized baby skeletons inside the rib cages of fossilized adults, so that means they got in there by being swallowed. mom says when i was little, i was so cute she could have just eaten me up. and when i got older and started giving her trouble, she sometimes wished she had. i don't think that is what happened with the dinosaur babies, but it was a really long time ago and you never know. now here is a video of me in the art cave, talking about my picture. i just uploaded it to youtube and it took a while but by the time you see this, it should be ready to watch.   it is kind of bad and needs editing, but i just wanted to do a quick video to show you what things will be like around here from now on. it will be art but it will be more. it will be a multimedia gallery! that's like when they have tvs stuck in the walls along with things you can touch along with zappy light shows all alongside regular paintings. i have an opinion that it will be pretty cool.there will be more soon. i want to put up something new before we go away for thanksgiving, but i'm not sure i can. but i still wanted to say hi to everyone who kept coming here and emailing dad and asking "when is art lad coming back?"well, now you know when.see you soon!signed,art lad (thomas)

bad luck for abby

abby is dead.i got up to feed her and she was floating at the bottom with her head straight down and not moving. she looked really dark too and she is normally bright orange so that means she was dead.i ran and told dad right away. it was 5:02 in the morning. dad was really upset. he laid there with his eyes closed and moved his mouth but no words came out. he said he was praying.i got abby for my birthday so she didn't live very long. i think maybe she was sick. her tank was dirty an awful lot. dad was always cleaning it. he just cleaned it three days ago. that's what he kept saying this morning. i should have helped clean it more. i feel bad. now she will never meet my new sister.i got abby out by myself. mom made a noise when i didn't use the net to get her but i wanted to hold her in my arms. but she was too small so i just held her in my hand.i wrapped her in a burial paper towel and carried her to the bathroom.dad called it a burial at sea. he needs to take the trash out too. i just noticed that.i said a prayer even though my religion teacher says pets don't have souls. she is not very nice for a religion teacher. abby had a soul. she was always happy to see me. now she can swim in blue fish heaven and her tank will never have to be cleaned.goodbye abby.hey. i just thought: today is friday the 13th. it really is bad luck day.bye.

baby egg

hi! this is art lad and i am writing my own blog now for today. i can type really good now and told dad i can do it myself but he will still help me with spelling and stuff.there has been a lot of news going on here. we are having a new baby sister! we found out one dinner when we were having movie night on friday a lot of weeks ago. that was when mom only had a little bubble belly. now it is huge!look! you almost can't see my sister.this is the second time i can remember having a baby. the first time was when my little sister came along. i was 2 and a half but i remember some of it. i remember getting a new room where i could have all my trains out and dad helped me paint it. my sister got my old room but i didn't mind because it smelled like the attic and the floor was small and cold. i remember going to the hospital and mom was all tired looking, but she was happy too. my sister was all tiny and angry then but she got better.this new one is going to be another girl also. i'm happy because a little brother would break all my stuff. a little sister probably won't even care about my super guys and my fish abby and my colored pencils.the baby is supposed to come in may but i bet she will come early because mom has early babies. i was two weeks early and my sister was three weeks early. if my new sister is 3 weeks early that means she will come next week!we had easter on sunday and that was a lot of fun. we colored eggs. i love coloring eggs. you can make new colors that no one ever saw before. i like to dip my whole hand in the colors but my sister uses a dipper. my way is messy but i like it.look at my egg!later we went to my friend's house. they have a big back yard and we had an easter egg hunt there. i found 27 eggs with different things in them like candy and money and a compass ring to find my way home if i get lost. me and my friends ran around like nutsos, but mom couldn't run because the baby has got so big. she let me have the camera to take pictures. so i took one of mom. it made me think of my egg.doesn't she look like a big easter egg?i can't wait for the baby!!!bye!thomas

what is white?

i am back!i had a busy time in 2006. i like 2007 so far but it has been cold. we got a lot of snow and me and my friends made some snowmen. here is a picture of one. i am on the end. my sister is in the pink jacket but you can't see her face because she is so hairy!in school we read a book where one of the characters asked his grandfather, "what is blue?" and got a neat answer. so our teacher asked us to write a poem about a color like that. since it is snowy now, i picked white. it doesn't rhyme but it can still be a poem because it makes you have feelings. here it is. dad fixed the spelling.what is white?by art ladwhite is like the moon glistening in the summer night breeze.white feels like a baseball getting caught in the warm spring air.white tastes like gentle spring air blowing in my face.white looks like snowflakes falling on a wintry night.white acts like a polar bear looking for sea lions up in the freezing arctic.white moves like ice sheets on antarctica's freezing water's surface.white lives like penguins swimming in freezing water or walking one hundred miles like emperor penguins do. (sound fun?)white is clouds that blow overhead all over the world.now that's what white is.that's a long poem, isn't it? my teacher saved it to give to mom and dad on open house night. i guess they really liked it.now we're learning about fairy tales. maybe i'll write one of those next.bye!
