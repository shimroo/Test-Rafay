book of the month


get the book!

twelve trees "the deep roots of our future"by: daniel lewis, 2024
this book is interesting, thought-provoking, and fun to read. each chapter focuses on one tree, each chosen because it is special: the largest, oldest, rarest, most valuable, etc. besides describing the tree and its environment, related issues are well explored. we agree that it offers a "globe-spanning perspective on the crucial impact trees have on our entire planet."
