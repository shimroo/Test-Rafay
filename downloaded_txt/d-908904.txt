i have been making wheel thrown pottery for over 40 years.  most of my work is functional stoneware items thrown on a potter's wheel.  i first saw a skilled potter at work on a wheel when i was about 13 years old and i fell in love with it.  i also make much of my work with slabs.  my slab work includes trays, plates and lamps.  slab work is much different than wheel work, with its own challenges.  i also formulate and make all my own glazes.  i have spent many years and many, many tests to get the desired effect of surface, color, and durability.  currently, my wife, linda, and i work out of our studio in portland, oregon.  check the contact page for information on where to find me.
