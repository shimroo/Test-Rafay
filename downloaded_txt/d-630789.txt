gaukler medieval wares makes jewellery and
metalwork in ancient and medieval styles, using the methods and
materials of
the past. i do custom work, as long as the design is medieval or
earlier. we also sell authentic ancient and medieval antiquities. all antiquities pictures have a white background, and all of my work has a black background.
