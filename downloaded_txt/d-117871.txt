welcome to montenegro!






when was the last time you did something for the first time? have you ever drunk water directly from the river? or had an adrenaline rush from zip-lining over the deepest canyon in europe?
have you ever kite-surfed at the upstream running river? visited the resting place of a miracle-making saint? montenegro is offering something different and unique. visit montenegro, a country of tall people, dramatic nature contrasts and colorful rains. montenegro is like a box of chocolates – every candy of a unique, rich and delicate taste that is long remembered.

montenegro stands on the edge between the east and the west. different civilizations crashing and colliding have left the most beautiful marks between the wrinkled mountainous face of this fascinating country. roman floor mosaics, illyrian gray castles, venetian stony walls, vibrantly painted orthodox monasteries, ornamental catholic churches, modest and minimalistic mosque minarets and plane socialist style buildings will tell you about montenegrin rich cultural history. myriad powers fought over these lands and that is why the locals are tall and strong, their eyes are of different shades of all colors, and their welcoming hug is warm and brotherly. those looking for a multicultural european history are more than welcome to montenegro.
