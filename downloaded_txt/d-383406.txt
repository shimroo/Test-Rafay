review: john lyell - eternity ii





john lyelleternity ii (2024)
one of the newer (relatively speaking) classic spacemusic
artists on the scene, john lyell, hasn't been heard from since 2017 when he
released planetary artifacts about which i wrote "simply put, if
you are a spacemusic fan, this is an essential album to own." lyell has
returned to his roots just earlier this year (2024) with eternity ii (i
would postulate a sequel to his 2012 eternity) and he hasn't missed a
beat (i know…a strange choice of words for a spacemusic album).
before i give more details, an explanation of sorts. while
stephen hill defines spacemusic less as something astronomical in nature (i.e.,
having a direct link to space exploration, the cosmos, etc.), i refer to some
spacemusic as being "classic" in nature. specifically, comprised of
not just titular (or even cover art-wise) reference to outer space (e.g. the existence of life beyond our planet, space travel, etc.) but also
certain sonic qualities of the music itself. first and foremost, a drifting quality,
based typically on synth washes, ambient textures, and tones containing an
element of, well, spaciness. jonn serrie, geodesium (mark pedersen) and meg
bowles come to mind as some of the stalwarts of classic spacemusic (not there aren't
others, as well). lyell's music fits into this category nicely. he blends
assorted synths with the occasional rhythmic pulse or melodic tone to craft
music which (given a listener's ability to visualize) could certainly inspire
traveling through space watching the stars go by on a viewscreen. and, as
stated above, eternity ii certainly evokes those images aplenty. 
i've always admired that lyell intermixes a little mystery
or shading of semi-darkness now and then, such as on the title track, which
also introduces some whirling sounds to further accentuate the sf element on
the track, as well as percolating (at a midtempo pace) pulses and reverbed
tones. this is in contrast to the first track, "when the world was
new" which opens with a myriad of tasteful nature sounds against a warm,
inviting layer of synths and low-key but dramatic keyboard chords. "a
moment in time" is another warm but even more spacey number albeit in a
more minimalist vein with the main component being muted melodic tones over the
sound of flowing water. two tracks ("gateway to the stars" and the
album closer, "final approach") introduce a new element for lyell,
that being a semi-glitchy background effect, which if i'm being honest, i'm not
sure i like, but in each case it's not something that derails the overall
effect of either the individual track or the album as a whole. in the case of
"final approach," it does lend a certain element of dramatic effect
which may suit the track's title (there's also a nice retro-em whirly sound
effect that i got a kick out of).
i am not as attuned to either spacemusic or, for that
matter, the ambient genre, as a whole, like i used to be, so for all i know,
there are still many artists crafting high quality drifting soundscapes like
john lyell does here (and has done throughout his previous recordings). what i
do know is that lyell once more has honored the tradition of the subgenre with
eternity ii, which makes this a worthy addition to his discography and should
delight the followers of his earlier works.

overdue review: thierry david - slow motion






thierry david
slow motion
k-vox (2020)
 
long-time readers of my reviews know that i have some…well,
unusual takes about certain types of music and the subsequent evocations they lead
me to. one of these is a subset of ambient (and later chill) music that, for
me, paints a specific visual backdrop that almost creates a story for my
imagination to transition into while listening. one of these is that of a
quasi-blade runner-esque urban cityscape but anchored in the present…or even in
the film noir past. the backdrop? rain-slicked city streets reflecting neon bar
signs and cheap hotels. it's late…maybe 2 am. not many folks walk these
pavements and the city itself seems to be exhausted with its daily struggle to
find optimism in a world overtaken by loneliness, desperation, and hopelessness.
yeah, i can be a depressing kinda guy!
 
the first recording that brought these images to mind was
ben swire's brilliant ep on the foundry label, equilibrium. later,
marconi union released two albums that had the same impact on me, a lost
connection and distance. fast forward more than a few years and the
highly talented keyboardist thierry david (who broke onto the musical scene
while on the real music label) contacted me and sent me slow motion.
sadly, in the midst of a myriad of personal problems and covid, i put my
reviewing on hold (mostly) and never got around to spreading the word about his
amazingly chilled out and highly atmospheric recording which absolutely belongs
alongside the others mentioned above.
 
thierry david proved himself adept (to say the least) during
his stint recording for real music by releasing albums in an assortment of
styles, e.g. spacemusic (stellar connection) and chill-out (zen pause).
even aware of david's abundant talent, when i first played slow motion, i
was unprepared for what greeted my ears that first playing. mesmerized,
enthralled, transported are all words that came to mind as these seven
excursions into a moody, atmospheric, and shadowy world issued forth from my
speakers, all encased in a framework of subdued and superbly performed
chill-out music. a mixture of reverbed piano, layers of ambient textures, muted
rhythms, and other elements comprised an ultra-evocative soundscape. and that's
what this review's first paragraph alludes to, i.e., i couldn't wait to go out
one night and drive the darkened streets of minneapolis listening to this
superb soundtrack for a solitary urban excursion. 
 
slow motion isn't sad or melancholic or even dark in
any traditional sense. it's moody, provocative, subtle, and even comforting in
a strange way. it envelops you in its own unique musical vision of beautiful,
compelling, unsparing sensations of the aforementioned urban loneliness, all
propelled by piano, synths, textures, and rhythms. again, remember these are my
evocations. for all i know, some might consider this music cheerful or upbeat.
but for me, it's the opposite which does not take way from how much i love the
album; in fact, it underscores the appeal it holds for me.
 
while each track paints its own picture, the
"play-through" quality is off the chart (by that, i refer to the desire
to not skip tracks and play the entire cd in one sitting). the album is
masterfully produced, mixed and mastered (see below).

overdue review: vicente avella - physics of light





vicente avella
physics of light
pandora's boombox records (2022)
 
vicente avella's physics of light is, to be blunt, a
brilliant execution of the endless boundaries of solo piano music when composed
and performed by an artist whose talent and ambition are seemingly as endless
as said boundaries. through sixteen tracks, avella held me spellbound with a
dizzying command of tempo, tone, mood, and style.  yet, while i can't describe how he
accomplished the level of cohesion and continuity within the album, that is
also here in abundance. now, i am not saying that a solo piano release that
maintains a unified mood or sound cannot also be great and an artistic
triumph, but physics of light is a rarity where the artist throws
(relatively speaking) caution to the wind and plays his ass off across the
widest possible spectrum and damn the torpedoes. perhaps the key to why i
enjoyed this album so much is that no matter the specific underpinnings of a
piece (e.g. fast or slow, haunting or warm), avella's humanity and, well, his
humility shine through. he's never showing off, despite the brilliance of his
technique. i get the distinct impression he is always playing straight
from his heart (which, when one thinks about it, is contrasted by the
intellectual nature of the album's theme, i.e., each track's title deals with
light, a property of light, or a type of light). 
 
"light particles" (track one) is a patient and
somewhat somber sonic exploration while "radiance" sparkles with
frivolity and whimsical playfulness as it races here and there. things get even
deeper (psychologically speaking) on "where light and shadow meet" as
a darker mood takes gentle control of the song. the refrain on the piece speaks
of this melding of the two opposing light qualities. the song brushes furtively
with both a sense of warmth and contentment and a sense of being in an unknown
emotional state. "ultraviolet" returns to a much gentler and
affirming mood, romantic with a dose of nostalgia, a little like a serenade to
family and friends. "oscuro" is the piece that made me sit and go (in
a neo-esque fashion) "whoa!" here, a palpable feeling of darkness and
dread looms large (albeit still within the framework of beautiful piano music).
"resistance" follows with an enticing blending of quasi-urgency and
yet deep purposefulness. there is a semi "call and response" nature
to avella's use of upper and lower registers – freakin' brilliant to my ears.
 
i could go on, but i will leave the other ten remaining
tracks for you to explore and enjoy on your own. physics of light is one
of the most emotionally and intellectually satisfying piano recordings in more
than a few years. it's a work of unparalleled ambition married to amazing
talent.

overdue review: rick erlien - moonlight beach






rick erlien
moonlight beach (2022)
 
rick erlien’s moonlight beach epitomizes the best
aspects of an ep release, i.e., leaving the listener wanting more, yet also
sated as one would be after a serving of small plates from a great restaurant.
these four solo piano tracks give ample evidence that should erlien release a
full-length recording, it will likely garner praise and please many fans of
simple, uncomplicated, yet carefully nuanced solo piano instrumentals.
 
riffing off the title of the ep, one might compare the four
songs to the four phases of the moon, i.e., it’s always the same moon, but it’s
viewed differently, and each, perhaps, evoking a different emotional reaction
from the person viewing it. this may reflect her/his locale/environment or
maybe her/his mood the time. making statements about the emotion a piece of
music will evoke in the listener is, of course, the highly subjective opinion
of the reviewer. longtime readers of my reviews know that typically i do draw
some conclusions of music’s evocation, but i always try to paint the picture of
being my, and mine alone, opinion.
 
all that said, the four pieces on the ep do strike me as
being on the reflective side of the spectrum, but not in a melancholic or
somber way. instead, there are elements of pleasant reflection, a dash of
nostalgic remembrance here and there, and subtle elements of cheer and
happiness. erlien displays solid control of tone, sustain, and nuance, no
matter the specific mood or tempo of the piece. "moonlight beach all
around" is softly romantic and sometimes transitions to a subtle yet
noticeable dramatic mood, while "moonlight beach on the sand looking at
the water" comes across more reflective and introspective. the remaining
two tracks also display a duality at times, exhibiting both a pensive and a
contrasting more active side as well. however, erlien maintains a cohesive
musical vision throughout. it's a solid collection of beach-inspired
pianoscapes. album detailsall compositions composed and performed by rick erlien.album produced by rick erlienalbum recorded by rick erlien at beach recording music, encinitas, caalbum mastered by sean m. lennon, control c, oakland, californiaalbum photo by rick erlien

review: todd mosby - land of enchantment





todd mosbyland of enchantmentmosby music group (2023)

i remember the first time i played todd mosby's newest
album, land of enchantment, and after 15 or so seconds of the first
track, "place in the sun," i seriously thought i had misplaced
the cd and inserted a spyrogyra or return to forever album instead. this was
completely unexpected to say the least. i listened to a lot of jazz fusion when
i was much younger, including the aforementioned two groups as well as bob
james, the brecker brothers, tom scott and the la express, and more. of course,
i hadn't read the album one sheet or glanced at the guest artist list which
would've certainly lessened the shock when this sweet opening track blasted
from my elantra's sound system.according to the liner notes, mosby new mexico as the
artistic impetus behind this release, stating "a longtime source of
creative inspiration for artists such as georgia o'keefe and ansel adams, new
mexico serves as the transformative catalyst for a musical journey into its
beautiful landscapes and unique culture." granted, that opening track with its driving trap kit drum
rhythms, funky bottom, and (surprise!) tom scott, the tenor sax himself, laying
down some serious horn work, may not strike most as reflecting what new mexico
"typically" brings to mind. the same can be said of track two, "moonrise
samba," and its sensual swaying melody and intoxicating percussion. but,
no matter how you slice it, if mosby and company had new mexico coursing
through their veins during the recording of land of enchantment, i sure
ain't complaining.not everything on the album is "let's get off our ass
and move," but if one were to compare the overall tone of the cd to so
many other more "new age" southwest us inspired releases, the venn
diagram would feature little intersection. not that the former myriad albums
are any less inspired or fantastic.i also must give props to mosby for his two cover tunes (the
other six are his compositions). the famous beatle tune "norwegian
wood" on which mosby plays lead melody on his sitar-like imrat guitar. the
song rocks, albeit mostly gently, with a pan-indian twist and an infusion
indian fusion jazziness in the bridge. the other cover closes out the disc and
it's a song you (or should i say "i") don't see recorded much as an
instrumental: jimmy webb's (made famous by glen campbell) "by the time i
get to phoenix." things turn reflective and low-key here, deservedly so,
and guest star charlie bisharat's violin adds the perfect amount of atmospheric
shading here, as does vocalist (wordless) laura vall. one can almost picture a long-haul
trucker making his/her way down the desert highway well into the night.i also dug the semi-blues/jazz "a distant light,"
on which dapo torimo's nuanced piano is a highlight, as well as adrienne woods'
cello.  finally, one song is a solo
guitar piece, that being "emerald springs," where it's just mosby and
his acoustic guitar veering from some mellow fingerstyle to energetic chord
fireworks.lanf of enchantment is one of those "take me
away somewhere new and exciting" albums that will, i believe, enchant the
listener who is seeking music to liven the day and sprinkle some magic into
her/his life, even if just for a bit.

review: rudy adrian - reflections on a moonlit lake






rudy adrian
reflections on a moonlit lake
spotted peccary (2024)
my first exposure to rudy adrian's music was when he
released twilight in 1999 which i could swear i reviewed but i can't
find it anywhere in my hard drive archives. i do remember being
impressed with this relative newcomer to the spacemusic/ambient and em genres.
however, i could not have foreseen how his career would blossom to the degree
that it has with now over 20 recordings to his credit. and, in my estimation,
he just keeps getting better. he seems to have left his em/sequencer days
behind in 2006 (the exception being 2017's sequencer rarities) and he now
concentrates his considerable talent on ambient soundscapes that reflect a deep
connection with all manner of nature, as witnessed by some of his album titles
(the healing lake – 2000, desert realms- 2008, coastlines
– 2016, woodlands – 2019). 
 
adrian excels at several of the aspects of
spacemusic/ambient music, e.g. the deft layering of the assorted sounds,
keyboards, textures, all of it yielding a whole which always surpasses the sum
of its parts. another way he distinguishes himself is limiting the duration of
pieces, i.e., no one track overstays its welcome. three, the cohesion of his
compositions is always around a central theme or backdrop. 
 
reflections on a moonlit lake features eleven tracks,
nothing longer than 7:59 in duration, and the music is some of adrian's most
relaxing and soothing in recent years, which one might expect given the album
title and inspiration. per the liner notes (written by adrian) "this album
was created to evoke the experience of a lakeside view in the wilderness. i
hope the music captures the calm and serenity of such a place." well,
growing up and living in the upper midwest (wisconsin and minnesota), i've
spent my share of time at wilderness lakes and yes, the music here would make a
superlative backdrop for whiling away the twilight (and deep night) hours
gazing at how a full moon glistens off the still waters of a lake surrounded by
woods of pines, oaks, and birches. all that's missing would be (for
minnesotans), the plaintive call of loons or the occasional hoot of an owl.
 
now, for those unfamiliar with rudy adrian's work, while
it's undeniably ambient in nature and scope, it can gravitate from a warm mood
to one more neutral in evocation, e.g., "midnight angel" brushes
against shadow and mystery via minor key piano whereas the piano on "lunar
shadow" perfectly captures a feeling of contentment as it patiently
unfurls against a backdrop of classic spacemusic synth washes. the closest that
the album gets to true darkness is in the aptly-titled "within the
darkness" which does paint a picture of a certain eeriness in one's
surrounding, but it's done so well with an assortment of textures and keyboard
sounds that it fits in nicely alongside warmer cuts such as the title track or
the album closer "summer night rain" which features equal parts
semi-drone washes and actual rain falling sounds. 
 
reflections on a moonlit lake is filled with
excellent drifting ambient music that one can either listen to intently, visualizing
the album's titular landscape or played in the background allowing the sounds
to soak into the room and color the environment in a noticeable but unobtrusive
sense of calm and repose. because there are no abrupt shifts in overall tone, i
imagine it'd be a great "fall asleep to" album as well.  
 
over his two-plus decades of making music, rudy adrian has
established himself as one of brightest beacons in the world of crafting
ambient soundscapes that invite the listener to dive into the music and enjoy
the experience in any capacity whatsoever.

review: michael whalen - watercolor sky






michael whalenwatercolor skymichael whalen music collaborations and musical groups have been around almost
since the earliest days of the new age music genre, e.g. nightnoise on windham
hill, eric tingstad and nancy rumbel on narada, and more. however, recently,
the era of the supergroup, which was a big part of rock and prog rock in the
late 60s and early 70s has been ushered into the genre in a more pronounced
fashion than previous collaborations evoked. prominent among these have hailed
from will ackerman's imaginary road studios, e.g. flow, among a few others. it
might be my singular opinion that these newer gatherings of musicians to record
an album are akin to the term supergroup, because i do not mean to belittle all
the assorted collaborations over the last 30-40 years in the genre. so,
consider this my take on the subject. which leads me to the album watercolor sky, a
superlative (and that is not hyperbole) uniting of some true giants from
the last several decades in the genre. headed by michael whalen who plays piano,
electronics, and percussion, this recording is not "literally" the
representation of a "super group" since he is listed as the primary
artist, but a looser definition of the term fits since it unites whalen's
talents with those of other legendary performers mark isham (trumpet and
flugelhorn), michael manring (bass), nancy rumbel (oboe and english horn), willackerman (acoustic guitar) and charlie bisharat 
(violin). you'd be hard-pressed to find a better pedigree than that.as to the music itself…well, i was about two minutes into
the opening track, "the endless summer," when i realized this was one
of those instances where the whole of the album actually exceeds the sum of its
parts. hard to believe, but all nine songs display not just the requisite
musical chops and artistry one would expect from this assemblage, but the
highest degree of sympatico one could ever desire or even imagine. it's almost
as if these folks had rehearsed for months and months prior to recording this
(which i doubt, given how busy all these musicians are, given their assorted
projects). this high level of symbiosis is what elevates watercolor sky
to the upper echelon of collaborative recordings in recent years. (it also, to
be honest, almost demands a "part 2" be already in the works).obviously, i don't need to extol anyone's talent here since
they are all bona fide superstars, but i must say that even with how often i
have praised michael whalen's skills as a composer and performer across a wide
swath of genres, moods, styles, and type of music, i was still impressed
to hell with what he does on this recording, especially his adroit use of a
myriad number of keyboards. only a small handful of musicians wield a command
as virtuosic across these aspects (david arkenstone and kevin kern come to
mind) and whalen's nine compositions demonstrates he clearly belongs in the
same orbit as those two. of course, with artists like rumbel, isham, manring,
bisharat, and ackerman, watercolor sky is undeniably a team effort.from the cheery percolating exuberance of the opening
"the endless summer," through the sparkly iridescence and flowing
melodies of the title track, the somber and slightly melancholic beauty of
"the first frost," and closing with the plaintive reflection of
"winter beach," watercolor sky brims with soulful
performances, gorgeous melodies, perfect production quality, and music that
will inspire an assortment of images if the listener relaxes and soaks it all
in. do i recommend watercolor sky? whaddya think?
