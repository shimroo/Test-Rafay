created to preserve that traditional skill sets of working cow horses and handlers, penning and sorting challenge modern riders and mounts to compete in a timed event to identify, move and pen specific cattle from a herd in a limited amount of time. penning and sorting are timed events that involve speed, precision and strategic planning in order to quickly and accurately cut and pen the cattle.
