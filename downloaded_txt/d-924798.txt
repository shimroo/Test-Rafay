    “the day of my spiritual awakening
    was the day i saw – and knew i saw –
    all things in god and god in all things.”
– mechthild of magdeburg (the flowing light of the godhead)

    “i believe that god is in me
    as the sun is in the colour and
    fragrance of a flower — the light
    in my darkness, the voice in
    my silence.”    
– helen keller

    “what can we gain by sailing
    to the moon if we are not able to
    cross the abyss that separates us
    from ourselves?”    
– thomas merton (the wisdom of the desert)


    “the secret of life is to share the
    creative madness of god.”    
– an english mystic


    “fish cannot drown in water
	birds cannot sink in air.
	gold cannot perish in the refiner's fire.
	this has god given to all creatures,
	to foster and seek their own nature.
	how then can i withstand mine?”    
– mechthild of magdeburg (the flowing light of the godhead)
