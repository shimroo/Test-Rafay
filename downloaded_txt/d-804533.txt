bankruptcy lawmichael drose

after practicing law for the past 40+ years, i have made the difficult decision to officially retire and close drose law firm. as of november 1, 2023, i am no longer accepting new cases. it has been both my pleasure and my honor to have served the people of the lowcountry over the years. if you are a current client of my firm, you can expect to receive a notice by the end of february 2024 providing information and instructions on what this means for you and your case. if you are a former client needing copies of case documents, please contact the bankruptcy court of sc for instructions on how to obtain copies of these items or if you need additional assistance, you may need to consult with a bankruptcy attorney for matters going forward.
thank you for allowing drose law firm to represent you over the years, i wish you all the best.
sincerely,
r. michael drose
