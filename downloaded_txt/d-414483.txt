what our clients say








i have worked with the rosen group over the years and highly recommend them for your hr needs. recently, we needed to find a lead technical resource to manage our hris. the rosen group successfully sourced a leader who met both our hris and business requirements. they were great to work with!

i worked with scott to hire a senior hr role at my company when i was leading the function. scott really helped narrow down the field for me and saved me a ton of time vs. wading through the candidate field on my own. quite honestly, i had a couple of false starts with this particular position and scott's level of involvement, expertise and market knowledge - particularly around the local area - really helped get the search outcome right. he moved quickly, his team was communicative, and we hired the right person who is still in position today. i wouldn't hesitate to use his services again. i worked with scott to hire a senior hr role at my company when i was leading the function. scott really helped narrow down the field for me and saved me a ton of time vs. wading through the candidate field on my own. quite honestly, i had a couple of false starts with this particular position and scott's level of involvement, expertise and market knowledge - particularly around the local area - really helped get the search outcome right. he moved quickly, his team was communicative, and we hired the right person who is still in position today. i wouldn't hesitate to use his services again.

scott is an outstanding hr business leader and hr partner. his knowledge and experience has always been an asset to the work we did together for more than twenty years.his thoughtful and caring approach has always made the difference in his results. if you work with scott and i encourage you do so, my advice .....listen and learn from his knowledge, wisdom and pleasant demeanor

( retired talent acquisition leader at main line health )



i had the privilege of working with scott for many years during my tenure as chro for the honickman companies, and i can confidently say he sets the standard for excellence in executive search. scott has an uncanny ability to truly understand the needs of his clients and deliver exceptional candidates who align with both the role and the organization’s culture. beyond his technical expertise, scott is a trusted advisor who brings integrity, thoughtfulness, and a deep understanding of the human resources landscape to every interaction. his insights have consistently proven invaluable to me and my team over the years. i’m proud to recommend scott without hesitation.

i would highly recommend the rosen group to fill your hr functional needs. i recently used scott and the team to help me find a leader for our talent acquisition function. he and his team are awesome to work with!!
mary sweeney
( svp of hr at tridentcare )



when faced with the challenge of filling a key hr position on extremely short notice due to an unplanned medical absence, the rosen group exceeded our expectations by stepping in and delivering our candidate within just two weeks. i was introduced to the rosen group while tapping my network for recommendations and their name came up more than once. now i am among those recommending them as experts in their field!
