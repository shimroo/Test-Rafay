our faith, our vote blog




our faith, our vote campaign publishes a new blog post every tuesday highlighting a critical election issue. check out the newest article!









having faithful and respectful discussions




as people of faith participating in the public square, we are called to a higher standard of engagement and interaction with our neighbors. check out these tips for being a civil voice in uncivil times.













the united church of christ’s our faith our vote campaign is our ongoing commitment to equip you with the tools for nonpartisan faithful engagement in our democratic process. the campaign is made up of three main components; voter registration, issue education, and voter empowerment. the 2024 our faith our vote campaign asks the church to answer the call of 1 john 3:18 to “let us not love with words or speech, but in action and in truth,” by “voting with love.” vote with love for creation, for our neighbors both here and abroad, for a just peace, for repair and reconciliation of the brokenness of our nation. and encourage your family, friends, and community to do the same. the 2024 election season is well underway, so please check this page for updates to learn how you can “vote with love” this year.




⭐️ watch the current and four former general ministers and presidents of the united church of christ team up for one united message in the our faith our vote campaign, on the importance of voting with love.
for people of faith, public policy is never merely politics. it is a way of living out the commandment to love our neighbor as ourselves. it is fitting for local congregations and church structures across the country to develop nonpartisan programs to help the faith community reflect upon the political order.

vote faithfully sunday 2024: join us in observing the sunday before election day as vote faithfully sunday! we invite you to use & adapt these worship materials for any ecumenical setting.
don’t be scared, be prepared: what to expect in the 2024 november election: check out this resource for election day scenarios and guides on how churches discern their role as community leaders in keeping our elections safe and accessible.
