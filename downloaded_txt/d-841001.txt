sponsor a family



when you sponsor a family you become part of their story. from $25 a month, less than 85 cents a day, you will help provide practical, emotional and spiritual support to some of the poorest families in europe.  
our aim is always to help the families to eventually be able to take care of themselves.  you can exchange letters, photos and cards throughout your sponsorship and share the family's challenges, successes and milestones.
