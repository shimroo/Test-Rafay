"we have been on 12 coopersmith tours in the
              past, starting with venice and the italian lakes in 1994, through
              buckinghamshire & hertfordshire in 2023. our upcoming tour to
              the peak district will be our thirteenth, and jane's farewell tour
              the fourteenth. so we've been traveling with you for 30 years,
              with our thanks!"
              â kathy and greg stern, jefferson, maryland
dear garden enthusiast,
welcome to coopersmith's, north america's oldest and most trusted
            international garden and stately-home tour company, now in our 40th
            year of crafting one-of-a-kind toursâ® for the discerning traveler. 
over the years, people have asked me, âwhat made you decide to go
            into the tour business?â my answer, simply put, is that travel has
            been in my blood for as long as i can remember. having grown up in
            new jersey, some of my fondest childhood memories were the car trips
            our family took to places like niagara falls, smokey mountains, and
            williamsburg. while in high school, i savored week-long bicycle
            tours in nova scotia and marthaâs vineyard. 
later, while attending the university of california, berkeley, i
            hitchhiked annually between west and east coasts. upon graduating, i
            set out for europe, where i thumbed my way around the continent for
            six months before settling in london. in the ensuing three years, i
            researched and wrote a guide book for like-minded travelers (rule
              of thumb: a hitchhikerâs handbook, simon & schuster,
            1973).
back in berkeley, where i supported my travel habit by working for
            over ten years as a landscape gardener, contractor, and garden
            designer, i co-founded a taste of britain, later to be renamed
            coopersmith's one-of-a-kind toursâ®. my passion was, and still is,
            crafting unique, small-group, upscale garden and manor-house tours
            that i, myself, would feel comfortable being part of.
the following elements have always formed the foundation for those
            tours: 


 world-class tour leaders, with a minimum of ten years'
                experience in the field


 exceptional gardens, featuring private tours by owners and
                head gardeners


small groups: as few as six and never more than 20 participants


 relaxed pace: on average, one visit in the morning, and one in
                the afternoon


 limited time on the motorcoach, with plenty of extra seats


 in-depth focus on one or two regions of one country


 four-to-seven-nights in atmospheric country inns and
                manor-house hotels


 gourmet meals, often locally-sourced



now, four decades later, weâre still going strong. our tours
            typically fill up 12 to 18 months in advance. we have dozens of
            clients who travel with us on a regular basis, some up to two or
            even three times a year. i love what one of our clients once wrote
            on his feedback form: "going on a coopersmith's tour," he said, "is
            like taking part in a traveling house party, focusing on beautiful
            homes and gardens, with jeeves doing all the work!"
when people go on a coopersmith's tour, odds are theyâll be signing
            up for another one soon - sometimes even before finishing the one
            theyâre on! come join us this year or next and help us celebrate our
            forty years in the business. and see for yourself what makes our
            tours truly one-of-a-kindâ®! 
happy travels,


"a company that specializes in small groups [where
            members] are often taken to private gardens rarely seen..."

            speak with [famous english horticulturalist] penelope hobhouse, who
            recommended your garden tour as one of the two best in europe..."
