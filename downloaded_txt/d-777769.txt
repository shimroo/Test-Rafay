the steve perreault award
el premio steve perreault
 
 

nfadb is proud to posthumously recognize mary o’donnell, past nfadb president, as the recipient of the 2024 steve perreault award.
during the 2024 nfadb annual general membership meeting, nancy o’donnell reflected on the beginnings of nfadb and shared:
 “mary o’donnell was one of the original 12 parents of this national parent network advisory committee. it didn’t take long for everyone to realize that parents needed to do more than advise. they needed to advocate, to lobby, to educate beyond the educational years. leadership needed to shift from professionals to parents and siblings. a 501(c)(3) needed to be established. the early organizational meetings were a hoot. i say that with great love and affection, as i was a front-row witness to this evolution. i got to work with joe (mcnulty), steve (perreault), mary, and other parents as they shepherded this new group from an advisory committee into a national nonprofit.”
as described in an excerpt from the db link newsletter:
“a private, understated person who shunned the spotlight and preferred working behind the scenes, she somehow always seemed to end up in a leadership position. for those lucky enough to have known her personally, it was easy to see why. she possessed a wealth of knowledge but never tried to impress others with it—she simply offered her support and counsel. she had an inner strength and tenacity that enabled her to stay focused, even in times of great confusion. she was a great listener who was open to differing points of view and never failed to recognize the contributions of others. she was a lovely, thoughtful person who carried herself with class and dignity in all she did. she is greatly missed.” (excerpted from the september 1996 deaf-blind perspectives)
mary o’donnell served as nfadb president after nfadb became a non-profit organization in 1994, leaving a lasting legacy through her dedicated leadership. although she is no longer with us, her commitment and passion continue to inspire and empower the success of families in the deafblind community through her family and nfadb.
