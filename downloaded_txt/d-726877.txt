notices





your online profile has a new look!
new year, new look. your online profile has a new green menu bar, but you can still navigate your profile in the same way. we hope you enjoy this refresh for 2025!
did you know?
green can have a positive impact on mood and behavior and has been known to increase productivity.


online profile multi-factor authentication
to ensure the highest levels of security, central casting now requires multi-factor authentication to log in to your online profile. if you have not set up mfa, you will be prompted with step-by-step instructions the next time you log in. for more information, see our mfa support page.

want to update your profile photos?
we are no longer holding in-person photo updates. while you cannot change your main profile photo, you can upload photos of your current look to your online profile. our casting directors use these photos when booking their roles. in addition to a current headshot and full body shot, casting directors also recommend a casual, business, and formal look, then 1-2 photos in unique looks or wardrobe. casting directors prefer photos that are similar in style and framing to the photos taken or approved during talent onboarding. check out our photo update guide to learn more.

central casting’s new text message number – it’s shorter and always the same!
text messages from central casting will be sent from a new number. it’s shorter – only 5 digits, and it’s always the same 5-digit number. you can be assured that all messages you receive from this number are from us here at central casting. we know some of our background actors had some difficulty receiving text messages, this new number will help ensure all messages are delivered.
to respond to availability inquiries, you still must click the provided link or log in to your online profile. and of course if you’re going to be late or need to cancel, you must call your central casting office. this new text number does not accept replies.

tech support chat
our tech support chat is now available between 6am-6pm pt for technical help with your online profile, email updates, required training questions (los angeles and new york only), and more. note: technical support and casting are separate. if you need to cancel, are going to be late, have questions about your booking, or other casting related inquiries, you must contact your central casting office.

check out our articles section
articles are available now. each article has a quick poll. be sure to cast your votes. keep checking back as we continue to post regular new content.
