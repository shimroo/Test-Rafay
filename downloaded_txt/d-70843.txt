we know how to make your wedding magical




magical review: “we cannot say enough good things about having our wedding at rancho de las palmas. we just got married in june and the grounds were flourishing and looked beautiful. we loved all the different areas for our ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. laura and the team were wonderful to work with too. laura met with us multiple times throughout our planning process, let us bring our families to tour the grounds and was always willing to answer any questions we had. the pay it forward room was a blessing for small items and laura’s team did a wonderful job setting up all our décor the day of our wedding. we had everything labeled and talked about where we wanted it the week before, and they ran with it, not having to reach out to us once. highly recommend rdlp!”

all of the guests were stunned at how beautiful this venue is. pictures do not do it justice. i was fooled until i decided to book a tour and the moment we stepped into the venue we knew we wanted to get married there. it is literally so beautiful and so much greenery!! i cannot fail to mention laura who runs the venue. she is literally the best! she makes everything run smoothly! she solved every issue we ran into and i had no clue until after the wedding. so the venue is beautiful and laura is a plus!! -yasmin g
