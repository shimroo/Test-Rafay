about

aodd pumps

aodd pumps in their simplest form are a type of positive displacement pump

they are powered by compressed air. the air is shifted between two chambers via a shaft that links these chambers. the shaft enables both of the chambers to move simultaneously.  the motion of the compressed air forces the liquid out of one chamber and into a discharge pipe. this happens as the other chamber is being filled with liquid and the process is repeated.
