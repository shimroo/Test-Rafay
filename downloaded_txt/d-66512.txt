welcome to genealogy images of 
    history. was your granddaddy named in any old newspapers or magazines? well, 
    as i researched my family names, i found my granddaddy ran for constable in 
    a little town named belton, texas way back in 1902. so, it occurred to me 
    that others might be searching for news of their loved ones  - so on  the following 
    pages you will find an expanding database of articles that i have saved over 
    the years published in magazines, newspapers and books about people from the 
    past who made the headlines. some of these are very rare one of a kind 
    documents and are very valuable. originals are 
    first come first serve. the research staff is constantly adding names and we update 
    the pages daily, so check back 
    often. please check our feedback.
