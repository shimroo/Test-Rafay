awesome pizza for awesome people

what our customers say










seriously. i could eat a pound of that sausage they put on their pizzas as a meal unto itself. they are huge pies and the most delicious pizzas ever. come hungry and ready to be hosed down afterward. good tap selection too.

this location continues to deliver big-quality good even during the busiest times. the beer: cold. the glasses: frosty. the pizza: delectable. we ordered the combo2 which is my recommended pizza! reheat even-tastier leftover slices in a frying pan on medium heat for 8-10 mins to get a nice crust.


												 - egan										


there is a reason i come back here with friends and family! the food is excellent, and a great price! the staff are always cool people, and the atmosphere is 80s arcade and feels right! it is a kid friendly place where you can still have a beer, a slice and a salad from the salad bar! the lunch special is awesome too! a slice with a salad, breadstick, and a drink! no complaints from me, only satisfaction! thank you!


												 - alex										


the best ever! fat pizza, fat toppings cooked to order. i prefer it well done extra crispy on the xtra thick crust. stromboli pizza is the champ ?
fresh beer on tap and free soda refills. salad bar always packed with variety even at closing. i go out of my way to come here!  ?
