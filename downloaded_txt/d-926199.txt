717 gigapixel image of 'the night watch'






digital photography review reports: [edited]
the rijksmuseum hosts a 717 gigapixel rendition of rembrandt's 'the night watch' (1642).
starting in 2019, conservationists used a 100 megapixel hasselblad h6d 400 ms camera to create 8439 photographs of the paintings. the file size of the image is 5.6 terabytes.
the distance between 2 pixels on the image is 5 micrometers (0.0005 centimeters). one pixel of the image is smaller than a human red blood cell. each photo has a depth of field of 125 micrometers (0.0125 centimeters). 
to ensure each image was properly in focus, the surface of the painting was scanned with lasers, the camera's settings were adjusted for optimal image quality. after each image was captured, a neural network scanned it for colour accuracy and sharpness.
the level of detail captured, coupled with the size of the file, makes it the largest image of a work of art ever captured.

pure flux one electric bicycle






t3 reports: [edited]
the first electric bike from e-scooter specialist pure electric has three things going for it: a low price, unusually cool looks for an e-bike, and extreme simplicity. if you're considering taking up cycling for the first time, post-lockdown, it's a perfect choice. if, like me, you have cycled before but become so unfit that electrical assistance is now very much required, it's a sound option.
it's not the best electric bike but it is probably the best cheap electric bike, taking a stripped-down approach that means it doesn't feel like too many compromises have been made to get the price under £1,000. 
the display tells you your speed, you also get a basic battery gauge – the range is 25 miles max, so it's worth keeping an eye on this. you can recharge it to 80% of capacity in three hours or fully charge it in five.

there are disk brakes, although they are mechanical rather than hydraulic. the ride experience is simple and pretty good fun. there are no gears, no chain – a carbon belt is used, so no mucky trousers for you – and no app. 
it provides three levels of electrical assistance capped at 9, 12.5 or 15.5mph. you can also turn the assistance off entirely and ride it like an unusually hefty single-speed bike. the flux one weighs 17.5kg including the battery. pure electric describes this as 'lightweight' and by e-bike standards, it is – a lot of them weigh 20kg and up. however, compared to a single-speed, non-electric bike, 17.5kg is by no means light.
there is an issue if you want to go above 15.5mph. due to the absence of gears, this involves pedalling like mad. i find it a bit of a chore but for everyday, stop/start urban riding, it's plenty, for most purposes.
in contrast to the kind of folding, feature-packed, ai-powered bikes i've been bombarded with recently, pure electric's looks, rides and behaves like a bicycle. it's got full-sized wheels, good-enough brakes, stylish-enough 'hybrid' bike styling and it handles really well.
