the original motorcycle lowering link built in boise. ridden and raced everywhere.

 

koubalink specializes in motorcycle lowering and performance linkages for off-road and dual-sport rear suspension systems. compromise is not an option at koubalink. we listen to riders from all over the world explain where and how they use their off-road and dual-sport bikes.  with their input, we manufacture products that add to your motorcycling experience and make it a little more enjoyable."good enough" is not in the koubalink vocabulary. not for materials, craftsmanship, and certainly not for customer service.  koubalink gives you choices based on rider height and ability whether you're a racer, weekend fire-road cruiser, or just need a lower seat height without giving up suspension performance. we design products to meet your specific riding style and terrain.
