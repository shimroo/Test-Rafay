sunchaser performance
owning a sunchaser is more than just an incredible feeling of freedom and exhilaration, it's about taking that indulgence to the next level.
add x-treme performance strakes to your features package and discover stability and handling you didn't think was possible in a pontoon boat. our advanced pontoon tubes slice through the waves and chop, lifting the boat onto plane for a smooth, nimble ride instead of plowing through the water and pounding up and down. for the ultimate in performance, our x-treme pr25/20 performance packages provide better lift, less drag, increased speed, faster planing times and a tighter turning radius - all of which equals better fuel economy and sporty handling and performance you can truly feel!
