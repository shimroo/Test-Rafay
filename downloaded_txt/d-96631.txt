touch of red

friday–saturday, february 28–1, 2025 


“touch of red” is the beautiful new entry in pitts’s and tribe’s ongoing red series, which explores black multiplicity and human connection. “touch of red” is a duet for black men who come together in a boxing ring—not for a display of aggression but rather for an exploration of vulnerability, effeminacy, and healing.
