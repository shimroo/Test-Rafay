address
3145 n sheffield avenue
chicago, il 60657
in 1912, the victoria theater opened as an alternative to the more expensive fare playing in chicago’s notorious downtown venues. an article in the chicago tribune – one of many rave reviews – predicted the theatre would become one of chicago’s most popular priced houses. initially built to host vaudeville and touring stage shows, the vic – as it’s now known – would prove to be one of the more adaptable and resilient such buildings in town, all the while remaining a stable anchor in the ever-changing landscape of the lakeview neighborhood.
