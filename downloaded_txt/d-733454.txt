our studiosherwood dance academy first opened in old town circa 2001. it started with a handful of students, a single classroom, and a vision to share our passion with the growing town. fast forward 20 years: we now have an amazing dance family that includes hundreds of students, 12 staff, 3 classrooms, and over 60 classes offered each week. at sherwood dance academy, we believe that anyone who wants to dance, should be able to dance.  if you want to dance, you are welcome here!what can we say?  we love what we do and are thrilled to share our passion for dance.














“my daughters have always been welcomed, celebrated, and felt like they belonged by teachers and students alike. sda is a physical place and a feeling all at once- a place to work hard, gain new skills and friends, share your passion, and find new passions and that is only possible because of the excellent staff that cares, communicates, and embraces the strength that each student brings.”— amy d.
