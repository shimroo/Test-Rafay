i’m happy to announce the recording of savage winter is now out on albany records, available as a cd and for streaming. this re-imagining of the text that schubert set as winterreise, features me on guitar and my long time collaborators and friends tony boutté (voice), frank london (trumpet) and alan johnson (music director, conductor, keyboards).



the premiere of the jump up! for sandbox percussion and volunteer percussionists will be at the caramoor center for music and the arts, in katonah, ny. it’s on sunday, july 21, 2024 at 4pm, and it’s a free event! come see it, or even better, come and participate as a volunteer percussionist - it’s easy! it’s fun! more info about how to join in (or just be in the audience) here.
