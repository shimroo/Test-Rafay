“i’ve had the privilege of getting to know carlisle school through two different perspectives, one as a faculty member and more recently as a parent. i have come to think less of it as a job and more as an intellectual opportunity. it has provided me with a great educational foundation that i want for my own children. in fact, we enrolled our daughter in the preschool program this year and it was a decision that has validated our feelings about the carlisle experience.”juliana cartermom to maryn  we have been a part of the carlisle family since 2013. the boys and i visited for a tour of the school that year, and they have been there ever since. the boys were in pre-k3 then and are currently 7th graders. our love for the school has continued to grow every year. the curriculum supersedes any other in the area and is phenomenal. faculty and staff are hands-on, readily available, and phenomenal. carlisle school is just simply phenomenal. if you are interested in a stellar education, along with a caring environment, then carlisle is the place for you and your family 💛💙tiffany hairstonmom to kendrick and karter  “we have been very pleased with carlisle’s methods of teaching. we are truly delighted with how our children are embraced, nurtured, and supported by the staff and teachers. our children are excited to go to school and learn new things each day.”amber heathparent of andrew and jackson  transferring to carlisle has been the best decision we’ve made for our son. i appreciate the way he has been welcomed into the carlisle family. he loves the smaller classes and is thriving in this new environment. he is excited to go to school each day, and we love to see how he is being challenged in the classroom. we also appreciate the focus carlisle places on the holistic development of the student that goes beyond the classroom.meghan egglestonmom to rylan  “carlisle school has allowed our son ben to flourish over the past two years. our family believes carlisle brings out the best of each child by leveraging their individual strengths while promoting kindness and leadership skills.”hillary robinsonmom to ben  “at carlisle, i’ve found that you will not only get an education you can be proud of while having teachers that truly care about you, but you will also always be part of a family here.”jameson smithstudent, class of 2022   
  








we support carlisle because this is the type of educational environment that fosters our son’s love of learning. carlisle is a very special place where we feel safe and secure knowing that the teachers love and care for our child the way we do. it has enhanced our son’s life in so many ways, and we wouldn’t have him anywhere else. - shannon reynolds


carlisle feels like a family with dedicated faculty who work closely with each student. our daughters are receiving an outstanding education and benefit greatly from the small class sizes.  - molly wright, parent
