                      	 wealth shortcuts
	                       
                          

there are shortcuts to wealth.but it isn't so much what you do but what you think.yes, you usually have to do something to get wealthy, but your thinking will determine what you do and influence what you see and achieve.clear the pathways in your mind to creating, attracting and receiving wealth and son of a gun, there it is, right there before your eyes and in your bank account.but how do you clean those inner beliefs and thought limitations?how do you install a mindset of wealth and abundance based on the "secret teachings" of the greatest prosperity writers?a tested new way is through a combined approach of listening to key messages from the classics of wealth literature *while* in a state of receptivity.there are now a series of audios to help you do just that.some you simply listen to while driving.others you listen to while relaxing, with headphones.they are all described over at www.thesecretshortcut.com the series of audios are a type of "push button" approach to attracting wealth.they are by my friend, famous las vegas hypnotist scott lewis. he combines his expertise in hypnosis with the wealth literature of napoleon hill and wallace wattles and others.why not take a look?www.thesecretshortcut.comao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps -- in a few days i'll be revealing my secret of productivity. people have been asking me how i'm able to create so many books, cds, dvds, products, services, courses and so on. next week i'll reveal how you, too, can be prolific and productive and get things done with my method. stay tuned.

the reason you don't personally know a lot of people is because of your brain.the reason most of the six billion people you don't know are grouped into categories is because of your brain.appears our noggins can only hold about 150 people -- people you know the first name of and feel comfortable with.beyond that amount your brain lumps people into things like races, stereotypes, organizations, cultures, etc.this is all because of something called the monkeysphere.since i've been recording and filming all week and am bushed right now, i don't have the time or energy to explain this concept to you.but someone else has already done so.his writing is excellent, and for mature audiences only, and located at www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/monkeysphere.htmlwatch your bananas and go read it.ao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps -- a wikipedia article on the underlying research of the monkeysphere is at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunbar's_number enjoy.

if you could ask me just one question about how to live a "zero limits" life, what would it be?i'll be doing a free teleseminar soon where i can answer your question.  you can post it at --www.askjoezerolimits.comthis event is part of a global promotion for the release of my next book, "zero limits," due out at the end of this month."zero limits" is the true story of the therapist who helped heal an entire ward of mentally ill criminals, using a simple hawaiian healing method called ho'oponopono.the book is by me and the therapist, and reveals his method for the first time in history. the method can be used to remove inner blocks to anything you want to heal or manifest.this is the most exciting thing i've ever written about.aparrently i'm not the only one to think so.dr. marc gitterle said, "i feel this book will be the definitive personal-change/self-help book for at least a generation, and viewed as a watershed event by historians. there is real potential for this book to start a movement that will end war, poverty and the environmental devastation of our beloved planet."bestselling author debbie ford said,"this riveting book can awaken humanity."author james arthur ray said, "joe vitale has captured the truth that all great spiritual, scientific, and psychological principles teach at the most fundamental level."maverick marketer craig perrine said, "this book is like a stick of dynamite and the moment you start reading the fuse is lit. it blows away all the complex and confusing success paradigms of the past and reveals a refreshing and clear path to transform your life with just one simple step."again, you can post your question at  -- www.askjoezerolimits.comao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps -  you can get more details about the book, including how to get audios of the first seminar based on the ideas in the book, at www.zerolimits.info  you can also pre-order the book from amazon. i'm currently recording the audios for the book and they should be on itunes at the end of the month, as well.

                      	 bonnie meets francine and learns the mightest motivator
	                       
                          

when my sister, bonnie, visited me last week and saw my 2005 panoz esperante gtlm named francine, she lit up. bonnie has never been into cars, but she sure wanted in francine. and once behind the wheel, she didn't want to let go, or get out.it was raining that day, so bonnie didn't get to drive francine.bonnie has been married for almost twenty-nine years. when her husband, frank, got into the car, his eyes grew large and his smile grew wide. i let him start the car. as he heard the roar of francine's engine, he seemed to radiate bliss.bonnie looked at him and said, "i haven't seen that look on your face in twenty-nine years."frank replied, "get me a car like this and you'll see it all the time."ao akua,joewww.mrfire.com/ps - if you think desire is bad, or the cause of all suffering, then you are believing a myth. buddha actually said misunderstood desire and attachment to desire cause suffering, not desire itself. as mandy evans points out in a guest article just added to my site, babies learn to walk because of natural desire. it's the most powerful force. it's your inner compass letting you know you are on your path. but most of us squelch it. what do you desire?

                      	 principles of change
	                       
                          

a dear friend who knew me over thirty years ago, when i was in poverty and struggling, is baffled by my level of success today.she's still struggling.i'm not.so she asked me an interesting question:"how'd you do it?"sheesh. this is a question i get a lot.i've tried to answer it here on this blog, on my main site, and in my various books.i'll try to answer it yet again.i think my change came from the following principles of conscious creation:1. constant belief clearing.i feel we live in a belief created universe. most of us, myself included, are living our lives based on programming we aren't even aware of. those unconscious beliefs are causing us to see the world the way we do, and to take the actions (or not take them) that we do. to get different results, you have to change the programming. i keep working on myself with books and audios and seminars. but i also know sometimes you need what i've coined a miracles coach. this is clearly the number one thing i've done and continue to do to keep improving myself. the only limitations are my own. the way to change them is inside me. if i can't see the beliefs operating in me, i may need an outside trusted party to help me find them and release them. this is the most important key to permanent change. everyone who finds their limiting beliefs and changes them will get new results. everyone. and "everyone" includes you. this is the missing secret to dramatic change.2. constant action.i rarely sit around waiting for things to happen. i've tried many things that failed, and many that succeeded. recently suzanne, my chief assistant, compiled a bibliography of my work. it's forty-three pages long. how in the world did i create 43 pages worth of products? from constant action. most people don't take any action because they talk themselves out of it. they are afraid of failure, or success. this is why step one (belief clearing) is so important. take care of the doubts and you naturally take actions. i'm the guy in the movie the secret that urges you to take inspired action, so it should come as no surprise to you that i still believe action is one of the essential keys to change. action is a great way to install and transcend the secret.3. constant ruthless honesty.most people lie to themselves about what they really want. they say things that are socially acceptable or safe in some other way, instead of opening their heart and speaking the truth about their desires. being ruthlessly honest with yourself helps you discover your passion, and passion is the fuel that brings you new levels of success. passion is my secret to success. passion is your guidance system that leads you to change. passion adds fire to the law of attraction. passion is one of the key principles of change.again, there are numerous principles of change, self-empowerment and deliberate creation. i've written about them in my books, the attractor factor and in life's missing instruction manual, and in forthcoming books, such as zero limits, and the key. but if you want a quick answer to a big question, the above three points are it.having shared them here with you, which one are you going to passionately act on right now?ao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps - as you may already know, i also created several dvds based on the law of attraction and deliberate creation to help you easily change. see www.subliminalmanifestation.com/ and www.missingsecret.info/ and www.installthesecret.com and of course there's always www.miraclescoaching.com/ you can change and experience self-empowerment, but you have to do something to begin that change. choose. act. now. go!note: some books that can help you awaken and begin to change are ones by steve chandler, who i am reading lately. see his gems at www.stevechandler.com/books.htm great stuff.

actress cathy lee crosby (wonder woman, that's incredible, etc), author of let the magic begin, read the manuscript to my forthcoming book, the key, and said this --"joe vitale's energy and enthusiasm for life jumps off every page of his new book, the key. he leaves no stone unturned in explaining exactly how to attract everything you want in your life. the words 'i love you' have taken on a whole new meaning. bravo!"just had to share...ao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps - the key will come out in october. zero limits comes out later next month. you can pre-order either or both at amazon right now. cathy lee's book is also worth getting, and amazon has it, as well.

                      	 melinda's one-finger manicure
	                       
                          

while escorting my sister around san antonio's famed river walk last saturday, a young, tiny woman at a kiosk quietly stopped me with the question, "want to see something amazing?"amazing?of course. i was curious. i said yes.she then asked me to put my hands in a bowl. then she poured a small amount of dead sea something or other on my hands and asked me to wash them. i did."when was the last time you washed your hands?" she asked.though it was saturday, i said, "last monday."she laughed, and then pointed out how dirty my hands were. apparently the dead sea stuff was getting dead dirt off my hands.the little lady then asked me if she could do my fingernail. i agreedshe began to scrub my index finger's nail with some dead sea block of something or other. as she did, she asked, "when was the last time you had a manicure?""a manicure? probably in a past life. i've never had one."the girl went on with her sales pitch. i was going along with the demo, thinking all along i would just buy this stuff for nerissa. but i have to admit i was enjoying the interaction and becoming interested in the products. it was hypnotic selling at work. though the girl seemed a little awkward in her presentation, she was doing fine in engaging me.but the punch line was yet to come.at the end of her spiel, i bought just under one hundred dollars of her goods.she then announced, "my name is melinda and you were my first customer."i was stunned.almost speechless."you've never done this before?" i asked."today's my first day," she replied. "you're my first customer."her boss was standing behind the kiosk and came out to confirm that yes, indeed, melinda just made her first sale.goes to show you that you can never determine what people are thinking, what their skills or experience level might be, or much else, until you put them on the stage. and even then you won't know for sure.this is true for you, as well.so go out there and try something new today.ao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps -- "i love you" is now actress cathy lee crosby's mantra. stay tuned to learn why.

                      	 turning corners, playing gigs
	                       
                          

you never know what's around the next corner.while showing my sister around the area where we live, we went into hill country guitars, a cool place to buy vintage and collectible guitars.my sister isn't at all interested in guitars, but i am. since i was her tour guide, we went where i wanted to go.anyway, in the store nerissa saw an unusual stool in the center of the room. when i asked the owner, kevin drew davis, he said there's a story behind the guitar stool.appears a guitar player by the name of pete petre made the stool for himself, to make his gig playing more comfortable. there are adjustable legs to rest your feet, a place to put your beverage, slots to stick your guitar picks, a place to lean your guitar, and so on.the thing is, whenever pete played, people were more interested in his handmade guitar stools than in his music.but being a smart entrepreneur, he went with the demand. he now makes guitar stools. his site at www.guitarstools.com/ is so busy with orders, he just took it offline until he could keep up with the demand.i bought one of his guitar stools, too. that's it in the picture. (the guitar in the picture was given to me by pat o'bryan.)the lesson here is to be open. you might want to do one thing, but the public may be more interested in a tangent to it. you can still do what you want, but don't overlook what the buyers want. after all, they are the ones with the money.ao akua,joewww.mrfire.com ps - in an upcoming episode of this blog, i'll be telling you the amazing (but true!) story of my one-finger manicure. stay tuned.

                      	 how to get my attention - part two
	                       
                          

i'm in san antonio showing my sister around. but before i could leave to get here i had to sign for packages from fed-x and express mail.people are sending me dvd players and cell phones, all trying to get my attention.there's a lot to say here about sending me things but since i'm typing on my blackberry, i'll just say this: the first time someone sends me a dvd player and/or a phone, it's unique. but by the next ten times it wears thin.anyone who reads this blog should know how easy it is to get my attention. just be the person to send me the largest ever amazon gift certificate. (the largest i ever received so far was five hundred dollars.)but what you *really* should be doing is developing an idea worth my (or anyone's) attention. then and only then should you get creative about turning my head.after all, i'm not looking for new projects, so your idea has to be more stunning then the approach you use to get my attention.ao akuajoe www.mrfire.com ** sent via wireless e-mail with blackberry **(i could be anywhere) :)

i don't watch sports at all.no football.basketball.baseball.wrestling.not even boxing, though i thought i was going to be world heavyweight boxing champion back in the early 1970s. (for real.)today i couldn't tell you the name of the current heavyweight champion.but all this non-sports watching changed a few weeks ago when i discovered the most exciting athletic competition ever seen on television.i'm talking about ninja warrior.i stumbled across this wild game show one night while flipping through channels, waiting for jon stewart's the daily show to come on.as soon as i saw these japanese athletes run through the most bizarre and demanding obstacle course ever created by madmen (or madwomen), with a clock ticking away and an audience cheering them on, i was hooked.even nerissa - another non-sports watcher - got caught up with the ninja warriors.at times i found myself holding my breath, wondering if a competitor would make it across a trippy obstacle.  (most don't.)at other times i actually spoke to the tv, urging the people in japan to make it across the mind-boggling obstacles.you've got to see this show to believe it.i find it inspiring. this morning after i worked-out, i looked at my 15 ft climbing rope and said, "if a ninja warrior can do the incredible feats they do, i can go up a frickin rope!"i then went up higher than ever before.check out ninja warrior at www.g4tv.com/ninjawarrior/index.htmlao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps -  ninja warrior is called "sasuske" in japan. talk about stretching limits and doing the impossible. what will they try next?

                      	 when is something bad?
	                       
                          

as i begin this post i'm still without my computer and wireless in the house. i only got online with my laptop a few minutes ago.as you know from my last post, lightning hit a tree here and knocked out almost everything. even my hot tub was hit. now that was bad.or was it?i started wondering when something we attract gets labelled as "bad."the power going out isn't preferred but is it bad?the internet going down, the wireless router burning up, and the cable modem being fried aren't desired either, but is it all bad?the computer dying on me isn't on my wish list either, but is it bad?i've often said that most of marketing is perception. well, so is most of life.what if i looked at the lightning strike and the resulting power problems as actually good?what if i asked myself, "what's the positive reason for this experience?"for example, i'm supposed to be on vacation this week, anyway. what do i need my computer or internet for? we cancelled the actual trip to las vegas due to brownie's death, but i can still read and relax at home. the lightning strike could be seen as a statement from the universe to stop working.i didn't understand why the hot tub would have a problem though. i use that to relax. but then i realized only half the hot tub doesn't work. i can still get in it and still use it. so even that isn't really bad.i've been reading some good books while on this enforced vacation. i'm becoming a fan of steve chandler. his book the story of you is inspiring.it's about learning to choose a new story - or to give new meaning - to whatever happens.when you do that, you have control of your life experience.so - what's bad?maybe nothing at all.maybe all it needs is a new story. a new interpretation.thank goodness for that lightning strike.without it i may never have written this post or paused to read a really good book.not bad, eh?ao akua,joewww.mrfire.comps - i don't know steve but his books are excellent. see www.stevechandler.com or of course shop for him at amazon.
