brewer clifton













 



 
founded in 1996, brewer-clifton wines are a reflection of the geographic, geologic and climatic uniqueness of california’s sta. rita hills appellation in santa barbara county. founder and winemaker greg brewer has spent the entirety of his three-decade career dedicated to crafting cool-climate chardonnay and pinot noir from this finite stretch of land.
 















 








"at brewer-clifton, it is our primary goal and priority to deliver the essence of that vineyard as clearly and honestly as possible. our mission and indeed our passion is to present wines that convey the characteristics inherent to each of these sites, with uncompromising quality."

winemaker & founder, greg brewer
