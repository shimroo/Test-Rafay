‚Äúthroughout the last two semesters, i have spent more than thirty hours interviewing clients on immigration matters," says josiah jones `26. "i have worked with individual clients i‚Äôve gotten to know in-depth, and i‚Äôve spent three days in detention centers advising people on their immigration rights with only brief individual consults. throughout these experiences, i have learned the value in the work that has been accomplished, but i also have come to realize just how much work there is yet to be done.‚Äùread more about josiah`s experience in the immigration law and advocacy clinic at the link in our bio.
