diplomacy & decorum



the evolving modern professional

 









the benefits of becoming a polished professionalin the business world, good etiquette means acting professionally and showing respect to colleagues and clients. most professionals are available 24/7, and with increasing pressure to perform are often too busy to think about how their words and behaviors affect others. workplace stress costs the us economy $500 billion per year (american psychological association). it is easy to get wrapped up in our laptops, and smartphones and to forget that how we treat people is critical to our success.  whether we are speaking face to face, on the phone, or digitally, everyone should be treated with consideration and respect. policies that demonstrate respect and care for people are good for business, and even the smallest of gestures can help shape positive, value-adding behavior in teams and organizations.the polite society’s modern business etiquette was designed to address the needs of the changing workforce and the effects of being ‘on’ 24/7. this bespoke course will help professionals and organizations re-visit these issues and polish the skills necessary to build strong, long-lasting relationships.
