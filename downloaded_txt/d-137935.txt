" .... there is no future for the community
that does not honor it's past .... to have
the incentive to go forward, it is necessary
to know what lies behind. out of the past
the present has come: and out of the present
the future will arise."

      welcome to the sumter county genealogy site,
      a part of the gagenweb project. my name is
      robert evans and i, along with alan anderson,
      began this site as a source of information 
      for all those with connections to sumter 
      county, georgia. now, alan anderson is coordinator
      and tbass is the webmaster for this website. this 
      site, as well as, the gagenweb, usgenweb 
      and worldgenweb projects are non-profit and 
      live and grow only with the support and 
      contribution of time and effort on the part 
      of interested individuals. if you are one of 
      those individuals willing to help make this 
      one of the premier sites of the genweb
