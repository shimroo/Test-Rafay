tutoring with certified professionals in language development
your child deserves the a tutor that studies and practices the craft of assisting in language development, reading comprehension and writing composition. 
all of our tutors are certified speech language pathologist assistants who serve our clients locally at our award winning speech therapy clinic in dallas texas. each of them has a bachelors degree in communication sciences and maintains a license in the state of texas under the direct supervision of a master level speech language pathologist.
while we are not seeing clients in the office, we are offering our services as reading tutors and language development coaches nationwide through our online platform.
too many tutors are smart high-school or college students just trying to get by. your child deserves a licensed professional who has dedicated their career to speech and language development.
if you want your child to make goal directed progress in reading and language, you have come to the right place. give us a call today to set up a free consultation.
