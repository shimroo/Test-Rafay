our journey to better bread
 
 
at bread factory, we are dedicated to crafting exceptional bread. we’ve recently enhanced our classic baguettes, potato and rosemary sourdough, and focaccia to better reflect our commitment to more nutritious, flavourful, and sustainable bread. our passion for traditional methods and ingredients remains strong, but we believe that excellent baking also involves continual learning, evolution, and improvement.
our updated recipes feature a broader range of grains such as emmer, spelt, barley, and rye, increasing the fibre content. by sourcing ingredients from healthy, regenerative farms, we support biodiversity and farmers who are nurturing the soil.
this is bread factory’s better bread – more nutritious, more delicious, and more sustainable.
