in case you haven't noticed, your occasional clicks on brave-o-matic have yielded precious little content of late.  some combination of poor play by our trusty charges, coupled with the ravages of the dog days of august among your faithful correspondents, has rendered us mute and fairly disinterested in learning to speak anew.  so we're closing up shop for a while.  it's been a blast seeing our nonsensical scribblings being read everywhere from keokuk to korea, and gratifying to get feedback from braves fans from all corners of the globe.  we might crank it up again one day, so keep us in mind.  thanks to everyone who read and wrote.  with deep regrets, we remain,brave-o-maticp.s.  go braves!

funny, i don't remember turner south broadcasts having the kind of technical difficulties we witnessed tonight before fox bought the network.  this isn't the first time either -- why, it's enough for a person to think they're running this operation on the cheap.  just another example of profit over product?fyi, adam laroche is now 12th in the nl in slugging percentage.  anyone out there still want to trade him?brave-o-matic is heading to the beach, so our sporadic posting schedule will be even more truncated than is usual.  however, brave-o-matic select subscribers are in luck!  you'll be able to watch the debut of our webcam series "brave-o-matic bocces..."  first episode:  amelia island!

just like that, the mets (featuring the amazing beltran) slammed the door shut on any meager playoff hopes we might have had, and exposed our greatest weakness for all to see.  our starting rotation is the worst in the league right now, just getting hammered day after day.  no end in sight, no help on the way -- it's so bad that we might be looking at a new era of mediocrity.  all the money we've sunk into hampton and hudson, smoltz will be 40 next year, two rookies who we insist have promise but who haven't delievered (james, davies).  and horacio, always horacio.js has one more day to see what parts we can assemble for spring training 2007.  in descending order of likelihood, here are some of the prime candidates to be traded:1) wickman -- hey, you know how it is when it comes time to tighten the belts.  last to arrive, first to leave.  proven bullpen arms are always being shopped this time of year, so let's flip the wick.  possible destinations:  boston, anaheim.2) baez -- see above.  possible destinations:  anaheim, arizona.3) renteria -- having a great year, he's also a 30-year-old ss whose trade value will never be higher.  possible destinations:  colorado, minnesota.4) hudson -- he's the kind of guy that tends to move this time of year, but he's been so horrible that it's hard to see who would want him.  still, considering his history of success, someone might take a flyer.  possible destinations:  texas, st. louis.5) giles -- betemit's departure means it's far less likely giles will be moved before the offseason, so we'd need a functional 2b in return.  possible destination:  anaheim.

                      	 dirty sanchez  (marlins 2, braves 1)
	                       
                          

once again we fell victim to a rookie starter, as anibal sanchez baffled the batsmen for seven innings.  our only run came in the sixth when giles singled in langerhans, who had a heckuva game, getting two hits (his first since the all-star break) and making two highlight reel catches -- he must have read my comment on yesterday's game.  cody ross accounted for the fish offense, hitting two solo hrs off chuck james, who pitched very well otherwise.  so it's a bump in the road.  we'll have to get a win tomorrow to give ourselves a chance at our seventh consecutive series victory.  smoltz vs. josh johnson -- if the bats tonight were any indication, it could be a quick game.

                      	 bob wickman
	                       
                          

we've waited for scheurholz to make a move to shore up the bullpen, and considering what's available out there, this was about as good as he could do without giving up the store a la the reds.  wickman has the proven closer label, but more importantly can draw on a simple history of success at the major league level that's completely absent from the remainder of the bullpen.there are definite signs that he's not what he once was, though.  wickman's baseball reference page shows an aging pitcher who was league-average in 2003-4 before enjoying a renaissance last season.  however, he's no longer the pitcher who would routinely strike out a man per inning, and he got a little lucky last year -- anyone who gives up 9 hr in 62 innings and ks about 6 per 9 ip is fortunate to only give up 17 total runs.so far this year he's kept the ball in the park, which he'll have to continue doing.  i'd still like to see us import linebrink or williamson, but if we don't take a couple from the phillies this weekend it may not matter much.  the recent hot streak accentuated the hole that we've dug for ourselves -- we're still behind the same teams, and losing 4 of 5 will put us right back where we started.anyway, we welcome any contributions that wickman can make.  i have a suggestion for his entrance music -- what about "fat man" by jethro tull?  fear the flute!

...who sounds surprised that 1) marquis didn't cover third on a single to right, and 2) he made a stupid first pitch to renteria, busting him up and in with the bases loaded:  jason marquis is a hothead and a me-first player.  always has been, always will be.  now let the slaughter continue....
