leading manufacturer of burn off ovens & cleaning furnaces

the history of burn off, also known as burn out, ovens are the history of pollution control products co.  the company’s founder, peyton simpson, designed the first "pyrolysis" cleaning oven to help manufacturers comply with the clean air act of 1970. pcpc’s burn off oven and its patented controlled pyrolysis® process cleans parts by using heat to decompose organic material into vapors and pyrolysis gases. 
these gases (smoke) are then drawn through an afterburner where harmful emissions and contaminates are burned and completely eliminated before being discharged out the exhaust stack. first used by electric motor rebuilders, pcpc quickly adapted their burn off ovens for use by automotive engine and parts rebuilders, paint and powder coaters, oil and gas producers, and plastics, fiber and chemical manufacturers. 
today pollution control "burn-off" process ovens cover the entire field of thermal cleaning and parts reclamation with more than 8,000 installations in 45 countries around the world. 
recognized as the industry leader in burn off oven manufacturing, they are in use in over 800 industrial classifications, including branches of the u.s. military. contact a burn-off ovens manufacturer, like pcpc, today!
