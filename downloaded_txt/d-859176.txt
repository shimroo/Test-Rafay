				vance delivers a historic defense of free speech in europe			



			february 15, 2025		

			no comments		

if you haven’t listened to jd vance’s blistering 19 minute talk to the european union, it is certainly worth a listen. see the youtube of his talk below.
jonathan turley, one of the most respected reporters and commentators today, wrote a brilliant review of vance’s lecture. his review is a must-read as well. he explains how vance hit the eu right where they needed it. turley wrote,
“in perhaps the greatest single declaration uttered by an american leader since john f. kennedy in germany declared “ich bin ein berliner,” he added: “if you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing america can do for you. nor, for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the american people that elected me and elected president trump.”
you can read turley’s brilliant article here:

				the borders of usa and the walls around the vatican			



			february 12, 2025		

			no comments		

the walls are imposing and impenetrable. the bricks rise to the sky around the 2.5-mile perimeter. swiss guards in their colorful uniforms stand at the entrances. the vatican is the headquarters of my roman catholic church—and i say “my church” because i converted to catholicism and consider it mine.
i cannot tell you how many times i have run around the walls of the vatican early in the morning, in the heat of the day, or in the cool of the evening. i always deviate off the sidewalk to enter st. peter’s square, which is open to the public.
(you can watch my walk around the walls of the vatican in october here on youtube)
i cross myself and bow to jesus, and acknowledge sts. peter and paul and the 140 saints atop the colonnades reaching out as arms to welcome us.
yes the colonnades warmly welcome us into the arms of mother church. but try to enter the vatican at one of the eight entrances into this tiny nation and see what happens.
no one enters without special permission and without the proper paperwork. you will not find immigrants lined up at the entrances or climbing the walls.
the vatican has strict newly implemented laws about entering the vatican. according to the catholic news agency,
in a decree issued last month by the holy see, the monetary sanctions and prison sentences for those who violate the strict security regulations of vatican city have been considerably increased.
the document, signed by cardinal fernando vérguez alzaga, president of the pontifical commission for vatican city state, provides for monetary fines ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 euros (about $10,200 to $25,700) and prison sentences ranging from one to four years.
these fines will apply especially to those who enter by means of violence, threats, or deception, bypassing border controls or security systems.
the pope just sent a letter to the us bishops challenging our attempt to restrict illegal entry into the united states. he substantially called on our bishops to continue our current policy under biden immigration, in effect, resisting our president.
immigration should be legal and our country is very generous and always has been. i find myself is agreement with jd vance who seems to understand the situation better than a lot of sheltered and seemingly misinformed clerics.
we are spending untold millions to house illegal immigrants while our own people are neglected (e.g., recent hurricane victims). why are our citizen ignored while illegals are housed in posh hotels across the country.
josh mercer, vp of catholicvote wrote,

those closest to the pope have failed to give him the full picture of the humanitarian crisis we have experienced this last four years. biden’s border policies were a boon to mexican cartels, who made $30 million a day smuggling drugs and people across our southern border.
this reckless open border policy allowed migrant women and children to be exploited. when trump took office there were 300,000 migrant children who were missing.
american catholics have compassion for the plight of people in other countries and have long shown incredible generosity to other countries. but we don’t understand why our already-generous immigration laws are not respected.

the vatican is protected by impenetrable walls and strict laws and penalties, yet they expect us to open our borders to anyone that wants to enter? why the double standard?
babies are not allowed to be born inside the vatican walls which would give them citizenship—they must be taken outside to hospitals in rome for birth.
we cannot insist on legal processes for immigration? we should not take care of our own disadvantaged and needy first?
we all want to care for the poor and needy. that is what we as americans have always done. but we want it implemented in a legal and orderly manner.

                    a good quote from the catholic thing about those who claim to be "spiritual but not religious".

"our longing for the supernatural is also grounded in human nature: we are hardwired to seek things higher than ourselves, and to bend our knees in worship of them. religion guides…
