hivdent's mission
 hivdent is a not-for-profit coalition of 
           concerned health care professionals 
           committed to assuring access to high quality 
           oral health care services for adults, 
           adolescents, and children living with hiv 
           disease. hivdent disseminates 
           state-of-the-art treatment information and 
           shares expertise in advocacy, development, 
           training, integration, and evaluation of 
           oral health services for the hiv-infected 
           population.
 the primary 
           mechanism by which hivdent initially intends to 
           accomplish its mission is via this web site. inside, not 
           only will you find several sections on the oral 
           manifestations of hiv disease and a large picture 
           gallery, but information on infection control, 
           post-exposure protocols, pediatric/adolescent care, 
           medications, funding and other resources.
 through an easily accessible e-mail 
           system, health care professionals and consumers alike are able to communicate 
           directly with our faculty, some of the 
           foremost international experts in these fields.
