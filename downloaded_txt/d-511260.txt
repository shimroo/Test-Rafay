the inspiration 



							in 1990, past usga president, sandy tatum and one-time pga tour professional, george kelley founded the stocker cup in honor of their dear friend and preserve golf club visionary, peter c. stocker.  the principal aim was to create an event that honored the man and the game he loved by combining two great joys of his life – golf, and the spirit of fellowship engendered through competition. 







 




















the championship 





the stocker cup is a 54-hole, individual stoke play, mid-amateur invitational.  this field is comprised of nationally and regionally accomplished competitive golfers. in a concurrent event, each is paired with a net partner in a 54-hole, 2-man better-ball competition vying for the tatum trophy – a structure similar to the at&t national pro-am, held on the nearby monterey península.
