                        tales of witchcraft & wonder - the book! 
                        
 
 
‘one of our land’s most individual and interesting gothic folk-rock bands now proves that it can deal as 
effectively with prose as music, in a mixture of stories old and new, of horror, beauty and romance, that 
capture perfectly the magical and mystical heritage of one of england’s most remarkable counties.’ 
 professor ronald hutton 
 
a woman falls under the spell of a poisonous plant. 
a young man discovers a mermaid, washed up on the shore. 
a mysterious body is discovered hidden in the trunk of a tree. 
an orphaned ape is raised as a child in a cotswold village. 
an old man’s body is discovered on a hill, mysteriously 
pinned to the ground as though believed a witch. 
these are some of the folkloric tales told in the songs of inkubus sukkubus in their trilogy of albums, 
tales of witchcraft & wonder. in this book, founder members and songwriters 
candia and tony mckormack further research the stories, to explore the meaning behind the tales – the theories, the magic, 
the romance, and the horror.
