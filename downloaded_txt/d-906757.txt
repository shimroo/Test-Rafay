creating beautiful architecture that respects our natural resources



ewers architecture is a small firm in downtown golden, colorado practicing sustainable commercial and residential architecture.  we value community, relationships with our clients, consultants and contractors, extensive collaboration with all stakeholders, and having fun in what we do every day.







































sustainable



since 1998 our focus on sustainability has not changed.  ewers architecture is a leader in sustainable design, with all-electric and net zero energy projects, high levels of insulation, tight exterior envelopes, natural and recycled materials, and passive solar strategies as our standard operating procedure.

commercial 



ewers architecture has designed a wide variety of commercial projects, from office remodels to new school campuses, restaurants to manufacturing facilities, retail to religious.  our clients include family businesses, non-profits, local and state agencies, and the federal government.




    commercial projects
  


























residential 



our goal for every residential client is the same – ensure that we are designing a home that will look, feel, and live like the client desires.  that is why our homes do not have a single style.  our designs reflect the desire and style of our clients.  what they do have in common is that they are always sustainable, comfortable, and beautiful.




    residential projects
  


























our process



at ewers architecture, our processes have been developed over more than 25 years.  good design is a process, and the methods that we employ are born of the architecture traditions of the past, the technology tools of the present, and adding our own flare for the future.
