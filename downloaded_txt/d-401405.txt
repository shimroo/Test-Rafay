about me





alexis  treese


alexis: wife and stay at home mom. major procrastinator. afraid of my phone. love creating things. finally enjoying my domestic life (after fighting it for so long). and i could disappear in a book.
casey: full of love and light. enjoys his multiple ever evolving hobbies. cuts wood. super funny. enjoys naps (barf) can make ginger laugh way better than i can. watches the most boring shows on television. 
ginger: happy baby. eat, sleeps, poos terrifically, has a great set of lungs, fake coughs so you will say "bless you ginger!" so i guess she loves being blessed. turns into a pumpkin if she doesn't get her nap. selfish with her kisses. does not comprehend that moses is just not that into her.
moses: 4lb chihuahua. lies about having to go potty. sits on your shoulder when you drive (think parrot). codependent. sits on the tub when i shower. chases the vacuum.
