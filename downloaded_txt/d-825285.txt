county highpoint trip reports


 as of january 2015 there are just over 7,800 county highpoint trip reports, several dozen for 
 national park highpoints
 and a small number for national monuments. 
 additional reports are available by linking to external websites.
 some of these reports are available only by special request from the webmaster. 

 to view county highpoint reports click on relevant state(s) from the following map. 
 some reports may no longer be valid. hence for a given county they should be reviewed in reverse 
 chronological order. other reports provide little substantive information, yet are retained after a
 community-wide discussion for their potential historical and/or entertainment value. the reader determines
 which reports are of value for his specific goals - not the webmaster. hence all reports are presented.
