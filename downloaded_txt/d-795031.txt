traveling to visit friends or relatives
one day while visiting texas on one of my many trips, i was having dinner with a friend of mine that own’s san antonio windshield repair and he came to the conclusion that there are risk factors that people traveling to visit friends or relatives abroad are exposed to. some of these individuals travel to places with higher risks of some diseases and stay there longer. they also eat the local food and drink water that may not be treated. unfortunately, some people travel to visit friends or relatives without seeking pre-travel advice or getting adequate vaccinations.
seek medical advice 
before you travel to visit friends or relatives, it’s important that you seek medical advice. it’s unfortunate that many people travel to visit relatives in foreign countries without doing this. this implies that they are not aware of the health risks that they face while away from home. others have a different perception of the risks that they face whenever they travel to visit their relatives. 
it’s however imperative that you always talk to your doctor about your travel plan before you leave your home. essentially, see your healthcare provider at least six weeks in advance. your doctor will give you advice on how to reduce the risk of injury and sickness when you travel. 
discuss your immunization history with the doctor 
if you are traveling as a family, discuss the history of immunization of every family member that you will be traveling with. let your doctor know when each family member was immunized last including children. it’s recommended that you have up-to-date routine vaccines when traveling. as such, your doctor will determine whether any family member needs vaccination before you travel. 
your travel destination will determine the necessary vaccines to have before the trip. some older travelers and children are immune-compromised. that means they are at a higher risk of developing diseases. therefore, your healthcare provider will provide personalized medical care to ensure their protection. 
conduct some research 
take time to conduct some research of your travel destination. find out whether there is a risk of specific diseases at your location. you can ask the relatives that you are visiting about this. this will enable you to reduce the risk of contracting the diseases when you travel. also find out about the security and political situation in your destination before you travel. this will ensure your safety during the trip.  
additionally, carry enough cash and items that you will need while away from home. and, don’t forget to buy gifts for your relatives.

risks of traveling during the pandemic
many health experts warn travelers with no immunization to avoid traveling. that’s because the activity increases their risk for covid-19 and severe illness if they get the virus. what’s more, the infection rate at different travel destinations can hinder even those fully immunized from traveling. ideally, a small portion of the fully vaccinated people can still get covid-19 after exposure to this virus. nevertheless, these people are unlikely to die to get severely sick.
