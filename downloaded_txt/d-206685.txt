soy and butter glazed king oyster mushrooms





 when we went to the swelaps market i picked up these king oyster mushrooms because they looked super cool.that night i sliced them and cooked them and then simmered them in a buttery, soy saucy, garlicky sauce based on this delicious recipe. once they were done, we tried them and were ready to go buy some more mushrooms to make this again - even the boy tried on and sort of liked it!  and he is a mushroom hater.i still haven't gotten my hands on enoki mushrooms yet, but i'm keeping my eyes open.

in the bin - 1





 hello, and welcome to episode 1 of in the bin, where i share with you any and all assorted products i've used up and let you know very briefly what i thought of them.first up we have this fenty lotion.  i liked the smell and it worked quite well on my old tired skin.next is this toner, which is the first toner i have used in a long time that i felt maybe possibly was working.both gets a thumbs up.next are these hair, skin and nail vitamins that i don't think helped me one but but didn't hurt either and they were tasty.sideways thumb.next is this very nice face lotion.  rich and greasy in a good way.  thumbs up. lastly today are these towelettes for your face after a workout.  these got dried out which is my fault and not burt's fault, but once i dampened them, they were fine.  i am now trying to stay away from products like these and instead just use a washcloth or my hands, but i bought them and used them.sideways thumb. thank you for joining me for episode 1 of in the bin

kimchi cucumber salad





 this was one of the first things we made in the new year and what a way to start it off.  it was so delicious and not too spicy - even the grandpa and the kids all tried it and liked it to varying degrees.  i used this recipe and played around with it a bit.  super good.
