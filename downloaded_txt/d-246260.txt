honoring judy lichtman’s 50 years of service
the lichtman legacy fund will establish a general fund that can be used to support projects that honor judy’s visionary spirit, strategic wisdom, legal expertise, coalition building, and unwavering commitment to equal opportunity and equal justice under the law.
the fund will support, among other initiatives, the creation of the judith lichtman fellowship, a 12-month position for a recent law graduate to work at the national partnership as a policy counsel, which is consistent with judy’s longstanding efforts to mentor countless young women and launch them into fields such as law, policy, and social activism.
