  the resource to the sickle cell disease patient. we hope you find this website instructive. keep checking back here for updated information. sign up to our facebook page or my twitter account to stay in contact.

the patient: while there is a lot of information published on sickle cell disease, there is comparatively less on the person with this hereditary affliction. this web site aims to correct the anomaly and be as complete a resource to the sickle cell disease patient as possible. 


      the kanad in sickle cell genetic counselling


    interview with professor fid konotey-ahulu

the author: this web site is developed by professor f.i.d. konotey-ahulu, an acknowledged expert in his field. read what others have to say about him and his 643-page magnum opus, 'the sickle cell disease patient' 

publications: dr konotey-ahulu's own observations on, and assessment of the sickle cell disease  patient, have been published extensively in the international medical press. some of the publications are discoveries (as for example the numb lower lip sign of sickle cell crisis published in the lancet in 1972). these publications also give credit to pioneers and foundation layers in the field of haemoglobinopathy on both sides of the atlantic, notably professor roland scott of howard university, washington dc and professor hermann lehmann of cambridge university uk, and the hungarian professor bela ringelhann with whom dr konotey-ahulu had a very close working relationship. 

matters of faith: people are not just a bundle of anatomy, physiology, pathology. each of us humans is the embodiment of many things that cannot be quantified by science. at least one of the publications of professor konotey-ahulu describes two fellows of the prestigious british royal society who used for their well known textbooks in genetics information that he (konotey-ahulu) had published in the british medical journal. in that journal professor konotey-ahulu told an important story to make a vital ethical point about a genetic defect of his. while one of the fellows of the royal society (oxford universityâs professor sir david weatherall frs md frcp) mentioned konotey-ahuluâs story to stress how important ethics was/is in genetics, the other eminent scientist, also fellow of the royal society, used the story without once mentioning ethics in his book, nor the source of the story. ethics meant a lot to the one scientist, but little to the other. aware of the needs (ethical and otherwise) of many of his patients, professor konotey-ahulu has included a section in his website that he calls matters of faith where some of his published articles on ethics and faith can be read.  his millennium hymn âtime was createdâ too can be heard and sung here: http://bit.ly/crrz0s
