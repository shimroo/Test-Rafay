peanut-butter 'n' bacon sandwiches (1974) from mccall's family-style cook book





happy national peanut butter day! you'd think a peanut butter and bacon sandwich would be pretty straightforward. but the folks at mccall's clearly take their sandwiches very seriously.
"the lunch you carry can, and should, be as appealing and satisfying as the lunch you eat at home. and if you pack a lunch for a school child, a calorie-conscious teenager, an office worker, or a husband with a man-size job and a man-size appetite, you'll find our menus and recipes not only nutritious, but highlighted with those little extras that children and grown-ups appreciate. so go ahead — prove that ... you can take it with you ..." 

here's a recipe and menu from 'mccall's family-style cook book' (1974). click picture for full-size image. — dan taylor

sour cream pancakes from mccall's home-baked breads (1974)





when ryan was little, we always made pancakes on snow days. with winter storm blair headed our way, i thought it would be a good time to pull out a pancake recipe in case school is closed tomorrow. bonus points for the use of sour cream! from 'mccall's home-baked breads' (1974).

roast pork shoulder from mccall's book of marvelous meats (1974)





my mom always made pork for new year's day. sometimes we'd also go visit my aunt who lived in the bridesburg section of philly and she would also have fresh ham (pork), kraut, and fresh kielbasa. as i remember it, her row home had a teeny tiny kitchen, and i always marveled at how she made such a feast in such a small space.
my mom would never debone a pork shoulder like this recipe suggests, but i remember her prep was simple and the result was delicious. one time my brother-in-law walked in to find several of us hunched over the finished shoulder, breaking off pieces of the crisp skin with a glistening layer of fat underneath, and exclaimed "how are you all not 300 pounds?!"

happy new year! (click image for full-size picture)

review: aldi fremont fish market dynamite shrimp





not to be confused with their boom boom shrimp, the fremont fish market dynamite shrimp is aldi’s latest frozen appetizer aimed at fans of bonefish grill’s bang bang shrimp. like me. when we had a bg near us, bang bang shrimp was my favorite dish—a heaping helping of crispy fried shrimp tossed in a creamy sauce with a kick. unfortunately, the dish is tougher to replicate at home that you’d think. believe me, i’ve tried. so, when these appeared in our freezer case, they were a must buy—especially with a thursday night eagles game screaming for apps and cheesesteaks. i followed the directions for conventional oven cooking but after the specified time the shrimp looked anemic and not golden brown (not to mention undercooked), so i left them in a little longer. meanwhile, i warmed up the sauce packets in some water and waited for the magic to happen. when i removed the cooked shrimp from the oven it became clear disaster awaited. even the slightest movement caused the coating to slide off the shrimp, and once tossed with the sauce we had a bowl of slightly coated shrimp and slightly coated shrimp coating. too bad, since the sauce was tasty, even if it wasn’t anything like bonefish grill’s signature sauce. the box also includes air fryer instructions, but did not specify if that preparation was recommended over conventional oven prep. if i was to get these again (and that’s a big if), i’d go the air fryer route. personally, i think the boom boom shrimp are much closer to the big chain fave and will be on the lookout for them in the coming months. — dan taylordan taylor is the editor/publisher of the hungover gourmet and is still accepting contributions for issue #13 (due out in spring 2025). visit hungovergourmet.com or email editor@hungovergourmet.com for more info.#aldi #frozenfood #appetizers #review #foodie #hungovergourmet
