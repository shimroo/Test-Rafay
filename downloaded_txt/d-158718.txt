a message from the superintendent of schoolsfebruary 12, 2025

dear wcsd community,
at monday night’s board of education meeting, i shared the superintendent's preliminary budget presentation, as well as a facilities needs assessment which provides the rationale for a potential capital improvement project.  i encourage the community to watch this video of the presentations and subsequent discussion, and to share your comments and suggestions with us at wcsd.comments@wcsdny.org.
our theme this year will be “building our future together.”  it is with this in mind that you can expect to receive communications throughout this year's budget process to ensure that you have all the relevant information to help us build that future together.  
please see our budget page for more details, and thank you for partnering with us in this important work!

sincerely,
dr. dwight bonksuperintendent of schools
