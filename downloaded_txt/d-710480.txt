architecture after the internet

                                    in this research we explore and frame the implications of architecting space and society through digital technologies. from decentralised technologies to civic platforms, architecture after the internet explores these shifts through a series of publications, events and projects.
                                









cities and people

                                    the project investigates the future impact of the new technologies upon the european urbanities. developing concepts like smart city or smart community, the research seeks to reveal the future social and cultural mutations that tend to better valorize individuals and communities together with their human, creative and entrepreneurial potential.
