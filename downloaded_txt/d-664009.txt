welcome to my website

i live on the island of newfoundland in the north atlantic, a largely untamed place where it’s still possible to believe the world is filled with magic.books are not only a comfort and a refuge, they can change the way we feel and think.







“janet mcnaughton [is] one of canada’s finest living writers, for kids or adults.”

— john burns, the georgia straight

once again available in printthe secret under my skin is once again available in print, though on demand printing at harpercollins warehouses. i hope this will help the many teachers who have been struggling with mismatched editions, or copies that are falling apart. the books may be ordered in canada via hcorder@harpercollins.com and in the usa via orders@harpercollins.comin solidarity with ukraine. world central kitchen is a charity working in ukraine and neighouring countries to bring food and comfort to displaced and returning people.  with the help of volunteers and with partner restaurants and cafes on the ground, wck has now delivered 175 million meals, including grocery packages delivered to places in ukraine where people can no longer purchase food. when russia blocked neighouring moldova from shipping out perishable crops, wck bought 20 tons of apples from moldova to distribute to people in ukraine. winter is coming and many parts of ukraine have no power for heat or cooking.  if you can spare some money, please consider making a donation. you can also donate through the paypal giving fund.
