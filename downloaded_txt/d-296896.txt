radar

now, next, and beyond: tracking need-to-know trends at the intersection of business and technology






areas weâre focusing on:


ai/ml
few technologies have the potential to change the nature of work and how we live as artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning (ml).


future of the firm
everything from new organizational structures and payment schemes to new expectations, skills, and tools will shape the future of the firm.


innovation & disruption
stay on top of the emerging tools, trends, issues, and context necessary for making informed decisions about business and technology.


next architecture
see how companies are using the cloud and next-generation architectures to keep up with changing markets and anticipate customer needs.


next economy
weâre charting a course from todayâs tech-driven economy to a ânextâ economy that strikes a better balance between people and automation.
