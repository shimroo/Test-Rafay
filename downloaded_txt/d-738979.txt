                                        there is normally only one chance to appeal so it is important to identify all of the issues that could be appealed, and determine which issues  should be appealed.
                                    

                                        the rules for filing an appeal are very specific, and if not followed exactly can result in a valid appeal being dismissed or denied. if you have a case decision that you would like to discuss appealing, please contact gause & hargrove immediately as the time for filing an appeal is very short.

                                        gause & hargrove has successfully represented numerous clients in administrative legal issues, and looks forward to discussing your administrative legal matter.

                                        gause & hargrove has much experience representing clients in land use matters. land use matters can involve issues such as development permits, variance requests, and zoning issues to name a few. land use matters normally stem from a client wanting to make use of their own land, or fighting an intended land use of property that someone else owns.
                                    

                                        land use matters can become complicated and involve much unneeded expense if not addressed properly from the beginning.  therefore, it is important for clients to obtain legal advice and guidance early in a land use matter. it is just as important to seek legal advice and guidance early in a fight against a proposed land use. numerous rights can be waived if a land use issue is not addressed in a timely manner.
                                    

                                        gause & hargorve makes every attempt to resolve a land use issue before any legal action is taken. however, sometimes clients have no other choice than to pursue legal action to enforce their rights in a land use matter. contact gause & hargrove to discuss your land use matter today.

                                    everyone needs a will, and many people believe that these are very simple documents. however, a will is a legal document that tells the world how you want your assets distributed, who should care for your minor children, if you have any, and who will oversee carrying out your wishes. while this is just a basic description of what a will is for, this is not a document that you should entrust to a fill-in-the-blank form. every state has differing laws that apply to determine if a will is valid. these laws can frequently change as well. if you filled out a will from a form, you may be leaving your family in quite a quandry. contact gause & hargrove to schedule a consult with one of our attorneys to assist you with preparing a proper will and estate documents in florida.
                                








what is the process for an eviction?





                                    unfortunately, life comes with some bumps in the road. if one of those bumps includes eviction issues, the resolution may not always seem so simple. landlords and tenants alike have certain responsibilities during the eviction process. for those that want to represent themselves*, it is possible; however, it is always best to consult an attorney about your legal rights and responsibilities in your particular case.  contact ghlaw to assist you with your eviction process today.  
									 if you decide to represent yourself, you should be familiar with chapter 83 of the florida statutes. if the eviction involves a personal residence, you should read part ii - residential tenancies. the florida bar website is a great resource for information and forms. the landlord and tenant forms have been approved by the florida supreme court. however, because the law is continually changing, there is no guarantee that these forms comport with current law. these forms are not a substitute for the advice of an attorney.
*corporate entities including limited liability companies (llcs), must be represented by a lawyer in order to file documents in court and/or appear in court. they may not be represented by a non-lawyer, employees, or agents. the only exception is that a property manager who has written authorization from the landlord may handle an eviction on the landlordâs behalf. that exception only applies if 1) the eviction is for failure to pay rent and 2) the eviction is uncontested. if the eviction is considered contested, the property managerâs authorization to act on behalf of the landlord ends when a hearing is required.
