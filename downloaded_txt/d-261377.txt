eminent domain
when the north carolina department of transportation (ncdot) or another government entity initiates eminent domain proceedings, they often employ an appraiser to determine property value and make an offer. however, property owners contemplating hiring a private appraiser to counter that offer may not realize all of the complexities involved. negotiating with government entities differs significantly from negotiating with private property owners. to ensure optimal value for your land, engaging the right attorney and appraiser in order to obtain the appropriate type of appraisal is crucial, especially one tailored for eminent domain perspectives. without an accurate understanding of your property’s true value, assessing whether you’re receiving a fair offer becomes challenging.

ingram and company, a leading real estate valuation and consultancy firm in southeastern north carolina, specializes in eminent domain cases. beyond appraisers, our professional network encompasses land planners, civil engineers, real estate agents, surveyors, and environmentalists, each offering insights into your property’s unique attributes that contribute to its value.

distinguishing between general appraisals and eminent domain appraisals is vital. while general appraisals may overlook critical factors such as zoning, environmental concerns, traffic patterns, and engineering aspects, eminent domain appraisals delve into the details. they consider the property’s highest and best use, accounting for its potential value under different development scenarios, essential for negotiating fair compensation. furthermore, eminent domain appraisals assess damages to the remaining land post-taking, ensuring just compensation for any decrease in value. given the complexity of this process, selecting the right appraiser is paramount. ingram and company ensures impartiality and expertise in our appraisers, who are adept at courtroom testimony, essential if your case proceeds to trial.

in choosing your valuation professional, opting for a team that specializes in eminent domain is prudent. our firm’s extensive experience in this field ensures a comprehensive understanding of appraisal intricacies and potential oversights. we maintain professional relationships with various experts, facilitating a credible and fair determination of your property’s value. ultimately, navigating eminent domain proceedings requires a dedicated team with specialized knowledge and a track record of success. with ingram and company, property owners can trust in our commitment to deriving fair market value.
