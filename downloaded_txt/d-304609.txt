 cash rich uber technologies inc., whose stocks skyrocketed 43% last month after it reported unrestricted cash of us$10 billion to see it through the covid-19 pandemic unharmed, has turned to crowdfunding to ostensibly support its drivers in india. uber announced the launch of the uber care driver fund last week with a seed grant of inr 25 crore (approx. us$ 3 million). the company announced that it is seeking an additional inr 25 crore from other sources, and included a link to donate via a prominent indian crowdsourcing website, milaap.

coca-cola credits indian campaigns for companys water vision

              posted: december 30, 2019
 the coca-cola company has officially credited its new-found zeal on water conservation to the local, community-led campaigns in india that have successfully challenged the companys atrocious mismanagement of water. but much of coca-cola's claims on water management come from their public relations department, and a reality check on the ground reveals an ineffective water management plan.  if coca-cola were really serious about having learnt lessons from indian campaigns, it could start by ceasing bottling operations in water stressed areas of india, including bottling operations of their franchisees.

              posted: may 15, 2019
 there is a lot of hype around uber and lyft as they go public on wall street but these companies contribute to more problems than they solve, and are the target of protests globally.  after destroying the taxi industry, they pay poverty wages, misclassify their drivers as contractors, increase congestion on our streets, aim to privatize public transportation, contribute to increased pollution and climate change  just to name a few.  it is only a matter of time before rideshare companies are regulated more  around the world  to protect society from the negative externalities of the rideshare business.

 international life sciences institute (ilsi) is a front organization for food, beverage and agrichemical industries, and was founded by coca-cola.  a recent study has found that ilsi has undermined chinas public health policies on obesity by networking with nutrition scientists to nudge government policy into alignment with the companys corporate interests.  alarmingly, ilsi is also active in india, and key indian functionaries who sit on ilsis board also occupy central roles in indias primary food regulator, the food safety and standards authority of india (fssai).

the food safety and standards authority of india (fssai)  the countrys premier government organization responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety  announced yesterday that it has entered into a partnership with coca-cola india to provide training to vendors in order to ensure safe and nutritious food for all. fssais partnership is misguided and antithetical to the food regulators mission, and must be scrapped. fssai should not enter into partnerships with entities it is supposed to regulate because it ensures conflicts of interest.

in a major development, an indian high court has ordered that water from the river tamirabarani in the south indian state of tamil nadu must not be diverted to coca-cola and pepsi producing plants in gangaikondan due to the severe water shortages in the area. the court order came as the result of a public interest litigation filed by fedcot, a statewide consumer organization, which had sought to stop the use of river water for production of coca-cola and pepsi product because water scarcity has diminished both drinking water as well as water for irrigation in the area.

the coca-cola company has stopped production at its controversial bottling plant in kala dera in jaipur, and has no plans to resume operations. groundwater levels have plummeted ever since coca-cola began operations in 2000, and the increased difficulty in accessing groundwater from the depleted aquifer is one of the main reasons for the plants closure.

the india resource center welcomes new guidelines by the government of india which strengthen regulations governing use of groundwater by industries in india.  the new guidelines are significant because they will apply to industries using groundwater regardless of when the industry was established.  the latest guidelines could put an end to the excessive and destructive groundwater usage by industries that were grandfathered in under the last guidelines.

india resource center
              posted: august 25, 2015
as campaigners that have closely scrutinized coca-colas operations in india for over a decade, we find coca-colas assertions on balancing water use to be misleading. the companys track record of managing water resources in and around its bottling operations is dismal, and the announcement is a public relations exercise designed to manufacture an image of a company that uses water sustainably  far removed from the reality on the ground.

bowing to public outrage, the state government of tamil nadu in south india has cancelled plans for a new coca-cola bottling plant in perundurai in erode district. the cancellation of the land allotted to coca-cola for a rs. 500 crore (usd 80 million) bottling plant came as the result of an extremely well-coordinated campaign led by farmers and political parties who opposed coca-colas plant because it would worsen the already existing water shortages in the area, and bring more pollution into the area.

pepsicos announcement that the company will invest another $5.5 billion in india by 2020  to manufacture and sell more junk food to indians  does not bode well for the long term public health of the country.  more junk food is not something india can afford, nor should it encourage.  for india, a growing obesity problem is sure to further burden an already overstressed and under-funded public health system in india, as well as adversely impact the quality of life of millions.
