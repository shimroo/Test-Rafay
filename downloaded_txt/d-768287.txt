see recent additions for all the latest titles added to the free sheet music library!
concertina music is proudly brought to you by the  world concertina congress and the united states concertina association; organizations devoted to the promotion and preservation of the chemnitzer concertina and related musical instruments from the bellows-driven, free-reed family.
this site features an extensive library of free sheet music, instruction materials, a collection of nostalgic and historical information, and technical essentials for the chemnitzer musician. you will also find information on chemnitzer concertina clubs, honorary organizations, people associated with the instrument, a brief history of the chemnitzer, a database of select manufacturer records and much more.
all of the arrangements in the sheet music library feature special notation for the chemnitzer concertina. though the music has been arranged for this particular instrument, many professional and amateur musicians who play other musical instruments also enjoy the use of these compositions. visitors find this website a valuable resource for both popular and hard to find polkas, waltzes, obereks, fox trots and other styles of old-time music.
