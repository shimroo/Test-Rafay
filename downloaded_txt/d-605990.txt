what makes me different from other trumpet teachers? 



i have been featured in articles in “the international trumpet guild journal”, “wind player magazine”, and “overture” an american federation of musicians publication. i have been mentioned in over a dozen books written by other trumpet teachers, in trumpet clinics, dissertations, trumpet forums, magazines, trumpet web sites and even you-tube videos posted by other trumpet teachers. learn online trumpet courses, online trumpet lessons at bbtrumpet.in the last 47 years, i have helped thousands of trumpet players of all different levels and abilities from high school, college, comeback players and working professionals like herb alpert. herb had a 12 year layoff before he came to me. herb has released 9 cds and done countless live shows since i gave him trumpet lessons. keith fiala toured with maynard ferguson and has done 3 cds after i gave him trumpet lessons.if you want to hire a trumpet teacher then contact us. 





 




 







there are 4 things that act like mini octave keys for trumpet players. sadly most players use the wrong physical action in the wrong register and it doesn’t work. i can help you with that.the clint ‘pops’ mclaughlin trumpet foundation page has 7400 pages of free trumpet music for you to learn and practice from. view detals

so far i have published: 4188 pages in my books (most of it musical exercises and etudes), 13 hours of instructional video, 6 hours of instructional audio and 5 subliminal tapes.i have had endorsements from over 200 full time trumpet playing professionals and college trumpet professors. including: herb alpert, darryl bayer, eric bolvin, bill churchville, kiku collins, mark curry, keith fiala, mic gillette, george graham, jeff helgesen, david hickman, bill knevitt, roddy lewis, jim manley, rex merriweather, leon merian, flip oakes, jeanne g pocius, matt von rodderick, eddie severn, andrea tofanelli, james r. west and many many more.double tonguing all two or three octave scales or playing a nice double c or higher no longer has to be a challenging task. by following and practicing the tips and tricks of pops mclaughlin’s efficiently designed trumpet courses, you can do all these techniques with relative ease like never before.. a musician never misses a chance to be musical, and in the same way, a student never misses a chance to take advantage of learning opportunities..
