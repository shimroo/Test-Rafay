new jde article type—advancing through innovation
                  




advancing through innovation articles—author guidelinesadea invites authors to submit articles for consideration for a new feature in the journal of dental education: advancing through innovation.in health care education we often pilot new methods for learning and supporting our teams. exploring new approaches to a problem often is based on a limited availability of high-quality evidence. advancing through innovation articles are scholarly insights that are not completed research, yet they meet our standards of originality, clarity of approach, and significance through a rapid peer review process. the goal is to present a problem,
    describe how it was addressed, and discuss the lessons learned from the experience in order to help others replicate, refine, or redirect the approach to similar problems in their local environments.



download the author and submission guidelines — we
        look forward to seeing your submissions.
submit articles for consideration to mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jdentaled. select “advancing through innovation” from the list of article types.
