another place, another time  


you and me, baby.guess where that's from :) anywayssss... it's done! lj has officially pissed me off with their new system and crappy layouts, so i took the initave to create a new blog for myself. i tried blogger at first and was content with that, but then i went and created a new blog with my wordpress account too and even with my reluctance to give blogger up, the better and larger quantity of layouts on wordpress were too enticing to abandon. so here it is, folks:http://meaninglyss.wordpress.com/http://meaninglyss.wordpress.com/http://meaninglyss.wordpress.com/see you there. maybe.tags: lj   
current mood: bored
