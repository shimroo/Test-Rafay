the bandit story

in 1983, mike morey sr. and six employees built the first brush bandit chipper in a small mid-michigan pole barn. today, bandit has 560,000 square feet of manufacturing space, provides products to over 56 countries, and has five diverse product lines consisting of hand-fed and whole tree chippers, stump grinders, horizontal grinders, and arjes slow speed shredders. much has changed since 1983, but bandit’s mission statement and core values endure as the foundation for bandit’s commitment to excellence.
