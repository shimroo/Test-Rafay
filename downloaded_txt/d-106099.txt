bob
lawrences vintage auto racing web ring for
kansas
racing history
established february 15, 1998
 
          this is the
front page of my web ring connecting the various vintage auto racing related
websites that i have constructed.  this web ring is provided to assist you
in touring these websites in somewhat of an organized fashion.  to begin
your tour, click your mouse on the race car logo below and you will be
transported to the front page of the first website in the series.  tour the
pages of that website for as long as you wish before returning to the front
page of that website and then clicking your mouse on the web ring
logo there like the one below that is provided on the front page of each
website in this web ring.  by doing so, you will be transported to the
next website in the web ring.  be sure to click your mouse on the smaller
photos you come to as many of those are thumbnails that lead to still more of
my web pages.  also be sure to sign the guest book at one of the opportunities
provided along the way.  i hope you enjoy your tour as it is my pleasure
to share my passion for the history of this sport with you.
          if you are
the owner of the rights to a photo on this website and you are not credited,
please contact me through the click here button below at right.  i will
either credit the owner or removed the photo, whichever the owner prefers.
