              quotes from great people.





welcome to
              a place of peace and positive thoughts and encouragement, here for you all day, every day,
              where you can have your own
              refuge from the stress and strife of the daily grind.  living life fully is a place where the love of life never
              dies; it's here to lift you back up on those days when life may be bringing you down, to keep your spirit uplifted when
              you feel the need to refresh your perspective, or to help you learn valuable life lessons from people who have been
              where we are and who have cared enough to teach us what they've learned about life and living.
                 

              aligning
              our minds with the most compassionate
              words and
              thoughts we can muster can bring
              connection and a sense of
              peace.  for some,
              it means giving up almost an entire way of life,
              but only this will allow glints of joy to shine through.

this
              passage from the dalai lama summarizes well
              what we hope you can
              get from our site:



              although
              i speak from my own experience, i feel that no one has
              the
              right to impose his or her beliefs on another person.  i
              will not
              propose
              to you that my way is best.  the decision is up to
              you.  if you
              find some
              point which may be suitable for you, then you can carry
              out
              experiments
              for yourself.  if you find that it is of no use,
              then you can discard it.

                you!
what does it mean to live a full life? how do we
                stay happy and content in a world that often seems to be
                throwing more at us than we can handle?  thirty years in
                the making, universal principles
                of living life fully explores different aspects of our
                selves as human beings, aspects that we are able to develop and
                expand when we need to in order to make ourselves more
                comfortable in the world we live in. it explores 57 different
                elements of who we are, from love to mindfulness to adversity to
                prayer, in an effort to help you to figure out just where to
                focus your energy and attention when life is being difficult for
                you.  use the link to the left for the kindle edition, or click
