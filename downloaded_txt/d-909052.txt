wow! it's been over 5 years?! and the blog is still here?! amazing and whoa!

just here for a quick look around. lots has happened since i last posted.

- my father thankfully and finally died october, 2009
- my mother died in november, 2010
- sold casa de clutter west in february, 2011
- moved to floriduh november, 2013
- took over my sister's old home and rechristened it casa de clutter east.

that's the main highlights.

i'll see if i'll do much with this site, if only i can remember how to code!

	 facebook sucks...

    


...major bong water right now!!!! i give up! after 20 minutes of trying to log back on and getting nowhere, i'm going to walk away while cursing them out.anyway, keeping an eye on "all my bad storylines" right now. erica and ryan doing the nasty on a desk!?! eww! from jumping the shark to jumping the cougar, i guess.my father's still in the hospice unit. no calls so far today so no news is good news. the doctor spoke to my nephew over the weekend and she said that it doesn't look good but doesn't know how muc longer he has but i gather it's a matter of days. you're not put in a hospice unit for an extended period of time.

	 beginning of the end?

    


just got an email from my sister. my dad was readmitted to the hospital last night because he was bleeding out again. she said he's a mess. giving that and what he's gone through the past month, i have this feeling that he may not have much longer.to quickly catch my reader(s) up: at the end of august his divorce lawyer didn't show up to a scheduled court appearance. when they finally got a hold of him he said that my father didn't do any of the paperwork needed (again) and with nothing to hand in and my dad being in the hospital, why bother showing up?now, no one was told he was in the hospital and sis, mom, and i all thought it was bull. no one called any of the hospitals in his area to check so i did. yep! he was in one. my sister called the next day to see what was going on. turns out he had been in since the beginning of august, had some sort of a small stroke, three toes on his right foot were so bad (mrsa infection and complications due to type 2 diabetes) that they needed to be amputated, and for some reason, he was bleeding out in his intestines and landed up needing 6 pints via trasfusion. he seemed stable enough to be moved to a rehab place last thursday but the bleeding started again last nite.as i said my gut feeling is that he'll never see home again alive. i'm fine with that in a lot of ways. granted, if he goes soon, it's a landmark major event in my life but giving everything that has happened esp. the events and revelations that have happened over the past 2 years or so, my guess is i'll be okay. lets hope so.

	 when smoke gets in your eyes...

    


today's the 17th anniversary of when i quit smoking! can't believe it's been that long already. for those who don't know, i smoked for a grand total of about 15 years; the last several about 2 packs a day. marlboro was my staple brand but i smoked many others as well. i still head over to the nat sherman's website and droolingly recall smoking several types of cigarettes they put out. to quote jerri blank: "good times."that nite, 17 years ago, it was just before midnite, i was futzing around on my first computer (an ibm ps1. lousy thing! ibm did not know how to do personal computers), and just finished off the last cigarette of the pack. i figured i'd step outside for a moment or two, get some fresh air, and look at the stars before toddling off to bed. (what?! me thinking about going to bed before midnite? yes! amazing, ain't it?)at the time, i didn't have a regular asthma doc nor was i on any decent asthma meds other than occasionally sucking down on primatine mist. not the best stuff to use. anyway, i left it on the nitestand and headed out to the parking  lot of the complex i lived at. after a handful of minutes, my lungs were feeling a bit tight so i headed back in to go get the inhaler. now, from where i was to my bed was only about a minute or less in travel time but by the time i got to my bed i seriously couldn't breathe...at all. my lungs completely seized up on me. i couldn't inhale or exhale...at all. this was very outta the blue for me. my asthmatic attacks were the type that slowly gets worse giving me enough time to go see a doc but not in this case. it just hit me outta the blue and bad!i don't know exactly how long i sat there at the edge of my bed (just a moment or two) but it felt like an eternity. i couldn't breathe and seriously thought i was going to die that nite and probably would have. i was scared shitless. nothing like that happened to me before (and thankfully not again since), i didn't know what was going on or what to do, and there was nothing i could do except that i was was on death's door. for some reason my lungs "deseized" and i was able to breathe a bit again although there was an immediate segue into something being wrong (took me a month and 5 fuckin' doctors to find out both my lungs were badly inflamed. why the first four didn't think of it is beyond me. asstards!)the next night, 24 hours later and not a cigarette had, i realized that i had lived without one, i didn't kill anyone, my apartment didn't get torched, and my cat hadn't filed for a pet version of a divorce  (and i still had major breathing problems anyway)i decided to continue on with the non-smoking. so, here i am 17 years later, ass once again parked in front of a blasted monitor but still smoke free.p.s. i still have all my lighters and ashtrays i had back then.

	 still alive! part deux

    


ugh! i can't believe i let this place slide unattended for 7 months! bad blogger! bad! no biscuit! i've made a bit of a pact with three other people (2 bloggers and 1 blog-newbie) in trying to post more often. they started it and i just hopped on since i figured i needed the inspiration. anyway, now that my internet service seems to have been fixed after a recent service fuck-up by dear old cumcrust, i'm going to start making an effort in posting more here. just going to tidy up a bit first (clean up the blogroll list there on the right and seeing what else i can do.)wish me luck!

	 still alive!

    


yeppers! still here with every intention of posting! about family melodrama that'll probably best fit into a joan crawford-esque 50's-style one. i'll do it soon! really!also want to ask if anyone can recommend a blog links site i can use instead of blogrolling which i'm extremely unhappy about now. they've been kinda down for months where you can't do any sort of editing of your line-up claiming they were hacked into and have been trying to correct it. well, it's been fuckin' months now, asshats!! months! it shouldn't take so long and i've had it with them. any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
