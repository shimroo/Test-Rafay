usui students









			the 
dr mikao usui and traditional chiba mark, or family crest, a circle with a dot at the top.

this is an 
ancient form of healing. it was rediscovered by dr. mikao usui of tokyo, japan 
towards the end of the 19th century.

dr. usui had 
	spent many years on a quest for the secret of the ancient  
	enlighten knowledge. 
	he usually went to a mountain top in japan and underwent a 21 day purification, 
	fasting and meditating. in the time at the end of which he received enlightenment and the 
	power of healing. he came down from the mountain and spent the rest of his 
	life practicing and teaching what we know as rei ki.
mikao passed his knowledge in courses onto about up to 20 usui reiki master and made mr. chujiro hayashi reiki traditional master 
	with the responsibility of training all the other  teachers. he took 
	rei ki to the usa in 1936 where he met up with one of his students, mrs. 
	hawayo takata going on in 1938 to make her a master. mr. hayashi died on 
	10th may 1941. passing on the traditional master to mrs. takata 
	beginning the west lineages. at this 
	time there were many living masters under her leadership. however, she 
	went onto  22 master ships before her death on 12th
	december 1980 when she willed the title of reiki traditional master to her granddaughter 
	phyllis lei furumoto. after mrs. takatas death the western rei ki movement 
	split into many directions. most know: the alliance' led by phyllis furumoto and 
	the radiance techniques which was led by barbara ray ( benedek m. diana 
	and dr eva rudas lines ) and based in the usa. several other branches grew out of the alliance. healing has gone on from strength to strength now being practiced 
	worldwide. reiki four elements > chiba mark - usui do system
