 casual baseball 
            talk prompts discovery
 it was your classic american thanksgiving gathering: 
            the bounty was plentiful, multiple generations of family were assembled, 
            and casual discussion around the table alternated between thanksgivings 
            past and current affairs, such as politics, entertainment and sports. 
            after a short exchange about who might be the front-runner to win 
            the heisman trophy, our sports discussion turned to baseball - as 
            it inevitably does. >>see

jimmy palermo, center, watches the
                  brown's red kress touch the plate during a game with the indians
                  in 1931. 

beginning
                     in 1927, when he was 6 years old, vincent “jimmmy” 
                  palermo was with the st. louis browns organization. his first
                   job was as mascot of the team. at the age of 9, he was made
                   the batboy and by 17 was managing the visitor’s clubhouse
                  at sportsman pbark, home to both the browns and cardinals. during
                  those years the major leagues featured players that fill
                  the hall of fame today - and he knew them all. >>see
