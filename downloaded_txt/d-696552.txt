	 oh the cuteness
	 

    
there are some things going on that i'm not sure that i'm ready to blog about, but i will ask that you pray for j's health.  we think he will be fine, but prayers are all any of us can do right now.so.  what to blog about?  my pretty, pretty girl.  replete with photos.we dressed the girl up in a santa suit we got for the boy way back when.  she is so cute!sweet and smiley:serious:lickin' lemons and liking it:i love all her smiles, but this is one of my favorites.  she looks like she knows a secret when she does it.labels: girl

	 design mom gives away the best stuff
	 

    
i don't know how gabrielle does it.  she has five kids and updates her blog all the time and organizes the most amazing giveaways.  companies big and small - and usually high-end - donate prizes for her to give away.  this must be a massive undertaking to organize it all and she does it as a labor of love.  well, i suggest that you head over to design mom this friday for 12, count 'em, 12 giveaways this weekend.  you will not be disappointed even if you don't win because everything that she talks about is seriously lovely to look at.  do it. mark your calendar for friday and do it.labels: giveaways

	 handmade toys rock.  let's keep them from being black market fare.
	 

    
you want the toys the kids in your life play with to be safe, right?  me, too.  so toys should all be tested to make sure that they are safe, right?  not so fast...did you know that testing of children's items costs about $4,000?  if the act that congress currently has in the works passes as is, everyone selling a children's item on etsy will be out of business because testing makes it impossible to continue to operate their small business.  and tedde.com isn't going to have anything i can afford anymore. :( read about the issue and what you can to do help here.  sign the "save handmade toys in the usa from the cpsia" petition here.  thanks for your help!labels: toys

	 it's a battle
	 

    
so i know that this is old news, but did you every see the electoral map put out by the new york times?  check it out here.  seriously interesting stuff.  looks like i am a concern to some people because i'm apparently winning a war:back in july when the iphone 3gs first came out, j went to an at&t store at 3 a.m. to wait in line to get us the mother of all mobile phones.  we went from whatever was free with a plan to paying more for the service - albeit much better service - and actually paying for a phone.  i didn't think that i would care about having the data plan, but i adore it. i can get directions or compare prices or look up phone numbers anywhere.  i can check email waiting in carpool line, make a grocery list or just play a little game while waiting for anything.  and it is so pretty.okay, i'll shut up now.labels: iphone

	 goodbye gummy grins
	 

    
after her lunch today, the girl was having a chew on my fingers (better than something else) and i thought i felt something.  one tiny tooth, bottom left.  i'll miss the gummy grins, but she sure has been a joy with a tooth coming through.  sweet baby.  picture to come once it is in enough to actually get a photo of it.

	 holy moly, it's thanksgiving
	 

    
this year is flying by and the fact that tomorrow is thanksgiving blows my mind.  i've done as much of the prep work for the food as i can for now.  there is so much to be thankful for, and blessings to ask for still.  thankful for my lovely little girl and sweet son and fabulous husband.  the rest of my family and friends are happy and healthy.  i'm asking that our neighbors serving overseas in the military come home safe and sooner than we think.  i'm asking that a man at the end of the street beats the cancer he's fighting and that the family two houses down have healthy twins.  and i'm wishing a wonderful and safe holiday for you and you and you. :)labels: thanks

	 school
	 

    
the boy started school in august.  i had high hopes for how he would do, but was realistic expectations of his reaction: i expected a lot of crying.  the very first day, we went to school with him.  it was a double whammy for me - i left the girl for the very first time and it was my oldest child's first day of school.   we were with him so the first day was great. he said that he would be fine when he had to come by himself.  sure enough, he got out of the car the next day without looking back and i was left feeling like i'd left my arm somewhere.  some integral part of me was missing and i felt lost all morning and even more lost that he seemed so very okay without me.  i was pleased that drop-off had gone so well, but was mourning his desire to be with me all the time just a bit.  hey, i'm not proud that i was disappointed that he didn't cry just a little.  i just love him and it's a hard day for a mom.i wasn't "disappointed" for long.poor little boy - i forget he's just a little guy, sometimes - cried the whole day. about ten minutes after he got to school, the tears arrived and stayed for the next four days.  i had to push him out the door of the car into the waiting arms of sweet old lady and then drive away.  i literally peeled him off of the back of the front seat like one might pry an octopus off a clam then smiled and told him to have a good day.  i love you!  i'm not going to save you!then he got sick.  illness combined with sobbing every time we mentioned school on monday made for a weekend that wasn't all together pleasant. when monday finally rolled around, he was still sick.  just a cold, but he was a slimey, sobbing mess so i caved - he stayed home.that day home did the trick.  the next day he was ready to go to school and shed no tears.  not one!  now he rarely remembers to tell me goodbye in the morning and loves school.  he hates it when school is closed for a holiday, even.  being "mom" is both extremely rewarding and heart-wrenching, frequently at the same time.labels: boy, school

	 i have to admit
	 

    
i was very disappointed when i found out that our second child would be a girl. i had myself convinced that i was going to be surrounded by boys my entire life and was just fine with that.  the boy was so very cuddly and sweet and i wanted that again.  basically, i knew boys and was having trouble imagining having a girl.  the unknown was a fear.of course, i wouldn't trade her for the world now.  no, she's not a particularly snuggly baby and there is a fair amount of drama even at five-and-a-half months (i detest the phrase "save the drama for your mama" because i do not want the drama any more than you do, trust me).  but she is so very pretty and can already entertain herself for a few minutes and she so loves her brother.  the boy might not realize it, but i think a sister is the best gift we ever gave him.and the clothes are really, really fun.labels: girl, guilt

	 i love baby shoes
	 

    
while i was pregnant, all those months ago, i couldn't wait to put my baby girl in all the cute shoes that i got for her.  they were on clearance, natch, since babies don't really need shoes for anything other than warmth and there are socks for that.  seriously, i love in south texas and it just isn't that cold.  but a little online shoe place had a huge clearance sale so i bought shoes.  and love them.  and there are a bunch that she hasn't worn.  not because they aren't cute or that they don't fit or even that it isn't cold enough.  it has been in the 30's and 40's at night and is therefore downright chilly in the mornings as i take the boy to school.  she doesn't wear shoes simply because i can never remember to put them on her lovely little feet.labels: clothes, girl

	 well, well, well
	 

    
so, i have someone i'd like you to meet.  presenting to you, the girl:yes, she'd five months old and yes, i feel bad that i haven't blogged about her yet.   i have no excuse. you know, other than the new mother thing, but it's not an excuse.  everything is wonderful here.  the boy loves the girl without reservation and took a photo of her to school for show-and-tell as something for which he is thankful.  it's hard to blog when you are so happy because you don't want to brag.  i think that's something i need to get over.labels: boy, girl

	 what i think about the other night
	 

    
growing pains. my child has been waking up every night for several days, but the other night was the first time he has complained of leg pain.  i think he has been waking up from growing pains every night, but once he moved the pain went away once he moved and he didn't remember that is why he woke up in the first place.  he woke scared from the pain, but unable to remember that the pain was what woke him.  i also think that he said "knee" rather than "leg" because my mother just had knee surgery.  i was so worried, because fluid in the joints - particularly the knees - can be an early warning sign for leukemia.  thankfully, the boy was totally fine in the morning and had it been actual fluid in his joints causing the pain it would not have completely drained by the morning.i feel like i've dodged a bullet.labels: boy, growing pains, pain

	 terror in the heart of a mother
	 

    
eta: the following is an over-tired freak out of a pregnant woman.  things are fine this morning after a little more sleep.  i'll tell you my theories later...i've lived this charmed life.  when i was three, my brother died of leukemia and i have always felt like god was making that up to my parents by giving me a charmed life.  i know it doesn't really work that way, but it's kind of how i have felt.i had wonderful friends throughout my childhood who, despite all being military families like ours, never moved until we went to college.  the university that i wanted accepted me and got a scholarship that made it possible for me to actually attend.  the love of my life and i worked on the school newspaper together and i was fortunate enough to meet him at just 18 and marry him at 22.  when school was over, i had good jobs.  one where i met one of my dearest friends and another where i felt like i was actually making a difference in the lives of others.  i became pregnant when i wanted - or close to it - both times.  when the time came for me to go back to work after the boy was born, i knew it was temporary and would be able to stay home with him in a few months just as i desired to do.  i'm blessed to be living in a home of our own and in a financially secure situation right now.do you see how i might, just might be waiting for the other shoe to drop?last week, the boy was sick.  nothing major - minor fever, coughing, runny nose and an aches in his knee.  the last of these i attributed to his fever and didn't worry about.  until about an hour ago (4 a.m. on april 1) when he woke screaming.  i went to him and he said "my knee hurts so bad!  will you hold me?"  of course, i held my child.  my sturdy, strong, beautiful, smart child who i can't imagine living without.  my child who i'm terrified will share the same sad and devastating fate as his uncle.labels: fear

	 letter lament
	 

    
it is so great that the boy is doing so well on his letters and can, sort of sound out words at three and a half.  he's not quite read to read just yet, but i think that will come soon.  he can always identify the first letter of a word that has been said if asked and can (with a little coaching) figure out what letters make up small words like mom, dad or cat.  it is very exciting and i'm proud of my little guy.  and yet.this means the beginning of the end of a form of secret communication between my husband and i.  it's so nice and easy to talk about something in front of him right now without him knowing.  he can ask me if i have a preference between our son having p-u-d-d-i-n-g or i-c-e c-r-e-a-m as an after dinner treat (usually sugar free pudding).   the p-a-r-k or the m-u-s-e-u-m (depends on how much time we have).  the t-r-a-i-n or f-e-e-d the d-u-c-k-s (do you have cash? do we have frozen bread?).i'm so going to miss the spelling.labels: boy

	 so am i the only girl who doesn't smell like flowers?
	 

    
one nice thing about being pregnant is the sense of community among the, um, afflicted.  gestators and those recently relieved of the condition readily dole out stories about strange physical behaviors of a body that is no longer controlled by our sentient brain.  we also understand the financial burden of a wardrobe of elastic waistband pants can be substantial.  maternity clothes get passed from woman to woman - at least in my neck of the woods - with little regard for who is getting what clothes and how they will be returned.  most of the people who have shared something with me have recently finished their final (planned) pregnancy and only care that the clothing that they no longer need will be passed on to a deserving soul when it has served its purpose.two lovely ladies, pcosmama and a lovely lady from playgroup, have bequested maternity clothing of some sort to me.  it is generous and thoughtful, the very sort of thing that saves me not only money but a trip to the store where i have to try on clothing when i'm feeling rotund.  here's the thing: both sets of clothes have smelt like flowers.  it's a lovely scent, but i can't wear it all day when pregnant and my skin can't take any sort of fabric softener with scent ever.  i washed the clothes and it's all good.  the only thing that is weird is that i know that pcosmama uses the same kind of detergent and fabric softener sheets that i do and my clothes don't smell like a florist shop.  maybe i am the only girl that doesn't smell like flowers.labels: baby '08, deep thoughts

	 things are just good here right now
	 

    
so sorry to have been so absent.  things are really good and a bit busy here these days.  play groups, doctor appointments, general errands and the occasional illness have kept us busy and i've not been here telling you things lately.  the boy is so big and fun.  he plays on his own.  he play well with others.  he's potty trained (depending on your definition) and he has a personality that is all his own.  good, good times.  i'm looking into pre-schools for him for the fall and he's doing really well with learning his alphabet (thanks to leap frog's letter factory dvd) and can read "on", "off", and his name.  j is fine.  he works late most nights and isn't normally home until about 7 p.m., but it works okay for us - probably because we can't do anything about it and we have decided that it has to be okay.  :)  the power of positive thinking!i had a doctor appointment on friday and we had an ultrasound.  baby is measuring just the right size for gestational age, four chambers in the heart, straight back with no gaps that would indicate spina bifida, and long legs.  oh, and it's a little girl.  chicka to round out our little family.  like i said, good stuff here.labels: baby '08, boy

	 all knocked up and nowhere to go
	 

    
well, i actually have plenty of places to go including a doctor appointment tomorrow afternoon.  i only just remembered, so i'm glad of that.  yup, the boy is going to be a big brother sometime on (or likely before, if the past is any indication) june 7.  that make me 12 weeks into my last pregnancy.  oh, yeah, this is it.  when this baby is six and i'm talking about how much i miss a baby in the house, remind me that preggo-me isn't the happiest-me.  don't get me wrong - i'm happy about this.  i am not happy about the nausea that has finally seems to have abated.  or the fact that i in no way look in the family way yet, but my clothes no longer fit.on a happy note, we are very happy to be completing our family.  we are in deep discussion about names already.  so far we have a long list of names that we like but can't use because they don't sound good with our last name.  a few names - primarily for boys - that we both like and some naming stipulations on which we can agree.  the baby's room is no longer empty as the boy moved to a big bed in july and i'm unsure as yet if we are even going to paint that room.  honestly?  that we might not paint is both sad and liberating.  after the labor of love that the boy's room was i might be sad if i couldn't even muster the strength to paint the new baby's room.  at the same time, painting the room is for us - not for the baby.  the baby won't care and not feeling like i have to paint is a relief.  who knows what we will do?anyway, there is our news.  so much to be thankful for this year! excuse me, but i have to go fall into a pregnancy-induced coma now.labels: baby, knocked-up, pregnancy

	 what happened to wantnot.net?
	 

    
so one of my favorite blogs, wantnot.net, has been gone for three or four days now.  the page won't load at all.  at first i was irritated and then became a bit worried...  so i emailed the lovely mir (also author of would coulds shoulda) and, pretty thing that she is, wrote back right away.bad, icky, loser service provider screwed her over.  if you are looking for mir, you can find her at http://workitmom.com/bloggers/corneredoffice .  just thought i'd post this in case other people are looking for this information as well!labels: wantnot
