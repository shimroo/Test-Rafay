james bay road













welcome to the trans-labrador highway website
this website is about travel by road in labrador 
(canada). labrador is a remote region of northeastern canada, and the 
trans-labrador highway is the primary road.



announcement: 
			the last section of the trans-labrador highway, from goose bay to 
			cartwright, is now open!
according to a short article in the april 2010 
			issue of canadian geographic magazine, this highway is now 
			open. this completes the entire trans-labrador highway from labrador 
			city all the way to blanc sablon (technically in quebec).
therefore you can now do a circle tour from 
			baie comeau (quebec), north to labrador city, east across to goose 
			bay, down to blanc sablon via cartwright, take the ferry across the 
			strait of belle isle to newfoundland, drive south down the west 
			coast of newfoundland to port aux basques, from where you can take 
			the ferry across to nova scotia.
