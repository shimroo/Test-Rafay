our financial commitment



your gift will be used exclusively for the exempt purposes of world help, a 501(c)(3) organization, and will be considered tax-deductible to the full extent allowed under the federal tax laws. you should consult with your personal income tax advisor for more guidance about your individual tax situation. gifts are considered to be without restriction unless explicitly stipulated by the donor. all restricted gifts for a specific project receive an administrative assessment, which is used to offset administrative and fundraising costs.
if contributed funds exceed the specific need of a project, or due to unforeseen circumstances the project cannot be completed, those funds will be used where they will make the greatest impact to fulfill the mission and purpose of world help. you can access world help’s full financial reports at worldhelp.net/financials.
you may also request a hard copy, as well as descriptions of world help’s programs, by calling 800-541-6691.












world help is a registered 501(©) (3) nonprofit organization. all donations are tax deductible in full or in part.
