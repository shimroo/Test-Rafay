the psychopaths amongst us have always run rough-shod over anyone who does anything to stand in the way of what they want.  it doesn't matter if it is only a small thing or something of great import.  what does matter is if one is standing in their way!it has been both considered reasonable and also legal for anyone to discuss in public, in any venue, any matter of public importance which can affect all of us.  this article below from signs of the times is about such an issue.  eric pepin - higher balance institute sue sott for 4.47 million over sott forum comments!laura knight-jadczyksott.netfri, 07 mar 2008 06:10 estyesterday, as i was working on finishing up the next installment of the comet series of articles, fedex delivered a packet of mail from our corporate registered agent in the u.s.  it was "complaint and demand for jury trial" filed in the state of oregon by eric pepin's higher balance institute, llc.  the reason?  a discussion on the sott forum that begins here.well, that was entertaining enough when you think about the fact that the discussion that he objects to was centered on several newspaper articles that describe his close calls with the legal system in oregon over charges of  sex abuse.  the legal document i received is 10 pages long so i'm just going to summarize it here.  if you want to read the whole thing (it's hilarious beyond belief!) go here for the pdf.  united states district court district of oregoncivil no.: cv '08-0233 hacomplaint and demand for jury trialhigher balance, llc, an oregonlimited liability company, dba higherbalance  institute, plaintiffv.quantum future group, inc, acalifornia corporation, and lauraknight- jadczyk, defendants. plaintiff higher balance llc, dba higher balance institute ("hbi") files  this complaint against defendants quantum future group, inc. ("qfg") and  laura knight-jadczyk and alleges the following:...defendants committed intentional torts that were purposefully targeted at  hbi within the state of oregon; defendants knew that hbi is a resident of  the state of oregon; defendants' tortious conduct cause hbi to suffer  economic harm within the state of oregon; hbi's claims arise out of  defendants' activities relating to the state of oregon; and the exercise of  jurisdiction over defendants is reasonable in light of their intentional  misconduct directed towards a resident of the state of oregon.as this court has specific personal jurisdiction over the defendants, venue  is proper in this district and division under 28 u.s.c 1391(a)(3)general allegations:hbi is an oregon-based company with over 40,000 customers from all over the  world.  hbi is dedicated to helping its customers relieve stress, reduce  anxiety, and achieve emotional balance and spiritual enlightenment through  meditation techniques.  the majority of hbi's revenues are derived from the  online sale of its books and cds, which are designed to help its customers  learn these meditation techniques.[etc...]defendant qfg operates a website known as signs of the times ("sott"). qfg  posts articles and sponsors forums regarding various conspiracy theories and  allegedly corrupt organizations on the sott website.employees and agents of qfg, including defendant knight-jadczyk, serve as  administrators and moderators of sott forums.  qfg employees and agents,  including defendant knight-jadczyk, post comments and analyses in sott  forums.  these employees and agents act within the course and scope of their  agency for qfg when serving as administrators and moderators of the sott  website and when posting comments and analyses on the sott website.sott forums are available to the general public online....many of hbi's existing and potential customers read the sott website as a  source of alternative media....first claim for relief - defamation - libel....beginning in may 2006, qfg sponsored a forum on the sott website  concerning hbi under the heading "cointelpro." beginning in november 2007, defendants intentionally posted several false,  baseless, and derogatory accusations concerning hbi on the sott website  including, but not limited to:a. hbi is a "front for pedophilia";b. hbi is a "cointelpro" organization;c. meditation, as sold by hbi, is an act of "falling into confluence with a  psychopathic reality";d. those associated with hbi must be careful to avoid sexual molestation by  hbi members;e. hbi is conning the public;f. "fishy sexual conduct is occurring at hbi; andg. hbi "leads people more deeply into sleep." by posting these statements in a public internet forum, defendants have  published and communicated false and baseless accusations concerning hbi to  third parties, including existing and potential hbi customers.defendants' statements tend to subject hbi to hatred, contempt, and ridicule  and tend to diminish the esteem, respect, goodwill and  confidence in which  hbi is held by the public and by its customers.defendant made these false statements with knowledge of their falsity or  with reckless disregard for their truth.as a result of defendants' false and defamatory statement, hbi suffered  general damages in the form of loss of reputation in an amount to be  determined at trial, but in any event, not less than $500,000.  hbi has also  suffered special damages in the form of lost income in amounts to be  determined at trial, but in any event, not less than $834,732.defendants defamatory statements are still available to the general public  on the sott website and are easily found through internet searches relating  to hbi.  defendants conduct causes hbi irreparable harm, and hbi is entitled  to an injunction preventing defendants' continued defamation of hbi.second claim for relief:  false lightdefendants intentionally gave publicity to matters concerning hbi that  placed hbi in a false light before the public. etc...economic damages ... not less than $834,732.third claim for relief: intentional interference with economic relations - interference with business relationshipsdefendant intentionally interfered with many of these business relationships  by communicating the false and defamatory information listed... ...economic damages ... not less than $97,299.hbi... has also suffered damages in the form of loss of reputation ...  damages .... not less than $500,000....defendants conduct was malicious and warrants punitive damages... fourth claim for relief: intentional interference with economic relations - prospective economic advantagedefendant's interference has diminished the esteem, respect, goodwill, and  confidence in which hbi is held by the general public, thereby hindering  hbi's ability to obtain many new customers with whom hbi had a prospective  business relationship. ... damages to be determined at trial......on its first claim for relief, that hbi be awarded general and special  damages in amounts to be determined at trial, but in any event, not less  than $1,334,732, and that defendants be enjoined from their continued  defamation of hbi....on its second claim for relief, that hbi be awarded damages in an amount  to be determined at trial, but in any event, not less than $1,334,732. and  that defendants be enjoined from continuing to place hbi in a false light....on its third claim for relief, that hbi be awarded damages in an amount  to be determined at trial, but in any event, not less than $597,299. plus  punitive damages, and that defendants be enjoined from their coninued  interference with hbi's prospective business relationships....on its fourth claim for relief, that hbi be awarded damages in an amount  to be determined at trial, but in any event, not less than $1,205,000 plus  punitive damages, and that defendants be enjoined from their continued  interference with hbi's business relationships.... that hbi be awarded pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on all  damages recovered....that hbi be awarded its costs and disbursements incurred in this action;  ...harry and david demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.25th day of february, 2008.bullivant houser bailey pcrenee e. rothaugechad m. coltontel 503.228.6351attorneys for higher balance institute whoah!  that's some heavy duty stuff, eh?  sounds like we just ripped up on that poor guy for no reason at all!but that's not quite the situation.  the original article about eric pepin that was brought to our attention on page 5 of the above-mentioned forum thread read as follows:a 39-year-old aloha man who promises spiritual awakening through meditation books and cds he sells on the internet is facing sex-abuse charges.beaverton police detective mike smith said eric j. pepin runs what appears to be a cult out of his higher balance institute on southwest second street in beaverton.pepin was arraigned tuesday in washington county criminal court on one count of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, two counts of second-degree sexual abuse, and four counts of third-degree sexual abuse. he was released after posting $26,750 cash, or 10 percent of $267,500 bail. a trial was set for sept. 12.using a child in a sexual display is a measure 11 crime punishable by a mandatory minimum of 5 years and 10 months in prison.jamison dwight priebe, 21, who works for pepin and lives at the same address in the 19600 block of southwest cooperhawk court in aloha, also was arrested on one count each of using a child in a sexual display and third-degree sexual abuse.priebe and pepin turned themselves in at the washington county jail last week after a grand jury handed down secret indictments. priebe was released after posting $25,375 cash bail and is awaiting arraignment monday.smith said a man who is now 20 was 17 and working for pepin when he allegedly was sexually abused at the higher balance office in the 11900 block of southwest second street in beaverton and at pepin's former home in the city.a call to the higher balance institute on wednesday was answered by a "personal star reach coach,"  who referred questions to pepin's private attorney, sam kauffman."the charges are false, and we are confident mr. pepin will be exonerated,"  kauffman said.pepin's web site claims he has located more than 100 missing persons and runaways, along with u.s. navy submarines, through a psychic ability he calls "remote viewing."pepin's meditation systems, which sell for $79 to $149, help customers develop their "sixth sense"  and apply it "inward to awaken a dimensional universe within the mind,"  the web site says.according to an affidavit smith filed with a request for a search warrant, the alleged victim told police that internet customers who rave about pepin's teachings are men and women usually older than 35. but, the man said pepin told him he should recruit "good-looking men"  between the ages of 18 and 24 to work for him.the court record also says pepin knew the man was 17 when he forced him to perform sex acts.the boy, smith wrote, "was taught by pepin to believe that the sexual contact was only a spiritual necessity."  but after a while, the affidavit says, the boy decided he was being used by pepin, who bought him meals and paid him $200 after sex.the man contacted beaverton police in january.smith said anyone who may have had underage sexual contact with pepin should call him at 503-526-2280.smith said the man accusing pepin told police he met one of pepin's followers at beaverton town square in april 2004. he told smith the recruiter invited him to meet pepin and see him demonstrate levitation.pepin introduced himself dressed in a robe emblazoned with the words "master eric"  and a triangular symbol and told the victim to take off his shirt, the detective said."it's a cult,"  smith said, "anytime you have a guy who fancies himself as the master, the leader."in another story from associated press found here, we read:beaverton police detective mike smith said pepin operated the higher balance institute in beaverton. smith said the ornate robe emblazoned "master eric" turned up during a search.well, i've been falsely accused of trying to start a cult myself, so i might ordinarily have had sympathy for pepin, but when i read the bit about the robe,  i blew my tea through my nose.   i guess that's why i'm such a failure as a cult-leader (aside from the fact that i'm not interested in the job) - i hardly ever wear anything other than sweats and bedroom slippers and spend all my time working! in any event, even though a grand jury felt that there was enough evidence to indict pepin, he was eventually acquitted in trial before a judge as the following report informs us:institute leader acquitted of sex chargesholly danks - hillsboro -- a washington county circuit judge called the leader of a metaphysical internet sales company manipulative and controlling and his testimony unbelievable, even as he acquitted him wednesday of charges that he had sex with an underage boy.judge steven l. price, after a five-day trial without a jury, found eric james pepin, 40, not guilty of two counts of second-degree sexual abuse, four counts of third-degree sexual abuse and one count of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct.also acquitted of third-degree sexual abuse and using a child in a pornographic display was jamison dwight priebe, 21, who has worked for pepin's higher balance institute since he was 18."everybody has stood by me who knows me," pepin said wednesday after hugging supporters. "they had faith in me, prayed for me. i told them i wouldn't let them down. i did nothing of what was alleged. i've been nothing but honorable and impeccable."however, price said it was "probable that the conduct alleged in all counts occurred," but he wasn't convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. "there's a lack of strong corroboration," such as a date-stamp on a videotape of the sexual encounter, the judge said.the accuser testified pepin had him take off his shirt the first day they met at pepin's beaverton home in april 2004."he was going to try and fix my energy and he needed me to trust him," the accuser said. pepin touched the teen's "chakra points" on his heart, head and lower abdomen."eric asked me to tell him everything i had done in my life that i was ashamed about," the teen added.the accuser said pepin asked him how old he was the first day they met and that he told him the truth."he said students had to be 18 because he didn't like parents fussing around," the accuser said.but within days the two were having sex, including a three-way encounter with priebe, the youth testified. pepin called it "crossing the abyss," the accuser said, "surrendering yourself to your teacher, your master."pepin testified he is gay and has had sexual relationships with most of his 11 employees, but not before they were 18. pepin said he gave his accuser a job, even though the teen was a poor worker, and continued to be intimate with him and give him money after he was fired, to help him out.stephen a. houze, pepin's private defense attorney, called the accuser a liar more than 100 times in his closing argument and noted that pepin was "the perfect patsy" because society wants to believe the worst of a gay man. houze said the accuser brought the charges because he wanted to shake down pepin.pepin's higher balance institute, now on northwest saltzman road in cedar mill, reached an annual high of $2 million in internet sales of meditation cds, tapes and books before his arrest in july.pepin touts himself as a psychic and "remote viewer" who has found lost submarines and missing people, and says he created the "psychic pill" magneurol6-s that enhances brain function, heals nerve damage, heightens paranormal experiences and relieves stress for $79 a bottle.andrew erwin, deputy district attorney, called higher balance nothing more than a sex cult run by a "snake oil" salesman who preys on the troubled.the accuser had nothing to gain by going to police and turned down $250,000 from pepin to drop the sex charges, erwin said."i'm disappointed," erwin said of the verdicts. "the judge wants proof beyond all doubt and that's too high a standard."and now, pepin wants to sue qfg and yours truly for talking about these articles, published in a newspaper and scattered across the web (though all of them are no longer on the newspaper's website, wonder what's up with that?)!!notice that pepin, himself, revealed his "sex cult" practices in his own testimony.  we'll be trying to get transcripts of the trial to publish so our readers can hear it from the horse's mouth; stay tuned for that.notice also that pepin's attorney, houze, accused the victim of bringing charges because he wanted to shake down pepin even though the kid turned down 250 k hush money offered by pepin.  well, maybe that's what gave pepin the idea of suing me.  only thing is, he's gonna have a hard time collecting his 4.47 million because i don't own a thing, live in a rented house, drive a used car and qfg rarely has more than a grand in the bank at any given time.  when we have fund-raisers, the funds are used almost instantly, repaying loans and covering basic expenses for the site and equipment.it's also humorous that pepin is suing qfg which only sponsors a world-wide group of independent researchers who, together, make up sott.net.  qfg doesn't own sott, nor does qfg have any employees nor any official oversight of anything that the sott.net researchers say or do.  but the bottom line is this: eric pepin is convicted out of his own mouth of being a sexual predator.  i mean, what kind of teacher of meditation says that he has sex with all his employees?  and all of them young men?  nope, we aren't backing down.  we firmly believe, based on available official documents and court records, that eric pepin is a danger to innocent people looking for spiritual guidance.  obviously, young guys just looking for sex and money and a good time will be delighted to take his pills, listen to his tapes and attend his retreats.  but the wider public who are not aware of these things in pepin's background, who are not aware that even the judge who acquitted him regretted having to do so, and that the prosecutor of the case was also convinced that justice had not been done, need to be warned about this sexual predator in our midst.maybe eric pepin will take sott.net down, we don't know.  we don't have money for an expensive defense attorney, we barely stay afloat.  but even if that happens (and we hope our readers will help us out now as never before), there are others who know and i don't think that eric pepin and all his minions can track down and silence all of them.  even if you can't give to our legal defense fund, i will appreciate letters of support during this trying time.  write to sott(at)sott.net and i will try to answer each and every one.and thanks to all our readers for your constant support and encouragement.labels: freedom of speech, psychopaths

                      	 the lies continue to continue!
	                       
                          

my word!we have had 5 years of unrelenting lies.  they just go on and on and on.  it's like the energizer bunny - on steroids!oh sure, lots of people are now aware we have all been lied to.  the question is now beginning to be:  what are people going to actually do about it, and when?here is an article written by paul krugman of the new york times i found at the signs of the times website that would likely make you laugh if you didn't already feel so much like crying!trust and betrayalby paul krugmanny timestue, 29 may 2007 04:25 edt"in this place where valor sleeps, we are reminded why america has always gone to war reluctantly, because we know the costs of war." that's what president bush said last year, in a memorial day ceremony at arlington national cemetery.those were fine words, spoken by a man with less right to say them than any president in our nation's history. for mr. bush took us to war not with reluctance, but with unseemly eagerness.now that war has turned into an epic disaster, in part because the war's architects, whom we now know were warned about the risks, didn't want to hear about them. yet congress seems powerless to stop it. how did it all go so wrong?future historians will shake their heads over how easily america was misled into war. the warning signs, the indications that we had a rogue administration determined to use 9/11 as an excuse for war, were there, for those willing to see them, right from the beginning - even before mr. bush began explicitly pushing for war with iraq.in fact, the very first time mr. bush declared a war on terror that "will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated," people should have realized that he was going to use the terrorist attack to justify anything and everything.[note: some people are of the opinion that this cabal 'created' the 911 'terrorist attacks' so as to be able to further their agenda.  the project for the new american century (pnac) concepts and the certainty that the gang now in power had the plan to invade afghanistan, iraq, iran and probably a whole bunch more countries even before gaining power is very tellingas to their intentions and probable methods to accomplish their aims]when he used his first post-attack state of the union to denounce an "axis of evil" consisting of three countries that had nothing to do either with 9/11 or with each other, alarm bells should have gone off.but the nation, brought together in grief and anger over the attack, wanted to trust the man occupying the white house. and so it took a long time before americans were willing to admit to themselves just how thoroughly their trust had been betrayed.it's a terrible story, yet it's also understandable. i wasn't really surprised by republican election victories in 2002 and 2004: nations almost always rally around their leaders in times of war, no matter how bad the leaders and no matter how poorly conceived the war.the question was whether the public would ever catch on. well, to the immense relief of those who spent years trying to get the truth out, they did. last november americans voted overwhelmingly to bring an end to mr. bush's war.yet the war goes on.to keep the war going, the administration has brought the original bogyman back out of the closet. at first, mr. bush said he would bring osama bin laden in, dead or alive. within seven months after 9/11, however, he had lost interest: "i wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure," he said in march 2002. "i truly am not that concerned about him."in all of 2003, mr. bush, who had an unrelated war to sell, made public mention of the man behind 9/11 only seven times.but osama is back: last week mr. bush invoked his name 11 times in a single speech, warning that if we leave iraq, al qaeda - which wasn't there when we went in - will be the winner. and democrats, still fearing that they will end up accused of being weak on terror and not supporting the troops, gave mr. bush another year's war funding.democratic party activists were furious, because polls show a public utterly disillusioned with mr. bush and anxious to see the war ended. but it's not clear that the leadership was wrong to be cautious. the truth is that the nightmare of the bush years won't really be over until politicians are convinced that voters will punish, not reward, bush-style fear-mongering. and that hasn't happened yet.here's the way it ought to be: when rudy giuliani says that iran, which had nothing to do with 9/11, is part of a "movement" that "has already displayed more aggressive tendencies by coming here and killing us," he should be treated as a lunatic.when mitt romney says that a coalition of "shia and sunni and hezbollah and hamas and the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda" wants to "bring down the west," he should be ridiculed for his ignorance.and when john mccain says that osama, who isn't in iraq, will "follow us home" if we leave, he should be laughed at.but they aren't, at least not yet. and until belligerent, uninformed posturing starts being treated with the contempt it deserves, men who know nothing of the cost of war will keep sending other people's children to graves at arlington.

                      	 the real us casualy count!
	                       
                          

 it's sad but funny in a way just how 'few' us troops are being reported as "casualties" in this insane conquest and occupation being called "operation iraqi freedom"!here's an article which helps to set the story straight.  i think it only 'helps' because there appear to be a very large number of soldiers who come home very 'changed' from their experiences there in iraq.  war generally does that to people, but what is going on over there is in a particular way very much worse than what 'war' normally does to people.  the article is from signs of the times and written by michael munk: the real cost of the iraq war: 50,000 u.s. casualtiesby michael munk alternet 4 jan 07death is not the only measure of loss in iraq. what about all of the lost limbs, bloodshed and other casualties that aren't being reported?to bring the human cost to americans of the invasion and occupation of iraq home, antiwar groups across the country are marking mark the 3,000th death of a member of its military components (at this writing the total is 3,004). but by focusing only on the number of dead americans we are being manipulated along with the media and public by the administration's determination to minimize the cost in blood of establishing permanent military bases in the heart of the middle east oil patch. that public relations strategy consists of prohibiting images of the dead and wounded returning home and those of u.s. casualties in iraq in the u.s. media as well as aggressive efforts to prevent such coverage by foreign media --including deadly attacks on al-jazeera reporters and offices. it also plants stories and interviews, leaks to fox and other pentagon-friendly reporters and provides generous payola to foreign (especially iraqi) news sources. still, the most consistent propaganda effort since the invasion aims to keep public attention away from the actual amount of blood being shed by american military victims of the war and their families. that cost now exceeds 50,000 casualties -- a far cry from the 3,000 to which most of the public is restricted to know. "casualties" in the military sense is the total number made unavailable for duty from all causes, including deaths and wounds suffered in combat as well as injuries, accidents and illness in a war "theater" such as "operation iraqi freedom" (the official pentagon name for the invasion and occupation). so whether caused by "hostile" (24,965 as of dec.27) or "non-hostile" (25,406 as of dec. 2) causes, the pentagon's own web sites record a toll of more than 50,000 so far in "oif." however, for most americans who depend on mass media for information, the approaching number of only 3,000 is the only measure of the loss of life and limb the media allow them to know. for the rest of us, here are the facts: the pentagon reports deaths on a daily basis at although its own total always lags behind the wire services number because it insists survivors must be informed before a dead solider, marine, sailor or airman can be added to the casualty lists. but the pentagon only reports the wounded on the weekly basis (usually on tuesdays) at the same site and it reports the non fatal casualties from non hostile causes only monthly and on another website. from those sources, we can count u.s. military occupation forces casualties as more than 50,371 as of dec. 27. the total (as above) includes 2,400 killed and 22,565 wounded (which includes both severely and less severely wounded) by what the pentagon classifies as "hostile" causes. by that date, another 583 military personnel had died from "non hostile" causes such as accidents, suicides (there were 99 "self inflicted fatalities") and illness and, as of dec. 2, another 24,823 had been injured or become ill seriously enough to require medical evacuation. according the excellent siteiraq coalition casualty count, another 147 u.s. "contractors" have also been killed since they invaded iraq. i urge opponents of the war to make the public aware that the actual human cost of the invasion and occupation of iraq exceeds 50,000 troops and their families who have suffered death and often life-long disability -- of whom the 3,000 are just one tragic part. michael munk is a retired political scientist in portland, ore., where his "portland red guide" is to be published by ooligan press on may day.

                      	 speaking frankly about israel and palestine
	                       
                          

 many people are still loathe to admit that there is and has been for many years an extreme influence upon our 'elected government'.  that influence is the israeli lobby which is known as aipac (american-israel political action committee) as mr. carter mentions in his article below.  although his book is only about israel and palestine, the actions of this lobby, which includes all of the other ways in which the israeli zionists influence our entire governmental apparatus. the us government and it's people have been so unduly influenced by people of this very same ilk for just about this entire century!  it is high time we begin to understand that these people have an agenda which is not for 'our' benefit in any way, shape or form!  they have nearly destroyed our country by shoveling us into war after war, ruining us economically and transforming our society into the psychopathic mirror of their own constitution.the below article by mr. carter is ample evidence that little can be done to change the way things happen until we rid ourselves of them and their agents.speaking frankly about israel and palestineby jimmy carter la times december 8, 2006i signed a contract with simon & schuster two years ago to write a book about the middle east, based on my personal observations as the carter center monitored three elections in palestine and on my consultations with israeli political leaders and peace activists. we covered every palestinian community in 1996, 2005 and 2006, when yasser arafat and later mahmoud abbas were elected president and members of parliament were chosen. the elections were almost flawless, and turnout was very high - except in east jerusalem, where, under severe israeli restraints, only about 2% of registered voters managed to cast ballots. the many controversial issues concerning palestine and the path to peace for israel are intensely debated among israelis and throughout other nations - but not in the united states. for the last 30 years, i have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts. this reluctance to criticize any policies of the israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the american-israel political action committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices. it would be almost politically suicidal for members of congress to espouse a balanced position between israel and palestine, to suggest that israel comply with international law or to speak in defense of justice or human rights for palestinians. very few would ever deign to visit the palestinian cities of ramallah, nablus, hebron, gaza city or even bethlehem and talk to the beleaguered residents. what is even more difficult to comprehend is why the editorial pages of the major newspapers and magazines in the united states exercise similar self-restraint, quite contrary to private assessments expressed quite forcefully by their correspondents in the holy land. with some degree of reluctance and some uncertainty about the reception my book would receive, i used maps, text and documents to describe the situation accurately and to analyze the only possible path to peace: israelis and palestinians living side by side within their own internationally recognized boundaries. these options are consistent with key u.n. resolutions supported by the u.s. and israel, official american policy since 1967, agreements consummated by israeli leaders and their governments in 1978 and 1993 (for which they earned nobel peace prizes), the arab league's offer to recognize israel in 2002 and the international quartet's "roadmap for peace," which has been accepted by the plo and largely rejected by israel. the book is devoted to circumstances and events in palestine and not in israel, where democracy prevails and citizens live together and are legally guaranteed equal status. although i have spent only a week or so on a book tour so far, it is already possible to judge public and media reaction. sales are brisk, and i have had interesting interviews on tv, including "larry king live," "hardball," "meet the press," "the newshour with jim lehrer," the "charlie rose" show, c-span and others. but i have seen few news stories in major newspapers about what i have written. book reviews in the mainstream media have been written mostly by representatives of jewish organizations who would be unlikely to visit the occupied territories, and their primary criticism is that the book is anti-israel. two members of congress have been publicly critical. incoming house speaker nancy pelosi for instance, issued a statement (before the book was published) saying that "he does not speak for the democratic party on israel." some reviews posted on amazon.com call me "anti-semitic," and others accuse the book of "lies" and "distortions." a former carter center fellow has taken issue with it, and alan dershowitz called the book's title "indecent." out in the real world, however, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. i've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. i've had one negative remark - that i should be tried for treason - and one caller on c-span said that i was an anti-semite. my most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. i have been most encouraged by prominent jewish citizens and members of congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas. the book describes the abominable oppression and persecution in the occupied palestinian territories, with a rigid system of required passes and strict segregation between palestine's citizens and jewish settlers in the west bank. an enormous imprisonment wall is now under construction, snaking through what is left of palestine to encompass more and more land for israeli settlers. in many ways, this is more oppressive than what blacks lived under in south africa during apartheid. i have made it clear that the motivation is not racism but the desire of a minority of israelis to confiscate and colonize choice sites in palestine, and then to forcefully suppress any objections from the displaced citizens. obviously, i condemn any acts of terrorism or violence against innocent civilians, and i present information about the terrible casualties on both sides. the ultimate purpose of my book is to present facts about the middle east that are largely unknown in america, to precipitate discussion and to help restart peace talks (now absent for six years) that can lead to permanent peace for israel and its neighbors. another hope is that jews and other americans who share this same goal might be motivated to express their views, even publicly, and perhaps in concert. i would be glad to help with that effort. by jimmy carter, the 39th president of the united states. his newest book is "palestine: peace not apartheid," published last month. he is scheduled to sign books monday at vroman's in pasadena.

                      	 jeff rense - compulsive liar!
	                       
                          

i have often had some reservations about rense, but this following article by lisa guliani is more than revealing. it i s more in the category of mind blowing.without further ado:jeff rense: a reinvention of what?by lisa gulianipatsy smullin has run kobi-tv for the last 30 years, and her father founded it. if anybody would have known jeff rense and the supposed 5,000 newscasts he claims to have made, it would be patsy.as it happens, patsy smullin does remember jeff rense, and in two different telephone conversations i had with her over the past few days, she confirmed that he did have a position at her television station for a brief time as a reporter and news anchor. smullin stressed that jeff rense, or “a guy calling himself jeff rense” (her words), was employed at kobi (an nbc affiliate) from june 1983 to may 1984, and she is not aware of him working at any other station in the state of oregon either prior to his employment at kobi-tv or afterward. [i would think if he'd worked at other stations previous to his kobi position, these would be listed on his job application or resume when given to kobi-tv.]patsy had more to say. she revealed that in her experience as jeff rense’s employer (and this is a direct quote), “he was not known for his honesty.” think about it. patsy smullin was rense’s employer some twenty-odd years ago. after all this tiime, the characteristic that has remained clearly in her memory is that “he was not known for his honesty”. what does that say to you? according to ms. smullin, at that time jeff was also involved in several court battles with other people. one wonders if it has anything to do with him not being known for his honesty?when asked if she could elaborate on the comment she'd made regarding rense not being known for his honesty, her response was: "sure. he was a compulsive liar." also, when questioned as to the claim that jeff anchored and produced “5000 newscasts,” patsy smullin laughed heartily and stated, “this is absolutely false. he never did that here.” okay, if not at kobi-tv, then where? perhaps jeff rense will reveal this to us all at some point so we can check it out.but on his own website, jeff rense claims to have been an award winning news director and tv news anchor for 10-12 years (accounts vary). if not at kobi, then where?an american treasure"…an award-winning television news director and news anchor for over ten years, jeff continually pushed for higher standards of journalism and responsible, intelligent reporting and inquiry. regrettably, those goals were often at odds with the irrevocable tv news obsession for tabloid exploitation of the trivial, the tragic and the sensational.the situation became so dubious and distasteful that one day he walked away from his highly-successful news anchor/news director career (as high as a 53 share of the audience - nielsen) and moved to radio, recognizing it as the last viable approach to bringing reality to the american public...and now with the internet, to the world."interesting that rense declares himself to have worked as a news director and tv news anchor. an online search to verify this claim will return only jeff’s words – repeated endlessly ad nauseum - as to the truthfulness of this assertion. there is literally no data to substantiate this claim anywhere on the internet. the claim exists only on the rense website and a few other websites that have copied and pasted the rense claims onto their own pages.here’s another variation on the same theme: jeff rense hosts sightings"during 12 years as an award-winning broadcast journalist, jeff anchored and produced more than 5,000 television newscasts. this devoted single dad is also author of the book aids exposed and passionately investigates ways to prevent diseases and extend life. his brother is rip rense, longtime reporter for the los angeles times. jeff first did radio while an education major at the university of california santa barbara, and in 1994 he returned to this first love with the talk radio show "end of the line." in 1997, by agreement with henry ("the fonz") winkler and paramount pictures, this show transformed into the ratings star "sightings."_______________________________________________________________based on the following article he was a former news anchor at kobi-tv. however, if one searches kobi, there is no information on the former popular tv news anchor/news director jeff rense to be found.the truth is up there"presiding over this conspiratorial miasma is talk-radio host jeff rense, whose weeknight show, sightings, is broadcast from a studio somewhere in southern oregon. (citing threats to his life, rense asked ww not to print his exact location.) five nights a week, millions of americans (including an estimated 21,000 portlanders) in 120 cities tune in to rense to catch up on the latest news on alien abduction, bigfoot, paranormal phenomena--and chemtrails.a former news anchor at kobi-tv in medford, rense began to hear reports of chemtrails in 1999."________________________________________________________________the above page also says:"...by the late 1980s, rense had worked for a handful of network affiliates in the west. he said his ratings were high, and he got 'lucrative offers' from several oregon stations. but he had also become disillusioned with tv news and decided to quit the business....""...after walking away from his tv career path, rense returned to santa barbara and opened three pet stores...""...by the early 1990s, he had sold his all about pets outlets and in1994 approached ktms with his idea for a talk-radio show, or at least hisversion of one..."a professional broadcast journalist"as an award-winning broadcast journalist, mr. rense has anchored andproduced well over 5,000 live 30-and 60-minute television newscasts…he began his end of the line radio show which is now in its fourth highly successful year. recently, the end of the line was acquired by the premiere radio networks, one of the top two radio syndicators in the u.s., and renamed sightings on the radio through an agreement with paramount.""as a journalist and private citizen, he became aware of the misinformation and propaganda surrounding the worldwide aids epidemic. devoting three years of his life to researching, collecting, and compiling information, mr. rense authored the underground best-seller, aids exposed, published in 1996. this 420-page book has been acclaimed as 'overwhelming,' 'invaluable' and 'the supreme public service' by broadcasters, medical professionals, and educators alike. appearing on scores of radio and tv talk shows as an author, mr. rense has also been invited to lecture at such institutions as the university of california and usc. he has also written numerous articles, papers, and reports on a wide range of subjects and acts as a consultant on many different issues."rense's radio show "end of the line" was renamed "sightings on the radio" with paramount's backing.an extensive online search for articles, journalistic reports and papers from rense’s purported pre-rense.com prior journalism career yields nothing.how can this possibly be if he has written ‘numerous articles, papers and reports’? his book, aids exposed, does not appear to be available anymore, with the exception of potential availability of a random used copy, if you’re lucky.a search on the publisher of this book, bioalert press, coughs up nothing as far as any listing for a company website. the top link on google search for bioalert press says:bookstore-- balaam's ass suggests you read these good books-- healthaids exposed-- jeffrey rense-- bioalert press-- order from jeffrey rense, box 764, goleta, ca 93116.www.balaams-ass.com/bookstor/health.htm -the above google link would not come up for me in multiple attempts on different days. regarding the balaam’s ass link, one has to order the book directly from jeff rense. is bioalert press really just rense? has anyone out there ever heard of bioalert press?i find it very ironic that rense claims to have become so disillusioned with the nature of the mainstream news broadcast business and its inclination to report tabloid style and sensationalistic material, when all anyone has to do is peruse the rense.com website for 10 minutes to realize that this well-funded site – funded by the same mainstream businesses that rense claims to detest – is full of nothing but a never-ending series of sensationalistic, tabloid-type, speculative, unsubstantiated or fabricated “news” articles. i have to ask: is it only wrong, disillusioning and distasteful when “other” people do it, jeff? or are you doing it for them?furthermore, online searches for any evidence of jeff rense’s longstanding claims regarding his extremely elusive broadcast journalism career path result in even more dead ends. there is an article on the rense website entitled “the most dangerous man in talk radio”, authored by an alleged la writer named kennedy grey.in this article, kennedy grey tells us, “when jeff rense walked away from a #1 rated oregon tv news anchor position, people suspected job burnout. but rense wasn't burned out on his job - his dissatisfaction was with the entire news media mainstream itself. grey also states that jeff spent “twelve years as on on-air news anchor and news director "up and down the west coast". grey further says, “rense set out to re-invent himself into a liberator of truth from the confines of a corrupt and bloated news broadcast industry.” he directly quotes jeff rense, who states that “radio is theatre of the mind - a classroom of the mind."very interesting comments, aren’t they? the news anchor/news director statement is impossible to verify via the internet, and thus far jeff rense is not forthcoming with information in spite of email sent to him containing a link to our website inquiry dated friday, may 26, 2006 entitled who is "jeff rense"?.does anyone have a copy of any of these 5,000 jeff rense newscasts? we’d sure like to see one. thus far, we have not been able to locate anyone other than one person who remembers seeing jeff rense anchoring a tv newscast.only one tv news station’s call letters has been identified thus far. kobi-tv 5 out of medford, oregon, which is an nbc affiliate. pretty slim pickings. nevertheless, i made a few phone calls to medford, oregon. one would think that as popular as jeff rense supposedly was, surely someone would remember him from the 1980s – particularly if he had produced and anchored 5000 newscasts up and down the west coast. i contacted the mail tribune and spoke with an employee in the newsroom there. she had never heard of oregon’s (former) #1 top rated news anchor, jeff rense. i’m awaiting a call back from bob hunter, editor of the mail tribune newspaper, to see if he has any recollections on this matter.“5000 newscasts” is a lot of face-time, wouldn’t you agree?three calls to rense’s former place of employment, kobi-tv, speaking to four people who worked there didn’t help rense very much. the first three individuals i spoke to had never heard of jeff rense and have no idea who he is. the fourth person was the owner of kobi-tv, patsy smullin.jeff claims to have left kobi due to his disillusionment with the mainstream news business and the tendency of tv news to sensationalize and dip into tabloid reporting, as stated above. i read jeff’s published claims about this to patsy smullin. she responded, “that’s not the reason he gave to us at all. he said he was leaving to join his wife in their pet store.” (i am currently checking out the pet store information.)overall, patsy smullin did not give the impression that jeff rense had been a good employee while at kobi-tv. in fact, her remarks lead one to believe that he was dishonest and untrustworthy. it was all i could do to restrain myself from asking if he conducted newscasts while wearing a wig.the question we are entitled to ask is: why would jeff rense make so many claims about himself, and why would he twist the truth and make public assertions that are simply not true? isn’t the “reinvented jeff rense” supposed to be all about truth and realism as opposed to sensationalistic, tabloid-style garbage? if one looks through his massive website, is it conceivable that a person might have some difficulty trying to discern the difference between rense shinola and honest-to-god truth? where does one end and the other begin? furthermore, is jeff rense the person we really want to ask? maybe that’s a little like asking the bush gang to investigate 911? (oh, right! that’s already been done. vanity fair called it a “whitewash.”)----------------------------------------“jeff rense” is a familiar name to countless political/conspiracy talk radio listeners and web surfers. in these circles, virtually everyone has heard of rense.com. what very few people realize, or have even stopped to think about, is that very little is known about jeff rense himself. the available online biographical information is vague and deals in generalities, and has been copied and pasted from one web page to another over the years. the rense legend has been dished out for public consumption in small, measured doses over time in word-bytes, with hardly anyone daring to openly question its veracity. rense fans embrace, and often even vehemently defend the legend; those who don’t end up being ridiculed and attacked. that’s a curious feature of rense’s position as a “don of conspiracy theory.”jeff rense is an interesting guy, wouldn’t you say? he’s almost a “legend,” and is even listed on a government site as the number one purveyor of “misinformation.” that’s quite an accomplishment in a world where “conspiracy theories” are mostly ignored and/or ridiculed. you could even say that it’s very good pr to get on such a list.my curiosity about jeff rense began to grow when i realized that he has maintained a large internet presence for over a decade, and despite this, there is virtually no information on him other than that which one finds on his website. how has jeff rense managed to keep information about himself off the world wide web all these years? that’s an interesting question.we live in a time that discourages curiosity about the ‘wrong” topics – that’s a hallmark of the fascist bushistas - and it seems that questioning rense is definitely “off limits”. we have to wonder why that is? asking questions about the ‘wrong” people is treated almost as sacrilege. we love to hold our heroes and gurus high, don’t we? but we have learned the hard way that questions are only discouraged by those who have something to hide.what could such a nice guy, such a great “patriot” as jeff rense possibly have to hide?after spending some time combing through his claims and trying to find verification, i began to realize that “jeff rense” is little more than a reinvention. he has made some very interesting claims over the years, particularly with respect to his former stints in broadcasting and journalism; claims that served as building blocks in the creation of a legend, a legend constructed from the twisting of truth.well, let’s look at “jeff rense” shall we?claim #1: on the rense.com homepage, we see the following:“7-time peabody award nominee”rense peabody talkers claimpeabody awardstruth: the rense.com website claims 7 peabody award nominations. the peabody awards do not have nominees. anyone can fill out an entry, and then later the winners are announced. the following is an email from the peabody awards foundation:"the peabody awards program receives between 1,000 and 1,200 entries each year. we have a 15 member judging panel that meets several times during the judging season, as well as listening to/watching entries alone in their homes. they discuss all entries as a group, usually awarding between 30 and 35 peabodys each year. there are no set number of awards given, and the board does not choose winners according to categories. we do not have a list of finalists or "nominees" as other awards programs have.basically we have entrants and winners.                    danna l. williams senior administrative assistant, emailed feb. 6th 2006 "in other words, you could nominate me, i could nominate you, and we could all nominate bozo the clown. the peabody panel will most likely be interested in these suggestions, but ultimately it is they who choose the winners – not the public. there are no official lists of “nominees”. rense’s website claim to be a “7 time peabody award nominee” is not only misleading, it means essentially nothing. it is presented to create a false impression of rense’s achievements, basically it’s deceptive bullshit.talkers magazineclaim # 2: the rense website states: “talkers magazine top 100 host”talkers magazine ‘heavy hundred’truth: please note that jeff rense isn't listed in the top 100, and he isn't even listed in the additional 250 names cited in the rest of talkers top radio show host picks for 2006. rense failed to make the cut for 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, etc. rense was on the list once about 6 or 7 years ago, according to a response to my inquiry from talkers. in fact, they find it pretty interesting that jeff rense is continuing to present this claim on his website, creating the appearance of his inclusion on this popular list, when in fact he is currently not listed. talkers characterized this misleading representation in one word: “deceptive”, saying they will be keeping an eye on rense and any talkers-related claims from here on. take a look at the list linked above. call talkers magazine and ask them yourself if he is indeed on the heavy hundred list.claim #3: rense’s myspace web page at:rense my space profilelists his location as ashland, oregon – yet his rense.com fan page says he is in california. which is it? oregon or california? does rense have two residences? if so, how does one afford two residences on an internet radio income?of course, the answer could be that one is his residence and the other is his business address, but again i ask: if he is just doing his thing because he is a “true patriot,” knowing how hard it is for other true patriots to make ends meet, we have to ask who is paying for his office? what money is backing him? his myspace page states an income of $100,000-$150,000 per year. that’s a pretty good chunk of change for a guy who claims to be in the business out of the goodness of his heart and his interest in truth.claim #4: jeff rense from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"former television news anchorman jeff rense, who lives in santa barbara, california, is a popular conspiracy theorist and is the host of the jeff rense program which is broadcast on terrestrial radio and on the internet. he originally became famous in the 90's with the program "sightings". his radio program and website (see below) cover such subjects as ufo reports, paranormal phenomena, conspiracy theories, reports of new diseases and a plethora of other material rarely covered by the mainstream media. jeff rense leans towards a populist approach regarding politics and media. rense does not subscribe to any conventional political standpoint and many of his views are simultaneously left and right leaning. rense has one brother: writer, rip rense. his step mother, new york socialite and editor-in-chief of architectural digest magazine, is paige rense. his father, now deceased, was sports journalist, arthur f. rense (1917-1990). jeff rense is also a vegan."here we learn that rense’s views are simultaneously both left-leaning and right-leaning. sounds like an impossible contortion to me. it is also established from more than one source that jeff’s father, arthur rense, formerly a sportswriter and sometime poet, also landed a job at douglas aircraft doing pr. how does a poet and sports writer qualify for work as a public relations director at douglas aircraft, one of the biggies of the military industrial complex? here is the ny times obituary for arthur rense:arthur f. rense, public relations executive, 74published: january 5, 1991“arthur f. rense, a retired public relations executive, died on dec. 28 at his home in las vegas, nev. he was 74 years old. he died of leukemia, said his wife, paige rense, editor in chief of architectural digest. mr. rense had been director of public relations for the summa corporation, owned by howard r. hughes, until he retired in 1985. he had been public relations director for the missiles and space systems division of douglas aircraft company and director of public relations at harvey mudd college in claremont, calif. besides his wife, mr. rense is survived by three sons from a former marriage, kirk of irvine, calif., jeff of santa barbara , calif., and rip of sherman oaks, calif.; four brothers, randy, andy and frank, all of cleveland, and william of denver; and two grandchildren.”regarding summa corporation: the washington post for april 1, 1975, carried this information:summa corp. is the financial umbrella under which most of (howard)hughes' worth is contained. . . .most recently, another summa "asset" hit the news: the $350 million hughes glomar explorer vessel that hughes built at the behest (and the expense of) the central intelligence agency . . . mormons, hughes, & ciasumma corporation has been tied to cia contracts on more than one occasion, to say the least. douglas aircraft company is also well-known for its numerous government contracts, not to mention the starring role it is now playing in bush’s endless war. so again i ask: how did “poet and sports writer” arthur rense end up as public relations director for douglas aircraft and summa corp? in bed with the feds? more importantly, what kind of connections does his son jeff have with these same gangs? after all, his views are “both left and right” which suggests that he could have “left” views to vacuum in his audience all the while subtly converting them to “right” views.douglas aircraft also has ties with rand corporation:rand (encyclopedia)the rand corporation is an american think tank."a think tank is a group of individuals dedicated to high-level synergistic research on a variety of subjects, usually in military laboratories, corporations,... first formed to offer research and analysis to the u.s. military. the organization has since expanded to working with other government and commercial organizationsproject rand was set up in 1945 by the usaaf, under contract to the douglas aircraft company.an interesting aside, condoleezza rice is a former rand corporationtrustee 1991-1997 and current secretary of state for the united states, a war whore if ever there was one."okay, i think everybody knows that summa, douglas aircraft, and rand are all major players with dod, military and intelligence agencies in the fascist government that jeff rense claims to oppose. yet we find that his father, arthur rense, poet, sports writer, was “somehow” a public relations director for both douglas aircraft and summa corporation? i would very much like to hear jeff rense publicly discuss this curious fact one of these fine days and explain how he could live much of his life with alphabet soup guys swarming around and avoid being sucked into the game. funny how this topic never seems to come up, isn’t it? perhaps he just keeps forgetting to mention it.now i want to come back to the fact that jeff rense has been “honored” by being listed on an official government website as a major purveyor of “disinformation.” among the conspiracy minded crowd, that is a high kudo indeed. but is it evidence that jeff truly is a news source standing in opposition to the bush reich and their endless wars of lies and agression?maybe not. as robin ramsay, editor of lobster magazine, wrote in the february issue of fortean times:recently, the us state department has begun trying to rebut some of the current conspiracy theories about america. their first targets were a couple of websites - www.rense.com and conspiracy planet - and the late joe vialls, an australian. what a boost for the named sites! attacked by the state department![...][y]ou don't have to be a pr genius to see that what you simply mustn't do is launch official attacks: all they do is amplify and legitimise the theories by announcing that they are deemed to be worth attacking. [fortean times 206, february 2006, p. 19]what a coup for rense and alex jones! to be officially declared the primo disinfo sites!now, if you know anything about cointelpro, you expect that the real cointelpro operations will be attacked "officially" in order to legitimize them exactly as robin ramsay has described. that also means that those who are honest and sincere seekers of truth and who do their homework and expose the lies of the bush reich will most certainly not be martyred by the official government. it's way too dangerous and gives them legitimacy. rather, they will be defamed by the “officially designated disinformation agents” – and dare we say it? – agents of cointelpro - such as jeff rense, alex jones and similar disinformation agents that have received the bush reich seal of approval. in fact, it seems that this is a well-orchestrated plan that is described in detail in that much maligned document, “the protocols of the elders of zion.” a really good way to keep your eye on the ball is to consider protocol 12...now, it is important when reading the protocols to not assign it's origin to any national, ethnic, or religious group. rather, consider it to be a statement of any group that seeks to control and dominate and use the public for their own gain then you will truly begin to understand who is who. (excerpts of protocol 12: control of the press are located at the end of this article):recently, jeff rense accused wing tv of engaging in deception, trickery, subterfuge, lying, slandering and libel, just to name a few of the charges. he has publicly called victor thorn and myself “dirtball scum” and together with alex jones and their groupies, charged us with being “cointelpro assets, government agents and un-american operatives." true to form and apparently attached to rense at the hip and the lip, (and linked on the official government site, i should add), alex jones reinforces, endorses, and repeats rense’s vomitus, only louder. what’s amusing about this is that rense, jones, nor any of their groupie parrots have yet to substantiate any of these bogus charges made against us.let me get this straight: nobody has to qualify with data anything they say, including (and particularly) veteran journalist jeff rense? alex jones has yet to qualify any of his ridiculous comments about us either, and he refuses to hold himself accountable for his own words.ask yourself: why? is it conceivable to anyone out there that they cannot prove the things they say about wing tv? moreover, this begs the question, can they prove any and all of the other “gospel-truth” claims they’ve made over the years? that is another very good question.you see, we are supposed to just believe what they say simply because they say it. forget about facts, data or substantiation. forget about showing evidence of their assertions; forget about journalistic ethics; just nod your head and agree. don’t ask questions. gobble up the lies and twisted half-truths and get your fill of the fix du jour. after all, in the words of jeff rense, it is all a “theater of the mind”.what we observe is that both rense and jones pander to a “least common denominator” audience demographic, the people out there who don’t bother to check things out for themselves and will just repeat what they hear and read over and over, like good little automatons. this is the ideal rense-jones target audience, one which will worship blindly, surrender critical thinking skills, believe without questioning or disagreement, and of course, shell out the bucks.incidentally, i did a search on kennedy grey, the la writer who penned the article about rense entitled “the most dangerous man in talk radio”. he (she) is supposedly the founder of a group called ras, an acronym for ‘rock against suicide’. unfortunately, a google search for kennedy grey did not yield a website for the ras group anywhere, but there is an interview with kennedy grey on this website: the internet nirvana fan club.nirvana fan club. oh boy, how impressive. a curt cobain suicide website.i was not able to find any links online to grey’s organization, ras, or to kennedy grey, other than the single article he wrote which is published on rense.com. i would like to find kennedy grey and ask whether he/she even bothered to check out any of the claims rense made to him in the interview. i’d like to learn if kennedy grey is a real person, for that matter, or just a construct of rense. whatever the case may be, it doesn’t look like grey checked out any of the statements rense made in that interview. if some fact-checking had been done, grey’s article would probably be written a bit differently. at the very least, it should have been.rense and alex jones enjoy howling that “honest-to-god patriots" never attack other patriots. that sounds a lot like:"for any attempt to attack us, if such still be possible, we shall inflict fines without mercy…. no one shall with impunity lay a finger on the aureole of our government infallibility. the pretext for stopping any publication will be the alleged plea that it is agitating the public mind without occasion or justification." [protocols]the fact is, those who do the research know that the founding fathers engaged in a great deal of spirited, heated, sincere dispute with one another. some of them hated one another with a passion, yet in spite of this animosity, worked together for the common good of all; as the cause was greater than themselves, and they all knew this to be true. so where do rense and jones come off bellowing such obnoxious bullshit, especially when we consider the fact that merely branding oneself a “patriot” does not necessarily make it so. i could call myself “madonna”, but that doesn’t mean i am madonna.appearances can be very deceiving, especially when some so-called “patriots” choose to hide behind microphones in undisclosed locations, behind wigs and a couple of re-touched, photo-shopped cartoon pictures of themselves, and when all they choose to disclose is a limited amount of extremely vague babble about their alleged past accomplishments, achievements, or experience designed solely to “create a legend”.and then, when we discover, with a minimum of investigation, that their claims do not hold up, that it is all completely manipulated, twisted, exaggerated, amplified and contorted facts designed to present a false front, we are entitled to question everything else. why do people tell lies, whether overtly or by omission? some do it because of mental issues, some do it for profit, and some do it just because they can.bottom line: jeff rense has falsely accused wing tv of trading in lies, deception, duplicity, innuendo, disinformation and trickery. jeff rense better start looking in the mirror, because i see a so-called “patriot” that needs to come clean about a few things, someone who is “not known for his honesty”.definitions of deception on the web:• misrepresentation: a misleading falsehood• the act of deceiving• magic trick: an illusory feat; considered magical by naive observers• deception is providing intentionally misleading information to others.• to practice deceit.• to give a false impression: appearances can deceive.• to cause to believe what is not true; mislead.• to cause to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid intransitive verb : to practice deceit• be false to; be dishonest with - 2: cause someone to believe an untruthstay tuned, because this investigation is not over. more to follow soon. "the big print giveth and the small print taketh away."                    ~ tom waitts ~protocol 12: control of the press1. the word "freedom," which can be interpreted in various ways, is defined by us as follows –2. freedom is the right to do what which the law allows. this interpretation of the word will at the proper time be of service to us, because all freedom will thus be in our hands, since the laws will abolish or create only that which is desirable for us according to the aforesaid program.3. we shall deal with the press in the following way: what is the part played by the press to-day? it serves to excite and inflame those passions which are needed for our purpose or else it serves selfish ends of parties. it is often vapid, unjust, mendacious, and the majority of the public have not the slightest idea what ends the press really serves. we shall saddle and bridle it with a tight curb: we shall do the same also with all productions of the printing press, for where would be the sense of getting rid of the attacks of the press if we remain targets for pamphlets and books? …for any attempt to attack us, if such still be possible, we shall inflict fines without mercy…. no one shall with impunity lay a finger on the aureole of our government infallibility. the pretext for stopping any publication will be the alleged plea that it is agitating the public mind without occasion or justification.i beg you to note that among those making attacks upon us will also be organs established by us, but they will attack exclusively points that we have pre-determined to alter.we control the press4. not a single announcement will reach the public without our control. even now this is already being attained by us inasmuch as all news items are received by a few agencies, in whose offices they are focused from all parts of the world. these agencies will then be already entirely ours and will give publicity only to what we dictate to them.5. if already now we have contrived to possess ourselves of the minds of the goy communities to such an extent that they all come near looking upon the events of the world through the colored glasses of those spectacles we are setting astride their noses; if already now there is not a single state where there exist for us any barriers to admittance into what goy stupidity calls state secrets: what will our positions be then, when we shall be acknowledged supreme lords of the world in the person of our king of all the world ....6. let us turn again to the future of the printing press. every one desirous of being a publisher, librarian, or printer, will be obliged to provide himself with the diploma instituted therefore, which, in case of any fault, will be immediately impounded. with such measures the instrument of thought will become an educative means on the hands of our government, which will no longer allow the mass of the nation to be led astray in by-ways and fantasies about the blessings of progress. is there any one of us who does not know that these phantom blessings are the direct roads to foolish imaginings which give birth to anarchical relations of men among themselves and towards authority, because progress, or rather the idea of progress, has introduced the conception of every kind of emancipation, but has failed to establish its limits .... all the so-called liberals are anarchists, if not in fact, at any rate in thought. every one of them in hunting after phantoms of freedom, and falling exclusively into license, that is, into the anarchy of protest for the sake of protest....free press destroyed7. we turn to the periodical press. … if there should be any found who are desirous of writing against us, they will not find any person eager to print their productions. before accepting any production for publication in print, the publisher or printer will have to apply to the authorities for permission to do so. thus we shall know beforehand of all tricks preparing against us and shall nullify them by getting ahead with explanations on the subject treated of.8. literature and journalism are two of the most important educative forces, and therefore our government will become proprietor of the majority of the journals. this will neutralize the injurious influence of the privately-owned press and will put us in possession of a tremendous influence upon the public mind .... if we give permits for ten journals, we shall ourselves found thirty, and so on in the same proportion. this, however, must in no wise be suspected by the public. for which reason all journals published by us will be of the most opposite, in appearance, tendencies and opinions, thereby creating confidence in us and bringing over to us quite unsuspicious opponents, who will thus fall into our trap and be rendered harmless.9. in the front rank will stand organs of an official character. they will always stand guard over our interests, and therefore their influence will be comparatively insignificant.10. in the second rank will be the semi-official organs, whose part it will be to attack the tepid and indifferent.11. in the third rank we shall set up our own, to all appearance, opposition, which, in at least one of its organs, will present what looks like the very antipodes to us. our real opponents at heart will accept this simulated opposition as their own and will show us their cards.12. all our newspapers will be of all possible complexions -- aristocratic, republican, revolutionary, even anarchical - for so long, of course, as the constitution exists .... like the indian idol "vishnu" they will have a hundred hands, and every one of them will have a finger on any one of the public opinions as required. when a pulse quickens these hands will lead opinion in the direction of our aims, for an excited patient loses all power of judgment and easily yields to suggestion. those fools who will think they are repeating the opinion of a newspaper of their own camp will be repeating our opinion or any opinion that seems desirable for us. in the vain belief that they are following the organ of their party they will, in fact, follow the flag which we hang out for them.13. in order to direct our newspaper militia in this sense we must take special and minute care in organizing this matter. under the title of central department of the press we shall institute literary gatherings at which our agents will without attracting attention issue the orders and watchwords of the day. by discussing and controverting, but always superficially, without touching the essence of the matter, our organs will carry on a sham fight fusillade with the official newspapers solely for the purpose of giving occasion for us to express ourselves more fully than could well be done from the outset in official announcements, whenever, of course, that is to our advantage.14. these attacks upon us will also serve another purpose, namely, that our subjects will be convinced to the existence of full freedom of speech and so give our agents an occasion to affirm that all organs which oppose us are empty babblers, since they are incapable of finding any substantial objections to our orders.only lies printed15. methods of organization like these, imperceptible to the public eye but absolutely sure, are the best calculated to succeed in bringing the attention and the confidence of the public to the side of our government. thanks to such methods we shall be in a position as from time to time may be required, to excite or to tranquillize the public mind on political questions, to persuade or to confuse, printing now truth, now lies, facts or their contradictions, according as they may be well or ill received, always very cautiously feeling our ground before stepping upon it .... we shall have a sure triumph over our opponents since they will not have at their disposition organs of the press in which they can give full and final expression to their views owing to the aforesaid methods of dealing with the press. we shall not even need to refute them except very superficially.16. trial shots like these, fired by us in the third rank of our press, in case of need, will be energetically refuted by us in our semi-official organs.17. even nowadays, already, to take only the french press, there are forms which reveal masonic solidarity in acting on the watchword: all organs of the press are bound together by professional secrecy; like the augurs of old, not one of their numbers will give away the secret of his sources of information unless it be resolved to make announcement of them. not one journalist will venture to betray this secret, for not one of them is ever admitted to practice literature unless his whole past has some disgraceful sore or other .... these sores would be immediately revealed. so long as they remain the secret of a few the prestige of the journalist attacks the majority of the country - the mob follow after him with enthusiasm.18. our calculations are especially extended to the provinces. it is indispensable for us to inflame there those hopes and impulses with which we could at any moment fall upon the capital, and we shall represent to the capitals that these expressions are the independent hopes and impulses of the provinces. naturally, the source of them will be always one and the same - ours. what we need is that, until such time as we are in the plenitude power, the capitals should find themselves stifled by the provincial opinion of the nations, i.e., of a majority arranged by our agentur. what we need is that at the psychological moment the capitals should not be in a position to discuss an accomplished fact for the simple reason, if for no other, that it has been accepted by the public opinion of a majority in the provinces.19. when we are in the period of the new regime transitional to that of our assumption of full sovereignty we must not admit any revelation by the press of any form of public dishonesty; it is necessary that the new regime should be thought to have so perfectly contended everybody that even criminality has disappeared ... cases of the manifestation of criminality should remain known only to their victims and to chance witnesses - no more.i think that all of the above may sound very familiar to all of you reading this. the only difference is that now we work with the internet and not printed materials. but the principles are the same.

                      	 new pentagon video is more proof boeing aircraft not involved
	                       
                          

but gee, how stupid do they really think we all are?these tapes are nothing but a re-hash of the same old 'it shows nothing' that were released years ago. if they showed nothing which could be identified as a boeing aircraft then, how could they pretend that they show something now?here is a good article by joe quinn who has been writing about the pentagon crash before, taken from signs of the times:new doctored video of pentagon attack release - confirms boeing was not involvedjoe quinnsigns of the times17/05/2006it only took four and a half years, but finally the u.s. government has seen fit to confirm what so many of us have been saying all along - pentagon security cameras recorded no evidence of a boeing 757 hitting the pentagon.the videos comprise the footage from each of the two security cameras stationed close to each other at one end of the pentagon. the first video contains nothing new given that it is simply the footage from which 5 stills were taken and released in early 2002 by the pentagon, the extra footage merely being the scene after the impact. the second video comprises previously unseen footage from the security camera that is slightly closer to the impact point. the pentagon alleges that in this video the "nose cone" of a plane can be seen in one frame. it should be noted that the security cameras appear to be the standard type installed in train stations and airports around the world. most people will have seen footage from such cameras showing people walking in "jumps", which is due to the fact that the camera records a still image every 2 seconds or so.basically then, while the mainstream press is trumpeting the line that "the defence department has released "the video of flight 77 hitting the pentagon", nothing could be further from the truth because there is still no evidence of a boeing 757 in the security camera footage. if mainstream press reporters were to be honest (for once in their lives) the most they could state would be that: "the dod has released a video of the attack on the pentagon in which something appears in one frame of the footage and the u.s. government claims that this 'something' is the nose cone of flight 77."let's take a look at this "nose cone":this, ladies and gentlemen, is "flight 77 hitting the pentagon". this, is supposed to "finally put to rest" the "conspiracy theory" (backed up by massive evidence) that flight 77 didn't hit the pentagon. this, is apparently the best the dod can do, or is prepared to do, to convince the world that they are telling the truth about what happened on 9/11. it doesn't say much for their confidence in their own story, does it.below is a zoom of the same "nose cone":is it more clear now? can you see flight 77 in all its glory? all we can see is an amorphous white blob that looks more like a car than the nose cone of any aircraft. obviously the images are too grainy to be of any use to anyone. at this point then, the most we can say is that an amorphous white blob with definite islamic terrorists leanings hit the pentagon on 9/11.the above image comprises one frame and 2 seconds (7 and 8) of the footage, the next and subsequent frames show the explosion, there is nothing in between, at least not on this camera footage. on the footage from the second camera, from which the original five stills were cut, an image of "flight 77" moving between the right most edge of the camera angle and the pentagon facade is visible. perhaps you remember it. for old times' sake, let's have a look:as you can see, this image, along with the new image of the "nose cone" appears to back up the idea that it was indeed an amorphous white blob that hit the pentagon. case closed? well there is still the problem of where the hell the plane is in the above still. if, as the government claims, this image shows flight 77 a few dozen feet from the pentagon, we are still left with the question of, "where the hell is the plane!?"the side of the pentagon is 971 feet long and the "blob" or smoke trail in the above image is no more than 750 feet (250yards) from the camera. remember the indelible images of those huge planes flying into the world trade center towers? the wtc planes were approximately the same distance from the observers on the ground as the "blob" in the above image was from the camera. so why can't we see a large 757 in the above image?to sum up: at this stage, absent any new future video from the dod, the u.s. government's "evidence" that flight 77 hit the pentagon consists of:the "nose cone" framethe white smoke trail or "blob" framethe explosion at the pentagon frames.convincing stuff, eh? this evidence is all the more suspect given the fact that the fbi confiscated tapes from at least two other video cameras in the area that would surely provide a more complete picture, but they refuse to release them.the release of the dod video footage comes at a very interesting time. some readers may be aware that the pre-eminent cannes film festival is just starting. fewer however will be aware that the "pentagon strike" flash animation is being shown at this year's festival. while we are not paranoid per se, we couldn't help but feel it was a little strange that the dod would release their videos on the very day that our team set off to cannes to promote the pentagon strike flash. if we were "paranoid", we might say that the release of these videos is an attempt at pre-emptive damage control over potential exposure at cannes. of course, it will also simply help to raise the profile of all things 'pentagonian', which can only help our team in cannes.a word on the response from alternative new pundits and 9/11 researchers about the new videos: most appear to agree that there is nothing new in the videos that in any way discredits the sound allegations that a boeing 757 did not hit the pentagon. a few notable editorialists however are attempting to revive the dead horse that is the claim that the "no boeing at the pentagon" theory is one big government-sponsored psyops. the theory goes that government spooks are deliberately fuelling the "no boeing" theories in an attempt to draw in as many researchers as possible - a honey trap for conspiracy theorists if you will - and then, when enough have been lured in, destroy their reputations by releasing a definitive video that shows clearly that flight 77 hit the pentagon.while possible, in a remote sort of way, i seriously doubt that if the u.s. government has had access to a tape for four and a half years that could prove categorically that flight 77 hit the pentagon, that they would have put up with so much rabble rousing from the "fringe" rather than simply quashing their claims from the outset. the simple truth is that the u.s. government has no recourse to any evidence that can disprove the claims of serious 9/11 researchers because no such evidence exists.serious 9/11 researchers claim that a section of the u.s. government and military helped to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks, that the wtc towers were deliberately demolished, and that flight 77 was very obviously not the plane that hit the pentagon. the u.s government, and the agencies that are tasked with preserving its hold on power, have been actively running interference over the threat of exposure of the truth about 9/11 by the alternative media for the past four years.the decades-old tactic of the cia's counter intelligence programs where their agents infiltrate "movements" in an attempt to sow discord from within is a major part of this "running interference". it is noticeable therefore that the only area of discord among 9/11 "truth seekers" is the pentagon attack and whether or not flight 77 was involved. let me put it bluntly: the success of government psyops on 9/11 is measured not by how many people can be made to believe the "no boeing at the pentagon" claim but rather by how many 9/11 researchers can be convinced that the "no boeing at the pentagon" claim is a government psyop and should be avoided.the attack on the pentagon is the real achilles heel of the official 9/11 story.let me explain:even in the event that evidence for the obvious controlled demolition of the wtc towers were to be publicly revealed and accepted, the u.s government could plausibly claim that 'al-qaeda' somehow managed to plant explosives in the buildings, that this evidence had somehow been overlooked due to "incompetence" in the 9/11 investigation. the incompetence angle could be used, as it has been already, as a plausible explanation for many other areas that would ordinarily point to government complicity. the pentagon attack, however, is a very different matter. if it were ever to be publicly revealed that it was not flight 77 that hit the pentagon, there is simply no way that the u.s government continue to claim that "al-qaeda did it" or lie its way out of it, because they would have to explain what happened to flight 77 and its passengers. it is for this reason that the "no boeing at the pentagon" theory has been thoroughly attacked and maligned by government shills and many alleged 9/11 investigators.the pentagon attack holds the key to the entire 9/11 mystery, it presents the best opportunity to blow the lid completely off the entire sordid deal and reveal the very, very disturbing reality of the nature of the u.s. government and that other middle eastern agency and the roles they both played in wantonly murdering almost 3,000 american citizens on september 11th 2001.

may 11, 2006



                      	 
                      	 high us official: 911 was an inside job
	                       
                          

well!golly gee!anybody with even average intelligence who actually did a reasonably thorough analysis of the existing facts in this event would have come to this conclusion really quick. however, most people simply glued themselves to the tv screen or the newspapers and absorbed the hogwash coming at them.what is becoming more obvious every day to me is that the 'official story' is becoming more and more difficult to maintain in the public arena. as this continues it is likely that some people who were actively involved in some parts of this psy-op slight of hand, which has been presented to the public as a 'terrorist attack' with all the trimmings, will begin to 'sing' so as to attempt to distance themselves from the very serious consequences which are probable for the perpetrators of this action.the following, found on signs of the times is a pronouncement from a fairly highly placed official that 911 was definitely an inside job.ex-bush official exposes 9/11 as inside jobmonday, may 8th, 2006rinfthe former director of the criminal justice center at the national center for policy analysis, showed that the defendants conspired to create a false cover story of suicide hijackings in order to "blow the world trade center to kingdom come" with explosives-a shock-and-awe psy-op designed to coerce the american people into supporting a pre-planned "long war" in the middle east, massive increases in military spending, and the rollback of constitutional civil liberties.reynolds stated that everyone in the worldwide intelligence community knew that 9/11 was an inside job as soon as it happened, with the obvious stand-down of us air defenses, controlled demolition of the world trade center, and non-protection of the president in florida being the biggest tip-offs. the head of the russian equivalent of the joint chiefs of staff, the former head of the german intelligence service andreas von bulow, former national security agency official wayne madsen, and former mi-6 agent david schayler have all openly called 9/11 an inside job, while former cia official ray mcgovern has confirmed this directly in private, and indirectly in public by way of his ringing endorsement of david ray griffin's work on 9/11.reynolds, who served as george w. bush's labor department chief economist in 2001-2002, believes that a 9/11 truth victory is looming on the near-term horizon. he predicted that one or more of the 9/11 insiders will soon "give it up" and come forward with what they know, saying "remember, you heard it here first." he said that most of those complicit in the attacks did not realize how over-the-top the plot was, due to the need-to-know compartmentalization of such covert operations, and that some semi-complicit individuals will probably be coming forward. reynolds said that most of his email acquaintances are now worried that the 9/11 truth movement is going to win, triggering the greatest constitutional crisis in u.s. history. for reynolds, this is less a cause for worry than for rejoicing: "we need a constitutional crisis!"reynolds argued that 9/11 truth is a matter of extreme urgency, since the perpetrators seem to be preparing another 9/11-style terror hoax as a pretext for attacking iran with nuclear weapons. he said that exposing the 9/11 fraud is the best way to stop cheney's plan to stage an unprovoked nuclear attack on iran, and the military draft and pinochet-style prison camps and death squads for dissenters that might accompany it.reynolds urged the audience to help educate the american public about the 9/11 inside job. personal contact with family and friends, the internet, alternative media, and public events like this are all good educational strategies, he said, adding that a demonstration of 100,000 9/11 truth supporters at ground zero next year would be hard for the media to ignore.politicians and the media will help expose the 9/11 inside job, he said, only after the growing grassroots movement reaches critical mass. the organizers of reynolds' talk urged audience members to come to the upcoming international 9/11 truth conference in chicago, 9/11: revealing the truth, reclaiming our future, june 2nd-4th, 2006: http://911revealingthetruth.orgcomment: to all those that dismiss the idea of an inside job on 9/11, ask yourself this: do you know more about the workings of the us government and what it would and would not do than a former director of the criminal justice center at the national center for policy analysis?by the way, try and find this story in the mainstream news via a google news search for example.
