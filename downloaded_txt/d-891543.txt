adair inn and restaurant in the heart of the white mountains
this memorable historic new england inn offers couples an intimate and romantic retreat conveniently located halfway between boston and montreal. the adair inn is located in the midst of many outdoor recreational activities, antique shops, art galleries, as well as the quaint villages of littleton, nh, sugar hill, nh and franconia, nh.
adair's restaurant offers flavorful new england style cuisine in our intimate fireside dining room, al fresco on our outdoor garden patio, or in the cozy library pub. from its long drive bordered by stately pines, gleaming white birch trees and stone walls to its picturesque setting on a knoll with spectacular views of the white mountains, adair is one of new england's most renowned country inns.
the inn is rich in history, with scenic grounds, walking trails and colorful gardens designed by the olmsted brothers (sons of the man who designed new york city's central park) providing an atmosphere of quiet splendor.  the country estate was built in 1927 by frank hogan as a gift to his only daughter, dorothy adair hogan, upon the occasion of her marriage to john w. guider. owners brenda dominici johnson and mark johnson and innkeeper stacey rachdorf await your visit to this romantic country inn and restaurant.
