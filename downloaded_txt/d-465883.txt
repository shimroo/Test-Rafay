comedycv: new acts on the uk comedy circuit that we rate – december 2017
 
 
it has  always been the ethos of comedycv that we are here to help comedians get noticed;  especially new acts on circuit. so on that basis we are going to feature a  number of acts who are new to the uk comedy circuit, but whom we  rate. you'll most likely see them doing 10 minute open spots at comedy clubs up  and down the uk.  we feel these are ones that are head-and-shoulders above the rest of the new  crop.

eric patric
travelled, weathered, and cultured, eric patric’s comedy is as varied as his  life experiences. a former resident of 6 different countries, eric has finally  settled in london, one of the few cities in the world that can keep up with his  energy. he has traveled the world, learning languages, 4 but who’s counting,  and performing stand-up to crowds around the globe. from johannesburg to  bucharest, eric’s award winning, high energy doesn’t seem to have borders. with  a range from edgy to silly, provocative to obscure, his shows are all-around  fun. all around the world. 

rahul  kohli
rahul kohli tells true stories from his drunken  adventures. from the wacky to the hilarious to the downright unbelievable, hear  about how he was pissed on by a tiger, nearly killed by a fire breathing  dragon, and how he accidentally joined a romani gypsy drug smuggling ring. pick  of the fringe 2016 (bbc radio 4, huffingtonpost.co.uk, skinny).  'dripping with erudite genius' (fest).  'a clear talent for telling a story' (bruce dessau, beyondthejoke.co.uk).  natys 2017 winner. 
 
 
bella humphries
      bella is a trained actress but now brings her  comedy skills to bear as a very promising newcomer to the scene. 
      she is confident yet charming on stage and her  theories on everything from instagram to fitness bloggers always gets the  audience laughing. she is petit yet powerful and looks to have a bright career  in stand up ahead of her. 
      she already appeared at the backyard comedy club in  london and at mirth control venues nationwide. 
      certainly highly recommended. 
 
natalie  allison 
      natalie is a scottish stand up  comedian, mc and producer living in london. she currently has a number of  exciting projects in development and is working towards her debut hour of  comedy. she combines stories of her childhood years in scotland with hilarious  one liners and some political satire thrown in for good measure too and is  rapidly building a reputation as a stand up to look out for on any uk  bill.
