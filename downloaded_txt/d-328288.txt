paris to the pyrenees





a grown-up book
paris to the pyrenees: a skeptic pilgrim walks the way of saint james by by david downie, pegasus, 2013.  isbn: 978-1605984322 

i am interested in spiritual/pilgrim walks so i was happy to find this  memoir. it is a useful and entertaining as a travelogue/virtual vacation.   i liked the accounts of where they visited and what they  ate, especially the food.   the challenges of finding shelter and food in the small towns,  somewhat off the other more heavily traveled pilgrim route, were not  issues i would have considered. 

perhaps it was because i  listened to the book instead of reading it but i found downie's  "skepticism" and his relentless suspicion of all things religious and  catholic,  tedious.  i was warned -- it was there in the title.  perhaps he was aiming for light-hearted irreverence but i found it wearing after a while.  i was more intrigued  with the insights and reactions of his wife, alison harris. she seemed  more in tune to the rituals of the faith experience and willing to  embrace the spiritual aspect of the walk. this is his memoir so we do  not get to hear her thoughts except as he reports their conversations.  you sense his admiration as she seems  undaunted by his ongoing commentary. i know i missed out on half of the experience as the audiobook does not provide the accompanying photographs that harris took along the way. 

having lived in france i did appreciate his  insights into mitterrand and wwii and ancient gaul.     his dedication to the effort,  returning to finish it after having abandon it due to an injury, was  inspiring.  the reader/listener is left hopeful as he is ponders taking  on the next leg of the pilgrimage at the end of the book.  i would read  that book too.

falcon





 falcon 
by tim jessell, random house, 2012. 
isbn: 9780375868665

breathtaking vistas and views greet the reader as an imagined flight of a falcon  sweeps them from the plains through mountain heights, over oceans and cliffs to a city-scape where a skyscraper becomes the falcon's eyrie.  jessell's landscapes spread over two pages and evoke wind and sky and majesty from the falcon's point of view.  the child's imagination takes the falcon to the city where it dives towards people on the sidewalk and swoops away.  jessell's landscapes and realism is fresh and welcome. 

his website gives an overview of his work and a look at his process for  sketching and painting.

ted talk --  jarrett j. krosoczka





jarrett j. krosoczka writes books that kids connect with on so many levels, through his artwork, his humor, his understanding of childhood.  when i am asked for a recommendation from a parent going in to a classroom to read, i want to give them a sure fire hit. i give them a krosoczka picture book. 

i did not think i could be a bigger fan girl but now i've viewed his ted talk.

krosoczka's ted talk should be a must view for everyone.

sadness: thomas locker





i just learned that the wonderful thomas locker died this year in march, 2012.  this is the publishers weekly obit for him.  i feel as if i've lost a friend.   at some point over all these years, i should have written him and let him know how much i admired his artwork. 

i love locker's books.  for years i've marked his books at "required" for library start-up collections and added his titles to  acquisitions lists for established libraries.  i realize now that i own very few in my personal library. 

his landscapes showed such a reverence for the majesty of the natural world. pw likened his work to 19th-century hudson river school of painting. his work also evoked the english painter, john constable and the great dutch painter,  jacob van ruisdael.  his brooding dutch skies in the boy who held back the sea are a direct homage to van ruidael. 


for science connections his cloud dance is an exquisite rendering of the hydrological cycle (water cycle) as is mountain dance which depicts the rock cycle.

 his pairing with jean-craighead-george produced the lovely to climb a waterfall taking the reader on a climb up the hudson river valley's kaaterskill falls.

i always add sky tree to lists of books for my art teachers.  each page is a study of the same tree during all seasons and at different times of the day.  it is breathtaking.

i feel a little poorer today and i have a new set of books to start collecting for my personal library.

i like old clothes





with the pending arrival of the first grand-entling, i am once again regarding picture books with an eye to snuggle-up reading and inclusion in the best library a grand-entling could dream of.  i've put down the knitting needles here to look at some that delight me.

i like old clothes
by mary ann hoberman, illustrations by patrice barton, knopf, 2012. isbn: 9780375869518

hoberrman's words exult the hand-me-down and rejoice at the charity thrift store find.

"clothes with a history, clothes with a mystery"

patrice barton has re-imagined hoberman's original 1976  version of this book with softly washed pictures "using pencil sketches and mixed  media, assembled and painted digitally." the illustrations seem to appear on a background of "old clothes."  fabric textures, prints, plaids and buttons serve as a backdrop for children who are playing dress-up and using old socks for hand puppets. there is no stigma to used sweaters or shirts here. old clothes upgrade to  "vintage' in the hands of these junior fashion-istas.  lovely.
