                                        concentrate vs not from concentrate juice                                    



not all juices are created equal, so here’s a cheeky guide to help you pick your perfect sip.
whether you’re clutching a bottle of ‘from concentrate’ or ‘not from concentrate’ juice, it’s good to know what’s gone through to get from the farm to your fridge.
while all juices go through some kind of process to ensure they’re all safe to drink, ‘not from concentrate’ juice is simple: fruit is juiced and pasteurised without any water removal or reconstitution. meanwhile, ‘from concentrate’ juice is more complex. the fruit is juiced, filtered, and evaporated to remove almost all the water. why all the trouble? this makes it cheaper and easier to handle, and gives it a longer shelf life.
when ‘from concentrate’ is evaporated, the juice is heated to super high temperatures, which can potentially zap some nutrients but extends shelf life—sometimes for years, if cryogenically frozen. before hitting the store, water is added back, and the juice is pasteurized again. sometimes, there might even be some additives tossed in too!
here at nudie, we like to keep things simple! that means we are ‘not from concentrate’ and only pasteurise our products – we don’t mess with anything else!









                                        what can i do with juice?                                    



gone are the days when juice was just for breakfast or a quick pick-me-up. with 100% real juice bursting with fruits and veggies, you can get creative any time of day or night.
splash some of your favorite nudie into a mocktail, whip up some frozen fruit pops, jazz up your salad dressing, replace milk in your bircher muesli or elevate your baking with a dash in muffins or cupcakes. nudie will add all the tasty goodness you’ll ever need.

                                        what is juice made from?                                    



we love talking about how we’re made from 100% real fruit and veggies because, well, umm… we’re made from 100% real fruit and veggies and that’s pretty rad! importantly, we don’t mess with our juice, so no concentrate or reconstitution here (that’s the process where water’s removed, then added back before bottling).
yeah, nah, we’re not big fans, either. instead, we just press, pasteurise, and bottle – it’s as simple as that. no artificial colours, flavours, or added sugars – just natural sweetness from the fruit itself, naturally occurring sugar which hasn’t been messed with, refined, or added to. plus, nudie is also gluten free, dairy free and even vegan friendly, meaning everyone can enjoy a sip when the juice cravings hit.









                                        is juice good for me?                                    



our juice isn’t just filled with 100% real fruit and veggie – it’s packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, too. no room for nasties like artificial colors or preservatives here!
take our orange juice: all we do is squeeze tasty aussie oranges into every bottle. sure, our arms get sore, but it’s worth it for that vitamin c boost! did you know that just 10% of the recommended dietary intake (rdi) of vitamin c per day can help your immune system, contribute to cell protection from free radical damage, contribute to normal collagen formation and energy metabolism. we’re all about the real deal and the benefits that come with it!
