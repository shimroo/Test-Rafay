about barrows house



this six acre estate was built in 1804 and served as the home of the reverend william jackson, pastor of the dorset church.  in 1900, experience and theresa barrows purchased the property for a farm and country inn dedicated to serving local residents, the traveling public, and long-term summer boarders.  many of these guests were writers and artists escaping the summer heat of new york city.barrows house has changed throughout the years.  functional buildings like the hay loft above the stables, the blacksmith cottage, and even the chicken coop were converted to accommodate more guests.  in 1939, a fire destroyed the rear wing of the building.  restoration then included an overlay of greek revival features, creating the iconic facade visitors enjoy today. more recent interior renovations revealed original wall stenciling created in the inn’s parlors by an itinerant artisan.  we’ve preserved some areas of the painted plaster.  guests can view it by peeking behind hinged panels in the living room and lobby.  in 2012, the owners of the dorset inn (est 1796) purchased barrows house, and it was completely renovated before opening in the summer of 2013.  the inn’s 27 guest rooms, restaurant, and tap room have been modernized and reconfigured to include a large outdoor dining terrace and a local marble bar. the inn boasts several cottages, a swimming pool, tennis courts, and beautiful gardens and grounds.  it is now home to the finest of accommodations and superb american cuisine.
