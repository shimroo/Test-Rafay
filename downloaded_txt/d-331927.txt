kaplan industries is the epitome of a true family success story. starting in the early 1950’s in a small building in philadelphia, the kaplan brothers — morris and albert kaplan — founded an independent supply business serving local welding and fire-protection distributors with compressed gas cylinders and related equipment, which would, unknown at the time, lead to a dominating role in the steel cylinder business. from this modest beginning in a small philadelphia warehouse to a spacious 16-acre campus in harrison, ohio with multiple distribution centers around the country, kaplan industries — led by dean and rita kaplan, the son and daughter of morris kaplan — has become a recognized leader in the north american cylinder market today. utilizing its state-of-the-art production facility, kaplan industries is poised to expand its role as a leader well into the 21st century.
