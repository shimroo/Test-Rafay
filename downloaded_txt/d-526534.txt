empowering musicians with disabilities










































at lagond music, we firmly believe that talent knows no bounds. with our power through performance (ptp) program, we aim to shatter the misconceptions surrounding musicians with disabilities.








            why ptp matters: 
          










for over two decades, we've witnessed countless gifted musicians who have faced unwarranted biases. far too often, they are marginalized, labeled as inferior talents, or simply overlooked. we are here to change that narrative.








            our approach:
          










formation & mentorship: ptp not only forms bands but also offers mentorship to musicians of diverse abilities. we ensure they are equipped to chase their musical dreams without inhibition.affordable training: weekly rehearsals and professional instruction are provided at minimal or no cost.performance opportunities: we collaborate with local entities and organizations to curate professional gigs for our artists, both at public and private venues.building community connections: by partnering with other like-minded organizations, we curate musical experiences that are both joyful and authentic. this allows our musicians to shine in their element, radiating positivity and captivating audiences.in-program support: mentorship within ptp is unique. musicians are teamed up with peers who have similar experiences, forging powerful bonds of friendship, trust, and mutual growth.advocating fairness: every step towards building their careers is safeguarded, right from nurturing their talents to ensuring they receive fair remuneration for their performances.








            our vision:
          










we envision a world where musicians are celebrated for their passion, talent, and dedication, and not labeled or limited by their disabilities.







join our cause:if you, or someone you know, is a musician facing challenges due to disabilities and needs our support,if you can provide performance platforms to showcase our musicians,if you wish to contribute financially, please reach out to our executive director, rosanne or donate today.your support is not merely a financial contribution but a testament to your belief in a world where artistic expression transcends all boundaries.
