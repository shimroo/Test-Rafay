enjoy the great outdoorsof central jersey


walking in nature is healthy for the mind and body and central new jersey abounds with trails for people of all fitness levels. from deciduous woodlands to grassy meadows to nature parks, there are endless possibilities to get outside and explore our area.
the new jersey trails association provides the information you need to find trails in our region. njta is headed by d&r greenway land trust with input from other land trusts and local open space groups. many of the trails found on this site were built by d&rg volunteers.
