travel
caci national convention & regional weekends


about caci travel
each year, several travel opportunities are available exclusively to cac members. join
    fellow cacers throughout the us, for interesting tours, dinner-dances, liturgies, seminars,
    after-hours parties, and more.
national convention
all cac members in good standing are invited to the annual caci national convention, a
    weeklong gathering of cac members from around the us. a varying north
    american location of particular interest to cac travelers is selected each year. weâve been
    sponsoring a national convention every year since 1960!
begin each day with breakfast. then join a sightseeing tour, swim in the hotelâs pool, or take
    a leisurely stroll around the grounds. later in the afternoon, attend a celebration of the mass.
    afterwards, enjoy a cocktail hour and catered dinner, followed by a dance. close out the night
    with an after-hours party. do all this while sharing the warmth of companionship and good cheer
    with fellow cac catholic singles.


caci also conducts its annual business meeting at the convention and holds its election of officers.
for many cacers, this annual vacation is the highlight of the year! you have to check it out and experience it
    for yourself.

regional weekends
regional weekends provide additional vacation opportunities for cacers beyond the national convention.
    cac chapters in a specific region of the country host a weekend full of activities of interest to catholic
    singles. all cac members may attend any regional weekend.
