        can i eat oats?
      




oats may be contaminated with gluten from wheat, barley, and rye due to its production process. take caution if you have coeliac disease. as long as you don't get contaminated oats it's ok. oats are rich in important b vitamins, zinc, iron, magnesium, protein and unsaturated fatty acids. but speak to your doctor before you decide.
