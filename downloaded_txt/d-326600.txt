nature is all around us, we live within it, we are affected by it, we are a part of it. but how often do we really stop and look at it? from the beauty of tiny butterflies to the grandeur of the natural landscape, nature can uplift us and encourage us to learn more, to explore and to share at least some of the wonders that we have been privileged to uncover.

photography provides us with the means to do all of these things, in a way that is accessible to young and old, fit and infirmed, enabling us to visit, at least in our minds, the beauty that we might otherwise never see.
