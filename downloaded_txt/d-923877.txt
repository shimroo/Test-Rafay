what our clients are saying...















arthur murray quote



              we don't stop dancing because we grow too old; we grow old when we
              choose to stop dancing.

what to expect on your first lesson

      after answering a few questions about your goals, aspirations, and the
      look and feel you‚Äôd like to have, you'll be guided through a few basics by
      one of our highly-trained instructors.
    

      you'll start to learn to dance on your very first lesson, and leave with a
      plan of action for the next few sessions.
    

      at arthur murray, we've developed a fool-proof method to help you learn to
      dance the quickest way possible and achieve your goals.

          my husband and i have so enjoyed spicing up our date nights with
          dance... it's helped us to be even more in touch with one another and
          given us more confidence to dance in social settings! marcia and drew
          are incredibly warm and welcoming and make everyone feel at home.

          i never thought dancing would be so much fun!!! i mean, i always
          wanted to learn to dance and it looked fun but when i actually started
          dancing the basic steps it became more fun than i thought. you learn
          so much just with a few lessons!...the whole staff is pretty amazing!

          ...i have to admit, like many men i was apprehensive but with the
          patient instruction on the part of our instructor marcia we have
          become the dancers we are today. the staff at arthur murray redlands
          are more than just dance experts, we consider them our "dance family".
