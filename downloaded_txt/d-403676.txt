the g.o.a.t.
six-time nba champion, five-time m.v.p, two-time olympic gold medalist & he’s still hungry. in 1993, during his historic nba career, michael jordan opened his first restaurant in chicago and has since grown his brand to the national level. in 1998 the first michael jordan’s steak house opened, delivering an unparalleled dining experience elevated to a level you’ve come to expect from the legend himself. as the g.o.a.t would say “some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” for over 30 years his concepts have created unprecedented experiences for everyone at the table.
