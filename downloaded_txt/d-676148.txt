it isnt about the facts





there is an arrogant obnoxious toxic elite. despite being a liberal, i was pushed away by the inability of the left to step away from communists. communists are quick to talk of race but are at their core antisemitic.

we watched democrats and their media clown squad describe a series of violent anti police riots organized by communists as mostly peaceful. stores looted and police assaulted were just inconvenient facts. exactly what does palestine have to do with policing in the usa. where did the money go? 

if you loot macys and assault a cop you get less time than if you stunk up
nancy pelosis toilet.

we have a two tiered justice system. rules are not enfoced against the elites. oddly trump despite his wealth and education is not elite. ones actual actions like running high tech plantations are irrelevant as long as you publically praise blm and serve the elites with the washington post.

the hysterical elites screaming about demanding israel negotiate with terrorists wont meet with peaceful truckers. the media described the blm riots as mostly peaceful while lying about nazi truckers.

funny as this is going on blm bailed out a kook who tried to kill  a jewish political candidate. lets not even mention his associations with kooks who think the real jews are black. no we arent discussing ethiopians or lembas. we are talking about obnoxious types in tacky clothes that look like a mashup between sinbad the sailor and star trek.

we live in a fantasy world where dhs is worried about far right terrorism. it talks of insurections while ignoring mobs that loot cities and buy real estate through tax fraud.

lets talk about george floyd and all of these so called victims. none of thess so called victims was stephen urkel. they had long rap sheets and were in the encounters for valid reasons. the question is if too much force was used is quite different from if there was valid reasons for the interactions with police.

in the case of garner how does the superisor who was present avoid charges. thats right she was a black female. did garner who was eligible for free diabetic medication get help no. garner was very familiar with the justice system and had a temper tantrum. his personal choices and negligence were factors in his death.

i want to contast the delusional statements of mark miley with actual arsonists vs peaceful truckers. peaceful truckers are nazis but violent pfotestees who are led by marxists are peachy.

the undertone is obnoxious elitist arrogance. we are the elite and laws dont apply to us.this is no surprise considering how peaceful taxpayer tea party people were treated by the obamunist goons in the media and by the irs.

covid fatigue is genuine. exasperation with toxic elites is genuine. when you see inflation running rampant blame zuckerberg and bezos. didnt we get lectures about media not using hacked materials but it will publish donor lists to causes they dont like.

lastly to the lunatic hacker braging about your deeds. the political winds are shifting. your authoritarian cohorts will not be able to save you. i only hope when you are cuffed for your crimes some trucker puts clown makeup on you. you can keep laughing when medicated and halicinating about real men named earl and dave wearing catepillar hats and coveralls.

in covid lockdown 





i want to state i am not anti vax. i decided to take the vaccine on my own. i do not like compulsion by the government.

i had a rough patch where my nose ran like a race horse. i had to use sudafed to sleep.it is very hard to discern over work from illness. i took the test and came back positive.

i survived this way back in the begining and had multiple episodes where i turned purple. i would cough up huge chunks of phlegm. it was a rough five weeks but with little more than a z pack i made it.
i never developed fever or the severe body aches but the fatigue was real.

this new bought is lame and would not wualify as a cold. again no temp and minimal congestion. i blow my nose in the morning and that is it. you can credit moderna or survival but it isnt a big deal.

the truth is there may indeed be scores of silent infections like thid. covid needs to be studied without politics.

although i am in zero danger, i quarantine to save others. i think we as a nation need to rethink covid. for cases like mine hotels with limited staff spartan food and with an on site nurse and testimg maybe smarter.

if this is the evolution of covid to a milder form. we may need to rethink all of this when we have more answers.

democrat and big tech bull





we experienced multiple years of russia hoaxes against president trump with zero evidence. these fabrications were spun by the media and governmental elite daily. now these same pillars of virtue want to criminalize any complaints against an election that went their way.

the usual suspects drone on an on about the capitol riot. after months of hailing excessive violence by blm complete with actual murders, store lootings and financial games worthy of irs review these concerns are hypocrisy. the heated antisemitic rheotoric of blm directly led to jews being lynched in their own enclaves. what israel has to do with a movement allegedly against police brutality points to the disengenous nature of anything led by communists.

the dc protesters didnt burn stores. a single person put their feet on nancy pelosis desk. putin pointed out the hypocrisy and he is 100/ correct.

big tec and elite government conspired to influence an election. the fact that hunter biden isnt facing criminal charges is disturbing. the same crew screaming falsely about gen flynn seems silent about the actual crimes of gomer kerry.

now is the time to take back our country and it starts by dismantling big tec first. its time to break up the familiar companies and force bezos to sell the washington post or close it. the ethics of bezos abusing the posts to sell the lockdowns while ignoring the predatory business practices and inhuman working conditions is apalling. once the election was over col bernie and the fraud from ma found the time to be concerned about inhuman treatment of amazon employees. yes bezos supports blm, while running a plantation  that treats his employees like livestock. 

its time to make all of these techno communists pay for their interference. get legislation forcing the breakup of the big tech baboons. boycott and build alternatives and hurl the worst we can at the tech titans. if it is true gates was heavily involved with epstein prosecute. 

as for big government, it maybindeed be time to end civil service protections for managers. the legislation to end the abuses should be called the lois lerner laws.

biden in fantasy land





the obama biden mania of looking for white supremacists is amusing. the former president had an extensive relationship with the nations foremost racist and homophobe louis farakhan. farakhan is still praised by many on the left. 

how and why did the media cover up the farrakhan obama relationship. why did the hysterical media allow obama to dismiss decades of membership in an antisemitic anti american joke of a church.

who were those vermin lynching jews. note most of these attackers traveled to jewish enclaves. theses were middle easterners who forgot col bernies word games with zionism.

joe biden has less braincells than some of the items in the produce bin.

done with mlb





i have decided to stop watching or caring about mlb. the decision to move the all star game was the final straw.

sports is a business and it is long past time for athlettes and their leagues to  start  respecting  fans. blm is a communist organized group with a lengthy history of violence. crime is an issue in the inner city. however, almost all  of these cases involve career criminals on drugs. 

i loved mlb but will not struggle to find new things to do.

just wonderful folk





i went to the funeral of aows husband. he was a  great man and it was a wonderful service with wonderful people. my only disappointment was i wanted to hear the word ribald used in a sentence.

the pastor was a decent man of faith who gets nyc inside jokes. he asked me if i see antisemitic types at work.  i said there was a lunatic ranting jesus was a palestinian. however he was a product  of our local public schools and his litteracy is defficient. we have another one who roots for the egyptians when watching   the ten comandments. i reminded him how the film ends.

pastor  why did you watch the film. you read the book. he assured me he loves that film.  apparently even young kids watch it.

left unsaid men of faith like good natured humor. apparently news of our public schools  has made it to virginia.

i did meet warren and aow is wonderful as always. i  miss dave and her feisty russian blue cat. there are those that love siamese but if  i could have any cat it would be  a russian blue  fearless, spunky  and personable.

talking about race with a coworker i disagree with but respect 





i work with a wide array of people. one such person has a reputation for being impossible with mgt. however,  she is personable and respectful to peers. there are people  i refuse to talk to because i view them as troublesome.

the subject of vaccination came  up. she made it clear, she was  sitting it  out. she stated the history of the usa with blacks and vaccines. i stated true enough but the country mistreated plenty of people. imbecile and idiot were legal terms used to sterilize people. even shirley temple films have cringeworthy racist parts. yet the films are reflective of a  time where a racist society forced blacks to different facilities.

yes some of the material  is cringeworthy. i am not a fan of gone with the wind. the notion of a noble lost cause for confederacy is stupid. yet you have clowns pretentding a similar theme for marxism. we still have col bernie waxing about singing folk songs in saunas while men of faith sat in gulags for seeking to emigrate. rationalizing marxist abuses while hyperventalating about the usa and israel is the norm with this crew. 

i respect the integrity of this person. you can understand where she is comming from. she also knows my family is just that regardless of color or religion.

i took some headaches about a coworker that i havent spoken since i arrived. this person has taken it upon herself to snitch over minor matters. i do acknowledge i avoid this person because it appears she is constantly looking for a fight. furthermore, there are people of all races that get similar treatment. if one is negative or hostile i wont waste my time. in  my world it is okay  to disagree as long  as we respect  each other. coworkers shouldnt snitch over minor matters and a snitch in my area will find themselves in for years of being an unperson.

i am a rudy republican . the 
peril of being a moderate is 
that at times you get hit from
both sides. some say i am at the edge of the great gop tent. radical leftists call me a rightwing extreemist.yet in the end all we can ever be
