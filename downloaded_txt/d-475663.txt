“the food was excellent! service was great! environment was… well let’s just say it’s almost stepped into time machine and went back into the 50’s-60’s. i highly recommend checking this place out.”

“one of my favorite places to just go in and relax. i’ve been here twice for breakfast and it’s amazing, but my preferred time is at night, right after work. place is not as crowded and you still get their amazing service.”
