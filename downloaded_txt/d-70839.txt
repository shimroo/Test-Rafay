welcome to metzer farms
 











welcome to metzer farms. we are a family-owned farm and hatchery that has been in business since 1972. we control all aspects of nutrition, breeding, selection, incubation, and hatching to ensure you the highest quality of day-old birds.

we specialize in waterfowl, hatching 32 breeds of ducks and 13 breeds of geese. we also hatch french pearl guineas and heritage turkeys, as well as two breeds of chickens (cornish cross and brown egg layer chickens).

it is easy for you to enjoy the thrill of raising a baby duckling or gosling into adulthood. our minimum order quantity is three ducklings or  two goslings so you do not have to raise more birds than you want. we also hatch ducks year round. whereas most hatcheries stop hatching in june or july, we hatch pekin and mallard year round and our other breeds of ducks from february through early december. our chickens are hatched year round for those of you wanting to grow chickens commercially for local restaurants or farmers' markets.

testimonials














everybody is doing just fine. just wanted to thank you for the great, responsive service-and the beautiful welsh harelquin ducklings.
robin from freeland, washington


i have been very pleased with all of my ducks and geese so far!! they have brought a lot of life, joy and laughter and helped in cleaning up all the extra growth around the farm. the added bonus is also the fertilizer they added back to the soil.
leah from blacksburg, virginia


thank you for your excellent customer service! my goslings arrived safe and sound today and faster than expected!
hilary from pryor, oklahoma


your staff is a lot more helpful than other hatcheries when i was learning & asking things so thank you.
marci from burlington, washington


thank you for such great service and stock. i am raising these in my class before they make a permanent home with me this summer.
deirdre from eureka, california


i got my ducklings this morning and they are absolutely beautiful and in great shape. thank you so much for all of your help and please tell ashley i said thanks to her too. you guys are the best!!! i love my little babies. i was afraid when i had them pinioned they would have a big hole in their wings but you can't even tell it! i was so happy to get them and see how healthy they are. thanks again for all your help with this matter and for being such a great place to order from.
debbie from pataskala, ohio


i received my 11 ducklings wednesday, 6/5, after being hatched monday morning 6/3. two day shipment to my home in panama, new york is great!! all 11 baby ducklings arrived healthy and lively, and remain that way.
janis from panama, new york


just wanted to say that your company has really been fantastic! quality birds, excellent customer service and policies. thank you for doing what you do and doing it so well!
lindsay from port angeles, washington


you all are my favorite hatchery. excellent, stellar customer service and wonderful healthy babies.
meryl from westford, vermont


our daughters will be showing at the fair this next fall and i know with this flock they will place well. hope to deal with you again as we continue to expand our flock.
tom from overbrook, kansas


i wanted to let you know how much i appreciate the care you took in getting the duck eggs i ordered shipped to me. i had trouble finding a local place to get duck eggs to hatch. i was leary of ordering online. the eggs were packaged so well and i received them in pennsylvania all intact. my four kids are excited to go through the process. i know you may only receive complaints. i candled my 14 eggs and only two are questionable. i am very happy with my experience and would recommend you in the future!
april from millerstown, pennsylvania


they’re all seemingly doing great and i am very happy with metzer farms. this was my first order of any birds from you guys and i’m very impressed. i will be ordering from you guys again for ducklings and possibly guineas later in the future.
davinity from bristow, oklahoma


we just received our golden 300's. they arrived safe and sound. we are so excited to add them to our flock when they get a little bigger. thanks so much!
glen from grimesland, north carolina


i hope this email finds you well. i just want to thank you for sending the extra eggs. i really appreciate it.  they arrived today safe and sound. we will keep you posted. wishing you all the best.
paulo from new york, new york
