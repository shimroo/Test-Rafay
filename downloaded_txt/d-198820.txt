dakar rally 2017: winners, final results and reaction


sam sunderland became britain's first dakar rally winner on saturday, as his lead of over 30 minutes in the bike category never came under threat during the final stage.
sebastien loeb was unable to bridge the gap to team-mate stephane peterhansel in the car category, giving the latter the overall win in the 2017 edition of the race.
here's a look at the final standings in the cars, bikes, trucks and quads races:


sunderland took it easy during the final stage toward the argentinian capital buenos aires, knowing only a major mechanical failure could keep him from the win. the final stage had joint winners, as gerrard farres and adrien van beveren finished in the same time.

dakar rally 2017: results, reaction and updated route schedule after thursday


stephane peterhansel, sergey karyakin and eduard nikolaev were among the winners when the 2017 dakar rally resumed on thursday. peterhansel remains the rally leader after being given back time following a serious crash.
peterhansel's stage win was awarded in slightly controversial fashion when he was given time back after being involved in a crash with simon marcic. sebastian loeb thought he had the overall lead before peterhansel was given back the missing minutes and awarded both the stage win and the top spot in the rankings.
there was also controversy in the bike category when michael metge had an apparent stage win cancelled out because of a late time penalty. ultimately, the stage win went to metge's team-mate joan barreda.
