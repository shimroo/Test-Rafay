daniel fraser, edinburgh. extraordinary historic mannlicher-schoenauer, “take-down” action, african sporting rifle, #2846, in 6.5x 53r dutch, completed for a british baronet, sir alfred e. pease, in the early 1890's.                                                                                                      sir alfred's prowess as a lion hunter was widely known and highly regarded throughout africa, so much so that theodore roosevelt, in preparation for his legendary, year long, african safari in 1909, chose sir alfred to introduce him to lion hunting. t.r.'s first stop on his safari was a prolonged stay with sir alfred and lady pease at their home, “kitanga”, in the athi plains of kenya, east africa. during his stay there he and sir alfred became fast friends and the first three chapter's of roosevelt's classic book,                                                                                “african game trails”                                  , relate his and his son kermit's adventures while staying there.                                                        later, in 1913, pease published his classic,                                                                                “book of the lion”                                  , which is an absolute must read                                                                                for anyone with any interest in african hunting during the golden age of the late 19                                  th                                                                                and early 20                                  th                                                                                century. in his book sir alfred refers to the fraser rifle as                                                                                “ his constant companion since 1892”                                                                                                                              and continues on to extol it's many virtues and give his reasons for choosing it over the more common larger bores, which you will better understand when you learn more about his unorthodox method of chasing lions across the plains on horseback, dropping the reins at full gallop, and dispatching the lion with the little .256 !                                                                                                      if you are in any way interested, go to the link below for the complete, 29 minute, uncut                                                                                version of the “shooting usa – histories guns” video interview that ran on the outdoor channel a few months ago.                                                                                                                                              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2pva9y_rja&t=44s                                                                                                                                                          description:                                                      weight: 7 ½ lbs. stock: 14 ½” lop. superb 26” steel barrel with excellent bore and very precise open sights consisting of a single fixed 100 yd. rear sight with 3 folding leaves out to 400 yd., and a tiny spirit level like those found on the best long range target rifles of an earlier era. the ramp front sight has a very thin blade with a tiny round porcelain dot affixed to the rear, and a larger flip-up twilight bead. in addition, there is a lyman folding, windage and elevation adjustable, peep sight located just behind the rear tang of the action that, when brought into play, brings the rear sight, front sight, and target all into near perfect focus at the same time! now, for most of us old-timers who grew up using open sights, that over-simplified explanation will be superfluous, however, i have been around enough to realize there are lots of younger folks hunting out there who have never had to depend on anything other than scopes. well, enough of that …. the point i want to make is that this little rifle has the best configuration of open sights i have had the pleasure of shooting in recent memory, perhaps ever, and, assuming proper lighting conditions, i would not hesitate to use it on certain types of game out to 200 yards. the silky smooth action is fitted with a “fraser patent” trigger group which incorporates an ingenious and mechanically rather simple intercepting safety sear which i have never before seen on a bolt action rifle. barrel “take-down” is accomplished by removing the large knurled set screw in the left side of the action, then unscrewing the barrel from the action. the highly figured stock, with game log carved into the right side, records 36 species of game, 100 animals, harvested with this rifle between 1900 and 1909 in southern africa, sudan somali land, british east africa kenya colony, and perhaps india (bear). “kongoni”, is swahili for wildebeest/coke’s hartebeest … african species of grassland antelope … 17 taken. also note the number of hippo, lion, and leopard!                                                                     this magnificent little rifle has been lovingly preserved for well over a century and has never been offered for public sale. complete provenance provided by my dear friend, guy bignell of griffin and howe, accompanies the gun which comes complete in it’s original case with trade label, original elephant hide sling, and all original accessories including cartridge clips. at our behest, mike ehinger worked up the loads for the rifle.                                              please note the attached targets!                                               in addition there are about 120 rounds of loaded ammo, a few rounds of new brass, and a rare first edition copy of,                                                                                            “book of the lion”, by sir alfred e. pease, bart.                                  , which accompany the gun.                                                        overall an incredibly rare, deadly accurate, completely genuine, piece of african history and rather poignant reminder of days that will never be again. the ideal gift for some very special and dedicated young hunter who desires to carry on the traditions of that bygone era.                                      price on request

daniel fraser, edinburgh. extraordinary historic mannlicher-schoenauer, “take-down” action, african sporting rifle, #2846, in 6.5x 53r dutch, completed for a british baronet, sir alfred e. pease, in the early 1890's.                                                                                                      sir alfred's prowess as a lion hunter was widely known and highly regarded throughout africa, so much so that theodore roosevelt, in preparation for his legendary, year long, african safari in 1909, chose sir alfred to introduce him to lion hunting. t.r.'s first stop on his safari was a prolonged stay with sir alfred and lady pease at their home, “kitanga”, in the athi plains of kenya, east africa. during his stay there he and sir alfred became fast friends and the first three chapter's of roosevelt's classic book,                                                                                “african game trails”                                  , relate his and his son kermit's adventures while staying there.                                                        later, in 1913, pease published his classic,                                                                                “book of the lion”                                  , which is an absolute must read                                                                                for anyone with any interest in african hunting during the golden age of the late 19                                  th                                                                                and early 20                                  th                                                                                century. in his book sir alfred refers to the fraser rifle as                                                                                “ his constant companion since 1892”                                                                                                                              and continues on to extol it's many virtues and give his reasons for choosing it over the more common larger bores, which you will better understand when you learn more about his unorthodox method of chasing lions across the plains on horseback, dropping the reins at full gallop, and dispatching the lion with the little .256 !                                                                                                      if you are in any way interested, go to the link below for the complete, 29 minute, uncut                                                                                version of the “shooting usa – histories guns” video interview that ran on the outdoor channel a few months ago.                                                                                                                                              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2pva9y_rja&t=44s                                                                                                                                                          description:                                                      weight: 7 ½ lbs. stock: 14 ½” lop. superb 26” steel barrel with excellent bore and very precise open sights consisting of a single fixed 100 yd. rear sight with 3 folding leaves out to 400 yd., and a tiny spirit level like those found on the best long range target rifles of an earlier era. the ramp front sight has a very thin blade with a tiny round porcelain dot affixed to the rear, and a larger flip-up twilight bead. in addition, there is a lyman folding, windage and elevation adjustable, peep sight located just behind the rear tang of the action that, when brought into play, brings the rear sight, front sight, and target all into near perfect focus at the same time! now, for most of us old-timers who grew up using open sights, that over-simplified explanation will be superfluous, however, i have been around enough to realize there are lots of younger folks hunting out there who have never had to depend on anything other than scopes. well, enough of that …. the point i want to make is that this little rifle has the best configuration of open sights i have had the pleasure of shooting in recent memory, perhaps ever, and, assuming proper lighting conditions, i would not hesitate to use it on certain types of game out to 200 yards. the silky smooth action is fitted with a “fraser patent” trigger group which incorporates an ingenious and mechanically rather simple intercepting safety sear which i have never before seen on a bolt action rifle. barrel “take-down” is accomplished by removing the large knurled set screw in the left side of the action, then unscrewing the barrel from the action. the highly figured stock, with game log carved into the right side, records 36 species of game, 100 animals, harvested with this rifle between 1900 and 1909 in southern africa, sudan somali land, british east africa kenya colony, and perhaps india (bear). “kongoni”, is swahili for wildebeest/coke’s hartebeest … african species of grassland antelope … 17 taken. also note the number of hippo, lion, and leopard!                                                                     this magnificent little rifle has been lovingly preserved for well over a century and has never been offered for public sale. complete provenance provided by my dear friend, guy bignell of griffin and howe, accompanies the gun which comes complete in it’s original case with trade label, original elephant hide sling, and all original accessories including cartridge clips. at our behest, mike ehinger worked up the loads for the rifle.                                              please note the attached targets!                                               in addition there are about 120 rounds of loaded ammo, a few rounds of new brass, and a rare first edition copy of,                                                                                            “book of the lion”, by sir alfred e. pease, bart.                                  , which accompany the gun.                                                        overall an incredibly rare, deadly accurate, completely genuine, piece of african history and rather poignant reminder of days that will never be again. the ideal gift for some very special and dedicated young hunter who desires to carry on the traditions of that bygone era.                                      price on request
