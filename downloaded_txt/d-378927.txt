about peace and justice works 


 peace and justice works [pjw], formerly known as portland peaceworks, 
 
is 
an 
oregon non-
profit corporation whose main purpose is to educate the general public 
on important issues including but not limited to: peace, justice, the environment, and human rights.  

          organizationally, much of peace and justice works' activities are conducted through project 
groups, 
also known as affinity groups. peace and justice works is primarily an umbrella 
organization 
which disseminates information on the tragedy of military interventions and military 
spending, 
builds coalitions among groups whose goals intersect with our own.
 (we began as a chapter of the state-wide group oregon peaceworks, 
which ceased operations at the end of april, 2013.) 
we participate in annual hiroshima day commemorations, and 
various community activities with other peace and justice organizations. 


pjw has helped organize and coordinate multiple major mobilizations for 
peace 
since late 2002 with various other groups seeking to end (and 
prevent) the wars in iraq and afghanistan.

        previously, one of our largest activities was the peace 
and justice fair, held on 
memorial day (1992-
1995, 
1997, 1999) to remember those who gave their lives in war 
by working toward a world without 
war. the community event involved 
the neighborhood surrounding irving park as well as activists 
from all over the region, 
musicians, food, children's activities and speakers.  literature from many 
groups was distributed to make this an educational event as well as a celebration.



while project groups can (by our bylaws) be created or disbanded 
from time to time, existing groups at this time are:

 (i) portland copwatch
(ii) iraq affinity group
(iii) sarajevo peace centre/people's aid to former yugoslavia.

(iv) pentagon porkbusters
(v) portland soa watchers

        nothing stated above limits peace and justice works to the project groups listed.  
as circumstances develop, we will begin other projects.   our overall mission will remain 
to educate the general public on issues including but not limited to peace, justice, 
the environment and human rights.



*pjw does not endorse
facebook 
but recognizes its usefulness as an organizing tool
