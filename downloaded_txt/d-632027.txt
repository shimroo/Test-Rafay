dear valued customers,
the health and safety of our customers and associates is a top priority, and our thoughts are with those impacted by the novel coronavirus (covid-19) global pandemic. since it first surfaced, all about pest has been monitoring the situation closely. we’re taking every precaution to keep our customers, associates, and our communities safe.
with the effects of the outbreak being felt more each day, we wanted to share what we have been doing so you can continue to utilize all about pest with confidence.
·        our equipment is cleaned daily, and we recently increased the frequency of cleaning throughout the day with a focus on highly used equipment.
·        we’re encouraging all employees to take common-sense health precautions recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), such as frequent hand washing or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol to stay healthy.
·        customers can utilize our convenient services as they always have, or if customers prefer to forgo interior treatment, we will treat the exterior to keep control of pest activity in the coming months.
·        while we appreciate the incredible dedication of our employees, we’re reminding them to stay home if they are sick and to use our paid time-off options so that they and their families do not suffer financially.
all of these safeguards and precautions are made with you in mind. they are based on recommendations from local, state, and federal health officials whose experts are working tirelessly to safeguard our health. we will continue to follow guidance from health agencies and government officials to maintain a safe and effective service for everyone.
thank you for being part of our family. we look forward to continuing to serve you and your property.
sincerely,
bridget taylor
director of operations
