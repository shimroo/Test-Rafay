welcome to the diningguide networksm of restaurant directories, part of the  
metroguide.network® of online city guides. diningguide is an online service 
consisting of an independent directory of restaurant profiles and a forum for restaurants to post their information. 
we encourage all our readers to share their dining experiences and suggest restaurants for us to profile.


since 1993, the diningguide service has pioneered interactive programs for restaurants. 
from coast to coast and around the world, diningguide network presents tantalizing insights 
on regional cuisines, traditions and trends. diningguide also lists food of the day and other dining-related special days in our diningguide today! section.


with the diningguide service, you can zero in on restaurants wherever you plan to go, choosing by either 
location or cuisine. where available, we also provide links to discount dining options, menus and 
reservation services at selected restaurants.


to use our diningguide-brand restaurant directories simply scroll down to the geographic area that interests you. many of the diningguide destinations
have links that you can use to obtain 
events, 
shopping, 
hotel, 
nightlife, 
attractions 
and other information for select cities.
