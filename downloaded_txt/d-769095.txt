innovating with technology
the city of olathe set out to create a digital transformation, but instead, they got a more transparent, informed, and united city. with the government experience cloud at the center, city of olathe modernized government operations from top to bottom.

"olathe's success can also be measured by its ability to continue evolving and adding to its experience, knowing everything will work seamlessly together."
scott meyer, digital programs manager

transforming engagement
king county elections knew they wanted to increase washington’s voter turnout, they just didn’t know how. partnering with the granicus experience group, we worked to increase transparency in the vote-by-mail process, which led to higher turnout in elections. 

"this feels like an exercise in radical transparency [leading to] greater turn out, greater cure rates, and more voices being heard.”
jaclyn adams, project manager

serving critical communities
in the first two years of working with granicus experience group (gxg), department of veterans affairs national center for ptsd increased subscribers by 275% and increased annual pledge support 400% during ptsd awareness month. 

“if it hadn’t been for the gxg partnership there would have been no way for us to know the difference in types of communications our audience wanted and needed."
