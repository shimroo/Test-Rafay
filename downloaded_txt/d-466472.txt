  why are employee recognition awards important?  


employee recognition for positive behavior motivates employees to continue in a way that earns recognition again. however, recognizing employees is not a one-time event. in fact, if it is just a one-time event, it will be widely ignored by staff members. instead, employee recognition needs to be part of the culture of the organization in order to be effective.
