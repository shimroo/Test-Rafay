tom waits in new jarmusch movie







tom waits will feature in a new jim jarmusch movie called father mother sister brother, variety reports. the picture will also have a strong musical component, jarmusch has said, according to variety, contradicting earlier reports that suggested there might be very little or no music at all.  the movie - “a comedy interwoven with threads of melancholy” - also stars adam driver, mayim bialik, charlotte rampling, indya moore and luka sabbat, and is expected to be finished later this year.
