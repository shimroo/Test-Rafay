we’re keeping faith in the family … and in your family










sally and clay clarkson















whole heart ministries began with the desire to strengthen families in the lord. from that seed, we imagined and envisioned how we could equip christian parents, and how we could give them help and hope to raise wholehearted children for christ. since 1994, we’ve been wholeheartedly committed to keeping faith in the family. let us help you keep faith in your family on your own journey of christian parenting.













mission





we’re giving help and hope to christian parents … like yousince 1994 our mission as a christian home and parenting ministry has never changed—we encourage, equip, enable, and engage christian parents because we believe in god’s design and purpose for the family. we want to send wholehearted children into the next generation who will serve christ and his kingdom. click a button below to read more about our mission and ministries on whole heart blog.













encouragingour heart is to encourage the hearts of christian parents to raise wholehearted children who will live for christ.













equippingwhole heart is at its heart a discipleship ministry—we equip parents and children to follow jesus wholeheartedly.













enablingwe work to create and place into hands of christian parents resources, tools, and ideas to shape their children’s hearts.













engagingwe create ways to connect christian parents in virtual community, in small groups, in events, and other ways.
