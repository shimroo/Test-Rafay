	 g&l korina collection guitars coming soon!
    


g&l has just announced a new line of limited edition korina wood guitars, and we are fortunate enough to have a few of them coming our way in august.korina wood was the wood used for the first gibson explorers and flying v's. korina is a rare tone wood. it is lightweight and balanced, and it produces a very resonant tone.the guitars also feature pao ferro fretboards.korina collection asat junior iikorina collection asat deluxe iikorina collection asat classic bluesboythe asat junior ii model and the deluxe model have a gibson-style setup on the bridge and the tailpiece. the asat junior ii is also the first g&l model to feature p90s. looking at the wood package and the design of these guitars, they really are the best of both worlds between a tele and a les paul. these are part of a limited production run and they are selling fast. if you want one, give us a call or email us and let us know. we have four on the way, coming in late august, and we will likely be ordering more as well. don't miss out!

	 epiphone b3 bass - back in action!
    


erick (one of the owners here) owns an epiphone double bass. about a year ago, it was damaged in an unfortunate incident on stage. he's been making do with various borrowed basses during that time, but they really weren't cutting it. this was the bass that he learned to play on, and it had taken on a personality of its own.a little history: erick bought the bass in 1993, and it had a broken neck at the heel at that time. he repaired it at the shop, and put on a new ebony fingerboard.at that time, he didn't really know much about the age of the bass, but he has recently been in contact with wendy at bassmonkey.net, and she has helped us to fill in some of the blanks. it turns out that erick's bass is an extremely rare epiphone b3. the bass was built in late 1939/early 1940. it is #149, and epiphone probably started numbering at 100.erick played it actively for several years after restoring it, and then the neck separated again. he repaired it again, and all was well until february 2009, when someone tripped over it on stage at a car show and smashed in the face. ugh. there are no words.erick took it to our very good friends at stevens violin shop, and they did some of the heavy lifting, repairing the cracks in the face and doing quite a bit of intricate inlay work. then erick brought the bass back to our shop and put the finishing touches on it, just in time for a recording session with jp and the rhythm chasers.he had ordered some new labella gut strings from tone king musical accessories, but while waiting for them to arrive, he put the three year old gut strings back on it, to try it out.his reaction:"even with the dead three year old strings, this bass sounds better than any of the others i've played. i feel like i can breathe again. i can play things i haven't been able to play in over a year. i can't tell you how great it feels to have my bass back."the new strings arrived in plenty of time for the recording session, and of course now it sounds even better.here are some more shots:gorgeous flame maple back

	 1949 gibson es-5, a guitar with a soul!
    


we are so excited to have this guitar on consignment in our shop. we have known the owner since the 1960s. this guitar is really special, everyone who has played it has remarked on its incredible sound and feel.details:the serial number would indicate that this is a 1950, but since the f-holes are unbound, it is from 1949. also we have recently confirmed that there were less than 20 of these guitars built in 1949, so this is from the first series.all the electronics are original except the output jack.the master tone control knob is not original, but all other knobs are originalthere is a non original bone nut installed, and the guitar has been refretted professional (by us), with the original fingerboard binding intact.it has grover rotomatic tuning machines, not original, and the back of the headstock has been touched up where the original tuning machines were placed.other than that repair, all of the finish is stock.the bridge is not original, and has been pinned to the top with small concealed pins (this can be reversed if desired)the tailpiece is a non original, but factory tailpiece, so it fits with the style of the guitar really well.overall, this guitar is in really good condition. it has been lovingly played for many years by a gigging musician, and taken care of very well. it is most definitely a players guitar.if you are looking for pristine collectors item, this guitar is not for you. but if you are a serious, gigging musician, or a hobbyist, you will love this guitar.as you might have gathered, this guitar has special meaning to us, and we want to find a good home for it, where it will be played and appreciated. come on in and check it out, or give us a call with questions. you can also see it on our online store.
