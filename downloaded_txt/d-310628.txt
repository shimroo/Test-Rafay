natural natural wonders
thank you to everyone to attended my solo exhibition in jan-march 2023. below is  some general information about the event for archival purposes. i am currently accepting commissions and  have  prints and sculptures from the show available for purchase.

~
 jan-mar 2023: “natural natural wonders” is a solo exhibition of new nature  inspired mixed media and digital collage by sue jenkins. works are colorful, at times abstract,  with a sprinkling of mystery, a dash of solitude, and a touch of surrealist  whimsy. using elements like scanned objects, handmade marks,  botanical illustrations, acrylic paints, and cut paper with her photos, the  artist crafts richly layered nature inspired worlds filled with plants,  animals, and vibrant color. works  on view include digital collage prints on canvas, poster prints, reproductions  of works on paper, mixed media collage, mixed media on wood panels, and an  art/poetry book reclamation project.collectively, the works echo the  artist’s biophilic yearning to make work that inspires others to embrace earth  and live in harmony with all of nature. for further information about commissions and sales, message the artist here or contact the gallery at gallery@marywood.edu or  570-348-6278. this event is  free and open to the public.
