romania episode v- for volcanoes! 


seeing the mud volcanoes (paclele mari) close to bucau was one of the things that i had planned from the really beginning of this trip. little that i knew that at the moment that i arrived at the neighboring campground, the volcanoes where the really last thing i was caring about.
