“we never imagined that a superb education could be so natural and low-stress for our kids. they wake up every morning eager to go to school, and come home every afternoon excited to share what they’ve learned. our kids have outstanding teachers, are part of a close-knit and caring community, and benefit from a curriculum that is perfectly in tune with each year of their lives. waldorf is truly the best that education has to offer.”

— wsl parents
