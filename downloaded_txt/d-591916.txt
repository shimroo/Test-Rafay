(1)hologram sticker security, types, effects
holographic master originations play a very key role in the hologram manufacturing

holographic master origination is a nickel shim mold to make holographic sticker. different master originations have different hologram effects and security. 


dot-matrix hologram






						  
                          dot-matrix holographic label allows implementing unlimited computer controlled and laser beam engraved dots in hologram. this dot-matrix hologram is the result of designs comprising many tiny hologrram dots. these millions  grating dots viewing angles and  position are controlled by  software. they create a beautiful impact of variable images. e-beam hologram has much more dots than dot-matrix. 

 2d/3d hologram






						  
                          2d/3d hologram is made up of multiple two dimensional layers with holographic images visually placed one behind another with visual depth to produce an effect of three-dimensional holographic structure by laser optical recording. it has very colorful and clear visual depth between different layers. optical recording 2d or 2d/3d has better sharpness and colorful grating than dot-matrix and e-beam. 


 true color hologram






						  
                          true color holographic label is made up of photographic quality portrait art-work with natual color.  if counterfeiter can not get  original portrait, they won't be able to duplicate similair hologram close to original one. it's a very good way to achieve anti-counterfeit performance by true color hologram combined with 2d, 2d/3d and dot-matrix hologram with animation effect and viewing depth.  
 2d hologram






						  
                          2d holographic sticker is made up of two dimensional images. the holographic images are assigned different colors and position in one layer. different color seperation images and text are on surface, without visual depth.  2d hologram has the highest  brightness and sharpness in colorful   text and logo. it won't have vague result as e beam or 3d hologram when view outside of door. 




3d hologram  stereogram, 3d model hologram, 3d photopolymer






3d stereogram hologram is made of hologram images more than 30 flips by optical 3d hologram system. it's not possible  to copy similair effect 3d hologram successfully from exsist sample. 3d model hologam is recorded from a small sculpture model by different angles laser beams. recombination of 3d stereogram hologram with 2d/3d, dot-matrix, 2d, clr hidden text, miron text and kinematic guilloche elements has high security.
 
 digital and e-beam 3d hologram with clr covert image and overt security features 







digital 3d hologram is made of  e-beam dots by electronic beam or dot-matrix by laser beam which are controlled by software. the e-beam hologram can make nano text as well as 3d-2d switch, animated clr and multilevel clr. it also incorporates  3d, 2d/3d,  2d, hidden text,flip-flops and kinematic  elements which is computer synthesized. 


 kinematic movement, like guilloche lines, zooming, switching, rotation, pillar light, raster effect 
                          





kinematic movement holographic image can be made both by 2d/3d and dot-matrix type holographic. 2d/3d holographic kinematic movement comes a sequential different viewing angle holographic lines with different color separation. dot-matrix holographic kinematic movement effect is more smoothly. with our special digital  and 2d/3d hologram technologies, customized design logo or graph can be incorporated onto good kinematic movement holographic-patterns.

laser reveal hidden text(clr images) and moire hidden text in hologram





 
                         hidden text or image contains unique encrypted images or text, invisible to the naked eye and detectable by means of a pocket reader. laser readable hidden text or image just can be seen with special laser pointer (or called laser reader). morie hidden text just can be revealed when you cover decode film on the holographic sticker encode area. these are covert secutity features. we can make high security dynamic clr and multilevel clr with morie covert features together.  


flip-flop hologram, multichannel switch and micron switch effect






2d/3d, dot-matrix, ebeam hologram allows display two images or more from different viewing angle. when the viewing angle changes horizontally (left to right) or vertically (upside and down), different images evolve through the hologram. this switch effect with multichannels are overt features. 
 micro text or image in hologram, nano text, concealed images and other overt security 





 
                          micro text or micro image in holographic is difficult to be seen clearly by naked eye . it's close visual inspection clearly by by magnifier. nano text is  smaller than micron text.   
                          security flash light and len effect, speckle effect, random interference fringes, matt color, also give good security and appearance.



combination of hologram






						  
                          combination hologram creates an impact that has extra-ordinary viewing effects and also security features. usually, it's good to combine 2d, 2d/3d and dot-matrix holographic which has good sharpness of 2d, kinematic movements of dot-matrix and viewing depth of 2d/3d holographic image with hidden text, micron text. to improve security, we suggest to use void, honeycomb, original tamper evident parttern released material and add sequential numbers by laser etching or de-metalization. 
 

transparent hologram sticker and transparent hologram decal for mobile screen






						  
                          transparent holographic sticker is see through type holographic sticker. we have tamper-proof and non tamper proof transparent holographic sticker which prevent photocopying and forgeries of document  with clear see through view. we also have transparent holographic id card overlays

(2)security of hologram sticker material and numbering 


pattern released material, serial numbers, security slit and special shape die-cutting can improve security 


 pressure tamper evident hologram sticker






                          tamper-proof also called pressure sensitive or tamper evident. tamper-proof holographic sticker will be damaged when it's removed. tamper-proof holographic sticker's holographic image cannot be removed without being destroyed. then sticker cannot be reused anymore. 

 void pattern release tamper evident,   honeycomb pattern release tamper evident,   original pattern tamper evident,    pattern release tamper evident holographic sticker leaves customized design word or image residue which is separated from aluminum layer when hologram sticker is damaged. overprinting release holographic sticker leaves over printing word or image in red, black and other colors. 



 non pressure tamper evident hologram sticker






						  
                          non pressure tamper evident holographic sticker's image won't be damaged when it's torn off from surface on which it's pasted such as paper, glass and plastic card, etc. most of transparent hologram overlay is non tamper proof hologram. the non tamper proof hologram sticker is widely use on textile tag which is washable. 

 serial number on  hologram sticker has laser etched serial number and black ink number. hologram special shape cutting  also helps to enhance hologram security and appearance.
						  
						    





						  
                          serial running number or random number is additional security feature in holographic sticker. they are widely used to improve management of goods and anti-counterfeit ability. customer also can print barcode/logo/serial number on our spoon hologram in roll  by   barcode thermal printer. we also make dual/triple serial number





 






(3)different color and thicknees of holographic sticker material 


different color and thickness of pet material is available 



silver, golden, blue, red, green color and transparent pet metallized film
 
                          metallized pet film has different 
                        colors. more than 90% holographic sticker is made of silver and golden color material because silver and golden material has best holographic effect. other color material as blue, red, green also is available.  

25micron, 36micron, 50micron, 100micron 
                          thickness fet metallized film
 
                        we have different thickness of holographic sticker base material-metalized aluminum film in thickness of 25 micron, 36micron, 50micron, 100 micron. we  have different pressure sensitive material to make different holographic sticker. 25 micron  is default thickness of our holographic stikcers.
