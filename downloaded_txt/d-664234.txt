louisiana cops give late ball asst police chief carl bordelon huge sendoff


no one will ever accuse wst... of being a pro-cop blog but to witness the fantastic turn out to the funeral for late ball, louisiana, assistant police chief, carl bordelon was an amazing, if not heartwarming sight to behold.

perhaps, we felt that way today because we remember all too well the spring 2006 incident he was a party to and the barrage of international criticism that he had to endure.

update: rapides trustee-inmate walks off during bordelon funeral


for immediate release to the media 

 at approximately 1:30 this afternoon, a road crew inmate assigned to work at a local church, fled the work detail and stole a truck that was on the parking lot at the church. 

 the inmate is christopher charles bailey, white male, 43 years of age, 6’4” tall, 170 pounds, black hair and blue eyes.

 bailey is serving time for a burglary conviction.  due to his non violent conviction, he was assigned to a work crew that goes all over the parish, picking up trash or clearing brush.

 this crew, supervised by a deputy,  was clearing brush at a church in the 2700 block of la highway 28 east in pineville.

 according to initial reports, the inmate fled the work crew and accessed a truck that was on the lot with the keys left in it.  he was last seen traveling east on la highway 28 east in a 2000 ford f-150, blue in color bearing louisiana license x924079.

 sheriff’s office detectives and corrections security personnel have responded to the scene and are conducting the investigation.

 bailey was last seen wearing blue denim jeans, an orange shirt and a blue denim jacket with the letters rpdc on the back.  bailey is not considered dangerous.

 if anyone has seen this inmate or this vehicle, you are asked to call the rapides parish sheriff’s office at 318 473 6700 or 911 to report any sighting.

ball, la. asst. police chief carl bordelon of richard lee mcnair dash cam fame passes away


we were saddened yesterday when the following tweet from kalb tv5 appeared in our timeline:

the ball police department has announced that its assistant chief of police, carl bordelon, has passed away. pic.twitter.com/dhjrfqhwrt
— kalb news channel 5 (@kalbtv5) january 10, 2015====
source - town of ball, la. official website==== carl bordelon is of course the ball, louisiana, policeman who in early april 2006 gained some level of international fame due to the dash cam video of his roadside interview of federal inmate escapee richard lee mcnair.


in 2010, canadian crime reporter, byron christopher, interviewed bordelon - the only interview mr. bordelon ever granted - for his book,"the man who mailed himself out of jail" about richard lee mcnair and his escape from u.s.penitentiary pollock, louisiana.  mr. bordelon was one of several law enforcement officers to whom mr. christopher dedicated his book.

this morning, we spoke by phone to byron christopher at his home in edmonton, alberta, canada. mr. christopher wanted to talk about the time he spent here with mr. bordelon and the influence that bordelon made on his life. they had remained on friendly terms throughout the intervening years and spoke occasionally.

mr. christopher had this to say to any of mr. bordelon's family who might happen across this post: "if any members of  his family are listening to this, i want you to know that mr. bordelon had made quite an impact with me and i'am going to miss him and that i was proud of him. i want you to tell them that."      

mr. christopher played a short clip of mr. bordelon explaining in his own words how the media focus had affected his life.  listen to the entire interview below:

central louisiana board of realtors files john doe suit in pursuit of emailer


this john doe suit was filed on 11 september 2013. interestingly is that it is only the second such suit filed in the 9th jdc and about a week after the first one, daniel slayter vs john doe docket no. 248272 -- which should be available online before long.

the petition, which is unverified, is filed by mark f. vilar, esq., of alexandria's vilar and elliot law firm on behalf of the central louisiana board of realtors claims that someone using the aol email address of board.office@aol.com and on 02 august 2013, "john doe sent an email message to the members of the board of realtors that contained disparaging and embarrassing information about a member of its board of directors." note: the board of directors email addresses are publicly available.

what's interesting is that nowhere in the petition is a claim stated for defamation or that the 'embarrassing information' about a board member isnt true -- just that the email address was created for the purpose of appearing to be an official email address and that "the board of directors does not know the identity of the person(s) who accessed its database and the membership mailing list and who sent the email message..."

that argument seems pretty flimsy. we bet that whoever sent the email message is a member of the board of realtors and already had everyone's email address. 

sure, it appears that the board.office@aol.com is an anonymous type email address, though not likely spam.

also, no copy of the email in question was entered into the record as an exhibit. the absence of the email tends to lead us to believe that its contents might be somewhat credible or believable and not the work of a hacker. plus no subpoenas as of the date and time of this post seeking information have been filed to aol either.

it's too late to catch rod noles today but someone should call his ksyl real estate talk show next wednesday and ask him what its all about.

the case is allotted to ninth judicial district court judge harry f. randow.

----original post----originally posted 1:16 pm 30 march 2006

today at 12:53 pm louisiana time we just happened to look out the kitchen window to notice that our fave hummingbird was buzzing around the spot where we always hang our feeder.

now this is interesting because the hummingbirds in years past usually return around 17 march - we noticed they didnt return last year until 01 april because like this year we had some late cold snaps.

there is no way you can tell us that they dont return to the same place every year - how else would they know to come to the exact spot where the feeder was hanging last year?

anyway heres how to make hummingbird nectar - mix 1 cup sugar to 4 cups water stir until dissolved.  there is no need to boil the water but you can if you want to.

do not! add food coloring to the nectar as that is unhealthy to the hummers and might kill them. the red color of the feeder is what attracts them, not the color of the nectar.

now soon you too will be able to enjoy the massive air wars around your place.

rapides regional medical center sued for snake infestation


the petition for damages of staci saucier and her husband joseph, states that on 02 april 2012 they were at rapides regional medical center with their daughter who was scheduled for surgery.

their daughter was brought into the surgery prep area and while waiting there with her, a nurse entered the room and moved a cart that was near the side of the room.

when the cart was moved it revealed a snake (what kind of snake the petition doesnt say but does it really matter?) coiled up and in the striking position.

not unexpectedly, the sight of a snake in there freaked ms. saucier out.  according to the petition she has a phobia of snakes.

ms. saucier fled from the room and struck a wall or the door which caused an injury to her person. also, according to the petition, the sight of a snake in the hospital aggravated a pre-existing condition and caused her great mental distress.

the petition for damages is filed by alexandria, la., attorney w. jay luneau of the luneau law office and is allotted to ninth judicial district court judge harry f. randow.

lt gov jay dardenne issues press release to tout management of department of culture recreation and tourism during budget crisis


a few  minutes ago, wst... received the following press release from lieutenant governor, jay dardenne:

march 18, 2013 

cami geisman
office of the lieutenant governor                       
225.342.1013

lt.gov. dardenne touts management of dcrt during budget crisis

lt. governor jay dardenne has not given merit raises to the classified or unclassified employees of the department of culture, recreation and tourism or office of the lt. governor during the past two fiscal years.

"we have a very hardworking staff, both classified and unclassified, many of whom are deserving of pay increases," lt. governor dardenne said. "but we try very hard to use the money we are budgeted to return even more revenue back to the state. we create jobs and earn money for louisiana."

since dardenne’s election in 2010 only two pay raises have been given; one was less than five percent to obiekezie agbasi, a state parks employee who was given additional duties and the other was to kristin sanders, an office of cultural development employee who earned an advanced degree and was assigned additional responsibilities.

in addition to serving as lt. governor, jay dardenne acts as secretary of the department of culture, recreation and tourism saving the state $130,000 annually.

alexandria la.'s haynes best western inn & suites & convention center sued in slip n fall


ahh slip-n-falls. whatever in the world would the courthouse crowd do without slip-n-falls (as well as divorces, protective orders and paternity cases) to give the appearance of actually doing something,  you know, to justify their tax parasite existence. luckily for them, louisiana lawyers are more than happy to provide them endlessly with.

according to the petition of mary l. doucett, of calcasieu parish, louisiana, on 20 january 2012, she  had just checked in at the front desk of the haynes best western inn and suites and conference center at 2720 north macarthur drive in alexandria, la.  and was in the process of looking for her room:

"when she fell as a result of a variation in elevation of the floor, causing her severe pain and discomfort, and fracturing her femoral shaft which required her to have surgery to repair the fracture with a intramedullary implant and which will require a surgery in the future."
ms. doucett "alleges that the damages sustained in this matter exceed the sum of $50,000, the threshold for a jury trial in state court."

the petition for damages was filed on 17 january 2013, by lake charles, louisiana, attorney, terry j. johnson, of the johnson and vercher law firm, is docketed at number: 246,448 and is allotted to ninth judicial district court judge john c. davidson.

george washington's vision and prophecy for the united states of america


son of the republic, look and learn!  


george washington's vision has been published from time to time and is recorded in the library of congress.
[...]
the place was valley forge, in the cold and bitter winter of 1777.

washington's army suffered several reverses and the situation was desperate. food was scarce. the continental congress was not sending supplies or money.

some of the troops did not even have shoes to wear in the snow. many soldiers were sick and dying from disease and exposure.

morale was at an all-time low and there was great agitation in the colonies against continued effort to secure our freedom from england. nevertheless, general washington was determined to see the struggle through.

 washington's own words"this afternoon, as i was sitting at this table engaged in preparing a dispatch, something seemed to disturb me. looking up, i beheld standing opposite me a singularly beautiful female. so astonished was i, for i had given strict orders not to be disturbed, that it was some moments before i found language to inquire the cause of her presence. a second, a third and even a fourth time did i repeat my question, but received no answer from my mysterious visitor except a slight raising of her eyes.

"by this time i felt strange sensations spreading through me. i would have risen but the riveted gaze of the being before me rendered volition impossible. i assayed once more to address her, but my tongue had become useless, as though it had become paralyzed.

"a new influence, mysterious, potent, irresistible, took possession of me. all i could do was to gaze steadily, vacantly at my unknown visitor. gradually the surrounding atmosphere seemed as if it had become filled with sensations, and luminous. everything about me seemed to rarefy, the mysterious visitor herself becoming more airy and yet more distinct to my sight than before. i now began to feel as one dying, or rather to experience the sensations which i have sometimes imagined accompany dissolution. i did not think, i did not reason, i did not move; all were alike impossible. i was only conscious of gazing fixedly, vacantly at my companion.

"presently i heard a voice saying, `son of the republic, look and learn,' click here to see george washington's vision.
