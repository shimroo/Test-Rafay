welcome 











the murrieta church of christ is a joyful community of imperfect people. yes, that’s right! we’re people that have fallen short of perfection. however, through the sacrifice and resurrection of jesus christ, we all have the opportunity to be made perfect in god’s eyes and enjoy eternal life in heaven. at murrieta church of christ, we’re going through the journey of life together. one day at a time.
