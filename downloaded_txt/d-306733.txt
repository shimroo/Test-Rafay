  transformation in jesus




    many youth live outside the reach of traditional church programs.

they might not feel comfortable or safe in that environment, but sport ministries help christians follow the great commission and go beyond the walls of the church to reach them.



    sport activities create a safe space that opens hearts to the gospel.

our sport ministries challenge youth to reach their potential as athletes, discover a biblical worldview, and find their place in god’s story. 
   
 they find confidence through athletics.
participants gain access to truly excellent sports training led by accomplished athletes and coaches..

 
 they find community through their teams.
many youth without a strong family structure find one through both our programs and the church.

 
 they find a new identity in jesus.
caring mentors help athletes discover their true identities as god’s children and their purpose as disciples of jesus.

for yackencys domínguez trías, enrolling her 10-year-old daughter georgette medina in a sportquest soccer program resulted in several unexpected benefits. while watching her daughter practice, yackencys saw a group of women exercising and learning about christ. she wanted to join this community of women and decided to get involved. today, yackencys is part of the vida fitness team and works out while georgeth learns soccer skills. both mother and daughter have embraced christ and are becoming devout followers.                                                                  more than 90 children participate in the sportquest soccer academy and fitness program located in maturin, monagas in eastern venezuela. sportquest partner cesar daniel bermudez runs the program and has a dream that it will grow to serve 500 youth. residents in this community face many challenges including poverty, dysfunctional homes, alcoholism, and drug addiction.                                                                  “we have seen how the different sports and fitness programs have allowed children and their parents to play sports and go to church together,” cesar says. “children and youth play sports and are discipled. mothers attend daily fitness training and learn the word of god. fathers are invited to participate in games to connect with their children and also to learn about the lord. as a result, several participants have made their confession of faith, have been baptized, and attend church regularly.”                                                                  santiago salazar met jesus through soccer. at 14 years old, in the middle of a biblical teaching, santiago accepted christ into his life. in december 2021, he was baptized and today he attends church on a consistent basis. as prepares to be a professional soccer player, he is also learning how to share his story and his love of christ with others.                                                                  great things are happening in venezuela through sports and fitness while learning about christ. praise god!

  here’s how we help youth discover god’s love through sport and play.
 1. create community
young people find a place to belong by joining our sports programs, and the coaches we support become trusted mentors in their lives.  2. share the gospel
in organic, conversational ways, we invite youth to encounter jesus, experience prayer, study the word, and develop a biblical worldview.  3. celebrate god’s victories
time and time again, we marvel at god’s work of salvation and transformation in participants’ lives. in many cases, parents also become involved and discover the love of god.
