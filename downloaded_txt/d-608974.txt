intersec: the world’s biggest business event mapping the future of security, safety and fire protection.






intersec 2025 is held under the patronage of hh sheikh mansoor bin mohammed bin rashid al maktoum.
intersec will mark its 26th edition from 14 - 16 january 2025 at dubai world trade centre following a huge international response from both visitors and exhibitors attending its silver jubilee event in 2024 which hosted 47,506 trade buyers from 141 countries including key government leaders, agencies and organisational heads across industries.
the event has been a success story for the past 25 years, offering a growth potential as innovation across all our sectors continues to address new levels of threat and risk. this makes it more important than ever that those charged with maintaining national and international security, safety and providing state-of-the-art fire protection should meet and discuss strategies and solutions.
the dynamics of the market are constantly evolving with new technologies such as blockchain, ai and iot having a significant impact across the safety and security industry. so intersec is the event where experts, suppliers and buyers in the world of security, safety and fire protection meet face to face to discuss leading-edge technology, see the very latest products and solutions across a wide range of industries and business sectors, and conduct business.
we would love to have you back for the 26th edition. your presence brought so much to the event, and we are already looking forward to catching up in 2025.
contact the intersec team for more information on exhibiting.
