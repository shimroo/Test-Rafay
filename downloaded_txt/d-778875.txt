what our customers are saying about us...
“everything was perfect in every way. the service was absolutely brilliant in all areas, from initial quote with sarah through to annabelle in the final confirmation. all the paperwork we needed was delivered on time and in an organised fashion and it was a pleasure to work with studylink once again. the online booking system (first time using this) was fab!”
ms sadie newens, nottingham trent university
 
“both tour leaders, lucy jolly and myself, were very impressed with studylink. everything worked like clockwork and i was impressed by rachel's text to make sure everything was running smoothly whilst we were in krakow.”
mr david mcphee, teesside university

“i felt i was fully supported when booking the trip and whilst we were away too. the hostel was the perfect accommodation for a college group. we are very happy with the service we received and will definitely book again.”
miss nicola worthington, salford city college
