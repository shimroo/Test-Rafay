                we seek an increasingly deeper, more personal relationship 
                with god our father, with our lord jesus christ, and with the precious holy spirit. this is expressed through our passionate worship 
                of the lord jesus christ, with an intense desire for his manifest presence in our services. we embrace personal and corporate 
                “times of refreshing” (carpet time) as we yield to the workings of the holy spirit in our lives.
