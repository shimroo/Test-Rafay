biography
hi.... i'm richard humphrey

            my career as a professional skater began in 1978 at the height of
            rollerdisco when i was selected to participate in a television pilot
            called, "dancing wheels," directed by saul zants productions. that
            year, i formed a group of san francisco based skaters called the,
            "golden rollers."
          

            from 1980 to 1982, i performed in sao paulo, brazil, annually in the
            san francisco fair, public performances on behalf of ksfx fm and
            acted as program / skating director at san francisco's le park
            skating rink. during 1982 to 1990, i appeared in performances before
            the san francisco ballet for michael smuin; by special invitation
            asked to appear as the opening act for comedian ronny schell and
            phyllis diller; television appearance on shows, "evening magazine"
            and "real people."
          

            from 1990 to 1995, i taught classes for university of california,
            san francisco at the third wave dance studio, including seminars and
            health expositions. in 1995, i opened up my own rollerdance studio
            in san francisco--the only one between here and new york, and
            currently teach about two classes a week.
          

            from 1996-1997, i produced my first instructional video called,
            "rollerdancing--a workout on skates," along with a step-by-step
            booklet. i performed in a half-time show for the oakland skates
            hockey team, and...by special request--choreographed dance steps for
            olympic gold medalist--kristi yamaguchi. i also appeared in the
            october 1996 issue of ebony magazine in an article about
            rollerdancing.
          

            in 1999, i received a patent on the rollerdeck-plus fitness machine.
            the videos and fitness machine are the product of my passion for
            fitness and skating.
          

            i have worked as damon wayans rollerdance stunt double and most
            recently appeared on the dr. oz show in 2010 to teach him the steps
            of rollerdance.
          

            to present, i still teach rollerdance classes at my rollerdance
            academy for all levels at weeks community park in hayward ca. every
            sunday from 9am - 1pm.
