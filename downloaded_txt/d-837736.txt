teapot prices have been reduced by more than half!we are moving to a smaller dwelling and can’t take all ofray’s reassembled ring teapots with us. visit “teapots for sale” section for new lower prices.




in 1978, my wife and business partner susan nykiel and i established oak bluffs cottage pottery at our home/studio in pownal, vermont. i make ceramic art, and i also teach clay-working skills in our studio. i’ve been making reassembled ring teapots since 1995. read paul park’s article in ceramics monthly to learn more about the process.

2012 video: conversations in the studio: ray bub, ceramic artist. produced by julia morgan and tracy baker-white.
