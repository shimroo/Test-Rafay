                                                                                                                "when our family moved to wichita for medical residency, we had every intention of moving back home to texas after. at magdalen, we quickly found a vibrant community of believers who were striving toward holiness. this community has rejoiced with us after each baby’s birth, supported us during times of sickness, and shared everyday life in christ with us. although family and friends remained in texas, we chose not to return after residency. it was abundantly clear that magdalen had become our family’s home."
