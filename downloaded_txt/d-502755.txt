comics review: disney's "zootopia #2" finds treasure in trash





zootopia: vol. 1 #2dynamite entertainmentstory: jeff parkerart: alessandro ranaldicolors: dearbhla kellyletters: jeff eckleberryeditor: nate cosbycover: trish forstnervariant cover artists: alessandro ranaldi; craig rousseau; trish forstner32pp, color, $4.99 u.s. (february 2025)rated “teen”“dump-da-dump-dump!”zootopia is a 2016 animated buddy-cop comedy film produced by walt disney animation studios.  zootopia is set in a world of anthropomorphic animals (animals that talk and act like humans).  the film follows a rabbit named judy hopps, who is rookie police officer, and a fox named nick wilde, who is a con artist.  judy and nick end up working together to uncover a conspiracy involving the disappearance of predators.  at the end of the film, nick graduates from the police academy and becomes judy's partner.dynamite entertainment has been producing licensed comic books based on disney characters and ip since 2022.  the latest is a zootopia comic book series, entitled zootopia: volume 1.  it is written by jeff parker; drawn by alessandro ranaldi; colored by dearbhla kelly; and lettered jeff eckleberry.  the series continues the adventures of judy and nick and is set after the events of the original film.zootopia: volume 1 #2 (“dump-da-dump-dump!”) opens in zootopia police precinct 1, where chief bogo is handing out a refresher course.  soon, officer hopps and officer wilde are on their way to the city dump... err... zootopia recycling depot.  according to its manager, skunk flowers, someone is actually breaking into the dump and stealing only select garbage bags.so exactly what kind of trash in those select garbage bags are raccoons and opossums hauling away?  hopps thinks she will find some connections to the pb&j phone explosions, but wilde wonders what he and his sensitive nose is doing at the city dump.the lowdown:  since july 2021, dynamite entertainment's marketing department has been providing me with pdf review copies of some of their titles.  zootopia: volume 1, issue #2 is the latest.i passed on walt disney's 2016 computer-animated hit film, zootopia, when it first played in theaters.  later, i started hearing good things about it, so i gave it a try on dvd (via netflix).  i loved it, and i'm excited about the sequel film, zootopia 2, which is due november 2025.my enjoyment of the film virtually assured that i was going to give dynamite's new comic book adaptation a try.  i can safely tell zootopia fans that the fun first issue of this series was not a fluke, because issue #2 is also a blast to read.  series writer jeff parker, who is quite adept at writing comic books that adapt other media, offers a surprisingly clever story that revolves around thefts from the city dump.  parker manages to keep intriguing his zootopia readers with novel plots and conspiracies.  he is giving us every reason to keep reading.the series' artists, penciler-inker alessandro ranaldi and colorist dearbhla kelly, offer the most exciting storytelling that readers will find is also similar to the aesthetic the original film.  ranaldi's compositions hop and dash across the pages with fast-paced storytelling.  kelly's colors have the spark of disney's animation magic and also make the story pop.  as usual, jeff eckleberry's lettering gives this story a sense of fast motion and noisy action.i look forward to more zootopia volume 1.  anyone who reads this second issue, dear readers, will feel the need to return for the third issue, at least.i reads you recommends:  fans of dynamite entertainment's disney comic book series will want zootopia: volume 1.areviewed by leroy douresseaux a.k.a.

review: "captain america: brave new world" explodes with intensity





trash in my eye no. 9 of 2025 (no. 2015) by leroy douresseauxcaptain america: brave new world (2025)running time:  118 minutes (1 hour, 58 minutes)mpa – pg-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, and some strong languagedirector:  julius onahwriters:  rob edwards, malcolm spellman & dalan musson, and julius onah & peter glanz; from a story by rob edwards and malcolm spellman & dalan musson (based on the marvel comics)producers:  kevin feige and nate moorecinematographer:  kramer morgenthau (d.o.p.)editors:  madeleine gavin and matthew schmidtcomposer:  laura karpmansuperhero/fantasy/drama and sci-fi/action/thrillerstarring:  anthony mackie, harrison ford, danny ramirez, shira haas, carl lumbly, tim blake nelson, giancarlo esposito, xosha roquemore, johannes haukur johannesson, william mark mccullough, and takehiro hira with liv tyler and sebastian stansummary of the review:--captain america: brave new world is the subject of a social media smear campaign, but it is one of the best superheroes movies of the 2020s, and it is probably the best action movie of the decade--the cast is dynamite. not only does anthony mackie light up the screen as sam wilson/captain america, but harrison ford also tears up the screen the way a hollywood legend and icon should--the supporting cast of captain america: brave new world is excellent, and the actors help make this film a rampaging good time at the moviescaptain america: brave new world is a 2025 superhero and action film from marvel studios and directed by julius onah.  the film focuses on the character, “sam wilson,” as the superhero, “captain america.”  sam wilson is a marvel comics character that was created by writer stan lee and artist gene colan and that first appeared in captain america #117 (cover dated: september 1969).  captain america is a marvel comics character that was created by joe simon and jack kirby and that first appeared in captain america comics #1 (december 1940).this film is the fourth film in the captain america film series and also the 35th entry in the marvel cinematic universe (mcu).  in captain america: brave new world, captain america must discover the identity of the mastermind behind a plan to launch the united states into a global war over access to an amazing new metal alloy.captain america: brave new world focuses on sam wilson (anthony mackie), who is still early in his tenure as the superhero, captain america, replacing his friend, the original captain america, steve rogers.  wilson was once the superhero, “the falcon,” and now, that mantle belongs to his partner, u.s. air force first lt. joaquin torres (danny ramirez).  captain america and the falcon begin the film on a mission in oaxaca, mexico where they take on the “serpent society” and its leader, sidewinder (giancarlo esposito), in a bid to intercept the sale of a canister of “adamantium.”adamantium is the new metal alloy that was discovered on the “celestial island,” located in the indian ocean.  celestial island is really the gigantic carcass of the “celestial tiamut,” whose emergence was stopped by the eternals (as seen in the 2021 film, eternals).  the u.s., japan, and india are vying to mine adamantium, and to that end, the three countries are working on a treaty that would create the infrastructure in which the three nations would share control of the island.the current president of the united states, thaddeus ross (harrison ford), formerly known as general “thunderbolt” ross, asks sam to be the face of the adamantium treaty as captain america.  president ross also wants sam to join him in a plan to reform the superhero group, “the avengers.”  however, the announcement of the treaty is interrupted by an assassination attempt.  now, sam's friend and mentor, isaiah bradley (carl lumbly), the korean war veteran and once-imprisoned “super soldier,” is once again imprisoned because of the incident.despite a growing rift with president ross, sam decides to investigate the assassination attempt, and joaquin joins him.  shadowing them is a former “black widow,” the israeli ruth bat-seraph (shira haas), but even she can't stop captain america and the falcon from discovering the mystery of a man named samuel sterns (tim blake nelson).  can sam wilson stop a global war, and can captain america really take on the creature known as the “red hulk.”captain america: brave new world is the subject of an intense online and social media smear campaign.  when you, dear readers, come across someone using the word, “woke,” to describe it, you should know that in the context of this film, “woke” is confederate pig latin for the name “anthony mackie.”  people who complain that the story and/or the script are not good are against the film because of their grievances concerning an african-american actor, antony mackie, taking on the role of captain america.  with that said...captain america: brave new world ties into some other marvel studios productions.  obviously, this film's “celestial island” subplot is related to events depicted in the 2021 film, eternals.  the disney+/marvel studios series, “the falcon and the winter soldier” (2021) is a prologue to brave new world.  surprisingly, brave new world acts as a sort of sequel to the second film in the mcu, 2008's the incredible hulk.  there are also references to numerous other mcu films.captain america: brave new world is a superb superhero movie and great action film.  director julius onah has helmed a film that is a rampaging good time at the movies, doing this in spite of delays and reshoots.  he should take pride in making a captain america film that is as good as or better than the previous three films in the series.  the action is great, and the conspiracy at the heart of the story is intense and shockingly personal.  the character drama is surprisingly potent and is both complex and complicated.  plus, the captain america vs. red hulk battle in the film's last act fell on me like a tree; it is so intense that for a moment i wished i was wearing an adult diaper while watching it.with captain america: brave new world, anthony mackie not only proves that he is a true marvel leading man who can carry a mcu film, but he also proves that he is a hollywood leading man.  in subtle ways, his performance and speeches clearly define that which mackie fights in the real world and sam wilson fights in his world.  watching mackie chop up this movie with his dramatic chops, i realized that it was long overdue that he lead a marvel film.i must also admit that harrison ford brings down the thunder in his role as president thaddeus ross, a.k.a. “thunderbolt” ross.  ford dominates his scenes so much that only mackie can really match him in captain america: brave new world.  seeing ford here reminds me of what a find dramatic actor he is and how he has always been fun in action movies.danny ramirez, shira haas, carl lumbly, tim blake nelson, giancarlo esposito, and xosha roquemore also deliver solid turns in their respective supporting roles.  they deserve to pop up in the mcu again, many more times.  i guess it is obvious that i am still buzzing from seeing captain america: brave new world last night (thursday, february 13th).  i had not expected much from this film because i had listened to too much of the propaganda.  i love being wrong in these instance.  captain america: brave new world is going to be my favorite film of 2025 for awhile, dear readers, and i heartily recommend it to you.9

universal pictures has released the first trailer for its 2025 film, "jurassic world rebirth."  the film is due in theaters july 2, 2025.press release:a new era is born. this summer, three years after the jurassic world trilogy concluded with each film surpassing $1 billion at the global box office, the enduring jurassic series evolves in an ingenious new direction with jurassic world rebirth. anchored by iconic action superstar scarlett johansson, emmy and sag nominee jonathan bailey, and two-time oscar® winner mahershala ali, this action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on earth, an island research facility for the original jurassic park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. also starring acclaimed international stars, rupert friend and manuel garcia-rulfo, the film is directed by dynamic visualist gareth edwards (rogue one: a star wars story) from a script by original jurassic park screenwriter, david koepp. five years after the events of jurassic world dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. the three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their dna, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.academy award® nominee johansson plays skilled covert operations expert zora bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. when zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for jurassic park. there, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. ali is duncan kincaid, zora’s most trusted team member; critics choice and olivier award winner jonathan bailey (wicked, "bridgerton") plays paleontologist dr. henry loomis; emmy nominee rupert friend ("homeland," "obi-wan kenobi") appears as big pharma representative martin krebs, and manuel garcia-rulfo ("the lincoln lawyer," murder on the orient express) plays reuben delgado, the father of the shipwrecked civilian family. the cast includes luna blaise (manifest), david iacono (the summer i turned pretty) and audrina miranda ("lopez vs. lopez") as reuben’s family. the film also features, as members of zora and krebs’ crews, philippine velge (station eleven), bechir sylvain (bmf) and ed skrein (deadpool).  jurassic world rebirth is directed by bafta winner edwards from a script by koepp (war of the worlds), based on characters created by michael crichton. the film is produced by oscar® nominee frank marshall and patrick crowley, both longtime jurassic franchise producers and of last summer’s blockbuster, twisters. the film is executive produced by steven spielberg, denis l. stewart and jim spencer.--------------------------------------------------
