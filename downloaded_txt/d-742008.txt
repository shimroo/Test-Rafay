february 2023 tour of new kansas city airport terminal

                lisa price





last week, our chapter was offered a unique opportunity for a sneak-peak of the brand-new kansas city airport terminal before its opening at the end of the month. our tour covered the entire airport from the parking garage to luggage handling with a focus on security operations and technologies. the only downside was that our group was limited to 20 attendees, which we could have at least doubled from all the interest this event received.
many thanks to our chapter member michael satter for connecting us with our host david v. at dhs.
