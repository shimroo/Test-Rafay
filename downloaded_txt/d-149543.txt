founded in 1991, taglich brothers, inc. is a full service brokerage firm specializing in the small cap segment of the market for publicly traded securities. we define the small cap market as companies with less than $250 million of stock outstanding.the firm has selected this unique niche for two reasons. first and foremost, the small cap market has historically outperformed the large cap market over the past 75 years. second, this area of the market is virtually ignored by the larger institutions and other wall street firms because they can not invest enough capital in each situation to justify the expense of investigating these companies.our focus and high energy level allow us to exploit these inefficiencies, giving us the added advantage needed to prosper in the small cap market.
