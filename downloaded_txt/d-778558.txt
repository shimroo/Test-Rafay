solving systems of equations using elimination
objective: solve systems of linear equations
using elimination 
example 1) 



3 x + 2 y = 2-3 x + 2 y = 6

add the equations


4 y = 8 
simplify 


y = 8/4 = 2
 


 
substitute using y = 2


3 x + 2(2) = 2
 


3 x + 4 = 2 
simplify 


3 x = -2
 


x = -2/3 
solution (-2/3, 2)



example 2) 



- x - y = 8 -2 x - y = -1

subtract the equations 


x = 9
substitute using x = 9


-9 - y = 8
 


- y = 17
 


y = -17 
solution (9, -17) 



example 3) 



2 x = -3 y + 1x + 2 y = -1

rewrite in standard form


2 x + 3 y = 1 x + 2 y = -1

multiply the 2nd equation by -2 then add 


2 x + 3 y = 1 -2 x - 4 y = 2

simplify


-y = 3y = -3

substitute using y = -3


x + 2(-3) = -1x + -6 = -1 
x = 5

solution (5, -3) 



example 4)



3 x + 2 y = 12 x - 5 y = -2

let’s eliminate the x 


-2(3 x + 2 y ) = -2 (1) 3(2 x - 5 y )
        = 3(-2) 

multiply the first equation
        by -2multiply the 2nd equation by 3



-6 x - 4 y = -26 x - 15 y = -6

now add.


-19 y = -8 y

now substitute



simplify.
