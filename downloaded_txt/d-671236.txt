in january 2020 the exhibition  ___a lineage of transgression___, curated by liz ikiriko, featured works by jamilah malika abu-bakare & kameelah janan rasheed at artspace peterborough. five years later, ___a lineage of transgression___ has been resurrected and re-envisioned to be presented at artspeak, in vancouver. co-curated by liz ikiriko and nya lewis, the 2025 edition includes the works of jamilah malika abu-bakare, kameelah janan rasheed, along with shala miller, cecily nicholson and m. nourbese philip.the exhibition continues to explore language as a tool to challenge the limitations of systemic definitions of blackness and womanhood. continuing subversive traditions practiced by noted writers and emancipators such as nikki giovanni, octavia butler, audre lorde, harriet jacobs to contemporaries m. nourbese philip, dionne brand and christina sharpe – the artists use voice, the sonic, revision, redaction and annotation to expand and dismantle monolithic visions of blackness. what happens when we free language from the page and allow it to become spatial, audible or sculptural? what does that teach us about words that attempt to define and contain us? the artists’ works are inherently bound to a lineage of makers who have provided the speculative blueprint for deconstructing singular notions of identity and representation.



recent publications
















dissident 3: art activist murmurings"spatial disruption of the body; a cathartic reintroduction to the newest version of myself" dissident is a quarterly art journal devoted to exploring community driven social practices. writing against and alongside limiting institutional historical orientation, the series positions restorative literature, intimate recollection, transdisciplinary dialogue, and the production of knowledge and pedagogical practices through active engagements with progressive social movements central to the pursuit of complex curatorial engagement. dissident investigates human-centric, intersectional, and decolonial frameworks, bridging autonomous authorship or anecdotal, self-reflective writing with activism, political agitation, and obscure cultural practice. documenting creative participatory re-shaping, redirection, resistance, refusal, and care, dissident invites guest writers to share research at various stages of progress- an exercise in disrupting evaluation and presentation and a gesture towards critical experimentation, innovation, and generative idea sharing.

news

a













artspeak was founded in 1986 by curator cate rimmer, artist kay higgins, and writer jeff derksen. our early association with kootenay school of writing served to situate artspeak within a unique interdisciplinary community of visual artists, writers, and critics. artspeak is operated by artists from the visual and language arts who share concerns in relation to the theory and practice of contemporary art. the mandate of the gallery is to encourage a dialogue between visual art and writing. artspeak has played a significant role in addressing the historical, social, and intellectual conditions of contemporary visual and language arts production from the west coast. we aim to support the practices of emerging and established artists and writers from this region and beyond by providing opportunities to exhibit, publish, and present new work to enthusiastic audiences. artspeak actively contributes to cultural communities through our commitment to artists producing challenging, innovative work in diverse media, our affiliation with other organizations, and the public interest we generate in contemporary art.
