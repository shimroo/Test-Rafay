            a taste of what to expect
        













            what the trade are saying...
        






the fair has been a huge success again for us at beyond wines. we had so many important meetings at the fair, with more customers and trade luminaries than i can count. we have seen all the major buyers over the last three days, including from: tesco; aldi; sainsbury; waitrose; morrisons; matthew clark; molson coors; mitchells and butlers; and lwc drinks to name just a few. and it is testament to london wine fair that they were all gathered in one place over the three days. why more companies don’t exhibit is beyond me.

it’s the perfect place to pick up on the latest trends, to discover new initiatives and new concepts. new wines, high levels of quality. there’s a lot to learn.

this year’s london wine fair has been exceptional. we have had an amazing amount of real quality customers to our stand.  added to which, the fair has a real sense of innovation and excitement.

all the big players are here today. we’ve had tesco raving about our wines, we’ve had sainsbury's over, you name it, it’s just an incredible few days

i liked the mix of exhibitors (ranging from currently in market to seeking representation), wonderful masterclasses, and exciting awards ceremonies! it's a great way to network, keep up to date on the industry and also develop new partnerships and business.
