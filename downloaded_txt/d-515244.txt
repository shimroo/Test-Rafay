i had a railing installed in december 2018.  i was delighted with the workmanship and quality of the design and install.  recently i noticed some paint was missing or scratched off, i don’t know when this occurred, maybe after i moved in?anyway, i called newman iron works and asked them to give me information on what kind and where to buy touch-up paint.  they told me they would get back to me shortly with the info, and the next thing i knew, within a few hours of the call, the railing was all touched-up, and a sample of the paint left on my doorstep. wow, that’s cool.michael rileyi have been dealing with newman iron works for almost 20 years. i first bought railings from them and have them come out every few years to restore them. i have also had them come out and add more over the years. they all still look great. they are a super customer friendly company, all the employees i have dealt with over the years were courteous, professional; and talented. i have given their name out countless times, and will continue to do so. everyone who has used them has been very happy. rick newman makes the customer feel very comfortable and has great ideas. i highly recommend themleon fischeri was very impressed with the service and in particular with the quick installation- literally within 24 hours!!  great job!
