previous updates


				in different parts of the world, the word dragon carries different connotation. some claim the 
				creature is an evil being sent by the great evil to harm mankind. others tell tales about 
				benevolent dragons who sacrificed themselves to save humans or promote fertility. both disaster 
				and bounty have followed in their wakes.
			

				in the modern world, dragons have spread as a wild fire; both through the internet and through 
				books, they've grown. out of all the creatures in mythology, the dragon is one of the most 
				present. where did this creature come from? why do so many mythologies tell the tale of at 
				least one dragon? 
			

				this site is here to help you unlock the mystery of the dragon, and i hope it can be informative 
				as well as entertaining. to begin, select one of the menu items from the side bar on the right.
