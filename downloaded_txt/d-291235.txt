				yoga, meditation, chi kung, mindfulness) involving top 
				scientists, health, education experts who believe it is high 
				time mind body education becomes part of public education 
				worldwide ... to save the world trillioins in future health & 
				social costs.the founders of world tai chi & qigong day, 
				william & angela wong douglas, spent 40 years collecting mind 
				body and consciousness and social/behavioral science that led to 
				their writing a 700 page meticulously cited book of science 
				("new 2nd edition; the gospel of science ..." see below), which 
				led to involvement in the global transformation project. this 
				project's goal is gaining a united nations resolution by the un 
				general assembly advocating mind body education for public 
				education worldwide. you can get involved!  at the global 
				transformation project website, you can sign the petition for 
				this un resolution ... william & angela (founders of wtcqd) have 
				committed to lobbying every united nations mission in the world 
				to get co-sponsors for this historic resolution. there is a 
				precedent for this, because in 2015 the un general assembly 
				passed the international day of yoga resolution, setting a 
				record in the un for the most co-sponsors of any resolution 
				before. this world yoga day, following the establishment of 
				world tai chi & qigong day, resolution was based on the same 
				reasoning as the global transformation project's goal of 
				expanding world health and increasing mental clarity in the 
				world.released on january 1st, 2022 ... a new book from the founders of world tai chi and qigong day, 2nd edition of "the gospel of science: mind blowing new science on ancient truths to heal our stress, lives, and planet." 700 pages of meticulously cited scientific research showing how alph-theta brain wave producing mind-body education (tai chi, qigong, yoga, meditation, mindfulness) included as a core part of public education worldwide can: save the planet trillions of dollars in future saved healthcare costs, reduce violence and social issues, and literally increase "coherent consciousness" throughout the entire planet! this unique publication will explain the rationale behind the world tai chi and qigong day sponsored "global transformation project," a global campaign for a united nations resolution-advocating science based mind-body education (tai chi, qigong, yoga, meditation, and mindfulness) as a core part of pubic education worldwide.
				this unprecedented publication provides just received data, showing that events like "world tai chi and qigong day" "international day of yoga" "world meditation day", etc. literally increased the "coherence of consciousness" planet wide!
				 the science is in on this ... time to use science in public education worldwide!
