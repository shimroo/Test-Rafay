land acknowledgementwe at the springer opera house wish to acknowledge with great respect that the land upon which we are fortunate to make art is the ancestral home of the muscogee (creek) people, who thrived here for millennia. in 1836, 15,000 muscogee were assembled locally and removed 750 miles to oklahoma with little more than the clothes on their backs. some 3500 died along the way.the springer is adjacent to “mother town” coweta and “peace town’ cusseta, two ancient centers of muscogee culture. others have walked these paths before us.further information about the muscogee people can be found at muscogeenation.com

“to our african-american friends, artists and neighbors, i want you to know that we see you, we hear you and we stand with you in solidarity for social justice and glorious transformation.”

— paul pierce, artistic director (retired)
