their staff is wonderful. i love their selection of frames and lenses. by bill j.i can't say enough good things about my eye doctor rita cook and all the staff that work there!  she listens to all my concerns and always comes up with a perfect solution. i has my regular checkup and had mentioned my eye strain due to computer use and she gave me a prescription that works amazingly well.  my computer glasses are awesome too.  the eyeglass selection is awesome too.  thank you! by b zwhile i lived in beaverton, or i used to go to murrayhill eye care for my eye check-ups and prescriptions. i was usually seen by dr. rita cook. she was very professional, knowledgeable and thorough in her examinations.  now that i no longer live there, i truly miss such an excellent and accessible eye care facility. they truly care for the patients. thank you! by aparna g.i have been going here since i first needed glasses. the entire staff is amazing and the atmosphere is very comforting. dr. cook is who i always see and she always answers any questions i have and really does a great job. also, selena, the office manager, is very very helpful and always is going out of her way to make everyone's experience great. by ty t.have been going here for over 10 years.  dr. luce is all about improving your vision and keeping up with the latest technology.  i appreciate the time he takes, the explanations he provides and the care he puts into his practice...he truly is doing what he is meant to do.  the staff are all excellent as well.  helped me pick out glasses which i always feel self conscious doing but they made me feel at ease. by sara n.my whole family loves dr. cook and everyone at murrayhill eye care.  everyone there is very friendly and knowledgeable.  they remember our kids names and have always been helpful with frames and contacts. by sally e.love this place!
