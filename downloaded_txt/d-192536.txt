understanding color management
color gamut has become one of those over used terms in the world of color printing which deserves a bit of time to explain. which inkjet paper has the widest or greatest color gamut? which paper has the darkest, richest black? which paper is going to most accurately represent what is seen on my computer screen? these are all great questions and represent some of the mysteries and myths of inkjet printing.

which printer is better? canon or epson?
there is no doubt that both canon and epson produce excellent printers. they are the brands currently at the top of the market in terms of the equipment we use for fine art digital printmaking.
