create web sites that work for everyone.
that's our mantra. it sounds like a simple proposition but most web sites today only work with the latest browsers or high-speed connections. there are many reasons why this is true, but the fact remains, if your web site doesn't work for everyone, you're probably turning away potential customers.

who is your audience and what do they want to know?
before you begin designing or re-designing your web site, you should be able to describe who your intended audience is and what they want to know about you. maybe more importantly, you should be able to describe what you want them to know. if you can answer these questions, you're ready to get started on your web site.

what is your "elevator pitch?"
a killer elevator pitch is the holy grail for successful companies. if you have one, it should resonate loudly throughout your entire marketing mix. if you don't, you better get one before you begin telling people about your company.
