i am just letting you know that my recently purchased max-prop easy was one of the best pieces of gear ever install on my tartan 37. i took the boat from new york to the bahamas and am now back in florida and will be headed back around the 1st of may. easy is right! a breeze to install; performance is nothing less than outstanding. thanks for a terrific product; and i also have you shaft seal that has been problem free since installation over 10 years ago. i will be ordering a replacement / service kit over the summer along with velox coating for the prop when i have a haul out date. cheers!

i absolutely love the maxprop. it has transformed our boat handling. much more power and control in reverse, with little, actually no prop walk. i have done a number of maneuvers in all conditions and find that i can control not just the stern better but the whole boat in reverse and in forward, and navigate much better in close quarters in light air or wind. oh my goodness i so much wish i had installed this prop several yers ago. so, while we still have issues with windage and tracking with the wing keel, i could not be happier with my ability to maneuver our boat effectively. the c400s a greta boat in so many ways, and finally being able to get on top of the boat handling issues is awesome. and we sail better also! thanks for all your help!

if anyone ever is dubious about the strength of the max prop mechanism, you might want to show them this letter. a few weeks ago a little harbor 54 was coming into philadelphia from new zealand as deck cargo on a container ship. she was supposed to have been offloaded into the water and then come to our yard to be rigged. as they were lifting the yacht off the ship a sling broke, dropping her ten feet or so onto the concrete. the 31 ton yacht fell stern first, destroying the rudder, causing extensive hull damage and breaking one blade of the three-blade max prop. believe it or not, the max prop mechanism still works perfectly! the yacht is several years old and has been cruised ten of thousands of miles, but the max prop works as smoothly as if it had just been installed. and that is after taking an impact sufficient to snap one blade like a potato chip. that is one hell of a piece of machinery!

hey guys! i am just about to set up for recoating my decks with kiwi grip! i have to say when i applied the product (in 2011) i was a little doubtful of it's longevity...but it has held up amazingly well! this on a boat that gets raced every wednesday night, cruised every weekend and partied on in between it has held up incredibly well...we are going to do the cockpit floor and seating areas as these get the worst of the wear! i have done several other boats for people in the intervening years and they all have held up great! amazing product!

i own a luffe 48. she is now 30 years young! great boat but last year she suffered some rudder damage. the solution was to replace rudder, bearings and rudder stock. it was recommended that we install a jefa rudder and bearings. iâve been racing and owning race-boats for 40 years and would highly recommend jefa rudders and bearings. beautiful design and very professional equipment. jefa exceeded all my wishes.
