how do
                                                                                                    they work?
the patented spring system (referred to as ips or impact protection system) compresses with each step to absorb the impact of athletic activity that can cause damage to the joints. the end result is a feeling of lightness that can be compared to âwalking on airâ. because the sole of the shoe from right to left is flat, lateral stability is not compromised and the user will feel safe and stable throughout the exercise session, regardless of the choice of activity.
