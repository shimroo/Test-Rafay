hudson river eagle trip
hudson river eagle trip
february 8, 2025Â @Â 1:00 pm - 5:00 pm

this year we are once again offering twoÂ chances to join naturalist tait johansson in search of bald eagles along thehudson river!Â 
whether itâ€™s your first or 101sttime, seeing a bald eagle is always a thrill and the stretch of the hudson river that borders northwestern westchester holds the largest concentration of wintering bald eagles in the northeast north of chesapeake bay. 
from our early eaglewatch counts, tait says there are already decent numbers of eagles around, and there should besome more arriving from up north in the next week or two if these cold temperatures continue, so it should be a good year to join us for one of these popular trips. the river and its banks provide food and nesting opportunities, which will give us the chanceto spot these majestic raptors along the river at multiple stops from peekskill to croton point, no matter whether you sign up for the morning or afternoon visit.
saturday, february 8,1:00-5:00pm. by heading out in the afternoon, we may be lucky enough to observe the eagles as they return to their roosting sites at dusk
or
tuesday,february 11, 9:30am-1:00pm.
cost: free. level of difficulty: easy. registration is required by emailing susan at info@bedfordaudubon.org.

the great backyard bird count (gbbc) is fast-approaching, and itâ€™s a way for the world to come together for the love of birds. for four days each february, people spend time watching and counting as many birds as possible and reporting them. the observations help scientists better understand global bird populations. this year the count will take place february 14-17.
please join us at bylane farm forÂ bedford audubonâ€™s backyard bird countÂ and a morning of counting. weâ€™ll stay cozyÂ indoors while observing the birds at the feeders through the windows. this is a great opportunity to introduce your children and other family members to the birds that they are most likely to see in your own backyards while adding to this great community science project. and with a couple of days left to count you can take your newfound skills home and add your own backyard count to the project. no experience is necessary, just keen eyes! if you have them, you can bring binoculars although they are not required. saturday, february 15, 9:30-11:00am. cost:Â free. level of difficulty:Â easy. registration is required by emailing susan at info@bedfordaudubon.org â€“ please tell us your partyâ€™s size on registering.
