we build an inclusive jewish community.
we are a center for jewish life that embraces a diversity of religious and cultural traditions.
we cherish each individual, cultivating friendship and reaching out to support one another in difficult times through acts of hesed (loving-kindness).
we gather to learn, pray, and celebrate the cycles of jewish time, infusing our lives with joy and meaning, and revealing kedushah (holiness) within and around us.
