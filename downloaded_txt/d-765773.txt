a little bit about our sauce



pee dee river swamp sauce answers the age-old question of which barbecue sauce is best - vinegar, mustard, or tomato based? so, which one is the best? they all are, especially when combined into one unique sauce.
swamp sauce is a versatile barbecue sauce. the combination of vinegar, mustard, and tomato base makes for a unique taste experience. swamp sauce has the perfect blend of spices, not too hot and not too mild. people of all ages will love this award-winning sauce. thanks for trying my sauce.
