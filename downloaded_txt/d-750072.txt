from 2007 through 2021, learning with math machines operated as a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization. with support from the national science foundation and other sources, we provided workshops, curriculum materials, hardware designs and software to help coordinate learning of science, technology, engineering and math (stem) and added some art activities for steam programs.covid-19 made hands-on workshops nearly impossible, and the non-profit structure and funding became more difficult to maintain. we are now dissolving the 501(c)(3) but we are doing all we can to keep the idea of hands-on, minds-on stem and steam programs alive. our software, classroom activities and hardware designs will still be available—right here. check back for updates, or emailstemmachines@gmail.comwith questions or suggestions.













this material is based in part upon work supported by the national science foundation's ate program under grants no. due-0202202 and due-1003381. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation
























want some hardware?
we are liquidating left-over hardware. if you are interested, let us know. if you make a good case for using things effectively, we will do all we can to get materials into your hands and your students’ hands.
