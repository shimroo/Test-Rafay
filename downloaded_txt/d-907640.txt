those who have struggled with machine quilting will be relieved and delighted with the author's step-by-step tour of the world of machine quilting. ports of call on the tour include fabric selection and preparation, choosing batting and backing fabric, pin basting layers, marking the quilt, thread choice, quilting sequence, walking foot and free-motion quilting, and finishing and washing the quilt. the sections on marking the quilting design and changing bobbin tension are particularly helpful as are the tips on lighting and managing the quilt in the machine. practice your skills on three charming quilt patterns: trip around the world wall quilt, log cabin revisited, and sixteen baskets of mud. 8.5 x 11. 128 pages.
