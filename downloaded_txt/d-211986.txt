hearings on hb 581
 
cartersville city school board (ccsb) understands the necessity of prioritizing a strong learning environment and meaningful experience for students and staff while also diligently maintaining fiscal responsibility. for decades, ccsb has held both principles in an intricate balance through listening and seeking to support our community’s highest good. it is with this same intention that ccsb is approaching house bill 581 regarding statewide adjusted base year ad valorem homestead exemption.
 
the public hearing scheduled for january 10 at 11 am will be postponed due to the potential threat of inclement weather. public hearings will be held on tuesday, january 21, 2025, at 5 pm and monday, february 3, 2025, at 6 pm as previously scheduled.  the meeting originally scheduled for january 10 has been rescheduled for wednesday, february 12, 2025, at 5 pm. all meetings will be held in the board room of the city of cartersville board of education at 15 nelson street. .
 
superintendent dr. marc feuerbach said, "cartersville city schools is committed to financial responsibility and academic excellence. the school district works diligently to maximize taxpayer dollars, providing a world-class education for all students."
 
for specific questions or additional information, please contact ccs chief financial officer hilary mullinax at hmullinax@cartersvilleschools.org.
