testimonial
we've been working with melissa and her wonderful team for 10 years now, and they're fantastic!  we started as renters for three years, and we were very impressed with their responsiveness and professionalism.  once we purchased our own ski house, we knew that rentals only would do a great job as our management company.  
now that we live on the west coast, it gives us peace of mind to know that rentals only is overseeing our "home away from home".  we've had great renters from summer through winter, and never a problem when something needs to be addressed.  not only that, but they are so positive and easy to work with.  i know that both our renters and our home are being well cared for.    
rentals only has earned our trust and admiration over the years.  i'd recommend them highly to anyone.    ~ leslie g., owner
