art that moves to the rhythm of nature

 













sacred art that celebrates the mystical world

 

heyoka merrifield (1946 - 2001) was a celebrated multi-media artist, medicine man, and author who lived in montana. searching for the reason ancient art pieces radiated inner life and power  led him on a lifelong quest of creation and learning. touching the sacred within his work  brought him international acclaim, and his pieces appear in the private collections including those of george harrison, cher, elton john, joni mitchell, bob dylan, neil diamond, stevie nicks, and more. 

 

















“not a gem nor precious metal passes through heyoka’s hands that is not instilled with a spirit of its own in the process of being transformed into a work of art and beauty.”

— george harrison

“heyoka merrifield is a medicine man, a priest, a guardian of the doorways and a powerful conduit to the understanding of the complex intricacies between our world and the world of the spirits and the ancestors. this position at the threshold between worlds underscores the exquisiteness of the art coming out of his hands and the halo of humbling spiritual energy surrounding him. every piece he makes is a ritual puzzle that encodes a healing message from the other world. we cannot afford to ignore his message. ”

— -malidoma some, ph.d.: of the dagara tribe in west africa, author of, healing wisdom of africa and of water and the spirit
