learn to float – learn to swim
the njswim learn to float philosophy is a nationally recognized teaching curriculum that promotes balance and buoyancy in the water.
we understand that every child is different and take a gentle approach in our swimming lessons. warm water and small classes provide a safe, intimate, and unique learning experience.
effective skill progression for each level:
makes learning to swim fun!
















at njswim
we don’t have employees – we have a team because that’s how we work to create the right learning environment every day at every location.
we don’t have customers – we have njswim family members because everyone matters, and everyone should feel a sense of belonging.
we don’t have instructors – we have swim teachers because we take a gentler, nurturing approach with the understanding that each child is different.

joe oehme, owner and founder of njswim, has been teaching swimming and water safety for over 30 years. he believes that drowning is preventable if the right resources are provided to reduce the risks.
njswim schools and the stop drowning now organization are actively trying to make a difference by working to require a water safety curriculum in nj schools.
