 coulee children's center has been in operation since 1987, providing early childhood programming, school age care as well as public preschool programming.   our educational philosophy reflects the belief that learning takes place primarily through exploratory activities and discovery (play based learning). the amount of adult guidance varies with each activity, as it is our belief that a strong early childhood program offers both directed and non-directed learning opportunities. this allows children to interact, engage, and think about their actions and achievements throughout this play.our classrooms are designed to be child-centered with a wide range of materials and developmentally appropriate activities tailored to their needs. this allows your child to create, manipulate, explore, and discover according to their particular and unique interests and skill sets. each child is valued and recognized as a unique individual with a large capacity for growth and development.
 we invite you to make an appointment to visit our childcare center and take a tour of our facilities.

  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
i was one who was never going to put her child in daycare. our finances said otherwise. my son began as a 21 month-old and i never once regretted my choice. when my daughter was born, i was getting a divorce, my son was starting 1st grade and coulee children's center became our "constant". we were loved, valued, and taken care of. my son is now in college and my daughter in high school. both have the most solid of foundations in part to their being a part of coulee children's center.-stacy b.

i have had my 2 children at coulee children's center in various classrooms as they have aged.  my youngest started in the infant classroom and graduated through the 4 year old kindergarten program.i couldn't think of a more loving and dedicated group of individuals with little ones.  i couldn't speak higher of the programming and learning activities that happen during the day.  highly recommend to any individual looking for childcare.  you would be hard pressed to find another agency better than coulee children's center.-elizabeth s.
