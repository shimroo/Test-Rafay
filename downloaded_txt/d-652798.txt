our rootsst. julien macaroons started in the cozy farmhouse kitchen of white oaks farm in 1974, when bill price hit troubled times in his work as a stockbroker. faced with the need for more income, bill and his wife elizabeth began looking for a new venture to help support their family. after learning that a friend possessed the coveted secret recipe for traditional almond macaroons (a recipe developed by the nuns in nancy france in the 17th century!!) the three decided to collaborate by bringing the centuries-old recipe to life. word of the delicious, light and chewy st. julien macaroons traveled quickly, and before long, orders were coming in from all over the country. customers loved their convenience and versatility: not only were the macaroons delicious, but they had the ability to be stored in the freezer for up to two years without any change in quality, making them a great treat for last minute guests and a thoughtful gift. today, we make our macaroons in small batches using the same time trusted process from our early days.  what makes our macaroons one-of-a-kind is that unlike their contemporary cousin which is made with coconut, our macaroons are made using hand whipped egg whites and finely crushed almonds. baked in small brick ovens, macaroons like ours aren't fast or easy to make, but they are worth the time and effort it takes us to create them. while our macaroons have a sweet and simple look to them, the flavor and texture is delightfully unexpected...you truly need to try them to understand how special they are. at once light, crispy, and chewy, our delicately balanced macaroons are sweet and delectable. they are everything one might expect from a recipe that has weathered the ages. we invite you to discover the delicious indulgence of our st. julien macaroons, and then to share generously.
