testimonials
what our amazing customers think
our results speak for themselves, but our clients’ feedback speaks even louder.

words cannot express how amazing the chocolate avalanche cake you made looked and tasted. i had you guys make it for my uncle’s 70th birthday and it was the center of attention as it was so beautifully made. the detail and depth of the cake was so sophisticated. debbie did an amazing job the cake was perfection. i am new to syracuse from long island and i can tell you biscotti’s is my new go to place. thank you for making my uncle’s 70th so amazing. i highly recommend biscotti’s ❤sharon hendricks
i ordered 130 of the mini pastries for my wedding desserts- i ordered them a week ahead of time, and the service was amazing. i spoke with a lovely woman on the phone for my order, and it was ready on time and perfect when it was picked up. plus, the desserts were amazing and definitely a high point for my wedding food. would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great service and delicious pastries!rhiannon randall
this is one of my favorite bakeries in syracuse. they are famous for special occasion cakes as well as italian pastries and gelato. my favorite pastry is the almond bar with raspberry. it’s sweet and crunchy, with almonds, almond paste, and raspberry jam. one bar goes a long way to satisfying your sweet tooth. i also think their macaroons are among the best you can find in the area.n n
