	 keratoconus update
	 
    

well i had my latest eye exam and my keratoconus is not as bad as the  first visit, praise god!!!!  thanks to everyone for your prayers. any how, i am able to be fitted with soft  contacts which are very comfortable.  several years ago i had trouble  with soft lenses but now there have been great improvements to which i  also praise god.  i have to return to have the fitting checked and see  if an adjustment needs to be made.  i will also return in january to be  tested on another machine.  i don't believe there is a charge for these  exams.  i like this doctor.  i have read about another corrective eye  surgery that is showing success in treating keratoconus.  at this stage  i am not considering this as an option.  one patient will be having this  surgery, so i have asked my doctor to keep me updated.  since they only  give a 1% success rate at this time i will not consider it.  this  procedures is more popular in europe.  until my eyes get to be so bad i  have a hard time seeing, i will use the recommended toric lenses to  correct my vision. 
for now,

\o/ praises

	 from pain to healing
	 
    

yesterday, i went to my chiropractor.  while he was making an adjustment i mentioned i was having pain in my shoulder.  he asked the physical therapist to check out my shoulder.  he pressed and rotated my shoulder, he squeezed and prodded, he knew what he was doing.  all i could do was trust him.  as he did what he had to do, i was in a lot of pain.  he found some nodules and he continued to  press, squeeze  and rotate my shoulder.  this happened every time he found another nodule and i would crimp in pain again.  sometimes there has to be pain before there can be healing.  today my shoulder feels like it has been run over.  healing does not happen overnight, it takes time

what a play

bears' vasher returns missed fg 108 yards


nfl.com wire reports

chicago (nov. 13, 2005) -- chicago bears defensive back nathan vasher returned a missed field goal an nfl-record 108 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first half against the san francisco 49ers.
when joe nedney's 52-yard attempt went wide right in a strong wind, vasher caught the ball over his shoulder, hesitated momentarily whether to come out of the end zone, sprinted to the 15 and then reversed his field with a spin, picking up a convoy of blockers.
getting blocks down the sideline from lance briggs and chris harris, vasher weaved his way past the 49ers for a stunning touchdown that gave the bears a 7-3 halftime lead.
the previous longest return of a missed field goal was 107 yards by baltimore's chris mcalister against denver on sept. 30, 2002. ap newsthe associated press news servicecopyright 2005, the associated press, all rights reserved
