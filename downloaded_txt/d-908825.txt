it's been far too long since i've put a mix together! this is an 80 minute set, and is mostly all dubstep. there's a little trance and electro house thrown in there to break things up, but you better like dubstep if you're going to give this a listen. hopefully you have as much fun listening to this as it was to make!!

	 bonus archive mix: elevate (march 2006)
	 



this will be the first of many "archive" mixes that i post to the site/podcast. there's so many great tracks in my older mixes, and i realize a lot of people enjoyed them, but at this point they're not available anywhere online. since i still have the high quality sources for all my mixes, i'll be posting these as often as i can. (i will also include the original cover art, if i have it.)this is one of my all-time favorite mixes, however i was never able to release it to the general public because the opening track by bt was never officially released. now that it's shown up on youtube, i'd say it's finally safe to release this mix. "elevate" is the mix i always come back to when i want nothing but pure trance bliss. you'll find that it's mostly vocal trance, and i'm still amazed at the track selection i was able to put together for this one, which makes it an even bigger shame i wasn't able to release it at the time. i hope you agree!01. bt - idea 3 (instrumental) (3:24)02. luminary - amsterdam (smith & pledger remix) (6:15)03. the thrillseekers feat. gina dootson - by your side (martin rothvocal mix) (6:43)04. robert nickson feat. elsa hill - close your eyes (vocal mix) (7:03)05. stunt - raindrops (extended mix) (4:41)06. interstate vs. terry bones - remember me (strube mix) (8:20)07. sunny lax vs. above & beyond - p.u.m.a. (strube's good for me mix) (6:24)08. electric pulse - time traveller (4:53)09. tom porcell - not tonite (bias bros remix) (7:08)10.hybrid vs. way out west feat. julee cruise - if i survive (strubemix) (8:33)

after a mixing hiatus, it feels good to come back with a punch. there's a little bit of all my favorite genres in this set... starting with progressive (my rework of a new hybrid track), moving onto a great trance mix of an estelle track, and branching out to prog house and even some breakbeat jazz. i'm far from finished.track listing:01. hybrid - formula of fear (strube's hychair mix) (9:42)02. will.i.am - impatient (1:30)03. estelle - american boy (soulseekerz club remix) (5:15)04. deadmau5 & kaskade - i remember (7:07)05. karl g feat. vicky fee - repeat again (solid sessions remix) (4:33)06. david guetta feat. tara mcdonald - delirious (4:59)07. slyde - frequency (napt remix) (4:46)08. mike devellis - introlecution (original mix) (5:54)09. kaskade vs. edx - angel on my shoulder (strube rework) (5:04)10. filterheadz pres. orange 3 - in your eyes (blue mix) (5:30)11. tritonal - essence of kea (tritonal air up there dub mix) (7:49)

	 mark strube presents: let go (2/08)
	 



for this new mix i've gone to the extended 80 minute length... there were just too many good tracks that i didn't want to cut! this is mostly vocal trance, with some house and electronica as well. i am extremely happy with this set, i personally consider it an achievement of both mixing and track selection... please let me know what you think. sit back, turn up the volume, and let go!

	 mark strube presents: flow dynamics (1/08)
	 



i've surprised myself with this genre shift. this new set is overall a chill-out mix, with a lot of hip-hop/funk elements, along with the electronica of course. this set is less about the smooth, barely noticeable transitions & layering... and more about just putting together a great set of eclectic tracks while maintaining a nice flow. please let me know what you think!track listing:01. groove armada - suntoucher (6:33)02. roy sela - the way (3:59)03. liftoff - kool it man (3:43)04. fort knox five - blowing up the spot (2:41)05. flash callahan - do you know the truth (4:23)06. malik trey - sleepy shadows (3:29)07. international velvet feat. mustafa akbar - chariot (interplanetary mix) (2:39)08. speedy consuela - sukka suited (2:49)09. roy sela - music to your ears (6:55)10. miika kuisma - trying my new wings (3:10)11. miika kuisma - cloud surfing (4:01)12. miika kuisma - till the dawn (2:00)13. cicada - cut right through (4:24)14. miika kuisma - time to fade (3:15)15. groove armada - common (2:42)16. elite force - you (5:30)

if you would like any of my mixes in higher quality, i will send you a cd for free. i do not make money on this... that would be illegal, and this is purely for promotional purposes. (note the fact that i give these all away for free on my site and podcast, taking immense bandwidth hits in the process.)however, i must cover my shipping & handling costs to get the cd to you. simply send me a paypal donation of $3.00 for the first mix cd, and $.50 more for every additional cd, using the button below. be sure to tell me in the payment comments which mixes you'd like, and be sure to select your correct shipping address.(outside the contiguous united states - $8.00 for the first mix and $1.00 more for every additional mix.)
