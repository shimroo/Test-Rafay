the north country maturing gardener lives, gardens and ages gracefully (we can only hope!) in northern new hampshire.  she was certified as a master gardener in connecticut and now, new hampshire. aging however, brings limitations...hence the internet vs. the digging!  :-)  so, come visit and have the north country maturing gardener (ncmg) answer your gardening questions on line!

     greetings from the pacific northwest!
    


well, the deed is done!  we have moved to the pacific northwest.  we now reside in downtown seattle.  it's a far cry from the woods of new hampshire!
i have just begun a new blog and if you're curious, come visit me at a transplanted gardener.  it will be very different from the north country maturing gardener, but maybe you'll learn right along with me!
i will also have a new email address atransplantedgardener@gmail.com .  i hope you'll come visit!  thanks for following me all these years!

     gardening chores for march and a big move!
    


well, it's happened! we are moving to seattle, washington. more than likely, i'll let this blog die. i think i'll find something to interest me in the gardening venue out there. if and when that time comes, i'll probably post the link on this website.i would like to thank all my faithful readers. i have enjoyed doing this through the years. i have enjoyed your comments and questions. i will remember it all with fondness.i am anticipating a whole new learning experience in the pacific northwest. wish us luck!marchbe sure to fertilize that poinsettia.check your stored bulbs to be sure they're not being eaten bymice.also, remove forced bulbs from cold storage. put them in a cool place until they begin to sprout, then bring them into the place you want to have them bloom.this is a good time to buy summer blooming bulbs.start seeds inside.begonias can be started in peat moss.if you haven't done so yet, start planning a new garden!this is a good time to send in a soil sample for testing...if you can get to it!if you have a lawn, this is a good time to send the mower in fora tune-up.fruit trees should be pruned of dead and diseased branches. checka reference book and give them a general pruning as well.it is time for dormant pruning. this is the process whereby you prune the trees while they are in a dormant (non-growing) state.keep your pruning shears away from spring blooming trees and shrubs, except tosnip a few for inside forcing! (although you should certainly remove dead and diseased branches.) some good forcing candidates are: cherry, apple, dogwood and forsythia. just remember that whatever you cut off now will not be blooming in a few months!cut back woody perennials like artemesia, lavender and russian sage to about 6 inches from the ground.talk about pruning shears...sharpen them before using.if any of your plants are frost-heaved, gently push them back into the ground.

     gardening chores for february
    


februarybring home some wonderful blooming flowers to enjoy around the house!look around the garden (if it isn't covered by snow) and be sure none of your perennials have been heaved out of the ground by frost. if they have, press them back down.remove any heavy snow from the evergreens.this is the time to get out and take a good look at your trees to see if they could stand somepruning. it is easy to see whether there are broken or diseased branches now that there are no leaves.are you ordering from those catalogs? this is the time to plan on making your dreams come true! at least in the garden.as you look around the neighborhood, make note of plants that have "winter interest". find out what they are and plan to add them to your garden when the weather is better!trees are easy to identify in the winter because all the leaves are gone. however, you have no leaves to use to help you either...so go to the book store and buy a winter tree identification guide. it's kind of fun identifying trees by their shapes, and the kids love doing it as well.if you haven't done it already, sharpen those tools-and while you're at it, organize them as well.before you know it, it will be time to roll out the lawn mower. has it been serviced? get it to the shop before everyone else beats you to it.if you have grapes, prune the vines now. if you wait until it begins to warm up, they will "bleed".if you start vegetable seeds this month or next, try using clear topped take-home trays that you get leftovers in, from restaurants. they work really well!force some of your spring blooming twigs for indoor color. try fruit trees, forsythia, dogwood, pussy willow and quince. just bring them inside and allow them to sit in a large vase with water.keep those bird feeders full.be sure to keep the leaves of indoor plants "dusted". it helps to wipe them with a damp cloth to keep the pores open.

     gardening chores for january
    


januarystart looking for those wonderful gardening catalogues!start a gardening journal. you can use a notebook, a calendar or even a real gardening journal you buy at the book store!this is a good time to check old seeds for viability. while you're there, paste a label on the envelope indicating when they should be planted, and whether they need soaking first. then sort them according to that timetable!your indoor plants get pretty dry at this time of year. try misting them. (don't mist african violets, however!) all plants should be watered sparingly during the winter. standing them in a tray of wet gravel is a wonderful treat for any indoor plants in the winter.turn indoor plants every week or so in order to keep their growth even.check those indoor plants for insects and give them a soapy bath if you find any!remove any heavy snow from evergreens. be careful! if it is icy, wait until it melts.try stamping a circle around the trunks of fruit trees that might be vulnerable to rodent damage.put your christmas tree outside to provide shelter for the birds.you can also smear the branches with peanut butter mixed with corn meal.the birds will love it!another use for that tree would be to cut some boughs off and lay them on top of your flower beds to add extra protection.keep those bird feeders full.

     poinsettia care at home
    


my husband recently had a hip replacement.  today at church he received a poinsettia from the women's fellowship.  when i got it home, i realized that a lot of folks are either receiving gift poinsettias, as we did, or are buying them.  it would be good to know how to treat them once they enter your home.  here is another link that i think would be very helpful in caring for your new plant properly.  it is from the ohio state university.  the other link also has helpful information.  enjoy them both!

     gardening chores for december
    


decemberif you can, dig a hole to put your live holiday tree in. store the soil you dig out in the garage, or other non-frozen place so you can just dump it into the hole after the tree is planted!have you made "tee-pee's" to cover your smaller shrubs, protecting them from snow loads? be sure they are out in the garden, doing their job! you can also wrap the plants, or shrubs in burlap.plant your pre-cooled bulbs in pots for some wonderful indoor color. put them first in a cool and dark spot to begin growing roots. water them, so they don't dry out.remove decorative foil from gift plants. set the plants into waterproof containers, after placing a layer of gravel in the bottom (of the outside pot) so the plant doesn't sit in water. plants are far more harmed by too much water, than too little!poinsettias should be in moist, not wet soil.fertilize houseplants.if you haven't done it yet, put stakes around your gardens bordering driveways and roads where plowed snow might harm them. the stakes will guide the plow elsewhere!save hardwood ashes to amend the soil in the spring. if your compost pile is not covered, the ashes can go right in there.think about gardening tools, equipment and books as christmas gifts.go to a gardening seminar.take a gardening break!

     can i still plant spring bulbs?
    


sure, you can still plant bulbs!  as long as the ground is not frozen yet.i'm seeing lots of sales around for bulbs.  take advantage of them.  you're planting the bulbs pretty much below the frost level.  they will work on building roots and a larger bulb all winter and reward you in the spring. so, go ahead and splurge!  get some wonderful bulbs.  you'll be glad you did come spring.
