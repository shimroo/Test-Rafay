about uii





craniosacral therapy & education with upledger institute international
cst was pioneered and developed by john e. upledger after extensive scientific studies from 1975 to 1983 at michigan state university. craniosacral therapy is a gentle, hands-on approach to evaluating and enhancing the craniosacral system, which is comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord.
cst is a complementary treatment that releases tensions deep in the body to help reduce pain, relieve dysfunction, and improve whole-body health and performance. by facilitating the body's natural and innate healing processes, cst is increasingly used as a preventive healthcare measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease. through uii's cst courses, practitioners can have a greater impact on clients' quality of life and their health.
receiving cst training from uii is unmatched. our cst training blends the science and art of health care. our faculty are leaders in their fields. they are seasoned practitioners who love to teach and share their passion for this work. hands-on, clinical experience will be the cornerstone of your education. with uii you will be inspired by this network of like-minded practitioners who are committed to excellence and making the world a healthier place, one student or client at a time.
