ocean ecology

endangered wildlife



although we share our land, water, and air with wildlife, at times it is an uneasy harmony. changes in the environment, either from human activity or other sources, affect wildlife, and eventually affect us. by practising wildlife conservation we are protecting our own species. this board is dedicated to the activist helping preserve the natural resources in our community.
