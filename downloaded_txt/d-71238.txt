welcome to lmsc


the lower merion soccer club (lmsc) is a not-for-profit youth soccer organization that sponsors a wide range of youth soccer programs for 
over 2700 youngsters each year between the ages of 3-18.  
each year, lmsc offers the following programs:

travel team program (under 8 up through under 19)
fall intramural program (ages 3-12)
spring intramural program (ages 3-12)
winter intramural program (ages 7-11)
winter training program (ages 3-6)
pre-travel team developmental academy
adult women's program
summer tournament team program (travel team players only)
special needs program for children with physical, mental and emotional limitations
a wide range of training programs offered throughout the year for children of all ages and levels


the 2024 - 2025 season will be our 57th season!

our club is about diversity.  our travel team program competes against some of the top teams in the region. lmsc travel teams
won many state champions over the years. we
also offer a wide range of programs for novice players of all ages, regardless of athletic ability and soccer background.  

our club offers a wide range of programs for children, based on age, gender, athletic ability, previous experience and desired competitive level. 
our travel team program offers up to four different teams in many age groups. the travel team program is not just for the superstar. 
the travel team program also offers teams for players looking to play at more competitive levels who are not super athletes.

our intramural program offers soccer for children ages 3-12.  our younger age groups all play in smaller numbers and on smaller fields than
the older age groups.  this philosophy enables players to be more involved with the play and develop at a much faster rate.

the ultimate objective of all lmsc programs is "to provide each and every youngster with a fun filled experience in a soccer environment." 
this philosophy applies to the highest level travel team player down to the least experienced intramural players and everyone in between.

lmsc is affiliated with the eastern pennsylvania youth soccer association (epysa) and the united states soccer federation (ussf).

lmsc is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.
