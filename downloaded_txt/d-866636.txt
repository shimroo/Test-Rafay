the 20, redux





years ago, i wrote a post about my top 20 songs.  kind of a "stranded on a desert island" scenario, but written like an article about investment recommendations.  it's time to update, and we'll remove the portfolio conceit.  assuming one takes the concept seriously enough (the only 20 songs you'll hear for the rest of your life), it's a challenging but fun exercise, and can actually bring up some emotions as well.


every
breath you take, police

freedom
90, george michael

don’t
stop believin’, journey

something
about you, level 42

rio,
duran duran

hungry
like the wolf, duran duran

africa,
toto

margaritaville,
jimmy buffett

escape
(the pina colada song), rupert holmes

life
in the fast lane, eagles

hotel
california, eagles

let
it be, beatles

big
shot, billy joel 

stiletto,
billy joel

come
sail away, styx

reelin'
in the years, steely dan

i.g.y.,
donald fagen

in
the air tonight, phil collins

tiny
dancer, elton john

take
five, dave brubeck quartet

of course, there's debates about things like whether africa or escape should be here (answer: it's my list, not yours), or if i should really have two eagles songs, or pick one and then add something from mozart (answer: no good answer).

i'll share honorable mentions that had to be bumped down - all stupendous songs in their own right:


time
for me to fly, reo speedwagon

bennie
and the jets, elton john

every
little thing she does is magic, police

who
can it be now, men at work

down
under, men at work

turn
the page, bob seger

take
it easy, eagles

gold
dust woman, fleetwood mac

juke
box hero, foreigner

heat
of the moment, asia

maneater,
hall & oates

devil
may care, diana krall

the grains of rice are piling up





i recently heard a thought-provoking idea.  it linked the allegory of "give me one grain of rice today, two grains of rice tomorrow, four grains of rice the next, and so on" with moore's law.  i was struck at how these two concepts can illustrate the cliche idea that computer power will truly explode in the coming years, much more so that even we have witnessed recently. 

i had to do a bit of googling to find out that the original insight was had by ray kurzweil in 2000 (before the doubling effects of moore's law were quite in the territory they are approaching now).  here's an article that summarizes it nicely, and adds some important context.

what's the upshot?  if this is to be taken seriously, the future jobs market may look more like this (see table at bottom, even if you don't read the whole thing). 

for years, i would joke that i might become a plumber, maybe because my dad was, and i learned a bit about it, but more importantly, because "you couldn't offshore a blocked-up toilet."  i'm now inclined to be more forward looking, and suggest that formidable computational power will be applied to eliminate the current systems of waste management as we know them today, and replace them with small biologically-engineered devices that happily consume all our waste and produce something harmless, or even useful.

so, what will the secure and profitable future jobs be?   there are lots of pet theories out there about bullet-proof future employment prospects.  i think it will be alot of fun to "red team" some of these ideas, coming up with creative but plausible rebuttals.  examples ...


machine learning and data management developers?  sounds good.  we will always need those, right?  maybe not.  perhaps the machines will derive their own learning and data processing approaches.
lobbyists to slow down this inevitable process?  lobbying, i think, is a combination of relationships, money, and asymmetric information.  i think the machines can tackle money and information problems just fine, and i suspect without the money and the information, the relationship piece may not be as important to these folks after all.
personal trainers.  the alternative scares me a bit, but may be real.  perhaps the machines will devise side-effect-free medications to maintain target weight, metabolism, etc.  




hopefully, you will come up with some ideas and rebuttals of your own.  if you do come up with a real rebuttal-free winner, i'll pay you to tell me what it is.   (wait a minute ...)

a fresh look at investment in drug research






it's interesting to read about the complexity of drug research.  this scientific american article does a nice job trying to explain the state of affairs.

now, here's someone that i used to work with, taking a fresh look at the money end of the problem.

while the reputation of some of these sophisticated finance techniques is perhaps a bit tarnished due to the housing bubble, i think it's fair to say that these are tools that can be used wisely, or poorly.  whether are not they are broadly understood, they still underlie a tremendous amount of finance and commerce around the world.   distributing the models and supporting data as "open source" is a great way to build confidence in the approach.  in fact, assuming an active feedback loop from investment to results will tend to direct more investment to those organizations that demonstrate the most success tackling the computational problems discussed in the sciam article.

free love workspaces





i tend to be pretty skeptical of "free love workspaces" ... the open office floorplans that ensure i will:



hear all the commentary (and sound effects) of my free love workspace-mates, good and bad.
be able to partake in any contagion from the same folks.
be blocked from the occasional deep thought that would seem to be required for knowledge work.



it seems like it isn't pc to criticize these designs, though.  between the management philosophies about teamwork at all times at all costs (like "brace yourself, i'm about to collaborate with you"), and the cost controls they reflect, there isn't alot of support for my view of things.  however, the nyt finally spoke up in this article.  not quite the corporate-friendly validation that the wsj might provide, but i'll take what i can get.

if you love your legos, set them free ...





i can still remember my childhood set of legos. they weren't quite as fancy as the ones you get now - just the basic blocks, wheels, windshields, roofing pieces, etc. i even remember the red plastic sewing case that i used to carry them around in.i'd probably been accumulating them for years. however, i probably didn't buy any myself. i can't say for sure, but i apparently didn't know what they cost because when my grandparents were holding a yard sale decades ago, i got caught up in the exciting of selling "old stuff" to make money, and i slapped a $5 sticker on the whole set, case and all.the first moment my mother caught wind of this was as some man was walking away with his amazing purchase. i'd like to say that he was cackling while he ran down the street, but he was probably a bit more smooth than that. my mother was upset, perhaps for my poor decision-making, but probably mostly out of disappointment that i didn't have the set anymore. i regretted the sale almost immediately.as an adult now with two young kids, i've got the excitement and the means to keep up a steady flow of new legos for them. it is a real pleasure to sit with them and build spaceships, houses, trucks, whatever.but, i can't tell you what a wonderful feeling it was to stop at some random yard sale and see a big set of legos for sale - 5$ ! i guess they didn't know what they were selling either, and i'm happy to say that being unaware of the value of legos is apparently timeless and inflation-proof.of course, i couldn't bring myself to take them for 3$. i told the woman they were worth more, and asked if $20 would do it. she was thrilled, and thankfully didn't counter for even more!as i continued digging through their piles of stuff for sale, i found another set - a little smaller than the first, and priced at $3. i offered her $10 for that one.as i carried my new legos away, i cackled a little, and tried not to run.

giddy screeching monkeys





perhaps i should post something from the national review for balance.  but in the meanwhile, this article should provide a few laughs, if not a penetrating insight into the nature of nature.

the tao of cusack





"i don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. i don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. you know, as a career, i don't want to do that."'nuff said.
