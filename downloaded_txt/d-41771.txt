helping familiesbuild a heritage of faith together

 













about us




“love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. these commandments that 1 give you today are to be upon your hearts. impress them on your children. talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.”

— deuteronomy 6:5-7



in 1995, heritage builders global was founded by three fathers.  their goal and passion was to give families the tools needed to follow the lord in unity.in 2013 heritage builders transitioned into two distinct entities. heritage builders publishing llc and heritage builders global (a 501c3 non-profit ministry).  













the goal of hbg is to encourage and empower parents all over the world to pass their faith to their children.heritage builders global is not about another church program. it is a set of tools that can add substance to your church's existing programs. it is a movement that seeks to educate, train and equip parents to become intentional about passing on a spiritual heritage to their children. heritage builders global can help the members of your church become stronger in their own faith and more intentional in passing on a legacy of faith to their children. with the principles from heritage builders global, parents grow, encourage and guide their children's spiritual life. the church becomes a partner in helping parents meet that challenge and a community in which to celebrate milestones in each child's life.
