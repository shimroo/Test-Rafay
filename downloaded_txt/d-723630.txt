chase community





compounding factors make mental illness worse. one of them is loneliness. although we're all different in terms of how much company we'd like to keep, being lonely all the time works against the path to recovery.

it's hard to power through the notion of being with other people when you just want to sit and do nothing (or can only do nothing). however, recovery needs (perhaps requires) the support net of positive community. there is power when you can, in whatever way, both share your burdens with others, and you may find giving back into community a helpful way to prove to yourself you're still valuable.

opt for community, go find community, in the flesh kind of community, and don't look back.

have pets helped your recovery ?





i don't nkow if adding a new pet to the mix if you've never had one is necessarily the right option, but i know for a fact many people have benefited from the company and love from a pet.

dogs or cats are the prime examples, both of which offer therapeutic benefits to their owners.

how have your experiences been with animals? have you found them to be a nuisance or a life saver?

find a rooter





you know the one--the kinds of people who root you on. positive people help, maybe even people who aren't intimately connected to you (family for example). being around an environment that's positive, helps both in pointing to a better picture in your mind (the possibility of), and it also adds the critical dimension of community.

although you may not have it in you to maintain a friendship as often as you would like (but if you can, opt for community), in the least, make a point to chase those who root you on. and if you think you're not worth it, remember that's a lie.

just do it





easier said than done.

sometimesbreaking the routine of no routine is just what the doctor ordered. when dealing with mental illness,  forcing yourself to do things you otherwise wouldn't can go along way to, 'faking it until you make it'.

not big things either. simple things like making your bed, making a cup of coffee.

of course, if you are really brave heading out to try some new activities that are the opposite of sitting in a dark room all day, but that might be tomorrow's victory. as for today, finding success in even the simplest of tasks is a step in the right direction--a triumph!

keep a job with mental illness 






found this conversation going on at reddit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolarreddit/comments/5ca298/how_to_keep_your_job_with_a_serious_mental_illness/

including:


step 1: do not tell anyone you work with that you have a mental health condition.just don’t. i wish that this was different, that we lived in a world where our health condition didn’t affect how we are viewed in the workplace, but that just isn’t our reality. someday, this will be different, but today is not that day.if you tell the truth, you will almost certainly be discriminated against. this ranges from illegal discrimination to smaller, legal ways like getting passed up on a project or promotion, or stigma from your coworkers if you need special accommodations. all these ways you will be discriminated against add up and seriously impact your career.

but the conversation in the comment section is worth the read.
