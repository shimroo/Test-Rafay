welcome to inmate-connection.com
a website designed to make a difference in the lives of inmates serving prison terms in   u.s. and all over the world. nothing can be as harsh as living an institutionalized life. correctional facilities across the country harbor thousands of inmates, who are bound to live behind dreary walls and only imagine as the world without them takes a giant leap towards progress and development. prison inmates are indeed at a disadvantage, as their connection with the outside world is cut and even their beloved family members and friends are restricted from maintaining communication.  the idea of becoming a pen pal is very simple. unlike most social networking platforms, you can find all the information about the inmate for whom you want to become a pen pal. you can start by writing a letter full of love and compassion, so that the dark world of prison becomes enlightened with your words of praise, love and encouragement.  the individuals living behind the bars also have hearts. they committed crimes and they are serving their sentences. however, it doesn’t mean they are any less human. in fact, inmates feel the need for companionship more than us. the individuals living in prison cells lose connections from the outside world after two or three years. don’t you think they need to know what is happening outside the prison so that they can adjust in the society later when they complete their terms?  pen pals are a great way to connect inmates with the outside world.
