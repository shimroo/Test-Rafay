                            today's tax laws are complicated.
                        


                            whether we like it or not, today's tax laws are so complicated that filing a relatively simple return can be confusing. it is just too easy to overlook deductions and credits to which you are entitled. even if you use a computer software program there's no substitute for the assistance of an experienced tax professional.
