                                      robinson talks about richard:  richard
                                      baldwin was a special man to me. he would
                                      let me come into his home and look at all
                                      the muscle magazines. rich also had a
                                      great physique and he was a great person.
                                      he allowed me to dream. i would get lost
                                      looking at the physiques in the magazines.
                                      it was another world for me to make up my
                                      mind to be best. thanks r.b. back in those
                                      days white and blacks lived on different
                                      sides of the track. if you got caught on
                                      their side you would get your buns kicked
                                      and vice versa. that's just the way it
                                      was. so my crew and i ran in a pack. that
                                      was what saved us. plus we were built for
                                      teenagers. we never had any problems.
                                      because of richard baldwin's support we
                                      had somewhat of a free passage. peace
