basenji
        information




since
    december 1999, after launching my rugosa
    basenjis web site, i have received hundreds of inquiries from 
   visitors. most of these have been requests for more information on 
   this wonderful breed. i am so impressed with the number of people 
   willing to do the research needed to decide if a basenji would fit 
   into their lifestyle, but found myself answering some of the same 
   questions over and over and over. so, i've tried to answer the most 
   common questions i received here.



the
    following links will take you to the various pages of this 
   "information packet." please keep in mind that some of the 
   information is my "opinion" and there will be good breeders 
   who will disagree with what i believe. contact other breeders and 
   discuss these same topics with them. it is your job, as a buyer, to 
   do your research, and find the breeder you feel you can trust, and 
   that you feel comfortable with.

you
    will find varying ideas among breeders, but hopefully, when it comes to 
   health, temperament and conformation, the breeder you decide on will 
   be dedicated to preserving this unique breed. 

please
    feel free to contact me for any help you may need, regardless of 
   where you got your basenji. if i can't answer your questions, i will 
   refer you to someone who can. my goal is that each basenji be placed 
   in its "forever" home right from the start, something that 
   will only happen if those looking for a basenji are educated and 
   armed with the information needed to make a wise decision.
