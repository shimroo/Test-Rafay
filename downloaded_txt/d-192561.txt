general fire restrictions on tonto national forest begin friday, april 18
release date: apr 18, 2014  
all fireworks prohibited year-round
phoenix (april 18, 2014) â drought conditions, hot temperatures, and increased fire danger have resulted in fire restrictions for the tonto national forest beginning at 8 a.m., friday, april 18.
most types of fire or fire-causing activities are prohibited across the entire tonto national forest.
building, maintaining, attending or using a fire, campfire or charcoal-burning device is prohibited.
restrictions also apply to operating internal combustion power tools, using welding equipment or torches with open flames, operating combustion engines without spark-arresting devices in effective working order, or discharging firearms except in taking game in accordance with arizona hunting laws.
smoking is prohibited except within an enclosed vehicle or building, or a developed recreation site.
use of petroleum-fueled stoves, lanterns, and heating devices are allowed, and some developed campgrounds are exempted from these restrictions. (please see attached list).
âwe are going into restrictions about a month earlier than normal due to the extremely dry winter and spring weâve had this year. fuel moisture and humidity levels have been decreasing steadily across the forest and the fire danger is high,â said tonto national forest fire management officer helen graham. âthese precautionary measures are intended to protect forest resources and enhance our visitorsâ quality recreation experiences.â
âwe continue to remind the public that all fireworks are prohibited on the forest at all times and this includes the use of exploding targets,â emphasized graham.
violation of these fire restrictions is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and imprisonment for up to six months.
