literature helps us see the inner beauty of man, learn to understand and appreciate it.
literature is a powerful source of nurturing the spirit, the personality. through the disclosure of artistic images, literature gives us the concepts of good and evil, truth and falsehood, truth and falsehood. no reasoning, the most eloquent, no arguments, the most convincing, can have such an impact on the human mind as a truthfully depicted image. and that is the power and significance of literature.
literature is a powerful weapon that can heal.
literature shows us the way to self-improvement.
