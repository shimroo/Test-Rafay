the chrysler 300 was a milestone car in automotive history and the legend
lives on today, more than sixty years after it was first introduced in 1955.
this story chronicles the cars and the people who had a vision to build a car
company based on strong engineering innovations, the people who crafted
the cars, and the people who restore them and drive them today.


the chrysler 300 club inc was formed in portland, oregon in 1969, originally
 to recognize the letter series chrysler 300s built from 1955 through 1965.

in 1981 the non-letter 300  series built from 1962 through 1971 and the 1979
cordoba 300 were also included  in the club.

the club was created for  enthusiasts of chrysler 300 automobiles.
ownership of a 300 is not required for membership. members of the club enjoy
camaraderie, share  stories and information on the maintenance, restoration and
acquisition of  these beautiful, unique automobiles.

national meets are held annually, usually in the summer. club  members are
encouraged to participate in activities and meets whether or not  their cars are
restored.


membership in the club includes a subscription to our quarterly magazine, brute force.
