how to invest in gold

 february 8, 2025february 8, 2025

how i stumbled into gold investing (and why you might want to, too)
let me paint you a picture: it’s 2008, the economy is doing the financial equivalent of a slow-motion car crash, and i—like many others—am watching my investments nosedive faster than my uncle dave at an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet.
at the time, i thought i was playing it smart. i had a solid stock portfolio, a couple of real estate plays, and some cash on the sidelines. but when the market tanked, my so-called “diversified” investments all seemed to have one thing in common—they were losing money. fast.
that’s when i had a lightbulb moment: maybe it’s time to look into gold.
the moment i realized gold wasn’t just for pirates and grandpas
i always thought gold was one of those things old-school investors clung to, like vhs tapes or their belief that fax machines were still relevant. but as i started researching, i realized gold wasn’t just a shiny rock—it was a financial lifeline.
unlike stocks or real estate, gold doesn’t need a company to perform well or a housing market to stay strong. it doesn’t care about inflation, interest rates, or the fact that your neighbor just flipped their house for a loss. gold has been valuable for thousands of years, and—spoiler alert—it’s not about to stop now.
so, after about three weeks of deep dives, caffeine-fueled youtube binges, and one too many late-night infomercials (do not buy gold-plated coins from tv, trust me), i decided to pull the trigger and start investing.
here’s what i learned along the way.



step 1: understanding why gold is a smart play
gold isn’t some get-rich-quick scheme. it’s a way to hedge against economic chaos, protect your wealth, and sleep a little easier knowing that no matter what happens with the dollar, the stock market, or global politics, your gold is still, well… gold.
a few key reasons people invest in gold:

inflation hedge: when inflation goes up and your dollars buy you less, gold tends to hold its value.
crisis insurance: market crashes, global instability, financial meltdowns—gold is like that one friend who always has extra batteries and a backup plan.
diversification: it doesn’t move in sync with stocks and bonds, making it a great way to balance risk in your portfolio.
real asset: unlike digital stocks that exist as numbers on a screen, gold is something you can actually hold.

after getting my head around why gold made sense, i needed to figure out how to invest.

step 2: choosing the right type of gold investment
at first, i figured i’d just buy a few gold bars and store them in my sock drawer (don’t do this). turns out, there are multiple ways to invest in gold, and each has its pros and cons. here’s what i found:
1. physical gold (coins, bars, and jewelry)
if you like the idea of actually holding your investment, physical gold is the way to go. there’s something undeniably cool about owning a stack of gold coins—it feels like you’re starring in your own treasure-hunting movie.
pros:

you own it outright
no counterparty risk (unlike stocks or funds)
holds value over time

cons:

requires secure storage
can have higher premiums when buying/selling
not as liquid as other investments

lesson learned: if you’re buying physical gold, get a safe (preferably not the kind you see in heist movies) and consider using a secure vault service.
2. gold etfs (exchange-traded funds)
gold etfs (like gld) are basically gold in stock form. you don’t physically own any gold, but you get exposure to its price movements without dealing with storage or security.
pros:

easy to buy and sell like a stock
no need to worry about storage
lower transaction costs

cons:

you don’t actually own the gold
potential management fees

lesson learned: etfs are great if you want exposure to gold without the hassle, but if things ever get really chaotic (think financial doomsday), i’d rather have physical gold in my hands than a digital promise.
3. gold mining stocks & mutual funds
instead of owning gold itself, you can invest in companies that mine it. some investors prefer this because miners can provide leverage—if gold prices rise, mining company profits usually jump even more.
pros:

potential for higher returns than gold itself
some pay dividends
easy to trade like stocks

cons:

riskier (mining companies can go bankrupt, gold doesn’t)
stock market volatility applies

lesson learned: if you go this route, look for well-established mining companies with solid financials.
4. gold iras
if you want to add gold to your retirement savings, a gold ira lets you hold physical gold in a tax-advantaged account. but there are rules (and fees) you need to be aware of.
pros:

tax benefits (like a regular ira)
long-term wealth preservation

cons:

setup and storage fees
limited to approved gold types

lesson learned: gold iras are great for long-term investors, but they come with paperwork and fees—so make sure it fits your overall strategy.



step 3: making my first gold investment
after weighing my options, i decided to go with a mix:

50% physical gold (mostly coins, stored securely)
30% gold etf (gld) for liquidity
20% gold mining stocks (for the upside potential)

the result? a portfolio that gave me the security of owning real gold, the flexibility of an etf, and a little growth potential with mining stocks.



final thoughts: should you invest in gold?
if you’re looking for a flashy, high-risk investment that’ll make you rich overnight, gold isn’t it. but if you want a proven asset that protects your wealth, balances your portfolio, and gives you peace of mind, gold might just be what you need.
and hey, worst case? at least you’ll own something shiny. 😉



key takeaways:

gold is a solid hedge against inflation and economic downturns.
you can invest in gold through physical ownership, etfs, mining stocks, or iras.
diversifying across different gold investments can balance risk and reward.
storing gold securely is crucial—don’t just throw it in a sock drawer!

so, my friend, what’s your next move? ready to add a little gold to your portfolio? or are you still waiting for that perfect moment? (spoiler: there’s never a perfect moment—just start smart.)
stay golden.
 




gold ira vs. physical gold

 february 8, 2025february 8, 2025

i never thought i’d be the guy sitting at a beachside bar, sipping a margarita, and contemplating the finer nuances of gold ownership. yet, here i was, half-listening to the waves crash, half-pondering whether a gold ira or physical gold was the smarter play. maybe it was the tequila talking, but i felt like i was at a crossroads—two paths leading to golden riches, but only one was right for me.
how it all started: the gold bug bite
it all began when i saw the stock market doing its usual rollercoaster act—one day soaring, the next plummeting like an anchor. the sheer unpredictability made me want to scream (or at least toss my phone into the ocean). i needed a hedge, something rock-solid. enter gold.
gold has been around since ancient civilizations were trading spices and telling time with sundials. it’s weathered every market crash, economic meltdown, and even my uncle’s disastrous attempts at day trading. but here’s the catch—do you go all-in on physical gold, stuffing your safe with shiny bars, or do you take the tax-advantaged route and put it in a retirement account?
the answer, my friend, isn’t as simple as it seems.
physical gold: the old-school route
what i realized reading the reliable gold invesment blog is that there’s something undeniably satisfying about holding a solid gold bar in your hand. it’s like having a real, tangible insurance policy against financial chaos. if everything went sideways, i could trade my gold for food, supplies, or a yacht to escape to a private island (a guy can dream, right?).
pros of physical gold:

direct ownership – no third-party involvement, no middlemen, just you and your golden treasure.
universal value – no matter where you go in the world, gold speaks a universal language: wealth.
no counterparty risk – unlike stocks, bonds, or even gold iras, there’s no risk of a company going under and taking your investment with it.
instant liquidity – in an emergency, you can sell your gold on the spot, no paperwork required.

cons of physical gold:

storage woes – keeping a stash of gold at home means you need a high-quality safe—or a really good hiding spot. burying it in the backyard is not recommended (unless you have a treasure map).
insurance costs – if you do store it at home, you’ll want insurance, which adds another cost.
no tax advantages – selling physical gold can come with capital gains taxes, which aren’t always friendly to your bottom line.

gold ira: the retirement play
now, let’s talk about the gold ira. i’ll be honest—when i first heard about it, i pictured a bank vault stuffed with gold bars with my name on them. turns out, it’s a bit different (okay, a lot different). a gold ira is a self-directed retirement account where you can hold irs-approved gold, silver, platinum, or palladium. the key word here? retirement. this isn’t about quick access—it’s a long-term wealth game.
pros of a gold ira:

tax advantages – depending on whether you choose a traditional or roth ira, you get tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
secure storage – no need to worry about theft; irs regulations require your gold to be stored in a secure, approved depository.
retirement hedge – gold iras offer diversification away from paper assets, which is crucial when markets tank.

cons of a gold ira:

no immediate access – if you need quick cash, getting gold out of an ira isn’t like selling a stock with one click. there are processes, penalties (if you’re under 59½), and tax implications.
higher fees – custodians, storage, and transaction fees add up over time. it’s not as simple as buying and holding physical gold.
limited control – unlike physical gold, you don’t personally hold it. you have to trust the system (and let’s be real, that’s not always easy).

the moment of truth: my decision
so, which did i go with? both.
i like having options, and i refuse to be boxed into just one investment strategy. my gold ira is my long-term, retirement-focused play, safely tucked away like a fine bottle of whiskey, aging with grace. but i also keep a stash of physical gold—just enough to sleep well at night, knowing i’ve got tangible wealth i can access at any moment.
would i recommend the same for you? it depends. if you’re the kind of person who wants immediate access to your assets and likes the idea of physically holding your investment, physical gold is the way to go. but if you’re thinking about retirement and want tax advantages, a gold ira could be your best bet.
at the end of the day, gold is gold. the key is choosing the right mix that fits your lifestyle, financial goals, and risk tolerance.
now, if you’ll excuse me, i’ve got a margarita to finish and an investment portfolio to check.
key takeaways:

physical gold gives you direct ownership, liquidity, and security, but storage and insurance can be a hassle.
gold iras offer tax advantages and secure storage but come with restrictions and fees.
the best strategy? consider a mix of both for flexibility and long-term security.
investing in gold isn’t just about wealth—it’s about peace of mind in an unpredictable world.

so, are you stacking gold bars or setting up a gold ira? or maybe both? whatever you decide, just remember: fortune favors the prepared.

a gold ira can function as a protective measure during periods of economic uncertainty, as gold’s value typically remains stable amidst market fluctuations. by integrating gold into one’s retirement strategy, an additional layer of stability can be added to their financial future. this precious metal possesses both inherent value and the tendency to move independently from stocks and bonds, providing a protective shield in the event of market downturns. the tax benefits linked to a gold ira can result in more effective wealth management and increased financial security for retirement.
1. diversification of portfolio
expanding the range of assets in your retirement portfolio by investing in a gold ira can assist in managing the risks linked to market fluctuations and economic instabilities.
integrating gold into your investment approach can act as a safeguard against inflation and the devaluation of currency, offering a sense of security during economic crises. gold has consistently been perceived as a secure asset, delivering diversification advantages that can complement conventional investments like 401(k) plans. by broadening your portfolio with a gold ira, you not only shield your assets from market downturns but also position yourself for potential long-term growth since gold prices typically increase with time. this makes gold a valuable inclusion in your retirement savings strategy.
2. protection against inflation
owning a gold ira can act as a valuable hedge against inflation due to gold’s tendency to hold its value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. throughout history, precious metals like gold have been regarded as safe-haven assets, offering stability to retirement funds and ensuring a financially secure future.
the intrinsic value and limited supply of gold make it a dependable wealth store that shields investors from the impact of inflation on purchasing power. by including gold in a gold ira, investors can diversify their retirement investment portfolios and safeguard their savings from market fluctuations and take advantage of the gold bull market. this strategic retirement planning approach allows individuals to protect their financial stability and preserve their wealth over the long term. by integrating gold into their retirement accounts, investors are taking proactive steps to construct a resilient and secure retirement fund.

4. tax advantages
one of the key advantages of a gold ira lies in the potential tax benefits it can offer. depending on an individual’s specific financial circumstances, contributions made to a gold ira may be eligible for tax deductions. additionally, any gains accumulated within the account can grow on a tax-deferred basis, presenting a tax-efficient method for generating retirement income.
by opting for a gold ira, individuals are presented with the opportunity to potentially decrease their current taxable income through deductible contributions. this approach can ultimately result in a reduction of their annual tax liability. furthermore, the tax-deferred nature of growth within the account means that taxes on the appreciation of gold investments are deferred until withdrawals are made during retirement. by strategically leveraging ira rollovers and carefully evaluating the tax implications, individuals can optimize their retirement tax planning and maximize the long-term financial security benefits associated with a gold ira.
what are the risks of investing in a gold ira?
while the gold ira presents a range of advantages, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential risks associated with investing in precious metals. these risks encompass the volatility of gold prices, which can experience significant fluctuations, the costs linked to storing and maintaining physical gold assets, and the comparatively restricted liquidity of gold investments in contrast to more traditional investment vehicles.
investors must recognize that gold’s value can be influenced by a variety of economic factors, geopolitical developments, and prevailing market conditions, leading to notable price oscillations. safeguarding physical gold holdings can entail expenses related to secure storage and insurance coverage. moreover, the limited immediacy of liquidity in gold assets can potentially present challenges when swift access to funds becomes necessary, particularly in times of financial instability or emergencies.
to address and navigate these risks effectively, it is imperative for investors to engage in proper asset management practices and thorough financial planning. this approach is essential to mitigating potential pitfalls and ensuring knowledge-based decision making when contemplating the inclusion of a gold ira in one’s investment strategy.
1. volatility of gold prices
one of the main risks associated with investing in a gold ira is the volatility of gold prices. these prices can see significant fluctuations influenced by market demand, geopolitical factors, and economic conditions. to manage this volatility effectively, strategic wealth management is necessary to shield your retirement savings from sudden price shifts.
by employing wealth management strategies that are specifically designed for the ever-changing nature of the gold market, investors can navigate through price uncertainties and protect their retirement funds. diversifying assets, conducting regular portfolio assessments, and staying informed about market trends are essential elements in maintaining and increasing wealth within a gold ira. understanding the relationships between gold prices and other financial instruments can aid in making well-informed investment choices, ensuring enduring financial stability for retirement planning purposes.
2. storage and maintenance costs
investors considering a gold ira need to take into account the storage and maintenance costs associated with physical gold holdings. these expenses can have an impact on the overall returns from your investment and should be included in your retirement planning tools to ensure they align with your retirement objectives and financial aspirations.
it is essential to factor in the storage and maintenance costs when evaluating a gold ira, as they directly influence the value of your retirement assets. by integrating these expenses into your comprehensive retirement planning, you can effectively manage your retirement security and make well-informed decisions regarding your financial future.
incorporating these costs into your retirement strategy provides a more precise evaluation of your overall financial situation, offering a clearer perspective on how to optimize your retirement choices and establish a stable financial foundation for the post-retirement phase.
3. limited liquidity
investing in a gold ira carries the risk of limited liquidity due to the nature of physical gold in comparison to more traditional financial assets. this restricted liquidity can impact the prompt access to funds during times of urgency, highlighting the importance of thoughtful retirement planning to ensure a steady cash flow and overall financial stability.
given the potential challenges posed by the lack of liquidity in a gold ira, sound retirement planning advice becomes essential. without the proper guidance, individuals may encounter difficulties in meeting their retirement expenses and sustaining their desired lifestyle post-retirement.
it is advisable to seek expert financial advice to develop strategies that strike a balance between the advantages of gold investment for retirement and the necessity for accessible funds when needed. by integrating effective retirement planning techniques, individuals can fortify their retirement security and optimize the advantages of a gold ira for long-term financial well-being.
how to start investing in a gold ira?
embarking on the journey of investing in a gold ira involves a series of crucial steps that are vital to crafting a successful retirement strategy. the initial step entails seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who can lead you through the process of establishing a gold ira, identifying your investment objectives, and formulating a customized retirement savings plan that is in line with your extended financial goals.
your financial advisor will play a pivotal role in elucidating the advantages of diversifying your retirement portfolio with gold and the tax benefits associated with a gold ira. by determining your risk tolerance and investment timeline, you can collaborate with your advisor to choose appropriate gold investments that complement your overall retirement strategy.
moreover, utilizing retirement planning tools can serve as a valuable resource in monitoring your progress towards achieving your financial objectives and making necessary adjustments to your investment approach as required.
1. choose a custodian
choosing a reputable custodian is a critical initial step in establishing a gold ira. your selected custodian will oversee the management of your retirement funds, protect your precious metal assets, and ensure adherence to irs regulations. it is essential to consider custodians that align with your retirement objectives and offer comprehensive asset protection services.
a trustworthy custodian plays a crucial role in assisting you in effectively managing a gold ira. by entrusting your retirement wealth to a reputable custodian, you can have peace of mind knowing that your assets are secure and that your financial future is being carefully handled. custodians not only provide safe storage for your precious metals but also aid in maintaining your ira’s tax-advantaged status by ensuring all transactions comply with irs guidelines.
select a custodian that prioritizes transparency, expertise, and proactive support to help you reach your retirement goals.
2. fund the account
once a custodian has been selected, the subsequent step involves funding your gold ira account. this process entails transferring funds from an existing retirement account or making new contributions to establish a secure retirement nest egg. properly funding your gold ira is crucial for realizing your retirement planning objectives and ensuring a financially stable future.
by apportioning funds to a gold ira, one is adopting a proactive approach to securing their retirement and establishing a strong financial footing for the future. maximizing contributions and judiciously selecting suitable investment opportunities within the gold ira can have a significant impact on one’s retirement security. employing retirement planning tools and strategies can assist in navigating the intricacies of retirement investing and optimizing savings for long-term growth.
creating a diversified portfolio within the gold ira is essential for safeguarding financial stability and attaining retirement goals.
3. decide on type of gold investment
when establishing a gold ira, the choice of gold investment holds significant weight and requires careful consideration. investors have the option of selecting between physical gold bullion, gold coins, or gold etfs based on factors like risk tolerance, investment strategy, and long-term financial goals for retirement. each type of gold investment presents distinct advantages and factors to take into account for the growth of retirement wealth.
to make an informed decision about the gold investment for their ira, investors should evaluate their investment objectives and time horizon. physical gold bullion is often preferred by individuals seeking a tangible asset with intrinsic value, while gold coins may offer historical and numismatic worth. conversely, gold etfs grant investors exposure to gold prices without the necessity for physical storage. by comprehending their risk tolerance and desired level of engagement in managing their investment, individuals can make well-informed choices that align with their retirement objectives.
4. monitor and rebalance portfolio
it is crucial to regularly monitor and rebalance your gold ira portfolio to ensure it is in line with your retirement objectives and can adjust to evolving market conditions. conducting periodic reviews of your investments, asset allocation, and risk tolerance can help optimize your retirement options, safeguard your retirement assets, and maximize your retirement benefits over time.
actively managing your gold ira portfolio allows you to make strategic decisions that are in line with your long-term retirement goals. by adjusting your portfolio according to market trends and economic changes, you can seize potential opportunities for growth and income. a well-maintained portfolio not only protects your retirement assets but also positions you to take advantage of favorable market conditions.
taking a proactive approach to managing your investments can result in increased financial security during retirement and ensure that you are adequately prepared to make the most of your golden years.
is a gold ira a good investment for everyone?
while considering a gold ira can bring about significant benefits, it may not be the most suitable investment option for everyone. it is crucial to take into account various factors such as your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline in order to determine whether a gold ira is in line with your financial goals. seeking advice from a financial advisor can offer customized retirement planning guidance that is tailored to your specific circumstances.
by assessing your retirement security requirements and recognizing the diversification benefits that gold can bring to your investment portfolio, you can make a well-informed decision. individuals with a lower risk tolerance may choose to invest in a combination of traditional and alternative assets, while those seeking potential long-term growth may find gold to be an attractive option. it is important to periodically review retirement investment strategies to ensure that they are in accordance with your evolving financial objectives and the prevailing market conditions.
1. consider your investment goals
when evaluating the appropriateness of a gold ira, it is essential to align your investment objectives with the attributes of investments in precious metals. take into account how a gold ira integrates into your overall retirement savings strategy, its potential influence on generating retirement income, and its role in effectively diversifying your retirement portfolio.
by integrating a gold ira into your retirement plan, you may potentially improve the stability and growth of your investment portfolio. diversifying through precious metals provides a safeguard against market fluctuations, offering a sense of security during economic uncertainties. it is critical to evaluate how a gold ira can complement your current retirement assets, ensuring a well-rounded mix that seeks to protect and enhance wealth for your post-retirement years. assessing the long-term advantages of a gold ira in conjunction with traditional investment instruments can lead to a more resilient and prosperous retirement outlook.
2. evaluate your risk tolerance
evaluating your risk tolerance is a crucial step in determining whether a gold ira is a suitable option for your retirement planning. it is important to consider your comfort level with potential fluctuations in the value of gold investments, the impact on your retirement savings, and the level of risk exposure that fits with your retirement goals and desired financial outcomes.
understanding your risk tolerance requires a thorough examination of how much uncertainty and market volatility you can handle without jeopardizing your long-term financial objectives. by carefully evaluating your willingness to accept investment risks, you can protect your retirement funds and establish a solid foundation for a secure and prosperous future.
finding a balance between the potential benefits of investing in gold and the risks associated with market changes is essential. safeguarding your assets and managing risks effectively are fundamental aspects of successful retirement planning.

why are standing desks good for you?


 aaron
uncategorized

 october 17, 2023

standing desks are believed to offer several potential health benefits, although it’s important to note that their effectiveness can vary from person to person. some of the potential benefits of using a standing desk include:

reduced risk of sedentary behavior: prolonged sitting has been associated with various health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal problems. standing desks encourage more movement throughout the day, which can help reduce the time spent sitting and mitigate these risks.
improved posture: when used correctly, standing desks can promote better posture by encouraging users to engage their core muscles and maintain a more upright position. this can help reduce the risk of developing poor posture-related issues, such as back and neck pain.
increased energy and alertness: some people report feeling more energetic and alert when they work at a standing desk. this could be due to increased blood circulation and a more active posture.
potential calorie burn: standing burns more calories than sitting, albeit not a significant amount. over time, this small calorie difference can add up and potentially contribute to weight management.
better blood sugar control: standing after meals may help regulate blood sugar levels. a study published in the european journal of applied physiology found that standing for three hours after eating led to lower post-meal blood sugar spikes compared to sitting.
reduced risk of certain health conditions: while more research is needed, some studies suggest that using a standing desk may lower the risk of conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
enhanced productivity: some individuals find that they are more focused and productive while working at a standing desk. this may be attributed to increased alertness and a more active work environment.
customizability: many standing desks are adjustable in height, allowing users to switch between sitting and standing positions as needed. this flexibility allows for personalized comfort and work preferences.

it’s essential to use a standing desk properly and gradually increase the amount of time spent standing to avoid overuse injuries. additionally, it’s recommended to incorporate other ergonomic practices, such as using an anti-fatigue mat, wearing comfortable shoes, and adjusting the desk and monitor height to achieve an optimal setup.
while standing desks can offer potential health benefits, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. some people may find them uncomfortable or experience discomfort in their legs or feet after prolonged standing. it’s essential to listen to your body and find a balance that works for you, which may include alternating between sitting and standing throughout the day.

 




how to paint a chest of drawers

painting a chest of drawers: a 6-stage process

our lives revolve around our furniture. whether it’s the bed we sleep in or the dining table where we commune with our loved ones or the couch we love to take an afternoon nap on, our furniture means a lot to us. that explains why at one point or another, many people have thought of sprucing up their furniture.
it could be through refinishing, resurfacing, or even repainting, along with many others. well, one of the iconic ways that can transform any piece of furniture from 0 to 100 is repainting. as such, even though there are hundreds of ways to refinish your furniture, i’m going to cover the furniture paint process in this piece.
note that this instruction only applies to actual wood furniture; i’ll cover painting laminate at a later date. let’s get this party started.
6 vital stages to painting furniture successfully
stage 1: preparation
prepare your piece of furniture first. it’s not enough to apply a coat of paint and call it a day. it’ll peel and chip, and it won’t last long. before i paint something, i like to give it a thorough cleaning (of course, after removing the hardware), especially if it’s been lying in a dusty garage or storage room for a long time.
for this, murphy’s oil soap will do. it works well and is furniture-safe. remember to also disassemble all parts say, all of the drawers so that you can work on them separately.
stage 2: sanding
sand your furniture to remove all of the glossy sheens so that the paint can “grab” onto it. sandpaper with a medium grain should suffice. i however recommend fine-grit sandpaper in between paint coats.
there’s no need to remove the finish or sand it down to bare wood if you’re painting rather than staining. it is sufficient to just remove the glossy finish. you can omit this step if the surface is already dull.
stage 3: making a primer
after your furniture has dried and is dust-free, apply primer. this improves the adhesion of the paint to the object and hides any stains or discolorations in the wood. kilz primer is my favorite, and they also make a spray version (i haven’t tried it yet but plan to since i’ve heard nothing but good things about it). oil-based primer is also amazing for furniture.
stage 4: sanding again
again, sand some more! lightly sand your artwork between each application of paint with fine-grit sandpaper. this gives you a much more professional and consistent finish. make sure to clean up any sanding dust with a tack cloth each time.
stage 5: painting
having primed and prepared your piece, it’s now time for the transformation! i usually prefer interior latex paint on furniture, usually in a semi-gloss finish. anything with a non-flat finish, however, will be a good choice. (flat finishes expose every fingerprint and defect, and cleaning it will be more difficult.)
the glossier the paint, the easier it is to clean. paint thin layers and, again, sand in between each one! if you want to attain an even finish, this step is critical. i usually use 2-3 coats in total.
there are a few distinct approaches to painting. you could use a roller, brush, paint sprayer, or even conventional spray paint (as long as it’s a good brand! ). i normally paint the main areas of the furniture with a tiny foam roller and the hard-to-reach nooks with a brush, starting with the crevices. the roller aids in the elimination of obvious brush strokes.
step 6: curing and protecting
once the last coat of paint has cured for at least 24 hours, you may seal it. (alternatively, you can let it alone for around 30 days to cure.) but seriously, if you’re going to do this, leave it alone and don’t touch it!. sealing your furniture adds added protection to the finish while also making it wipeable and easy to clean.
if you’re painting with white or a very light color, i strongly advise against using polyurethane to seal your finish. it turns yellow over time. it should work with any other paint color, and i recommend minwax wipe-on poly because it is so simple to use. (the satin finish is one of my favorites.)
however, i prefer a water-based finish like minwax polycrylic. it’s less messy to clean up, and there are fewer fumes. furniture wax is another alternative that i like and that can be used on any hue, including whites. minwax finishing wax is particularly fantastic, and i’ve heard positive things about other brands too.
it’s as simple as wiping it on (i use cheesecloth), letting it dry for 10-15 minutes, and buffing it with a clean cloth until it’s as shiny as you want it. this is the look i went for on my dresser. i recommend leaving your furniture alone for a day or two after sealing it before using or handling it. it would be a pity to jeopardize all of that hard work by dealing with it too soon!
wind up
following these 6 stages to the latter, even you can be a pro! simply wait for your 30 days and add your hardware and you’re done! if you want, you can distress the item or just leave it as is. paint has an incredible ability to transform any old piece of furniture. give it a shot today!

are regular dentist visits important?
yes! this may sound extremely basic, but regular oral health maintenance by a professional is necessary to keep your mouth healthy and cavities to a minimum.  let’s face it.  most people do not to a good job of cleaning their teeth.  most people don’t clean their teeth often enough, and they don’t use proper technique.  and only a tiny percent of the population actually flosses their teeth regularly, which is probably the most important thing to do to prevent cavities from forming.
it’s also super important to catch problems, like cavities, earlier, rather than letting them grow and get out of control.  because of this it is important to go to get a dentist cleaning on a regular basis.  basically, you need to go to the dentist every six months.
by maintaining regular visits, you will save yourself a lot of money over decades, by not needing to have as much major work done on your teeth.
what are the best practices for home dental health?
it is obviously really important to regularly brush your teeth, and to floss between your gums.  here are a few ideas of to keep you on the right path.
-brush your teeth in the morning, and right before you go to bed
-floss your teeth daily.  and if you can’t do it daily, try to floss at least 5 days out of 7
-use mouthwash daily, after brushing your teeth
-use fluoride in your toothpaste
-limit your intake of sweet sugary foodies like cookies and ice cream.  this is good not only for your teeth, but for your overall health as well.
-eliminate or severely limit sugary drinks!  most people have no idea of the massive amount of sugar that is in their favorite sodas, sports drinks, teas, and flavored coffees.  the grams of sugars in these drinks are massive.  simply by eliminating sugary drinks, you will be taking a massive step in the right direction to maintaining good oral health for the long run.
should i have digital dental x-rays?
you should have your dentist take digital x-rays of your mouth every 12 to 16 months.  as great as it is to get regular checkups, you still need the x-rays.  the reason is because the x-rays can see the insides of your teeth and gums.
they can spot the smallest problems, such as cavities, and they can be fixed before they become bigger problems.  and with digital x-rays you get a minimal amount of radiation, basically the same amount of radiation that you would get watching tv.  x-rays are so valuable because they can see, where your dentist’s eyes can not.
should i see the dentist, even if i don’t have any problems like toothaches?
yes.  you should have your regularly schedule appointments twice a year, weather you are feeling any pains or having any problems or not.  the reasons why are stated above.  your dentistry team will be able to spot and diagnose any problems before they become big problems.
what is the saying?  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?  something like that.
why are my teeth so sensitive?
a lot of people feel pain or discomfort when they eat certain foods or when they eat foods that are a bit hotter or colder than room temperature.  this is also more likely to occur as a person gets older.  the reason why is because of the depth or thickness of the enamel that covers the tooth.
you can think of the enamel as a force field that protects the fragile insides of the tooth such as the pulp and dentin, the same way that a heavy winter coat protects your body from the cold.  as you get older, you enamel can get worn down and it begins to provide less protect to your teeth, and so they get more sensitive.  just like an old coat will gradually begin to wear out and will not do as good a job protecting you from the winter winds and you will get chilly.
some reason that your teeth become more sensitive are:
-you haven’t been flossing, so your gums start receding
-you had an injury of some sort and your teeth became chipped or cracked
-many patients complain that their teeth whitening products make their teeth more sensitive.  that is because the harsh chemicals in these products actually erode the enamel on your teeth to make them white.  don’t use teeth whitening products!!
what age is should i start taking my kid in to see the dentist?
when your baby is a year old, you should take them in to their first dentist visit.  you will want to start your baby off with a visit to a pediatric dentist that is experienced in dealing with baby teeth.  the pediatric dentist can be helpful explaining some problems with oral health that are specific to babies.  some of these issues are:
-impact of baby’s teeth on the baby bottle
-the best practices for breastfeeding an infant
-the best way to regularly clean a baby’s teeth and gums
-how to prevent bad pacific habits and finger sucking habits
in general, on the baby’s first visit, the dentist is going to check for any teeth not coming in properly, and inspect the jaw, bite and baby gums to make sure the development is coming along safely.  you can find more in depth advice on oral health care for babies here: https://www.aapd.org/globalassets/media/policies_guidelines/bp_perinataloralhealthcare.pdf
these are just a few questions that you will want to ask your dentist.  the best thing is to find a dentist that is responsive to your needs, so that you never hesitate to ask questions.
it’s even ok if the hygienist or the front desk staff can follow up with you if the dentist is too busy.  the point is to find a practice that you feel comfortable with to ask any questions you may have and get an answer as soon as possible.

 december 13, 2019october 7, 2021seattle, tours

seattle is a city surrounded by water, which means that one of the most interesting ways to see the city is by boat. there are plenty of amazing tours in seattle, washington. from educational tours to fun boat rides, there are so many options available to people that want to explore this side of seattle.
day trips
if you’re planning on taking a day trip when you’re visiting seattle (you can learn more here: https://www.seattle.gov/), there’s a good chance that you’ll be traveling via boat. there are spacious and beautiful ships that can bring you to destinations like victoria, canada. although boat travel isn’t standard these days, it can be a surprisingly fast way to get to your destination.
you can expect to have a wonderful view of seattle when you’re on the boat, and you’ll also be able to see spectacular views of the cities you’re traveling to. you can ride a boat to a destination, spend some time there, and then take a boat back to the emerald city after you’re done.
boat tours for kids
if you’re traveling with children, you’ll want to make sure that any tour you go on is appropriate for children. although some of the most popular boat tours in the area are aimed at adults, there are also a lot of options that are family-friendly. in fact, some local schools have boat tour field trips!
you should never assume that a tour is friendly to kids. if you’re bringing children on a boat, you’ll want to do your research and find options that are appropriate for them. thankfully, since there are so many cruises and tours in the seattle area, you’ll have no shortage of choices.
one of the most popular is the long time attraction of the seattle duck boat.  the duck boats are old vessels left over from world war ii and the tour is not only kid friendly, but fun for adults as well.
harbor cruises
one of the best places to view seattle from the water is elliot bay. these cruises will take you around the harbor and allow you to see many parts of seattle. typically, these tours are also narrated, which means you’ll be able to learn more about seattle while you’re in the boat.
seattle has a storied history, and a lot of that history involves the harbor in some way. you’ll be able to remember more of what you learn if you’re able to see this side of seattle during your tour. by the time your cruise is over, you’ll feel like you’ve become an expert on certain parts of the city.
whale watching
many people dream of seeing a whale up close. that’s a dream that you can bring to life when you’re staying in seattle. there are local boat tours that are designed to let you whales in their natural habitat.
these tours are only available during certain times of the year, and there’s no guarantee that you will be able to see whales when you’re on your tour. however, tour guides know where whale activity is the highest. most people that go on these tours come away with many impressive photos of whales.
cocktail cruises
if you don’t get seasick, and you enjoy a good cocktail, why not try a cocktail cruise? there are one-hour and two-hour-long cruises available. while you’re on a cruise, you’ll be able to enjoy the pleasures of a boat ride, see more of seattle, and of course, enjoy a few nice drinks.
cocktail cruises have long been a favorite of seattle visitors, and residents love these cruises as well. not all of these cruises have a party atmosphere, but they can still be a fantastic way to kick back and have fun.
lake union cruises
because seattle is surrounded by water, it actually has a houseboat district! you can see this district for yourself if you choose to go on a tour that takes you through lake union. on a cruise like this, you’ll also be able to enjoy many other sights, like a view of the husky stadium from the water.
these tours can be quite long, but they can show you a new side of seattle. a lot of people that visit the pacific northwest never see these sights. if you go on a tour, you’ll be able to see some amazing sights and make some wonderful memories.
private sailing tours
most of the boats used for tours in seattle are quite large. since these tours are so popular, boats need to be able to accommodate a large number of people. however, it’s possible to go on a smaller tour that’s a lot more intimate. for example, you can see more of seattle from a sailboat.
it’s possible to charter a boat and go on a small cruise with just a few other people. while you might not be able to hear from an expert guide on a smaller tour like this, you’ll really get to feel the wind on your face as you’re in the water. it can be incredible to catch some views of seattle from a small boat.
hot tub cruises
it’s possible to enjoy all of the pleasures of being in a hot tub while you’re in seattle’s waters. there are boats that come equipped with hot tubs that will take you on a tour of seattle. while these kinds of cruises aren’t the best option for introverts or people that don’t enjoy hot tubs, it’s still a very unique way to experience more of what seattle has to offer.
if you do decide to go on one of these cruises, you can expect to bring two sets of clothing with you. you’ll want dry clothes, and you’ll want a swimsuit that you can wear while you’re in the hot tub. you’ll enter the boat in your dry clothes, get changed, and then enjoy the hot tub along with the other people that are on this tour.
you should try to spend some time in a boat when you’re in seattle. whether you opt for a relaxing cruise or an educational tour, you’ll really appreciate the side of the city that you see when you’re in the water. seattle has a rich culture, and the water around seattle is a big part of that.
 




explore paris a little differently

blog, tours

 december 7, 2019october 7, 2021


chic, sophisticated and romantic; three words that could very well sum up the city of paris in any visitor’s eyes, and even with all the superlatives used to describe the city none have quite managed to capture the true beauty and majesty that emanates from this ‘city of dreams’. with more famous landmarks than any other city, it’s also a weighty revenue for glitzy nightlife, exquisite cuisine, and proud culture.
for those of romantic temperament, or offbeat personality, or simply those who want to experience the city a little bit differently, the paris boat tour is a must take. it’s a chance to leisurely drift through the seine river or the network of canals while taking in some of the city’s finest landmarks. a tour of the seine will take you past sights such as the eiffel tower, musee d’orsay, notre dame, musee du louvre, hotel des invalides, assemblee nationale, grand palais, pont neuf, and pont alexandre iii.
sit back, relax and place your trust in one of the companies that have established tours through the seine and other waterways throughout the year. these companies offer a variety of deals from lunch and/or dinner, to one or two day passes. bateaux mouches, bateaux parisiens, batobus, les vedettes du pont neuf and vedette de paris are some of the tour company names that come with high recommendation. each company has its different times and places from where the tour starts and different terms/requirements that must be complied with. they have different tour patterns and may not visit all of the places mentioned above or would take a different route, thereby giving you a wide choice in which to plan the tour around your schedule to suit your needs.
looking for accommodation at a hotel in paris, it’s always best to reflect upon creature comforts and tranquility. a paris airport hotel that offers exactly such comforts along with a cozy atmosphere, exceptional service and above par leisure center is the millennium hotel paris charles de gaulle. built on the border of the village – roissy-en-france, it’s perfectly situated for reaching the paris city center.

 




bvi boat tour – bvi beaches


 aaron
blog, tours

 december 7, 2019october 7, 2021


if palm tree-lined beached with thatched rook watering holes is your idea of the perfect beach bar, you’ll never find a better collection of them then in the british virgin islands. why? the sun the sand, the incredible water… and the access to them by boat.
the usvi has incredible beaches – think magen’s bay on st. thomas, or trunk bay, watermelon cay, caneel bay on st john, but they lack the boating access and the bar location of being right on the beach, that the bvi beach bars have.
on a bvi boat tour, you can swing over to the next harbor and hang out at foxy’s. foxy’s is a much larger place than the soggy dollar. it still has the beach bar vibe, though and if foxy is there (yes, he is a real person) he’s a lot of fun to talk with. foxy’s also holds a not to be missed new years eve party every year that fills the bay with yachts, super-yachts, dinghy’s or whatever you can get thereon. by the way, foxy’s also has some really good food – their chicken roti with mango chutney is fantastic!
again, on a pirates paradise adventures bvi boat tour, you can swing around to the other side of jost van dyke and head over to foxy’s taboo. again, great drink and food on the patio overlooking the gorgeous water.
time to hop back on the bvi boat tour and head over to norman island, to the infamous willy t. while the willy t is not exactly a beach bar – it’s a floating pirate ship – it is sitting in a gorgeous bay and serves great drinks and food. the willy t’s fan-favorite ritual is for girls (and some guys) to earn free t-shirts by jumping off the top deck topless or naked. while not always wild, it can become racy quickly.

if you have small kids with you, you might prefer going to the pirates’ bight, across the bay. this place is on the beach and they even have a pirated themed museum/gift shop next door.
if you’re visiting the virgin islands, you owe it to yourself to get a bvi boat tour out to some -if not all of these iconic beach bars. it’s a fun hop from any island, including st.thomas, so make sure you add a bvi boat tour to your “must-do” list.
the boat you take really does make a difference! make sure you get one that’s comfortable and has plenty of creature comforts, such as a swim step for easy access to the water, upholstered seats, and maybe even a sun pad to maximize the fun on your next bvi boat tour.
 




the galapagos islands

 december 7, 2019october 7, 2021


galapagos island boat tours offered by the more than eighty licensed operators on the islands. a great way to experience your visit to the galapagos islands.
these fun-filled cruises last six to sixteen days with the most popular cruises being between six and eight days. the four-day cruises have been discontinued by most tour companies because many visitors felt that four days just wasn’t long enough time to take in the many spectacular sights offered by the islands.
smaller boats carrying 10 to 20 people offer the best opportunity to visit more islands as your trips on land are limited to 20 people at a time to help preserve the wear and tear on the islands. boats are limited to a maximum of 100 people in the area of the islands so smaller is better.
boat-based tours v land-based tours
you can visit more islands when you are boat-based because most of your traveling by boat is done between the islands at night when you are sleeping. if you are land-based you waste a lot of time getting ready at your hotel, traveling by bus to your boat and having to travel to whatever island you are visiting that day.
what to expect
on your first day, you will be taken to one of the nearest islands. after a light lunch, you will visit this island where you will be taken on a tour by your guide and allowed ample time to take in natural beauty and view the many animals and plants that are unique to the area.
be sure to take along a good pair of sneakers and hiking boots. your guide will inform you what type of terrain you will be walking over during your trip ashore. you will also be told if you are making a wet landing or a dry landing. on a dry landing, your landing craft will go right up on the beach or lava rock. be very careful, these rocks can be extremely slippery. on a wet landing, the landing craft cannot get directly onto the beach. you will have to take off your shoes and socks and wade to the beach in about a foot of water. be sure to take a towel to dry your feet and remove any beach sand.
after your guided walk on the island, you will be returned to the boat for a light lunch. after lunch, you will probably be offered a chance to do some snorkeling or swimming or just relax for a bit before going to the next island for another guided tour.
following your afternoon hike, you will return to the boat where you can read or rest before your delicious evening meal, which is usually served around 7:30 p.m. be sure you sample the many fresh fruits and vegetables and fish that you can probably get nowhere else.
while these boat cruises are not cheap to remember this is probably a once in a lifetime experience. so forget the expense and enjoy yourself to the fullest on your galapagos island boat tour.
