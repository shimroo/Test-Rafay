testimonials




“jason was awesome! he was super professional but also made you feel like you’ve been friends for years. his equipment is all high quality as are his pictures. he made me and my fiance feel at ease in front of the camera and had great ideas regarding places to take our photos/poses. i would recommend this guy to anyone! will definitely be using him again in the future.”

— jen s.




“this recommendation is long overdue, but well deserved! jason did my engagement photos a year ago in july and my (now) husband and i were completely blown away with jason’s photography. jason not only showed us his talent with editing and touch-ups, but we fit right in with jason’s approach. awkward staged poses quickly turned into candid shots. i would recommend giving jason a call a hundred times over! thanks, jason!”

— katie h.




“i worked with jason in vail, colorado for the gopro mountain games and shot with kayakers nick troutman, rafa ortiz and dane jackson. we nailed everything even though he had limited prep time and resources. fun-loving, organized, creative, jason a fantastic colleague to be around and work with. thanks, jason!”

— adam l.
