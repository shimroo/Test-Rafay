what guests are saying














victor dawson

tortola







“extremely well trained staff at roadtown.  this is to include everyone i was in contact with on the docks, in the restaurants, and at the desk.  really impressive.”






julie gagne

tortola







“excellent service. boats are well maintained and well equipped.”






kevin konzem

tortola







“i felt the customer service was top notch.  all of the employees from the dock to the office were friendly and helpful.  my crew, all of them first timers had a wonderful time and i am sure will want to return if not to the bvi to another sunsail or moorings location.  i have chartered with moorings many times in the past and was completely satisfied, it was the same with sunsail.  top notch.”
