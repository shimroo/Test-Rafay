the fsi difference







total rebuild
the builderâs work was so bad that we had to totally rebuild this deck and even redesign some of the very poor workmanship and details. this is a rare case where we heard of a homeowner actually recouping something form a terrible builder.  this video, no doubt shamed him into owing up to the errors.    see more about it by clicking on the red tab.

fiber cement walls & dummy wall takedowns
it will be hard to find another contractor to do what we did in this video.  we remove âdummyâ walls that leak and replace them with railing.  we remove stucco and install fiber cement siding but only after fortifying the flashings.  we remove metal parapet tops and replace them with fiberglass.  we repair the errors, repair the structure and install permanent cladding that will not leak.

fiberglass walls
we always try to make things better when we leave then they were when we first arrived. this particular job in manayunk was absolutely unbelievable when we arrived. we had a makeshift green roof with all kinds of penetrations in the field leaking like a sieve with stucco walls. we installed fiberglass cladded walls and we rerouted many of the penetrations so that they exited the vertical walls. take a look at this quick photo walk through by clicking the red tab below.

roof deck rehab
delco rehab on an old deck, new railings, etc. this was a rebuild that had some challenges with the work of others that preceded us.  this was done on an existing old property.  we went to great lengths to make this something special for our clients.   click the link for pictures.

about us
experience matters
 we have the knowledge.  we have the experience. no other company comes close to our level of expertise.  since 1978 we have serviced the exterior needs of clients throughout the delaware valley.  we entered philadelphia in 2010 to answer the calls for repair and replacement of the many roof decks created by single-trade applicators in the city.  many mistakes were made and many repeated in repair efforts.  the same people that created the problems are now engaged in the cleanup and repair of the problems they created!  because a roof deck is damaged or leaking does not mean that the cause is obvious.  quite often problems arise from sidewalls and doors and areas where the inexperience of the typical fiberglass technicians makes for return trips and ultimate costly failure.  donât repeat the cycle!  


experience
our techs have knowledge of all facets of your rooftop that can affect the success of the installation. 


highly skilled techs
they are trained and overseen by seasoned life-long trade professionals.

some facts
the same people that created the problems are now showing up to sell you more! they all try to do what we doâ¦ 
on most decks with issues, it will take so much more than a fiberglass sub-contractor to fix the problem.  builders use sub-contractors and our competitors use the same ones!  this is sad but true.  most decks that we are called out on have been repaired several times before our arrival.  some have even been coated with silicone or latex which makes out job even harder and more expensive for the homeowner.  call us and get the most comprehensive report available regarding the health of your deck and accompaniments â for free.

there really is a difference...
 costly mistakes are being made that lead to major down-line expense.  don't trust the idea of saving money with silicone, pvc, latex or even non-traffic bearing products. trust the pros of fsi.  
 every year a new company, or two will pop up to take the place of the ones that folded last year.  it is sad but true.  stay with us and we will stay with you with the best warranty coverage in the business.

















our commitment
we have been  a trustworthy company since 1978


truth
you have our word that our main focus is doing right by you.  we will inspect your deck and accompaniments free of charge and you will receive a true report as to the condition with options that fit your needs.  we will not lie to you to make a buck.  we will not withhold  information in order to present a proposal knowing that you will be hit with additional charges later.  contractors do this and it is wrong.  we only offer what will work because we will be here tomorrow to service our work.
