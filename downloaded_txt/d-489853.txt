latest story










a chandelier of great emotional impact, based on the creative intuition of the designer, together with the research on materials, technology and design conducted by luceplan.  a new protagonist for living areas in the home, but also for contract applications. the size is impressive, yet the overall image is ethereal, like an organism floating in space.
