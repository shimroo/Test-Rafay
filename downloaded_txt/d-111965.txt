  the 3 scenic byways
 nomadic hunters, including apache, kiowa, navajo, and youth (ute) tribal people sought out the valley's abundant wildlife. spanish governors were the first to provide written descriptions of the san luis valley before the formation of the united states. during ensuing decades, explorers, pioneers, homesteaders, land speculators, prospectors, and travel writers were attracted to the valley's riches. freely flowing clean water, comforting hot springs, verdant wetlands teeming with birds, fish and wild game, expanses of natural grass hay, majestic mountain vistas, forest and upland meadows, plus mother lode deposits of silver and gold lured these newcomers. today, as you travel any of the routes into the valley, you will be struck by the expansive landscapes, rugged mountains, and endless blue skies.
