 frequently asked questions







            what is the difference between a virtual and live murder mystery?
          









a virtual murder mystery is an online experience where participants connect from remote locations and interact over a video platform such as zoom or webex with a ”live cast,” including a detective and multiple suspects to solve a murder and track down a killer. virtual murder mystery events or games are often done as part of a remote social gathering, a virtual happy hour, or a team building activity for companies and can also be entertaining for your friends and family because of the existing virtual technology which allows you to invite “virtually” anyone from anywhere in the world to join in the fun.a live murder mystery event is a theatrical performance “in person,” serving the same purpose but with live actors, conducted in any number of venues or customized formats such as murder mystery dinners for the public, corporate events, or private parties.  both approaches are designed to be interactive, very entertaining and most importantly, a lot of fun for the participants.







            what is virtual murder mystery team building?
          









as a team building experience, our events are designed to bring remote team members together in a fun and entertaining way to encourage teamwork and help develop problem solving skills while enforcing the concept of the importance of each team member to the group. after interacting with our “live cast,” which includes a detective and numerous nefarious suspects, teams are sent to breakout rooms to come up with a solution in a designated amount of time based on their interviews with suspects and their gathering and interpretation of clues. our virtual murder mystery team building experiences are accessed by the simple click of a mouse on any internet connection and can handle virtually any size group, range in length from 1 to 2 ½ hours in length and are priced to fit any budget.







            what makes a good live murder mystery event?
          









our live murder mystery experiences are “in-person” interactive engagements with “live” professional actors as suspects, generally done over a 2-to-3-hour time frame, most often paired with a meal, where the participants try to solve a crime through a series of clues and interactions with the cast members. a professional host, along with a detective and cast members guide the guests through the event filled with intrigue, murder, mystery, twists, unexpected turns and ultimately a surprise ending.   our customized murder mystery events can handle virtually any size group, can be made to fit any time frame, and are priced to fit any budget.







            do you need a murder mystery theme?
          









the simple answer is “no.”  we do not do any of those done to death, clichéd, over the top, cheesy characters and plots that every amateur group on the planet is passing of as entertainment.  we do a very present-day “law and order” or “csi” approach with a lot of humor.   you will not see any feather boas, cigarette holders, or french maids in our productions.  if you want to decorate, or wear costumes, go crazy.  our shows will work anywhere, with any motif.







            if i sponsor a murder mystery event, can i participate?
          









yes.  in both our virtual murder mystery or live murder mystery events, like professional event planners, everything is handled for you so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  our murder mystery parties are immersive events for both you and your guests.  we do not pass out character cards to participants, so they do all the work, or ask them to wear costumes.  we do everything for you from beginning to end and guarantee you an unforgettable, hassle-free experience.
