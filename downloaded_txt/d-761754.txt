about the studio










our resident great horned owl





howling owlslegends tell us owls bring about change, urging us to see more than just the obvious. they remind me to look beyond what i know and approach my ideas with new interest and curiosity each day. i have many learning curve challenges, but i can honestly say, i enjoy every moment i spend trying something new. recent owl sightings make me wonder what i might have missed running so fast all these years. it’s time to slow down and be more aware of the beauty in this life i live. 










36 x 42” etching press





nontoxic printmaking after leaving my career as graphic designer, art director, and small business owner, it was definitely time for a change.  i am happily discovering myself and my art all over again. my etching press is one of my most valued tools for expressing new ideas. i have waited a long time to explore printmaking with the use of nontoxic solar plate methods and akua inks for prints and etchings. there are ways for all of us to save this planet a little at a time, if we pay attention.   photo above is my intaglio etching press










washed wool & llama fleeces drying





natural fibersmy world was influenced at an early age by a wonderful creative swedish woman. her patience and kindness over the years taught me to see nature’s beauty, texture and gifts. she was a spinner, a weaver, a natural dyer - all the things i aspire to today.i am grateful for her curiosity and the influence she had on my life. i now use a variety of dye techniques utilizing the colors found naturally in plants. the results are stunning and differ with seasons and mordants.
