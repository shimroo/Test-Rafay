welcome and thank you for visiting naums.  as stated in our mission statement we are a support organization to several programs that help the local church grow through ministry to youth.  we strongly support the pray program which the church may use to develop an understanding of faith for the individual youth.  our unique program is that we provide new testaments to the bsa high adventure centers at philmont, northern tier and sea base.  we also provide worship programs for churches that observe special sundays for youth participation, (i.e. scout sunday) and sell scout sunday patches to cover the cost of bibles. please be sure to head over to our blog page to read the latest news naums has to offer. also visit us on facebook @ https://www.facebook.com/naums1/
