          peer review is a critical part of the tech writing process. i learn so much from other writers when i review their work or when they review mine. i enjoyed reading this piece about how a team of content designers used hypotheses to improve their peer review process:

          many writers and editors think the associated press stylebook is against using the serial (oxford) comma. that’s not true. ap style *does* recommend using the serial comma in complex lists.

for example, if one of the items in a list contains a conjunction, ap style calls for a serial comma. like this:

fritz enjoys snacking on bananas, cheese and crackers, and ice cream.

additionally, if the items in the list are long, ap style calls for a serial comma. like this:

helen changed the car’s worn tire before embarking on her big road trip, raul shined the fenders until he could see his reflection in them, and sara double-checked all fluid levels.

ap does not recommend using a serial comma in a simple list:

dante bought strawberries, sliced turkey and rye bread.

this is in contrast to most other style guides, including the chicago manual of style, which calls for a serial comma in all lists.

to learn more differences between ap style and chicago style, check out dragonfly editorial’s field guide on this very topic. it’s titled “ap style and chicago style: 15 major differences,” and the link is in the comments.

          editing pet peeve: the goofy obsession with the oxford comma. 

oxford enthusiasts—whom i often refer to as "oxfordnistas"—insist that the serial comma is the ultimate arbiter of clarity and slayer of ambiguity. and they demonstrate this overstated power through a series of reductionist—albeit humorous—memes. 

below on the left is one such example. again, this meme assuredly suggests a moment where a lack of a serial comma may confuse readers. rather than express a list of the three, the oxford-less sentence seems to imply an appositive suggesting the exotic dancers are, in fact, stalin and jfk.

but what happens if you change strippers (plural) to stripper (singular). one good contrived strawman argument deserves another, right?

on the right is the counterpoint. here, the sentence with the oxford comma introduces ambiguity. is that jfk on stage three collecting singles, or is somebody else?

the trick is simple: when in doubt, rewrite. 

"we invited jfk, stalin and the strippers."

see how this is clearly a list of three? see how i didn't need the comma to do so?

ultimately, the oxford comma is a stylistic convention, so it is a matter of personal preference. you can also write, "we invited jfk, stalin, and the strippers." that *also* works.

either way, stop pretending that your prescriptivist take on the oxford comma is holy writ.

          technical writers have been underappreciated and disregarded by engineers for decades, despite their critical role in product development and user understanding.

contrary to popular belief, technical writing requires both linguistic skills and a deep understanding of the technical domain and target audience.

          building a better technical writing tool: my research journey

as a senior technical writer, i'm passionate about creating clear, concise, and effective documentation. but let's face it, even the most experienced writers can sometimes miss a jargon word, slip into passive voice, or let a sentence run on a bit too long. that's where the idea for a custom technical writing tool came in.
i've been diving deep into python libraries like nltk and re (regular expressions) to explore how we can automate some of the tedious aspects of technical writing analysis. imagine a tool that could:

flag jargon and suggest replacements: say goodbye to "leverage" and "synergy" with a click of a button!

identify passive voice: transform those "to be" verbs into active powerhouses.

spot lengthy sentences: wrangle those run-on sentences into submission.

even suggest stronger verbs: elevate your writing with more vivid and impactful language.

the possibilities are exciting! here's a glimpse of what i've been working on:

python
import re
from nltk.corpus import wordnet

# ... (code to analyze text for jargon, passive voice, etc. - similar to previous examples)

def suggest_strong_verbs(text):
    # ... (code to suggest stronger verbs using wordnet - similar to previous example)

# ... (example usage)



this code snippet uses wordnet to access a lexical database and suggest stronger verbs for more impactful writing. it's just one example of how python can be used to automate technical writing feedback.

challenges and opportunities
building a truly effective technical writing tool comes with its challenges:

context is key: identifying nuanced writing issues often requires understanding the context and intent.

balancing automation and human input: the tool should assist, not replace, the writer's judgment.

customization: different writing styles and guidelines require flexibility and customization options.

but the opportunities are immense! imagine a tool that integrates seamlessly with your favorite ide, providing real-time feedback as you write. this could lead to:

increased efficiency: spend less time on tedious editing and more time on creating valuable content.

improved clarity and conciseness: produce documentation that's easier to understand and more engaging.

consistency: ensure adherence to specific writing style guidelines.

next steps
i'm continuing my research, exploring more sophisticated techniques using nlp and machine learning to address these challenges. stay tuned for updates on this exciting project!

in the meantime, i'd love to hear your thoughts. what features would you find most valuable in a technical writing tool? share your ideas in the comments below!

          psa for writers and editors using ms word

re: disappearing editorial comments

i just thought i'd alert everyone to an issue that's cropped up with a recent update to ms word. it seems other editors are encountering it too; it's annoying a lot of people.

the default setting for editorial comments in ms word seems to be 'contextual', but, apparently, they've changed how contextual works. 

now, if one deletes or changes a word of text and then tries to comment on that change already made, the comment made is *not* made visible in the comment pane - one can only see it by hovering over the comment highlighting in the main body text. 

it *may* become visible in the comments pane *after* the changed or deleted word is accepted, but that's really unhelpful if the comment is an explanation of the change. one would prefer to see the explanation first so as to be able to make an informed decision.

also, if one makes a comment on a whole block of text and the *first word of that block has been deleted or changed*, exactly the same thing will happen - the comment won't be visible in the pane.

there seem to be two ways around this.

1) go into: 'review' then 'show comments', and then alter comment style from 'contextual' to 'list'. then all comments are shown in the pane at the same time.

2) don't attach a comment on a change - attach it to the word before or after it.

personally, i think option 1 is the more sensible of the two. however, please be aware that an ms word doc may reset itself to contextual comments after being closed and opened again. if you're going to use option 1, i advise checking every ms word doc is in 'list' every time.

one for the checklist.

          i've seen lots of presentations about reviews, but i didn't feel that any of them really defined the review problem(s). and if you don't define a problem, you can't develop solutions. 

between reuse and generative ai, tech writers will produce even more content for review in future. this trend makes it even more important to figure out how to ensure that our final content is reliable.

since no-one else has given me the answers, i will be leading a workshop on the challenges of review at tcworld 2024. i think that i have some interesting insights, and i look forward to getting insights from the workshop participants too.

          welcome to “style shenanigans!” a series of posts where this freelance copyeditor shares random style guide facts i stumble across while editing and try to make it deep (???).
- 
for today’s random fact, we’re in apa 7 and looking at how we construct a list.

apa section 6.50 says elements in a series included in a sentence or paragraph narrative should be organized with lowercase letters in parentheses, not with numbers. so even in a sentence such as this – “writing this post took four steps: (a) finding an interesting fact, (b) drafting some ideas…” – where the list is given a numerical quantity in the narrative before, it should be organized using letters and not numbers.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐢𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞? 

it’s easy to look at this fact and think, “okay, just make a list using letters. who cares?” but this rule gets to the core of the numbers vs. letters debate – math vs. language. if a list that is numbered in a narrative can be lettered in the actual list, the two are interchangeable. what does this mean for the language lover who is bad at math? what does this mean for the reader who doesn’t want to count each element of the list to make sure the author didn’t miss count? does a=1 like we found in that math problem in high school? or are both just constructs we can’t understand?!

it seems to me there is a lot more involved than a simple style battle. readers, we’ve stumbled across the cosmic battle between math and language… what will we find next?

          the importance of terse posts

"one of my eight pillars of technical writing is terseness. being brief is particularly important in business communications and for anyone who is targeting an audience of busy professionals. 

"this demographic simply does not have the time to consume lengthy posts, regardless of their topical appeal or quality."

          “hey”
is that your instant-message “language of love”? survey shows ... eh-eh

data shows:
·     employees spend nearly 90% of their workweek communicating across multiple channels including teams and google chat, or over text.
·     microsoft’s heaviest users send and receive about 150 chats a day. slack says 700 million messages are sent across its channels each day.
·     1 in 4 workers and executives say they experience miscommunication multiple times a day.

while employees have fine-tuned their email protocol, workplace instant messaging is still the wild west. consider “hey,” or “hi” or “hi there” or “hiya.”

the effect is the same: while the quick-drop salutation is often innocuous, it sends recipients into a tizzy, fearing the worst.

creative director atheina hasbani, 31, says “it’s like, ‘am i fired? am i in trouble? is your mom ok?’”

bryan robinson, ph.d, and author of a book on hybrid work, says “hey” or other iterations can engage a fight-or-flight response.

“the brain has to know ‘what’s going to happen?’ for survival,” he says, and it often jumps to the worst-case scenario.

when colleagues communicate in a way that irks, it’s important to let them know how it’s making you feel, says connie noonan hadley, a professor of management and organizations at boston university questrom school of business.

“even if ‘hey’ is your love language,” she says, “other people are not receiving it that way.”

          i’m seeing a worrying trend of archival conferences slowly transitioning into in-person only. at first they were digital, then they were hybrid, and then digital accommodations for presenters under extenuating circumstances. this was problematic enough as digital audiences began to be eliminated. many of whom finally felt they were able to participate for the first time. presenters also needed to disclose why they needed digital accommodations. something that may make presenters quite uncomfortable to disclose. me 10 years ago certainly wouldn’t have been able to. there are certainly exceptions, but i’ve noticed that we are getting to a stage where some conferences are eliminating language that even suggests digital accommodations in their callouts.

conferences heavily focus on networking and hosting in-person only eliminates those who may benefit from that networking most. travel can be difficult for many of us. for myself, it’s health related. i also think of those who need to care for small children or sick relatives, students/early career professionals/those in the global south who cannot afford to travel because few stipends exist, and those who work in very small non-profits that are not awarded the time to be away. this is particularly troubling when so many conferences are themed around underrepresentation.

i understand the difficulties that go into organizing a conference. i’ve been responsible for organizing events, including conferences in the past. i was organizing guest lectures during the pandemic. there are contractual obligations to sponsors and host sites but we need to be doing more.  

so, think about why certain demographics are more prevalent in our field. by returning to in-person only, we’ll always be stuck at the stage of “we need to be a more inclusive field.” those voices that are necessary for such inclusion initiatives will never get to participate in the “here’s how”.
