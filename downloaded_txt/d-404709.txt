 today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday !!
"....do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
each day has enough trouble of it's own."  matthew 6:34(niv)






 
 
 



this page is based on the scripture verse: 1 thess.5:14
encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.try to encourage someone today with just a word or a smile.it is amazing how we encourage ourselves when we encourage another.
