      sharp and the environment
  
            

environmental responsibility is in sharp's dna. from early product design to manufacturing, right through to end-of-life disposal, every area in which we directly or indirectly affect the environment is under constant scrutiny. the ever sharp pencil, invented by our founder tokuji hayakawa, was the product behind our name – sharp. since it also turned an everyday disposable item into something reusable, saving precious wood along the way, it could also be considered our first environmentally responsible product.in 2019 we formulated sharp eco vision 2050 - a long-term environmental vision-based on its basic environmental policy of “creating an environmentally conscious company with sincerity and creativity,” which was established in 1992. sharp is working toward realising a sustainable global environment by pursuing long-term goals set in three fields of action by 2050 : climate change, resource recycling, and safety and security.
