semiconductors @ purdue
as the united states strives to reclaim a leading role in the global semiconductor industry, boilermakers are acting to ensure our nation is prepared to meet the ever- 
      growing demands for these essential components in virtually all of our electronic devices.
as recent headlines warn, the u.s. needs to make up ground in crucial research and development to ensure that it can be competitive in the global marketplace. purdue is 
      working hand in hand with semiconductor industry leaders to train the next generation of workers, bring the next high-tech jobs onshore and ensure that the next big breakthroughs happen 
      right here in the budding silicon heartland.
our nation needs at least 50,000 trained semiconductor engineers within the next five years. purdue started the nation’s first comprehensive semiconductor degrees program, 
      with the goal of graduating 1,500-plus students per year.
want to know why u.s. news & world report has named purdue one of the most innovative u.s. universities for the last five years running? it’s because boilermakers aren’t afraid to tackle the world’s toughest challenges – and 
      we’re going to tackle this one.
