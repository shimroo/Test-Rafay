	 nytimes:strained by needs, a community withdraws its helping hands
    


by robert david zeligerpublished: january 22, 2006when henry calderon looks down 116th street between lexington and third avenues, he sees a tuxedo store, a dental center, a nail salon, two banks, and sidewalk vendors hawking tamales and jewelry. the scene is strikingly different from the boarded-up shops and crime-ridden pockets of just a few years back.but mr. calderon, who is president of the east harlem chamber of commerce, fears that the arrival of an h.i.v./aids center on the block could sharply alter its character. the 14,000-square-foot center, which is set to open in april above a washington mutual bank branch, would provide counseling, medical treatment and other help to 150 people, many of them former and current drug addicts. the site was chosen by harlem united, a nonprofit group that helps people with aids."this will set us back 30 years," mr. calderon said, predicting that crime rates would rise and that businesses would suffer. community board 11 has passed a resolution opposing the center, and assemblyman adam clayton powell iv has said that although he supports the goals of harlem united, he does not support its choice of a location.many east harlemites note that their neighborhood has more "special needs" facilities, a category that includes h.i.v./aids centers and methadone clinics, than any other area in manhattan.patrick mcgovern, executive director of harlem united, defended his center, noting that people had similar fears about crime and business losses at a similar center his group operates in west harlem. "but we allayed them over time," he said.according to city health data, about 2.5 percent of the 108,000 residents in east harlem have h.i.v., the virus that causes aids; that incidence, higher than in any manhattan neighborhood but chelsea, makes the center highly useful for local residents, mr. mcgovern said.but merchants and others note that the center's clientele will not be limited to local residents. they say they fear that 116th street, east harlem's main commercial artery, will be swarmed by addicts.residents also point to data that they say proves east harlem is overburdened by the "special needs" facilities. according to the urban technical assistance project at columbia university, community district 11 in east harlem has 135 such centers, far more than any other manhattan district. in second place is community district 3 on the lower east side, which has 98 facilities.local residents also accused mr. mcgovern of rushing his plans past them. "they didn't go to a community planning board meeting to get our input," mr. calderon said. "we didn't find out about it until construction started."in response, mr. mcgovern said: "we've been fully transparent about our goals." and he added, "they are not interested in the facts."as these exchanges suggest, the road ahead for the center may be rocky. "there are going to be problems," mr. powell said. "there are going to be lawsuits. there are going to be demonstrations every single day in front of the entrance, which doesn't really help their clients or their purpose."

	 obesity in east harlem compared to the upper east side
    


obesity in east harlem compared to the upper east side there is another face now visible among those living in poverty: obesity.   contrary to popular belief, obesity is not a sign of affluence, but rather an indicator of poverty, as the study,   "hunger and obesity in east harlem" by j.c. dwyer makes clear. the other report released by the new york city coalition against hunger in september, dwyer compares conditions between east harlem and the upper east side, two neighborhoods divided by 96th street that provide a stark contrast, representing the highest and lowest figures in poverty and obesity. in east harlem, 38 percent of children are born into poverty; on the upper east side, just five percent. east harlem has the highest incidence of obesity and diabetes in the city; the upper east side has the lowest.  dwyer outlines the link between obesity and hunger clearly and simply: it is about choice and control. people who have more choices and more control over what they consume have lower obesity and poverty rates and healthier eating.  the upper east side has more supermarkets which afford residents more nutritious choices. east harlem has more bodegas, fast food restaurants, and emergency food programs.  emergency food programs themselves can be part of the problem, dependent as they often are on donations from food banks. many food banks receive corporate products that failed their target marketing and are not selling--a new line of crackers perhaps. they may be plentiful, but not necessarily nutritious.  dwyer makes the point that even the large funders contribute to the problem, concerned as they are with short term solutions like funding food pantries, but doing little to ensure that nutritious foods are offered in these programs. "funders are still stuck in the emergency food mentality," said dwyer. "but a lot of people aren¹t relying on the pantries and soup kitchens for emergency food only. this is about long-term hunger." and the cash strapped food pantries, some existing on a budget as low as $17,400 a year, cannot afford to purchase more expensive nutritious items like produce. bodega owners, too, are often caught in the market forces that make it impossible for them to offer affordable fresh produce.

	 army recruitment targets latinos....duh!!!!...
    


the war for latinosby roberto lovato[from the october 3, 2005 issue]jessica sanchez poses an urgent threat to the us military. for a pentagon stretched by stagnating enlistments and an administration bent on waging a "global war on terror," the question of whether this four-foot-eleven mexican-born legal resident and others like her will decide to join the military has enormous geopolitical implications.the pentagon is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to find out whatever it can about sanchez and other young latinos: what they wear, where they hang out, what kinds of groups they form, what they read, what they watch on tv, their grades, their dreams. members of the military's numerous and well-funded recruiting commands use sophisticated geographic information systems maps, souped-up recruiting hummers and other resources to establish strategic positions in the minds, pocketbooks and neighborhoods of young latinos like sanchez.recruiters are devising new and often unexpected ways to penetrate daily latino life. "i went to a birthday celebration at chuck e. cheese's," says sanchez, a 25-year-old single mom from san marcos, california, just outside san diego. "we were watching a puppet show when all of a sudden a military song is playing in the background. i thought that was weird but kept watching. a couple of minutes later, all of us were looking at pictures on a tv screen of people in the army giving food and supplies to kids in iraq. my friends and i thought that was really weird--and got out."\r\nthe bad news for pentagon planners is not just sanchez\'s negative reaction to the puppet show, or even her eventual decision not to join the navy. it\'s that she and other latinos who are rejecting the military\'s overtures are turning around and organizing a grassroots movement against recruitment in their community. \r\nfrom the northernmost corner of washington state to the southernmost beaches of south florida, veteran latino counterrecruiters and younger activistas are facing off against thousands of military recruiters in a battle that will determine whether latino youth continue echoing the "yo soy el army" and other pentagon pr slogans or instead adopt the "yo estoy en contra del army" slogan taken up by sanchez. the counterrecruitment movement, spearheaded by scores of latinos in chicago, el paso, tucson and other cities, suburbs and rural communities, is largely occurring beneath the radar of the mostly white antiwar movement, despite its potential to alter the course of iraq and future us wars. \r\n"latinos are very important to the national security of the united states," says larry korb, former assistant secretary of defense for manpower, reserve affairs, installations and logistics in the reagan administration defense department, where he administered about 70 percent of the largest line items in the federal budget. "a decrease in latino enlistment numbers would make things very difficult for the armed forces, because they are the fastest-growing [minority] group in the country and they have a very distinguished record of service in the military. if i were donald rumsfeld, i would be very worried about the possibility of decreasing latino numbers. i\'d be thinking about how to make do with smaller numbers of troops or with further lowering standards for aptitude, age, education and other factors." \r\nthe centrality of latinos to the military enterprise can be seen in statements by pentagon officials like john mclaurin, deputy assistant secretary of the army for human resources, who stated that in order to meet recruitment goals, latino enlistments must grow to 22 percent by the year 2025, when one in four americans will be latino. two factors add to the urgency. one is that while latinos make up only 13 percent of the active-duty forces, they also make up a fast-growing 16 percent of the 17- to 21-year-old population. in the eyes of pentagon planners, this rapidly growing, relatively poor population is prime recruiting material. latinos already in the military are concentrated in the low ranks of the marines and the army, serving in the high-casualty, high-risk jobs of front-line troops urgently needed in iraq. the second factor driving the latinization of the pentagon\'s \r\nrecruitment strategy is the decrease in african-american and women recruits. since 2000 the percentage of african-american recruits has dropped from ",1]);//-->the bad news for pentagon planners is not just sanchez's negative reaction to the puppet show, or even her eventual decision not to join the navy. it's that she and other latinos who are rejecting the military's overtures are turning around and organizing a grassroots movement against recruitment in their community.from the northernmost corner of washington state to the southernmost beaches of south florida, veteran latino counterrecruiters and younger activistas are facing off against thousands of military recruiters in a battle that will determine whether latino youth continue echoing the "yo soy el army" and other pentagon pr slogans or instead adopt the "yo estoy en contra del army" slogan taken up by sanchez. the counterrecruitment movement, spearheaded by scores of latinos in chicago, el paso, tucson and other cities, suburbs and rural communities, is largely occurring beneath the radar of the mostly white antiwar movement, despite its potential to alter the course of iraq and future us wars."latinos are very important to the national security of the united states," says larry korb, former assistant secretary of defense for manpower, reserve affairs, installations and logistics in the reagan administration defense department, where he administered about 70 percent of the largest line items in the federal budget.

"we are trying to show the historical continuity of latino protest against the exploitation of other latinos in us wars of aggression," says mariscal, considered by many to be the dean of latino counterrecruitment efforts. \r\non this past august 29, mariscal\'s organization, the project on youth and non-military opportunities (yano), and dozens of other latino groups launched a campaign to educate latino parents and students about military recruitment in schools. a main focus was simply informing people that the no child left behind act, which allows recruiters access to student contact information, also contains an opt-out provision. the organizers chose to launch the campaign on august 29 because it was the anniversary of the chicano moratorium of 1970--the largest, most radical latino antiwar, antirecruitment mobilization in us history. the campaign draws strength from the antimilitaristic traditions of us-born latinos (especially mexican-americans and puerto ricans) as well as from the anti-militarismo traditions of more recent latin american immigrants from such countries as el salvador and the dominican republic.

well this might be a little of the east harlem topic. but there was allot of latino leadership at the chavez speech at the united methodist church at 86th and west end ave, and i believe there is an important lesson to be learned.  i had the benefit of going to hear hugo chavez speak last night. i was invited b several friends to hear chavez speak and make my own mind up on the man. well the verdict is in hugo chavez; president of venezuela is a threat to democracy.  but not the way the conservatives in the country, the corporate interests or the bush administration would have him be.hugo chavez is a threat to true democracy, because he is a populist demagogue.  i believe that one of the most dangerous types of public figures is the populist demagogue. the populist demagogue appeals to the people, usually the poor and under represented, and offer them easy, quick solutions to their problems. they point to the issues of hunger, racism, social injustice and economic inequality and tell the people that there is an easy solution but that the "system", admistration or whatever other group or term they want use isn’t going to solve these real issues. like all good lies there is a germ of truth to their solutions, a good lie has enough truth to make it sound real, to make it feel possible, to make it feel like the better world of tomorrow is just over the next hill.chavez is a charismatic speaker, and like all true charismatic, his use of symbolism, romantic archetypes and emotion were present. this to me is very dangerous. he referred several times over as to his passion for his people, his passion for latin america, his passion for social justice. well the most heinous crimes committed are usually crimes of passion.now, i agree with many of the issues chavez expounded on, but he offered no real solutions, no true concrete plan of action. there was nothing to of substance, but there was a lot of exciting rhetoric.i am concerned that jesse jackson and congressman serrano were endorsing this man. serrano had the good sense to leave early.  i am concerned that there still remains a vacuum in the latino leadership in the us and on the international scene. we don’t need leaders who wrap themselves in the imagery of george washington; we need leadership that will embody, thomas jefferson.
