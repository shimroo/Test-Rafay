about us
rise above records was founded in 1988 by then napalm death vocalist lee dorrian. it was started as part of the enterprise allowance scheme and its initial aim was to release a few very limited edition hardcore punk 7″s.
as time has moved on rise above records nowadays releases an eclectic mix of underground rock from doom metal to acid folk, classic styled progressive rock and proto-metal. the prime motive of the label is to put out interesting releases by bands that we actually like!
subsidiary label rise above relics specialises in detailed reissues and unreleased recordings from the golden days of underground rock and folk music (late 60s/early 70s). releases so far, have included artists such as comus, necromandus, bang, horse, steel mill, incredible hog, rog & pip, brân, luv machine, possessed, and (the original) iron maiden.
rise above records main artists include uncle acid & the deadbeats, giuda, blood ceremony, church of misery, septic tank, axegrinder, admiral sir cloudesley shovell, danko jones, galley beggar, with the dead,  as well as recent signings twin temple and witchskull. past artists include ghost, electric wizard, witchcraft, sunn o))), orange goblin and circulus to name but a few.
