we are india association of minnesotasince 1973

a non-profit organization that has straddled over five decades of community service since its inception in 1973, india association of minnesota (iam) aims to build a strong and cohesive community of over 50,000-strong asian indians in the state of minnesota.
through its three-prong mission of culture, charity and connections, iam seeks to build bridges of understanding between the asian indians and the society at large within the state and the country. we are a non-religious, non-political organization, whose primary goal is to serve the commity across the diverisities.
the iam activities is made possible by the voters of minnesota through a grant from the minnesota state arts board (msab), minnesota regional arts council (mrac), city of st paul cultural star and minnesota humanities center, thanks to the legislative appropriation from the arts and cultural heritage fund that was created with the vote of the people of the state of minnesota on november 04, 2008.
