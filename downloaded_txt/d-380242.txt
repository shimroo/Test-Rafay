our work













public trust

building people’s trust in advertising has been central to the work of the advertising association since our formation in the 1920s. our continuing research helps our members understand what drives trust in advertising and why this matters for campaign effectiveness.














inclusion

the all in census is the uk advertising’s biggest industry-wide survey to help build a workplace where everyone feels they belong.  read the results along with the action plan and apply to become an all in champion.  














climate action

we know advertising accelerates behaviour change and can be a real force for helping drive sustainable growth. check out what we have planned to help deliver the uk government’s ambitions of a net zero economy and find out how you can get involved.














exports

the uk advertising market is not just a gateway to britain; it's a gateway to everywhere. this workstream showcases the very best of our industry’s strategic, creative, production and technical capabilities to the world.














adspend

advertising is a major engine of the uk economy. our expenditure report, in partnership with warc, provides detailed advertising spend figures for all major media in the uk. every quarter, they are surveyed to produce the uk's most reliable adspend data. learn more here.
