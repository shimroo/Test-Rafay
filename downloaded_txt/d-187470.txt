  the pine barrens 
			is becoming a popular tourist destination. it offers history, nature, boating, 
			camping, fishing, swimming, and most of all, peace and tranquility. it's 
			important to families who live here, whether for a few years or many generations, 
			that our peace and tranquility be preserved.a local lawyer or doctor won't 
			look any different than his neighbor who works the land. thousand dollar 
			suits aren't what impress people of the pines - taking care of nature and 
			fellow man is what matters. to that end, it is important for you to know 
			that as a visitor to our precious pine barrens, you should show respect 
			for the flora and fauna, for the historical buildings or their remains, 
			and show respect for the "locals". walk and drive gently. treat 
			our pine barrens as you would want a visitor to treat your own home town 
			- and your own family. thank you.
