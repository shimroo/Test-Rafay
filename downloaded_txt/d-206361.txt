why naafa?at least one-third of the world’s population is fat, yet fat people are discriminated against in all aspects of daily life. for over 50 years, naafa has worked to make the world a better place for fat people through education, advocacy, and support. we are a multigenerational, intersectional social justice organization creating opportunity for big bodied people and building community for fat people and our loved ones.  our work towards #equalityateverysize is changing the world!
