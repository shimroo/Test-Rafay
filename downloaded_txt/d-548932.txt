a few years back in new years eve we went with couple of friends of mine to a home door of one of our schoolâs mockers. we checked through the window if there was anyone home and there the asshole was drinking with other bad boys of the school. we installed a huge firework into the post hole, fired it up and ran into the forest. we didnât have time to watch what happened but after christmas vacation we saw that some of the guys had bad burns on their faces and we heard that the house had been almost in fire, some paintings were ruined and some expensive vases had broken as well as some curtains had burned.

the guy who lived in the apartment swore that he would kill the ones who did it. iâm still a live. :)

he even suspected us for a moment but we had an âalibiâ, we were âcamping on our parents cottageâ. iâm not the slightest bit ashamed! they got what they deserved.

nerd
i bought my first computer when i was 7 years old. when other guys were playing computer games, i was coding. i did some sports but was still quite fat. during puberty i was annoyed when other friends of mine were talking about their women and i didnât have even one single phone number. i just sat on my computer and was wondering about the secrets of c++.

i graduated from high school. i got a summer internship from a software company. while friends of mine continued their studies, i continued to work. now after four years my friends are bragging with their degrees and high salaries, i can only say to them that iâm a director of over 70 people and my salary is over five times bigger than my friendsâ.

after puberty i didnât gain any weight but i got taller. add a few hours of gym per week to that and you can say that my body is quite well formed nowadays. at the moment i have lots of women, power and money, and it seems that thereâs no end to this. somebody might wonder why am i telling this story, but the motive of mine is to tell all the nerds on their computers that continue creating code, drink coca cola, sleep late and eat cold microwave pizzas. it will pay off!

depression
iâm not sure if this is the right place to open up at, but i just have to open up a little bit somewhere right now. iâm really badly depressed. i feel like i have failed completely in my life. iâve always given completely wrong image about myself to all the people i have been in contact with during my life. this is due to the fact that iâm unbelievably bad in social situations and iâm afraid of being myself except with the people i know really well. iâm socially afraid in places where there are lots of people, like casinos, and i canât open my mouth.

i feel like everyone is staring at me and talking about me. i am also really bad at getting to know new people, although i would very much like to do that. iâve been like this all my life and if everything continues like this, iâm always going to be like this. i donât feel like i want to live anymore. thereâs no reason for me to wake up in the morning and i actually often lay on my bed the whole day without doing anything. i am unemployed and i donât feel like applying for work. my school ended a year ago and since that iâve spent all my time regretting all my mistakes and feeling sorry about my life that sucks so bad. i donât think that my friends and close people even know that iâm depressed. i donât show my depression to anyone. i donât even want to get help, because no one would be able to understand me and the pain iâm feeling.

sometimes i have days when i feel like everything is going to get better. more often though i feel like everything is lost and thereâs no way out. the thing that annoys me the most is the fact that i have caused all this myself and thereâs no one else to blame for it.

iâd like to start my life all over again, fix the countless mistakes iâve made and use the many opportunities iâve had and not used during my life. thereâs nothing in my life and i feel like i canât succeed in anything. i fuck everything up. itâs not easy to be me. i suck.

pathological liar
i am a liar. i lie about anything. i canât even remember all the things iâve lied about. i always change things in my stories to how i would like them to be. i have for example lied that i have a lung disease that is going to eventually kill me, as well as being pregnant. the worst thing is that everyone believes what i say. iâve many times told myself not to lie anymore and tell the truth from now on, but the lies just come out of my mouth like nothing. i lie about things that i donât need to lie about. i hope that this confession isnât a lie.

debt skeletons in the closet
i have so many skeletons in the closet that the door hardly closes. i canât even write them all here because iâm afraid that someone would recognize me. iâm a loser swimming in self-pity that will never do anything great in his life, even though iâve always succeeded in iq tests. i have too much debt and so many problems with money and my personal finances that thereâs nothing i can do about it. talk about payday loans, mortgage loans or loans from my friends at pikavippivertailut.info â i have it all and more.

i donât know how to love anyone anymore or how to get interested about anyone because anytime iâve done it iâve been hurt really badly. still some little voice in my head tries to make me care about one important lady to me, even though i realize that all i can be for her is an average friend. i know that i can only disappoint myself, no matter what i do.

every day i pray for a higher power to give me a big win in an online casino to save me from my huge debts. i play poker and bingo in netticasinot many times a week even though i have too much debt already. i found them from https://www.casinogorilla.com. i just wish that my luck would change one day and i would win big to be able to get rid of my debts and maybe have some money to spend as well.

other finnish pages that i have visited are this one, this page here, this bonus information page, free spins info in finnish, deposit bonus info also in finnish, and no registration -casinos, not to forget this informational page here.

i smoke too many cigarettes that i bought from www.sã¤hkã¶tupakka.net a day and even though i have changed to electronic cigarette i think iâm still using way too much money on that and i ruin my health at the same time. sometimes i think that if i could choose whether to win in lottery or die instantly, i would choose death. i donât think that millions of dollars would help to fix the damage that my soul has experienced during my horrible life. i still canât end my own days because i have promised that to someone at www.pikalaina.me. i also have a sick obsession of keeping my promises. i guess thatâs very rare in todayâs society.

iâve been very depressed for a long time but i donât have any strength to get help even to my debt problems. i recently realized that a friend of mine had got meds for similar problems but i canât steal them even though i would like to.

the only thing that has helped me lately has been shopping online. in finland there are at the moment many good discount vouchers for the following genres: food, traveling, cdâs, design, books, contact lenses, health, clothes, and you should not in any case forget the following ones for fitness, emp, hong kong, and dogs.

scratching cars
iâve been harming hundreds, maybe thousands of cars during the last 30 years in europe (for example in germany, france, spain and italy).

iâve been scratching the painted surface of cars with keys, kicking the doors, removing mirrors and antennas, sprayed them, put every possible object into the exhaustion hole, put water in the keyhole in winter, removed the cable from the heating block in cold winters, broke windows with stones, thrown dog poo on cars. i have tons of other nice ways of doing harm as well.

only about ten times have i caused harm that big that police would have started to inspect it. iâve done this on purpose â i surely donât want to get caught! iâve never ever been even close to get caught because whenever thereâs a risk of praying eyes or cameras, i donât do anything. who would have thought all this about clean, well-dressed and middle aged guy who has learned languages in traduzione italiano russo, walking around with a briefcase?

i usually never target the same car again just to be sure i donât get caught, although sometimes i have been forced to return to a car of my asshole neighbors. the best part comes here: iâve only done all this to one brand: bmw. these cars are only used by dicks and i would be ready to blow all their factories and the car owners away! i hate all cars, but bmwâs should be made illegal, as well as the fat, bold and ugly owners of bmwâs.

and to all of those who think that you can do something about it when you catch me, iâd really like to see that. the mickey mouse sized bmw drivers look like rabbit shoots when they climb out of their cars and they have no balls to do anything to a big guy like me. the only thing that could happen would be small fine and a small compensation â a few hundred euros max.

anyway, iâve caused a harm of tens if not thousands of euros and iâm going to continue this until there are no bmwâs on the roads. after that iâll probably just change the brand. the biggest satisfaction comes whenever i can do some little harm that makes the expensive car to stand still for many weeks without driving.

stealing cigarettes
i used to steal things with my friends a lot about 1,5 years ago. we did this for many months and i donât even know the worth of all the things we stole. we stole cigarettes, candy, alcohol, food â everything you can imagine. we didnât even think about getting caught, that easy and fun it was.

one day my friend actually got caught. they were stealing many packs of cigarettes and got caught. the store had invested in better security doors that probably caused my friends to get caught. i was lucky and got away with it. i havenât been stealing anything after that and learned my lesson: it is not worth it to steal things. every time i walk past a counter, i feel like i am a criminal.

iâm a bi
iâm a 21 years old very nice and sociable young man. iâve always known that i am bisexual and now iâve been coming more and more out of the closet lately. my best guy friend knows that and heâs been very supportive in this and he suggests that i tell my other friends as well so that they can understand me better.

iâm so afraid of confessing my real identity because these male friends are so important to me. i donât want to cause them any bad thoughts or feelings. i just think they deserve to hear the truth. are they going to support me or just walk away? i donât even want to know and iâm so afraid.

iâve been mostly having sexual intercourse with women but had also sex with many men, even had a longer relationship with a guy. iâm not only interested about men but both genders. is it that difficult to understand? i want both women and men.

drummers
i get very irritated from table drummers. or any other drummers, such as a table, the thigh, behind the wheel, or any other drummers. anyone who tries to make music with stupid drumming. iâm not sure, but i think that kind of drumming is about musical bragging. a similar display of desire than, letâs say, a man that brings the discussion up to their own educational level or wealth. this is really annoying habit that makes me wonder if i should join the drumming or beat the asshole.

another thing that really annoys me is american sitcom. iâm not going to go into that right now though.

i hate my boyfriend
i hate my boyfriend. heâs such an asshole! he annoys me by nagging about everything and thinks that heâs the best snowboarder in the world. many times heâs promised to be with me and to call me, and thereâs no phone call. heâs snowboarding instead! âi went to snowboard instead and it was really coldâ.

i hate him so much! and i thought this was going to be the love story of all times. not gonna happen! iâm trying to pick up another guy but i have no guts to leave this boyfriend of mine. iâm only 12 years old and this problem is big to me. i hate my boyfriend forever!
