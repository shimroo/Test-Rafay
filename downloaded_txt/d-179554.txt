fox switches '70s' and o.c.' for mid-season; al sharpton nixes sitcom idea





fox has announced that the o.c. will move from thursdays 8 p.m. to thursday 9 p.m. starting january 12. that '70s show will air at 8 p.m. with repeat episodes at 8:30 p.m. originally it was slated for thursdays 9 p.m. stacked will be on hiatus until mid-march, when it returns it will air at 8:30 p.m., instead of the original plan of 9:30 p.m. american idol results show will give fox a mid-season boost on thursdays at 8 p.m. for a few weeks in late february/early march. it should be interesting to see who wins the adults 18-49 match -- will & grace or that '70s show? both shows are on their last legs. the o.c. will be in trouble i think facing csi, my name is earl and the last half hour of dancing with the stars. no doubt american idol will give it a boost in those few weeks where it will be its lead-in.al sharpton will not be the next archie bunker afterall. reverend sharpton had plans to create and start in his own sitcom, titled al in the family. the title even sounds hilarious. the democrat, who has run for president, mayor of new york and the senate, was earlier this month reported to be working with cbs on this pilot. "i'm not interested in being archie bunker, i'm looking forward to becoming george bush," sharpton said, alluding to a possible future presidential race. too bad, it could have gotten enough buzz to be a hit. i think it would have been even better on sister paramount network upn. pairing everybody hates chris and al in the family would have been interesting.
