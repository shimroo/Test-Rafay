      what is the way ?
the way
      is an international journal of contemporary christian spirituality,
      published by the british jesuits. through writing informed by critical and
      creative scholarship, it aims to provide a forum in which thoughtful
      christians, from different walks of life and different traditions, reflect
      on gods continuing action in human experience.

among particular
      concerns of the way are: 

 the role of spirituality in the struggle for justice 
 the spiritual issues raised by intercultural and
      interreligious dialogue
 the interactions between spirituality, politics and culture
 the fostering and development of the ignatian spiritual
      tradition.

to find out more
      about how the way understands spirituality read this article from the first issue after our relaunch in 2003, the ignatian spirituality of the way.
	  and to find out more
      about the history of the way read this: the way, 19611986
