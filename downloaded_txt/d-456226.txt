10 bachelorette party jokes
 if women ruled the world, little girls would read "snow white and the seven hunks". why do men find it difficult to make eye contact? breasts don't have eyes. what are the three rings of marriage? engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffering. what is a man's idea of foreplay? an hour of begging. why do bachelors like smart women? opposites attract. groucho marx said, "a husband should learn to keep his mouth shut and his checkbook open." tell the girls why god created eve. because after creating adam, he looked, scratched his head and said, "i can do better!" cats are better than men because a cat will purr when served dinner. if women ruled the world, men would have to get playboy for the articles because there would be no pictures. q. how are men and the weather alike? a. neither one can be changed.
the girls will keep laughing well into the night, and the bride will remember her bachelorette party for years and years to come.

											what are some ideas for a classy bridal shower party?
									 	

high tea: the key to a bridal shower party
high tea is an afternoon activity frequently indulged by the high class and well-to-do's. so why not make your bride feel like a princess for a day while you indulge her in a high tea bridal shower party? this party can be simple and does not cost a lot to put on, but can leave everyone feeling warm and fuzzy - and full from the scones, finger sandwiches and petite fours. to make this look as lovely as the bride, set out tea cups at each place setting. these look even more fun if every tea cup is different in design so don't worry about not having enough tea cups to match. you may even ask each guest to bring their favorite tea cup, which could work well as an ice breaker. then, serve the food on tiered platters placed on the tables around the room. this is the perfect way to spend a relaxed afternoon with some friends and celebrate the bride to be!

get on board
a great way to get around on the night of your bachelorette party is to hire a van or bachelorette party bus to escort you around town. if there are just a few of you, a limousine service is a fantastic way to pamper yourselves. call ahead to compare rates for the types of vehicles that will provide bachelorette party services, keeping in mind that the number in your party will determine how big a vehicle you'll need. some bus companies even offer party tours (especially in larger cities), so be sure to ask. also, see if there are discounted rates for large parties. you'll save on gas and have a lot more fun traveling together all night long!

bachelorette slumber party
a fantastic bachelorette party idea is a good old fashioned slumber party. you can pretty much guarantee that slumber parties won't be happening again in your bride's life, so now's the time to have one with all her best friends! go all out with footie pajamas, pillow fights, dreamy crooners on vinyl, slam books, and lots of junk food. you may even want to play some old favorite games like truth or dare or light as a feather. do seances, do dance contests, do each other's hair! live it up one last time before your buddy gets hitched...just like you did when you were all little girls.
