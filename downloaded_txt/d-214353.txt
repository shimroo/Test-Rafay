the polyphonic spree is







          not a cult. probably
        

          ~
        

          the best show on earth
        

          ~
        

          a choral rock band from dallas, tx
        

          ~
        

          nothing if not unique
        

          ~
        

          synonymous with rebirth
        

          ~
        

          radiating pure bliss
        

          ~
        

          still around
        

          ~
        

          a singular act
        

          ~
        

          a way of life & state of mind
        

          ~
        

          exactly what its name suggests 
        

          ~
        

          more like a small army than a band
        

          ~
        

          akin to slashing your wrists to a disney movie
        

          ~
        

          maybe a cult
        

          ~
        

          a spectacle to be witnessed
        

          ~
        

          the kind of band that makes converts
        

          ~
        

          an art collective
        

          ~
        

          less a band than a happening
        

          ~
        

          so affecting & special
        

          ~
        

          not supposed to work
        

          ~
        

          an energetic, robe clad, multi-member band
        

          ~
        

          a cult
        

          ~
        

          a living entity all its own
        

          ~
        

          a really big band
        

          ~
        

          like no other
