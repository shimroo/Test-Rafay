our founder










										in 1916, elfrida rathbone began teaching in kings cross at a special kindergarten started by her cousin, for children deemed 'ineducable'. in 1919 elfrida established an occupation centre in kings cross for 'ineducable' children excluded from school and recruited supporters to sit on the care committees of islington's special schools. she formed a girls' club in 1923, followed by a married girls' class with a creche, and in 1930 established a befriending scheme for children in institutions.
										
										the elfrida society was founded in 1919 by elfrida rathbone to campaign on behalf of those who needed more support in life. over 100 years later, the elfrida society remains a cherished part of the community at the forefront of support to those with learning disability and/or autism or learning difficulties, in islington and in recent years across london, and english counties.
