marquee customers with a track record of success

  











gelber & associates was instrumental in helping us make “just in time” decisions during the february 2021 cold snap. when gas supply was diverted from industrial uses to human needs requirements, gelber helped us identify certain fixed price contracts that could be eliminated and repositioned us during more favorable times with fixed priced contracts that continue to perform well.kristy carver – senior vice president













our team loves collaborating with gelber & associates to discuss hedging opportunities and the gas market. we make our own decisions but g&a’s guidance is one of the key inputs in our decision making process. our positioning is very strong thanks to the teamwork between our staff and g&a’s hedging team.ray crooks – director, utility business affairs
