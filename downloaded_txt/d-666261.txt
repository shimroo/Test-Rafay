“"when i was helping my daughter get ready to complete college  applications, i had to search through many years' worth of keepsake  folders to track down her academic records, activities, organizations,  awards and interests. i wish elocker had been available then, but am  happy to have it for my son, who will begin applying for colleges later  this year."-robin, parent
