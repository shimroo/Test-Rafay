sunstate's commercial and private pilot academy is located at kissimmee gateway
                                    airport (kism) in kissimmee, fl.

sunstate aviation was founded by steve graham with a focus on locally significant
                                vocational flight training. steve prided himself on word of mouth growth and proudly
                                declared that he had never advertised to build his brand.
                                
                                situated in a building that was custom-designed to be a vocational flight training
                                center and located near orlando, the space was ideal for a small vocational flight
                                academy.
                                
                                in 2023, sunstate was purchased by academy of aviation, a new york based aviation
                                services organization specializing in vocational flight training and diversified
                                supporting entities.
                                
                                as a well established and credentialed organization, retaining the sunstate name, faa
                                certificates, and business entities allowed the academy to bring our time tested growth
                                and improvements to the kissimmee airport without disrupting the existing student body.
                                
                                continuing to focus on student success, sunstate is looking forward to an exciting 2025
                                by rethinking the student experience and creating a culture of success.
                                
                                identifying areas where improvements can be made and making these accessible to our
                                student body is driving the next phase of sunstate aviation's growth.
