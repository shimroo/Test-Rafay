'nip/tuck' music cuts like a knife





courtesy of variety: 'nip/tuck' music cuts like a knifefrom the very beginning, showrunner ryan murphy and "nip/tuck" used music -- both songs and underscore -- in unexpected ways."ryan's vision was always clear," says music supervisor p.j. bloom. "he wanted a combination of big songs everyone knows and ultra-hip material that accentuates the decadent world in which our characters live."read more at source....tags:niptuck television nip/tuck nip tuck carver entertainment

latimesblog: 'nip/tuck' casts reacts to series finale





'nip/tuck' casts reacts to series finale via la times blogquick hits:dylan walsh" — i felt the finale should have been more about some closure with the things we’d already set up. it seemed like an odd thing to do."julian mcmahon  “i know that some people felt like it was less than what you should do on “nip/tuck.” joely richardson“i thought it was an absolute page-turner..."john hensley“this is anticlimactic to me. i was craving for there to be some great twist..."kelly carlson“i found myself reading the script and getting a little pissed off that my child was going with ava. i was a little mad. i was a little upset. it made me sick.”roma maffia“it went back to its nip/tuckism..."tags:niptuck television nip/tuck nip tuck carver entertainment

final nip/tuck episode tonight!!!!





it's been a while since my last post but this is it!!!!!   what are you expecting?  what are you hoping for?   drop me a line either by comment or in the forum.-ntf!!!thoughts on the finale:look, anyone who has watched nip/tuck from the beginning knows that sean and christian were on very self-distructive paths. in the end. they both saw it and finally had the courage to take a new path in life. that's what this episode was about. christian and sean both knew that for their own happiness this had to be done. it may work out and it may not but it's something that had to happen. even matt decided to take on a new path. it may not have been the right one and probably isn't but that's what he needed to do and had been trying to do for some time.christian will always be the christian we know and love... the womanizing, sex addicted, self indulgent who's only real relationship will be with liz while sean is away.sean will be the sean we know and love. he'll get to do something he truly loves and maybe, for the first time in his life have a normal life without all the "plastic" overtones. sean doesnt want the same life that christian does and never did. sean wants a family and now he can work on that without christian always begging for his attention and demanding that he interrupt his life to save him from his own.liz will continue to be the backbone for christian. their partnership may end in sheer disaster but it's a path that she needs to take as well. in the end, all we can assume is that the characters will have a better chance without each other than with each other.i enjoyed the finale... it may not have been the best one in the series but at least it left us thinking more about the characters than recent episodes. it's late so i apologize for the spelling mistakes / grammar/ typos if there are any. ;)tags:niptuck television nip/tuck nip tuck carver entertainment

nip/tuck final nine - season premiere dan daly





nip/tuck is coming to an end and it looks like the path will lead to the end of mcnamara/troy.  this episode basically highlighted all the tension that has been brewing between christian and sean (mostly felt by sean).  flashbacks in this episode give us the impression that christian has manipulated sean from the very beginning while they were in college.  sean was at the top of the class while christian was just having a good time while he skated by.   this episode revealed that it was christian's idea to be in miami and get into plastic surgery.  sean wanted to go to harvard and become a doctor in order to "make a difference." ultimately, it was christian who sabotaged those dreams.sean and christian were honored with a presitgious award from their alma mater for all the ground-breaking work they've done - sort of a lifetime achievement award.  things were going smoothly until sean found out that it was actually a donation by christian on behalf of the both of them that ultimately led to the honor.  christian said that this would keep them in business for another 25 years and while his intentions were good, sean just felt it was another backstab and sham that christian has done to him time and time again.a couple of weird plot points came up:-christian who always practices safe sex apparently got his interior decorator pregnant leading to his "snip/snip."-christian appears to be on a spending spree since forging sean's name on the line of credit against the business.  not only is he remodeling the office but he also made a 200k donation in order to receive the award in the episode.-kimber/christian are now married.  we went from proposal to marriage without the whole marriage episode inbetween.  kimber is apparently already on the lookout for christian's cheating ways but missed his first trist with the decorator.highlights of the next episode look pretty wild as sean and kimber start to heat up!tags:niptuck television nip/tuck nip tuck carver entertainment

nip/tuck season 6 episode 2 - enigma





we didnt really expect sean to kill himself on the second episode.  that couldnt happen!  kudos to christian for keeping sean in check!sean continued his downward spiral partly due to the stress and insomnia that he is enduring.  i can't believe he actually started any sort of relationship with that other insomniac.  she was as strange as they come.   sean was sinking to new lows until he realized what he was getting himself into. looks like teddy is in it for the money after all realizing that sean is spiraling out of control and has a $5m life insurance policy.  maybe she'll try to kill him like all the others.liz has finally decided to drop the divorce.  i am glad too because mean liz just doesnt work for the show.  i think kimber does a better job at playing a lot of different types of roles for the same character.christian is really starting to show a complex with mario (michael).  weren't they both in the shower together already not long ago?  i am not sure why it became a sudden surprise all of a sudden to compare manhoods.   apparently the new doc has the goods to satisfy kimber.no sign of matt in this episode but much like sean, he will sink further into the abyss.as for the main patient of the episode, enigma.... what a strange dude!  his parents were trying to get him cleaned up and while it may have helped on the outside, it surely didnt help his inner demons.   enigma ends up killing his parents and himself leaving christian and liz in shock with the outcome.i didnt get a chance to see the promo for next week but it should continue to be a rollercoaster ride for the boys of mcnamara/troy. tags:niptuck television nip/tuck nip tuckentertainment

nip/tuck premiere oct 14, 2009 - welcome back!





well, the first episode is in the books.  what did you all think of it?  i think the idea of relating the state of the business to the state of the economy is quite brilliant!   mario returns and brings the competition and jealousy that really drives both sean and christian.the best scene of the night had to be that commercial!  that was classic and has to be on of my favorite scenes all time for nip/tuck!   it was perfect!  if you havent seen the episode, that scene alone is worth it.matt.... poor matt.  this guy is just a tortured soul.  i can't believe what he is resorting to now.  you really have to laugh.   i thought he made the perfect mime though!sean's girlfriend doesnt seem to fit as well as the actress from last year.  curious to see how that plays out.  kimber was back and i was happy she was.no sign of the kids this year in the premiere which is not all that surprising.  i am just waiting for annie to show up as a 16yr old mid-season!  wilbur was there and the kid is huge!!it looks like liz is going to make life very difficult for christian.  good for her and her aspirations of the lezboat! :)the blind divorce lawyer was another funny scene with christian.   i thought it was going to get even raunchier than it did but thankfully it did not.   i am looking forward to this season and more things to come.   there was a lot of cheesy humor in this one which made it worth while.   it ended on a bit of a dramatic cliff-hanger but we all know what will happen next week anyway.drop me a line.  it's good to be writing about nip/tuck again!tags:niptuck television nip/tuck nip tuck carver entertainment

all new nip/tuck tomorrow night!  season premiere!





the previews are over and we're ready to go.  tomorrow night nip/tuck returns after a long wait.   i can only imagine the trouble that sean and christian will get into this year.  the previews look pretty good so i am anxious for the return.i have to admit i thought the finale last year was a complete disaster with christian being misdiagnosed.   now i guess we'll deal with the fallout.  i havent read into the previews for this year.  i honestly wanted a nice surprise (cast, storylines, and all).welcome back gang!tags:niptuck television nip/tuck nip tuck entertainment
