solar systems used in the
freeport house for solar electric and heating.
the solar thermal provides domestic
hot water and supplemental space heat. the collector array on the south roof
consists of 160 apricus evacuated tubes. the array is mounted at 60
degrees to horizontal to optimize performance for space heating. two 160 gallon stiebel
eltron dual coil tanks are used to store the thermal energy for domestic hot water and for
space heat. 
there is a 5.4 kw photovoltaic array
on the southwest roof of the  house consisting of (24)  225
watt sunpower modules.   the modules feed power into a sunpower 5000 watt
inverter. the inverter will feed roughly 6200 kilo-watt hours of electricity per year into
the house and/or the power grid.
