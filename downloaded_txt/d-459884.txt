space independent and new world realty





now slated for the wrecking ball beat.[greenpoint]if you are in the market for a new commercial space in brooklyn, youshould check out some of what new world realty (loftninja's company)has available in this new album.  there are places to put grocerystores, galleries, boutiques, you name it.  just wanted to pass thatalong...base4space.com   a nyc space search engine's storefrontthe polish (of greenpoint) were a lot smarter than the artists aboutthis whole gentrification thing(and forwardthinking too).  not only did they start buying all of their houses awhile back (so to avoid having to move when the rezoning came), butthey had to build a bank to hold all their money when the rent startedto pour in.[mcguinness blvd-greenpoint]a quickr pickr post
