quotable:

there is nothing better than to come home, tired and stressed from the ills of the day, to find a familiar, simple, dish of chicken and noodles with mushrooms. actually it can be any number of simple home made dishes.  they fill the holes the day has made.                                 me

cheerios




quite the flap over a breakfast cereal don't you think? the fda is trying to wield it long arm and force general mills to change their packaging. they claim to lower cholesteral and all...what a fiasco. if the fda really was concerned they'd have general mills and the rest of the food production world actually use ingredients that we, as consumers, could trust to be healthy for our bodies. they'd quit allowing large companies like monsanto, adm and cargill and their lobbyists control congress and their own researchers. they'd actually have consumer health as their goal. instead, the fda is only interested in headlines.

cake class




i'm teaching a beginning cake decorating class beginning thursday. it's funny that s'mee and i both were asked to teach them. she got through hers, and i of course, put them off until now. it will be a basic class, then if the students wish to go on they'll have to get specific on what they want to learn.week 1 will cover the basics of baking, prepping and the ways to make frosting. i was going to have them bring a cake to work with that first week until one of the attendees wrote me and asked just how you use parchment paper when baking a cake.week 2 we will put into practice a bit of what we learned in week 1. we will fill, and crumb coat then frost the cake in a basic icing. we'll talk about smoothing, and a bit about decorative tips.week 3 we will use the tips to make differnt designs and cover questions from week 2's experimentation at home. well talk about different ways cakes can be shaped and flavored.week 4 we will talk a bit about fondant. i have told them fondant is its own class, i will not be teaching how to cover a cake in fondant in this series. we will learn a few fondant decorations and flower making a bit.all in all we should have a great time.

alltop




if you look at my sidebar, i have a button for my alltop. what is that? it's a news reader. but it's not a regular news reader. it's better.if you click on it you'll see my alltop page. all top stands for all the top stories. it is a news aggregator that puts everything, i deem important, on one page for me to read at my leisure. i love it. i have not had time to post here regularly but i am reading. go take a look for yourself, and then set up your own alltop page. i'd love to see what you like to read!
