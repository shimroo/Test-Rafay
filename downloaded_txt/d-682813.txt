may the schwartz be with you





after spaceballs came out, my mom made 
“may the schwartz be with you” t-shirts for my entire family. we all 
wore them together whenever we went out and about — to the 4th of july 
parade, to family gatherings, and apparently we brought them to florida 
and wore them to busch gardens together.

call me, maybe





    

via lindsey weber:
a bunch of us are being serious plagued by the earworm parasite that is carly rae jepsen’s ‘call me maybe.’ as soon as xtine  found out that jepsen fans go by “jepfriends,” a nightmare was born and  we started calling ourselves and everyone we knew jepfriends*. we had  to help our jepfriends, and according to bieber, the only cure for ‘call me maybe’ is a finely edited group singalong.
*featured jepfriends: interweber, drinkyourjuice, speriod, bobbyfinger, iamsosorry, folkinz, hoodratbusiness, kindafabulous, ramou, bex, mattstopera, fjelstud & buster & lyla.

cheer up, sleepy jean





 
september, 1987.

my parents picked me up from sarah’s sleepover birthday party and i  was wearing my favorite outfit (yes, i believe that is a lilac button-up  jumpsuit, and it was a hand-me-down from my dad’s boss’s daughter) and  my awesome watch, and we drove to six flags for the first time to go see  weird al and the monkees. first concert ever! also: best concert ever.

and then later that day, after the concert of excruciating perfection, my little brother and i met alf.

* um. a cardboard cut-out of alf. but, still. weird al +the monkees + alf = the greatest day ever and nothing shall ever top it.
