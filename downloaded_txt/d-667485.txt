feeling good with sd pharmaceuticals


nov. 27th, 2013 at 11:08 pm



 


lauralohri have had a few health scares over the over the years that have really made me aware of the fact that i am not a spring chicken anymore.  i can’t put my body through the wringer the way i did in my teens and twenties.  i need my 8 hours of beauty sleep.  i need to fuel my body properly.  i need to get exercise.  i need to feed my soul.   i need to balance work and play—getting enough of both in my life.  so when i got an opportunity to review some of the high quality products from sd pharmaceuticals in a campaign with fitfluential, i jumped on the chance!over time, i have become more and more aware of the decrease in quality of our food sources over time.  one of the ways i have found to keep myself healthy and make sure i am getting all the nutrients, is to use supplements.  i use vitamin d supplements because when i am in the sun, i am blocking my vitamin d sources with sunscreen.  i use omega 3 to keep my heart healthy.  i use coenzyme q10 to help my immune system.  i use probiotics to keep my gut flora healthy.  i am no stranger to using alternative medicine.i was sent five different products from sd pharmaceuticals: green coffee bean, raspberry ketone, garcinia cambogia, dendrobium, and diindolylmethane.  they encouraged me to pick and choose what supplements best fit my lifestyle.  i was excited to read through the information and to learn about the product benefits.  when i opened up the raspberry ketone bottle, it smells so good!  what i really like about these is that they support fat loss, muscle growth and aid in recovery from exercise.  i am always looking for ways to improve my sports performance, whether i am on the road running or swimming laps in the pool.i immediately noticed an increase in my energy level throughout the day when i began taking the “stack” that i chose.  a stack is a combination of supplements from sd pharmaceuticals to help reach your goals.  for example, some might have goals for fat loss, others maximum health and wellness, while others might be interested in maximum sports/exercise performance.  the ingredients compliment each other quite well.raspberry ketone has great antioxidant properties and it smells delicious!i found the supplements easy to take.  there was no taxing my digestive system, like some other supplements sometimes do.  i’ve felt amazing taking them!  if you’re looking for a way to compliment your nutritional regimen, sd pharm has a plan for everyone.here’s to good health!

hanging out with the queen at the queen latifah show


sep. 11th, 2013 at 7:00 am



 


lauralohrme, at the queen latifah show, on the set.a few weeks back, i was invited to be an audience member at the taping of the premiere episode of the queen latifah show at sony studios in culver city.  i have only been to the taping of one show before and had a blast.  i love queen latifah, so i said, yes, please!  it was an incredible opportunity and they promised we wouldn’t be disappointed by the guest list.  as promised, i was not disappointed one bit!i’ve been waiting since august 23rd to share this with my readers.  the guest was john travolta.  i was sitting maybe 20 feet away from queen latifah and john travolta!  it was such a surreal moment!  it was an awesome time!   queen latifah with john travolta on the “big sexy” set of the queen latifah show i was able to carpool from san diego to the show with my friend and fellow blogger, rory hadley who blogs at chocolate hair/vanilla care.  the conversation flowed and we were both excited to see the show.  rory’s a big fan of the queen as well.  she knew right where the studio was and i could hardly contain my excitement (although, rory remained calm.  she’s great at remaining calm, even with my driving.).  we arrived on time and went through the security and then were escorted to the studio, across the lot and past many other studios.  the inside of the studio was packed with other exuberant studio-audience-members-to-be.  we were greeted by the producer, gillian sheldon, who was an absolute pleasure to meet and she spent some time chatting with the 6 of us bloggers about the show.  as bloggers, we got a vip tour of the gorgeous set (how lucky are we?!), that was designed by none other than lenny kravitz.  i love lenny and think he’s so extremely talented, however, he really outdid himself on the design.  it was lovely.  queen latifah calls it “big sexy.” will and jada pinkett-smith are the executive producers, we learned during the tour of the set.  we got to take pictures before the rest of the studio audience filed in and watched the crew getting set-up.  what an incredible experience!here are the 6 of us bloggers, touring the set before the show started and before the rest of the audience was brought in. we went back to the waiting area with the rest of the crowd and waited for our group to be ushered to our seats.  we were taken to the front row of the stands to wait for the show to start.  watching everyone on the set scramble around, in such a process of ordered chaos that it was difficult for me to comprehend how any television show makes it to the final cut.  it was astonishing to me!  nevertheless, like a well-oiled machine.  while we waited for the show to start, we were entertained by the funniest comedian, ron g.  he was damn funny and my side hurt by the time the show started!).  eventually, it was time and the show began.  queen latifah came out with an outfit identical to the one john travolta wore on saturday night fever.  i swear, she’s even more beautiful in person than she is one television.  of course, she came out dancing and singing, queen latifah style.  (she’s got some moves!) she’s is stunning and bubbly and down-to-earth.  you could tell that she is intensely enthusiastic and proud of her new show and i have to say, she has every right to be.  it was a great show and i have every belief that she’ll be a success!this is a picture of the set before the show started.  i wish you could see from this picture just how massive and impressive the set was! during the interview with john travolta, he opened up about his family, his career and discussed what advice he would give to his younger self.  i kept thinking to myself, “this is so weird.  i am close to queen latifah and john travolta.  i am not usually impressed by celebrity, nonetheless, this was an exception to the rule.  the very best part, was in between the breaks, when she did her own thing—dancing, singing, talking to the audience.  she put on quite a show!  i think my hands hurt for a week from all the clapping i did. right after i took this picture, she pointed at me and then waved.  i got all shy and blushed a little. i’d love to tell you more, however i know you’ll be tuning in to the first show, which airs next week and i don’t want to spoil it for you.  see if you can spot me in the audience, when the show premieres next week:the queen latifah show begins on september 16, every afternoon, monday through friday.  you can click here to find the showtimes and stations in your area.  you can find out more information about the show by visiting the queen latifah show website: http://queenlatifah.com/disclaimer:  i was invited to be a studio audience member for the queen latifah show.  i was not compensated for this experience and am sharing because i genuinely had an amazing time!

anniversary and 40th birthday celebration in sonoma with the wine road, day 2


sep. 6th, 2013 at 6:26 pm



 


lauralohri posted about the anniversary and 40th birthday celebration we had in sonoma on the wine road back on this post here.  today, i want to continue sharing our adventure on day two.  we had such a great time and one blog post just wasn’t enough to cover all the fun we had!on day two, we woke up and had breakfast at the hilton, where we stayed.  after searching for the best online deals, we used the hotel shuttle to take us back to the airport to rent a car.  we picked up a ford focus and headed to our first winery of the day—the francis ford coppola winery in geyserville. the winery was over-the-top awesome!  the grounds are beautiful.  we felt like we had arrived on a las vegas casino property, with the beautiful grounds, the resort-style pool and all its grandeur.  entrance to francis ford coppola winery.  we decided to call our ford focus rental car, francis ford, after seeing the winery.  from there out, our little rental was francis ford. (we’re nerds!)the beautiful francis ford coppola pool, which you purchase a day pass to swim inwhen we arrived at francis ford coppola winery, we went to the concierge to find out where we should go to redeem our three day pass to the wine road, which entitled us to complimentary tastings at over 80 different wineries.  we were directed to the inside of the main building, where we found a friendly wine host that was more than happy to share the lovely wines that ffcw had to offer.  we fell in love with several wines and had a lovely chat with our lovely host, who was a southern california transplant to the area.  she was informative about the area, attractions we should not miss and we had a great conversation.  mr. bear standing in front of the concierge at ffcwthis was one of the prettiest bottles!  i loved the bottle and the wine!this was the bottle we settled on.  there were so many great wines, but this was the one we liked the taste of best.after our tasting, we walked around the grounds and got to see some awesome memorabilia from several of francis ford coppola’s movies, including:the desk from the movie, “the godfather”the car from the movie, “tucker” memorabilia from the movie, “apocalypse now”it was a great day and we were so impressed by the grandiosity of the winery.  it’s definitely a “must-see” for anyone visiting sonoma.  it was our first winery we visited in sonoma and it left quite an impression.  loved it!  i think we could have spent all day at francis ford coppola, enjoying all they have to offer, nevertheless there was much more wine tasting ahead of us!  next, we visited quivira vineyards and winery in the dry creek river valley of healdsburg (pronounced heels-berg.  it would take 4 days for us to master the pronunciation!).  the location was recommended to us by mr. bear’s step-brother and it was a fabulous recommendation, indeed!  we spent some time sampling the amazing wines and learned about the various varietals that quivira has to offer.  the dry creek river valley is beautiful—as is all of sonoma.  the breathtaking vineyards of quiviraselfie of mr. bear and i at quivirathe grapes were very close to harvest everywhere we went.  we would have loved to be there for the sonoma valley crush festival that is happening at the end of this month. unfortunately, it was getting late, as the wineries usually close at 5:00 p.m. daily.  we cut our visit much too short at quivira to squeeze just one more wine tasting in.  we found our way to the raymond burr vineyards.  it was equally beautiful, driving around the dry creek river valley.  the vineyards were especially gorgeous, with the grapes so ripe on the vines.  the weather was perfect!they were getting ready to close, so we didn’t have as much time as we liked to visit, however we got to see a lot of perry mason memorabilia.  like this:raymond burr’s awards for the television series, “perry mason.”mr. bear, holding one of the many awards mr. burr won for his role as perry mason.  it was extraordinarily heavy!before we left, i caught one last view:beautiful! we went back to our hotel to get changed for dinner and came home to:milk and cookies from the hilton! …and lastly, we enjoyed a fantastic dinner at monti’s rotisserie and bar, courtesy of the wine road.monti’s is one of five stark restaurants in the santa rosa area.  there food is delicious.  the atmosphere is amazing.  the service is phenomenal.  did i mention the food?  because, nom, nom, nom, nom:mr. bear ordered this delicious dish.while i, on the other hand, opted for the mussels and fries.  the food.  oh, the food! we finished the day with a dip in the pool and jacuzzi, then a nightcap (or two) at the hotel bar.  it was a long, wonderful, amazing day.  i couldn’t be more relaxed if i tried.  this is part two of our sonoma wine trip. click below read about other parts of our trip:anniversary and 40th birthday celebration in sonoma with the wine road, day onedisclaimer: the wine road generously provided us with complimentary three day wine tasting passes and gift certificates to the stark restaurants, including monti’s rotisserie and bar.  regardless, i was truly pleased with all the products and services we received and only recommend those that i can honestly recommend to my readers.

living clean—clean eating, healthy living


sep. 5th, 2013 at 8:57 am



 


lauralohrtuesday was the first day of third grade for allie.  it was also the first day of my commitment to clean eating, being healthy and getting in shape.  we embarked on a mission in this house to living clean.  for us, that entails eliminating all the processed foods, including flour and sugar.  we are eating only vegan foods, with the exception of very few things, such as eggs.  it’s a 6 week challenge and 6 weeks seems like a long time right now!yesterday was day two.  i had a headache and felt a bit sluggish.  i am assuming that this is all the process of detox.  i muddled through the day and i made it, but man!  this might be a tough road ahead of me.  it’s all part of the process.  this, i know!i got on the treadmill for the first time in nearly a month.  with our fabulous vacation behind us, i’ve struggled to get back on track.  i have been using my fitbit zip to motivate me to get 10,000 steps a day, nevertheless, i have fallen short many a time.  i was excited that i did get to 10,000 steps yesterday.  it’s only 9 a.m. and i am more than halfway to my goal of getting 10,000 steps!  wooohooo!i am really out of shape now.  i have been trying to get back to running, yet i am struggling.  i am barely able to get through 3/4 mile without stopping.  i have a lot of work ahead of me to get back to where i want to be.  i have goals of finishing a few half marathons next year.  i want to do one this fall.  that means that there is a lot of work to do! i am doing this challenge with a couple of friends.  we are keeping each other on track and it is so much fun!  it helps to have someone to try to get healthy with, even if it is a virtual accountability.  we have plans of going to vegas the end of october—the three of us couples.  we’re pushing each other to stay committed and i am so glad to have that motivation.this morning at 4:30 a.m., i got up and ran for 50 minutes on the treadmill.  i am never up before 7 and never before 9 if i don’t have to.  when i say, “ran,” i really mean that i did intervals.  running for 2 minutes, walking for 2 minutes.  repeat. repeat. repeat.  it felt wonderful to get up and get my exercise in before the kid and husband were up.  i had the morning all to myself.…allie is doing really good.  she joined swim team at the end of july and she’s making a lot of progress.  it is fun to watch her swim and watch her get stronger everyday.  she has a swim meet coming up.  she couldn’t be more excited.  it’s amazing to see how grown up she is.  she has grown into such a nice little lady.  she is such a good little girl!  it’s crazy to think that my little baby is in the third grade.  she makes me laugh.  she is my heart.  i love her so much!

beam me up samsung galaxy s4 #verizon


sep. 4th, 2013 at 4:45 pm



 


lauralohrmr. bear and i have been loyal fans of the android operating system on our phones.  we’re always excited when the newest features and releases come out.  when verizon wireless asked me what phone i wanted to review next, the samsung galaxy s4 was at the top of my list!  mr. bear and i had been waiting somewhat impatiently for the release date of this phone.as it turned out, we bought mr. bear the samsung galaxy s4 for his birthday and that coincided with the date verizon sent me the same phone to tryout.  this was awesome, because we were able to “bump” our phones, using the s-beam technology to share photos, files and videos.  it was really cool.  we were able to discover and learn about the phone together.  we sat on our patio one evening, enjoying a glass of wine (okay, a bottle!) and playing with the phones.  love this phone! mr. bear chose the black one and verizon sent me the white onethere are so many cool features about this phone.  one i really like, is when you find a contact in your phone, you simply put the phone to your ear to dial.  the bluetooth connection in the car is so incredibly simple.  you can program the phone to automatically connect to the bluetooth, as soon as you start the car.  easy, peasy!  as a fitness lover, my favorite feature is the fitness tracker.  when mr. bear and i went to sonoma, he had his phone track our steps, as we spent our days in wine country.  at the end of the day, we could add in a walk, take a swim, or whatever to make sure we got our exercise in.  it definitely made us more aware of our activity.* we always have our phones with us and it was something we didn’t have to think too much about.  we got our 10,000 steps in every day!  woohoo!we took tons of photos on our recent trip.  the gs4 was a great camera to use!  the drama shot and eraser features.  when we were traveling down the road in the car, i could use the drama shot to take a “burst” of photos and i could choose between them to fit together the perfect shot.  the eraser feature was great when someone decided to photobomb our photos when we were trying to get some photos of the landscape.  i still have several months before i can upgrade my phone, but i am keeping my eye on the samsung galaxy s4.  mr. bear loves his and i am trying to not to be too jealous.  it is super fast, super light and really the best phone i have had the opportunity to review so far.  *it has a lot of other cool features too, like can be synched by bluetooth to a heart-rate monitor, blood pressure meter, body scale and s band bracelet.**i was sent the samsung galaxy s4 for review purposes only.  i was asked to return the phone after the review period.

anniversary and 40th birthday celebration in sonoma with the wine road


aug. 29th, 2013 at 11:20 am



 


lauralohrback in june, not only did i turn 40, but mr. bear and i celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary.  we were trying to choose the perfect spot to vacation, so i turned to facebook.  sonoma was the hand-down winner for the perfect vacation.  the more feedback i got from friends and family, the more i was convinced!  a fellow blogger recommended the wine road.  i contacted them and they offered some complimentary services for our anniversary, including a 3-day ticket to the wine road.we went out lax, as we had to drop the kiddo, the dogs and the cat off at my parent’s house and it was closer than san diego.  we took a one hour-ish hop from lax to santa rosa.  it was so easy!  much better than flying into san francisco!  we flew alaska airlines, which allowed for us to bring back a case of wine with us on the return, so bonus!  please, they were giving complimentary cocktails on the flight.  wooohoo!we stayed at the hilton sonoma wine country hotel, where the service was amazing from the moment we called for a complimentary shuttle from the airport.  they did not have a scheduled airport pick-up for another hour after we landed, but came and got us anyway.  when we arrived at the hotel, the wine road had this amazing package all ready to go for us, complete with maps, a cookbook, a lovely bottle of wine, coupons from various wine road participants and we immediately opened the bottle of wine. after being properly welcomed, we decided to roam around the beautiful grounds of the hilton.  we found our way to the lovely outdoor patio and enjoyed a glass (or two) of wine by the fire.  the evening was cool.  the patio was quiet.  the view was lovely.  the romance was there.  mr. bear and i enjoyed some much needed relaxation and conversation, along with some appetizers.  in just a few hours, all our cares in the world melted away!when we returned to our room, we found a beautiful spread of fresh fruit and a bottle of korbel champagne, compliments of the hotel manager.…along with a note from the manager:(we had the pleasure of meeting the manager the following evening, over a few glasses of wine at the wine tasting the hilton hosts in the lobby each evening.  she was so nice and easy to talk to.  it was clear to us that she really loves sonoma and enjoys meeting the guests.  she’s pretty awesome!)after freshening up, we decided to use a cab to get downtown.  we had heard that wednesdays were happening in downtown santa rosa.  if we were looking for a happening spot, we certainly weren’t disappointed!  there is quite a lively crowd that congregates, as there is a wednesday market from 5-8:30 p.m. (and the party continues on after that!) in the months of may-august.we had an amazing dinner at jackson’s bar and oven, near the santa rosa plaza.  mr. bear had pizza with roasted beets.  for their special of the day, they had “chef’s choice pizza.”  the chef chose to put beets on pizza.  i would have never thought of doing that, but i’m glad he did!  delicious!it looked and tasted delicious!  the wine road gave us so much guidance on what to see and do, in and around sonoma.  the first evening, we had a lovely dinner at jackson’s bar and oven in downtown santa rosa.  it was a wednesday night, so we had the pleasure of enjoying the wednesday market that happens every wednesday from may until august.  it was a beautiful, cool santa rosa night and we had a blast, just us two, reconnecting and celebrating.  founded more than 30 years ago, wine road is an association of wineries and lodgings in the alexander, dry creek, and russian river valleys of northern sonoma county. from its modest beginning as an organization of nine wineries, it has grown into a spirited constellation of more than 150 wineries and 50 lodgings. it’s not actually a “road” in the sense of a single, continuous stretch of paved highway, but more of a treasure map to the many jewels nestled among the hills and valleys of a region where fresh air, fine wine and exquisite cuisine await those who traverse it. – see more at: http://www.wineroad.com/about/3#sthash.dek1kn7r.dpufwe had a great first day in sonoma.  stay tuned for the next posts, with our wine tasting experience, canoe down the russian river and much, much more!

keeping house or playing hookey with naked clean


aug. 19th, 2013 at 7:13 am



 


lauralohrwe are blessed with a beautiful house.  we love that there is so much room to entertain.  we love that there is plenty of storage.  we love our house.  well, i mostly love our house, except when i have to clean the whole darn thing.  i cannot say i love house cleaning. when the good folks at naked clean offered a complimentary house cleaning, of course, i was ecstatic!  in fact, i am still ecstatic about it.a few years ago, i got shingles.  if you or anyone else has ever had it, you know how painful it is.  however, the shingles left me with a great deal of uncertainty and concern about my health.  i stopped using chemicals to clean with.  i began to use natural products for my own beauty care, including natural toothpaste and shampoo and conditioner without dangerous chemicals.  i began a regimen of probiotics to rebuild my digestive tract and to rebuild my health.  my health has improved tremendously and i have shared my knowledge about probiotics to anyone that will listen.  currently, i have my daughter, my husband and my parents taking probiotics on a regular basis.  probiotics are good!what i didn’t know, until i had the naked clean people out, is that probiotics have their place in house cleaning as well.   probiotics reduce the germ population naturally, and safely, creating a more healthful environment. probiotics are “good” bacteria, they can help keep the environment free of “bad” bacteria longer than a standard cleaning of chemicals or even natural products.  when i first heard about the concept, i was intrigued and excited to try something new.the naked clean crew showed up on time and ready to.  the two person crew got right to work: cleaning, scrubbing, vacuuming, sweeping, mopping.  we have two dogs and a cat, in addition to our hard wood floors.  it’s a big job to get those floors clean, but they did a great job!  they were here for an hour and a half (with a two person crew, that’s 3 full hours). it smelled good.  it looked good. when they left, i didn’t know what to do, so i sat down and read a book.  i almost felt guilty.  almost.  they left a gift basket of their cleaners to use in between cleanings.  i love the concept of green cleaning and i really love the concept of using products that will promote good health.  it makes me happy to know i am using products that are safe for me and my family—including our furry family.  now that i know about probiotic cleaning, i cannot imagine cleaning any other way!i am definitely going to have the naked clean crew back here!  right now, if you mention my blog, you will get $40 off your first cleaning!  their prices are listed here.  it’s $105 for a 3-hour cleaning or, you can sign up for a cleaning every two weeks for $64.99 for 5 rooms.  they really are amazing and i am excited to have them back out again.

lauralohrwhen verizon offered to send us the verizon jetpack mifi device, i was ecstatic! we have considered getting the device previously, as there are often times when mr. bear is on call and needs to login to the system at work.  there are often times when it would be convenient to have the device with us on the road.  we do a lot of travelling to the homes of friends and family members.  usually, this requires a minimum of an hour in the car.  at 7, my little allie kat gets bored very easily.  we have tried counting call boxes.  we have tried saying, “just look out the window and enjoy the ride.  inevitably, however, we get the same question:“are we there yet?” she whines from the back seat“no!” we both say back, in complete synchronization.  we have learned, over time that there is not a child in this world that can sit still and enjoy the ride.  out of frustration, we have brought coloring books, books to read, to no avail.  the question eventually turns to:“can i please use your cell phone?” she asks in her sweetest way.“no!” we both say, simultaneously. when verizon offered to send us the verizon jetpack 4g lte mobile hotspot mifi, we were thrilled!  it arrived not a moment too soon!  we had plans for it!we have the samsung galaxy tablet, but we don’t pay for the monthly wifi plan.  at the same time, we like to take it on the road with us.  unfortunately, this little girl of ours is far too sophisticated to use the tablet without internet.  with the jetpack, she was snug in the backseat of the car, playing games for fun, watching big time rush videos, playing educational games, browsing the web, doing research for a school project and having a grand time. three hours in the car on the way to my parent’s house?  no problem.  we have been happy to see that allie has become very interested in some great educational games online.  we utilize the parental controls that verizon includes in their software and it has given us quite a bit of control over what she is able to access.  therefore, we can comfortably give her internet access, without the traditional worries of internet safety.we try very hard to stay off of our phones, laptops, tablets and any other technology during meal times.  this idea of disconnecting from technology is very important to us, as meal time is one of the most important times of the day for us to connect.  nonetheless, there are other times it is super convenient to have access to the internet for allie to have access to the internet.  when we are in line at the dmv, at the post office, even at the grocery store.  i can’t say that it hasn’t had its place in our lives.  we recently had to bring the kiddo with us to a “mommy and daddy meeting,” which promised to be as painful for her as it was for mommy and daddy.  she sat quietly on the tablet, doing her own thing and to our credit, the attendees of the meeting complimented us for such a polite little girl.  while we can only take partial credit for our little one being quiet and polite, we were grateful!we found the jetpack to be extremely reliable on the road.  the blazing fast 4g lte network provided us with the best internet access!  mr. bear brought his laptop with us, while he was on call and was able to make immediate contact with his client and help his client on the road.  it gave us a sense of freedom while he was on-call, where previously, we would have been homebound, waiting for a call to come in.if you are looking for a reliable way to stay connected, the affordable jetpack is certainly the way to go! you can find the verizon jetpack 4g lte mifi 4620le for free with a two-year activation with verizon (see store for details and qualifications).  we were offered to try the verizon jetpack for review purposes.  we were required to return the equipment after the trial period.
