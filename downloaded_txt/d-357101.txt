"the ultimate text conversion and manipulation tool" - pcmag



textpipe® pro 12 has arrived!
textpipe helps data-wranglers, data scientists, and data analytics professionals extract, transform and load (etl) data from anywhere
		

		transform data on the fly and discover new levels of speed, simplicity, scale, and savings. 
		extract data from pdf, word documents, excel sheets, databases of any type, single and multi-segment 
		mainframe ebcdic files with cobol copybooks, and text files of any size and type, including 
		csv, tab, xml, html, json, log files and structured and unstructured reports of any size or dimension. 
		transform data with 145 unicode conversions, redaction filters to mask or remove 
		sensitive data such as ssns, credit cards etc or pii data such as names and addresses.
		

		use textpipe to transfer mainframe data to your cloud targets for big data, analytics, business intelligence, erp, crm, or for application modernization or mainframe offload initiatives.
		

		connect all your data sources - easily load all your source data into on-premises and cloud databases.
		

			textpipe is an affordable alternative to altair monarch and matillion, and an outstanding replacement for end-of-life products such as
			monarch data pump, ssis, vedit mainframe conversion, parserat, text2flat and more.
		
use the textpipe marketplace to quickly handle ebcdic to ascii conversion of industry data sets such as
		texas railroad commission oil and gas masters and fiserv/sagent data


		  textpipe will save you time and frustration in wrangling data,
		  regardless of the number of changes required, the size or number of
		  files, and the complexity of the transformations. 
textpipe now includes new connectors to stream data historian (industrial sensor) to azure iot hub 
		  	for big data time-series analytics.
