coro fellows program in public affairs



the fellows program in public affairs (fppa) is a comprehensive and rigorous national fellowship that equips emerging civic leaders with the knowledge, skills and networks that transform them as individuals with the promise that they then transform their organizations, communities and beyond. with each cohort encompassing a wide range of communities, interests, ideologies, and experiences, the program shapes the hearts and minds of fellows through multiple components. operated by coro in new york, southern california, northern california, pittsburgh, and st. louis, fppa has been cultivating a global community of thoughtful, prepared, and civic leadership for over 75 years. the program connects fellows with a robust network of over 15,000 coro alumni, professional placements in multiple sectors, and experienced facilitators that propel them to achieve their goals and drive impact in their communities.learn more about the fellows program in public affairs and access the application through each coro center’s website.
