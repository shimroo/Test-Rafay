aircraft spruce welcomes wag-aero customers











 aircraft spruce is pleased to announce the acquisition of the parts distribution operations of wag-aero. wag-aero was founded in the 1960s by dick and bobbie wagner in the basement of their family home in lyons, wi, around the same time that bob and flo irwin started aircraft spruce in the basement of their home in fullerton, ca. both companies published their first parts catalogs in 1965, and in 1971 wag-aero moved to their permanent facility on north road in lyons. in 1995 the wagners sold wag-aero to bill read and mary myers who have continued expand their parts distribution and manufacturing operations. aircraft spruce acquired only the wag-aero parts distribution division.
