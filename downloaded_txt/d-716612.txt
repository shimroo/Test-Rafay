i’ll be forever grateful.  i am working in a caring and learning labor & delivery unit, enjoying year round sunshine in a gorgeous new medical center.  this is everything i could possibly want plus!  beck-field answered all my questions, helped me through the licensure process, and best of all it didn’t cost me a cent.
