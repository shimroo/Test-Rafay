  reserve at mizuna on yelp 













a downtown spokane staplesituated in the heart of downtown spokane, mizuna is the quintessential dining experience for locals and visitors. we are located within 3 blocks of most downtown attractions, including all davenport hotels, the convention center, the inb performing arts center, riverfront park, and river park square mall. since our opening in 1996, our focus has been sourcing the freshest ingredients, and keeping the food simple to let the quality of the ingredients shine. we use organic produce whenever possible, and all-natural, sustainable meats. we have a full vegetarian menu, as vegetarian cuisine has always been a primary focus of ours. words to describe our cuisine are seasonal, honest and clean. our bar features an extensive wine list, craft cocktails and microbrews. we have a seasonal patio (may-september) that is off of the sidewalk and tucked away in the alleyway next to the restaurant. our private dining room can seat up to 40 guests, and is the premier destination for rehearsal dinners, birthday parties business dinners, etc. we can fine-tune a menu to suit all of your needs.  please contact andrew@mizuna.com for more information.
