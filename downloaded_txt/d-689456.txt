a note from us

founded in 1898, van holten’s is a family-owned company based in waterloo, wisconsin. we developed the original pickle-in-a-pouch as the perfect on-the-go snack for pickle lovers everywhere, and continue to bring fresh, bold flavors to our iconic pickles. from warheads® extreme sour to tapatio® salsa picante, we’ve got you covered. 
the fun doesn’t end there. shake things up with our pickleback mixer as a tangy twist to your favorite cocktail or mocktail or cool down with our electrolyte-enhance pickle-ice freeze pops. pickles are more than just a snack – they’re an experience.
rip. sip. enjoy!
