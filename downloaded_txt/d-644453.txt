"iâm just trying my best to be like chief brody from jaws."
- clint gage


after a harrowing ordeal on a bus in los angeles that would explode if it dropped below 50 mph, clint vowed heâd spend the rest of his life talking about movies. heâs largely succeeded too, although it took a similar (though critically less well-received) hostage situation on a cruise ship a few years later to get him back on track. as the long-time voice of ignâs film focused youtube channel cinefix, clint has spent the past ten years writing and producing countless video essays that read like love letters to the silver screen because, well, thatâs kinda the point and heâs an âalright" writer and âpretty goodâ narrator on top of being famously humble. currently heâs hosting the cinefix top 100 podcast, serving as ignâs managing features producer and always wary of the next 90s action movie scenario heâll find himself in that changes the trajectory of his life and career.
