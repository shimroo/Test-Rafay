                            we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. views were even more spectacular than expected, beds were very comfy and space is great for a part of 6. hot tub was great. the only down check is there is no kitchen. the place definitely has the space but for a party of 6 adults trying to cook wasâ€¦

                            this cottage is clean and cozy with everything that you need. it is nestled in a wood among other rental cottages, but you have plenty of privacy due to the trees. you can hear the nearby road and there was also some construction nearby when we visited. the instructions and communication were very clear andâ€¦
