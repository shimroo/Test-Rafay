hey there. welcome.



this is me. or rather, a curated version of me. (for the real me, we’ll have to go hiking together.) i am a narrative nonfiction author. that means i write about real people doing real things in the real world. that’s the nonfiction part. the narrative part is the way i tell it: stories with plot that come alive with characters and scenes. like, you know, fiction. but not. i’m the author of 15 books, scores of magazine articles and countless (well, i could count, but i haven’t) essays and blogs. come. take a look.
