colorado symphony principal harpist, courtney hershey bress, and composer michael daugherty





harp of ages
for solo harp and orchestra (2023)
harp of ages (2023) for harp and orchestra was commissioned by the colorado symphony for principal harpist, courtney hershey bress. the world premiere was given by courtney hershey bress, solo harp, with the colorado symphony conducted by andrew litton, at the boettcher concert hall, denver performing arts complex on may 12, 2023.
the harp is one of the oldest and most beautiful instruments, from early civilizations to the present. like the seven pedals on the modern harp, my concerto is divided into seven movements that reflect on many ages of the harp. each movement is associated with a memorable figure associated with the harp:

sappho
sister juana’s hymn
uhura’s song
david’s prayer
harpo speaks
detroit blue
irish wedding

review: “i don’t remember any previous commissioned score for houston ballet with such a lucid mix of contrasting, overlapping motifs as this one by the grammy award-winning composer michael daugherty. his melodies for flute, clarinet, strings and horns evocatively reflect the characters and emotions they represent. a small sea of xylophones punctuates it all, able to sound both primal and orderly. music director ermanno florio and the houston ballet orchestra seemed to relish daugherty’s music as much as the dancers seemed to enjoy moving to it.”  (houston chronicle)

michael daugherty’s hear the dust blow for solo harp (2021)
yolanda kondonassis, harp
from five minutes for earth
released april 1, 2022






hear the dust blow recalls the devastating dust storms that destroyed dozens of towns in oklahoma and northern texas, as depicted in john steinbeck’s seminal 1939 novel the grapes of wrath. millions of people abandoned their homesteads and headed to california in what became the largest migration in american history. i have recast the old american folk song, “down in the valley,” and created music which alternates between a melancholy dust bowl lament and a celebration of a better life to come in the “promised land” of california.

biography






grammy award-winning composer michael daugherty first came to international attention when his metropolis symphony was performed by the baltimore symphony orchestra, conducted by david zinman, at carnegie hall in 1994 and subsequently recorded by decca/argo. since then, daugherty’s music has entered orchestral, band and chamber music repertoire and made him, according to the league of american orchestras, one of the ten most-performed american composers of concert music today. his music has received six grammy awards, including best contemporary classical composition in 2010 for deus ex machina for piano and orchestra and in 2016 for tales of hemingway for cello and orchestra.
born in 1954 in cedar rapids, iowa, daugherty is the oldest of five brothers, all professional musicians. they grew up in a musical household, with a father who played the drums in dance bands and a mother who sang in musical theater productions. as a young man, daugherty studied composition with many of the preeminent composers of the 20th century including jacob druckman, earle brown, bernard rands and roger reynolds at yale university (1980-82), betsy jolas at the paris conservatory and pierre boulez at ircam in paris (1979-80), and györgy ligeti in hamburg (1982-84). from 1980-82, daugherty was also an assistant to jazz arranger gil evans in new york.
after teaching from 1986 to 1991 at the oberlin conservatory of music in oberlin, ohio, daugherty became professor of composition at the university of michigan school of music, theatre and dance in ann arbor, michigan, where he is a mentor to many of today’s most talented young composers. daugherty is also a frequent guest of professional orchestras, festivals, universities and conservatories around the world. daugherty’s music is published by peermusic classical/faber music, boosey & hawkes and since 2010 by michael daugherty music.

michael daugherty’s six riffs after ovid for solo oboe
six riffs after ovid (2021) for solo oboe was commissioned by bang on a can, and premiered on a bang on a can marathon in april 18, 2021 by oboist titus underwood.
my composition is inspired by the metamorphoses, written by the roman poet ovid in 8 ad. like six metamorphoses after ovid for solo oboe, composed in 1951 by the english composer benjamin britten, i have selected six characters from ovid’s epic poem:
pan, who played on a reed pipe; phaeton, who rode the chariot of the sun and was struck down by a thunderbolt; niobe, who lamented the death of her children and was turned into a mountain; bacchus, who revelled at drunken feasts; narcissus, who fell in love with his own image and turned into a flower;  and arethusa, who was turned into a fountain.

naxos releases michael daugherty’s this land sings: inspired by the life and times of woody guthrie
world-premiere recording features performances by the albany symphony’s dogs of desire ensemble led by david alan miller, and vocal soloists annika socolofsky and john daugherty
“during these times of turbulence and uncertainty, i think back to the songwriter and political activist woody guthrie, who traveled across america with his guitar and harmonica to perform songs of hope and social justice during the great depression and world war ii. as a musical tribute to this dust bowl troubadour, i have composed this land sings: inspired by the life and times of woody guthrie, a song cycle with 17 original vocal and instrumental numbers, like a grand ole opry radio broadcast. it is my hope that this naxos recording, featuring the albany symphony’s new music ensemble dogs of desire, will remind us that music can spark greater awareness and bring about meaningful change.”
