protecting wildlife






our strategies
                to ensure people and wildlife can coexist and thrive, wcn employs three core strategies—supporting the most effective conservation partners with the funding and resources they need to protect wildlife, creating wildlife funds that provide flexible grants to a wide range of organizations that protect a specific species across its entire range, and investing in the education and career growth of rising wildlife leaders.

conservation partners
we find the best entrepreneurial organizations and invite them to receive in-depth, ongoing support by joining our network of conservation partners. we provide our partners with the financial resources, tools, and services they need to effectively protect wildlife. conservationists in our network work within local communities to find solutions that address the needs of both wildlife and people.

protecting wildlife








wildlife funds
we establish wildlife funds when we see a need and an opportunity to protect threatened wildlife across a larger landscape. by providing specific, short-term funding to projects from institutions big and small, we harness the power of multiple organizations working to save a species throughout its entire habitat. 100% of donations to wcn's wildlife funds go directly to the field, with zero overhead.

rising wildlife leaders
conservation thrives when local conservationists have the support they need to protect wildlife. we invest in these brave women and men to strengthen their skills, build their organizations, and advance their careers in conservation. through scholarships and grants, we provide support to the local people who are shaping conservation in their home countries, ensuring we have a greater and more sustainable impact for wildlife.
