welcome to innisfreeenjoy a peaceful stroll through a world-class garden in millbrook, new york.nestled on 185 acres just 90 miles north of new york city, innisfree is a quintessential american stroll garden. a remarkable synthesis of modernist and romantic ideals with chinese and japanese garden design principles, the garden harmoniously blends elements of nature with a rare sense of economy and grace.we welcome visitors to experience the beauty and tranquility of the garden from late april, when thousands of daffodils are in bloom, through early november, when the majestic fall colors reflect off the lake. throughout the year, we offer a number of special events and programs where you can learn more about the natural world as well as the cultures and art that inspired innisfree.
