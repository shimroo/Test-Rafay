welcome to the refiner's fire, a free teaching and apologetics website that urges the world to discover the joy of knowing the creater of the universe, yahweh (); his divine messiah, yeshua (); and his torah (divine instructions in righteousness without which we would have no blueprint for moral, holy living). while myriads are still stuck in "religion,"  "religiosity" and "fluffy" teachings, many are discovering a deeper relationship with god than they've ever dreamed possible - simply by awakening to the truth of yahweh/yeshua/torah as clearly outlined in the bible. (please note we have no "donate buttons" as we do not want your money!  we simply want you to gain a true understanding of elohim and his word!)
