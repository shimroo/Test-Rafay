all aboard for family fun & memories!



                    on october 19, 1872, the wilmington & western railroad opened for service, and started moving goods and passengers between the small towns and mills that lined delaware's red clay valley. since 1966, the modern-day wilmington & western has moved hundreds of thousands of kids (both young and old) along this same route. 
                

                    the wilmington & western has become one of the east coast's premier heritage railroads, and we've been consistently ranked among usatoday's 10best scenic train rides. our passengers come to meet their favorite storybook or holiday character. they come to take part in a holiday celebration, enjoy a glass of wine or pint of beer, or they climb aboard simply to enjoy a relaxing train ride with family and friends. 
                

                    we have a seat waiting for you, and from that seat, you'll see the past as never before. history will come alive, senses will be excited, and a forgotten era will be re-lived (and we think you'll make a few memories along the way)!
                

                    come and join us for good, old-fashioned family fun in delaware's historic red clay valley. all aboard!
