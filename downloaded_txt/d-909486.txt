deal or no deal uk


















welcome to donduk. a refuge for those who enjoy deal or no deal, the hit channel 4 gameshow hosted by noel edmonds. the award winning gameshow deal or no deal has become a big hit for channel 4 and marks a sensational return to our screens of noel edmonds. 
deal or no deal is enjoyed my millions of viewers daily, where the contestants battle with the banker to try and win a jackpot of £250,000. here at donduk you will find full daily reports of each show, as well deal or no deal news and specials. deal or no deal although initially appearing very simple in format of just opening a few boxes for the chance to win some big money prizes, actually has some potentially complex decisions to be made at points throughout the show, the contestants occasionally try complex or simple gameplay in an attempt to give them an edge in beating the banker.

new year - new look deal or no deal





deal or no deal has had quite a makeover for the new year, both in the look and feel of the studio, and also in the game-play.




image copyright www.dealornodeal.co.uk



as can be seen on the image above the deal or no deal studio has had quite a radical makeover and now also includes 'deal' indicator lights next to all the contestants on the wings, so they can show whether would deal at any stage during the player's game. there is also a stats board in the studio displaying the show number, and how much the banker has paid out in total.



the biggest change to the game-play for the new year is the introduction of box 23. this new box adds an extra dimension to the end of game, by giving the contestant the option of buying box 23 at the end of their game with whatever amount they have won.


box 23 is randomly filled at the start of the game by the independent adjudicator with one the following five options:

•    double
•    +£10,000
•    money back
•    half
•    nothing



as you can see, this now gives the deal or no deal contestants a potential top prize of £500,000, but does have a big downside of going home with nothing.

will anyone ever be brave or bold enough to take a chance at gambling £250,000 to potentially win £500,000?

no deal

round 2
1 - 50p mev
16 - £15,000 caerwyn

banker's offer:
£8,500

richie says that he loves the shape of this board and esher is in a really strong position here.

esher says
no deal

round 3
2 - £10,000 mahmoud
11 - £100 sam
noel goes over to the gameboard and says that it is quite an unusual board as most of the action is taking place with the middle amounts.
18 - £5 billy

banker time
the banker says that if esher plays on here and has an all-blue round her offer will sky-rocket, but an all-red round and it will plummet.

banker's offer:
£17,000

esher goes to richie for advice, and he says that the banker has summed things up really well, and this next round is so important for her. esher talks about how the money would help her so much, and enable her to take her mum away on holiday.

esher says
no deal

round 4
10 - £20,000 lamin
9 - £10 jean
noel says that the way this game is unfolding has been amazing.
19 - £1 emma

the banker says that if esher plays on the chances of her hitting one of the big reds is huge. noel talks about days when only the governor will do...

banker's offer:
£27,500

esher talks about 21 being the number of her bus, and also how her son has always told her she will win big in her game, and she also has this feeling today.

esher says
no deal

round 5
5 - £500 dean
noel asks if we dare start to dream on an all red 5-box.
17 - 1p smithy
a shout of 'yes' from noel, with lots of screams from esher.
20 - 10p laura

banker time
what about that says noel, this is one of those sensational games. esher is in tears as noel talks about the sensational board with 4 of the power 5 still in play. the banker says that the chances of esher doing what she just did is less than 2%

noel plays around with values of what the offer isn't.

banker's offer:
£60,000

richie says that is a big offer, and he has gone into his shell a bit on this board. lamin says if it was his game he would play on here.

esher says
no deal

round 6
noel talks about how everyone knows how hard esher has to work as a bus driver, and that couldn't have been easy to turn down.
12 - £250,000 sammy
the banker calls and says that once in a while someone comes along who makes you believe that they will win the £250,000, and he is now going to offer esher a lifeline

banker's offer:
£25,000

esher says
no deal

round 6 - continued
22 - £35,000 versila

the banker calls again and says he was tempted to allow esher to play on here, but now he is going to help her...

£35,000

esher says
no deal

round 6 - final box
14 - £100,000 richie

banker time with £1,000 and £75,000 remaining

this is going to be really uncomfortable now says noel, as this offer will be really teasing.

banker's offer:
£28,000

esher talks about the feeling she has about box 21, and noel says that she could ask the banker if he would offer the swap, but the banker calls and says that he won't offer the swap.

esher says
no deal

noel does a big build up before opening the box, and then the banker calls and changes his mind

banker's offer:
swap

esher says
swap

noel takes box 7 away from esher and gives her box 21

noel opens esher's box 21 and reveals £1,000

if the phone hadn't rung you would have won £75,000 says noel

sheri with box 7 contains the £75,000

sarah millican's deal or no deal game report 29/04/12 - celebrity specials





today's celebrity player is sarah millican.

we get to see a video clip of sarah millican and she talks about being on dond. she says she's a massive fan of the show and loves how it can get very tense so quickly.

noel says we'll find out about sarah's charity later on. we get introduced to the people on the wings, who are sarah's family and friends, including dond's very own warm-up guy mark olver.

sarah chooses a ball at random and it's number 7. this is the box she gets given.

round 1
sarah says box 7 feels good.
6 - karen - £15,000
20 - aemen - £5
sarah points out that she has a letterbox on her board.
16 - sarah j - £1,000
21 - victoria - £500
sarah talks about what the box openers are wearing, and noel points out simon's shirt. sarah says noel's influencing things, and noel says he'll shut up. 
8 - elaine - £1

banker time
the banker says he longs after sarah, and she says he's been flirting with her on twitter! he says this is like a love film, and we see some photoshopped photos of sarah in romantic situations with the banker's phone. the banker gets noel to go down on one knee and he proposes to sarah, and she says "no deal"!

banker's offer:
£12,000

sarah says
no deal

round 2
sarah says she's raising money for macmillan cancer support, as cancer affects so many people directly or indirectly. comedian joe lycett next, and he says sarah once did a wee in the passenger seat of his car!
3 - joe - £3,000
joe says hello to his granddad as he opens his box, and the banker rings up and says that was rude, as box-openers during the celebrity shows normally say how nice it is to meet noel!
13 - denise - £750
22 - susan - £50,000

banker time
the banker says he's going to try and appeal to the inner sarah.

banker's offer:
£15,000 + lifetime supply of banoffee pie

sarah says that pie is her favourite dessert! she wonders whether she could give the pies to charity, and the banker rings and says they're a bit dodgy as they're home-made, and they're all for sarah. 

sarah says
no deal

round 3
14 - john - £10
1 - simon - £75,000
11 - elizabeth - £35,000

banker time

banker's offer:
£10,000

sarah asks about the banoffee pie, and the banker rings and says that's off the menu, but something else is on the menu!

banker's offer:
£10,000 + one creme horn

sarah says
no deal

round 4
10 - victoria - £10,000
15 - jonathan - £100
17 - juliet - £20,000

banker time
noel says the game's swung to the banker now. he says this is a genuine attempt by the banker to get a deal.

banker's offer:
£11,000

the others tell sarah that she's always a positive thinker, and sarah says the problem is that it's not her money. she asks the audience, and only a few people think she should deal. john says she may have to go to the end if she goes on now, and the banker rings and says if she goes on, the odds of hitting the £250k are 37.5%.

sarah says
no deal

round 5
noel says this game is so finely balanced now. sarah says she feels a bit sick now!
5 - andy - £50
12 - lou - 10p
sarah chooses box 9, and the banker rings and says this box could change lives, and sarah tells him to have a heart. he says he's had a feeling all game that box 9 has the £250,000. sarah says she's sticking with box 9, and the banker rings and says on her head be it! 
9 - gary - £250,000 

banker time
the banker laughs wildly down the phone and the audience boos. he tells sarah to listen to him now.

banker's offer:
£5,500

sarah says £20,000 would be a more meaty sum for charity. the banker rings and says if sarah declines £5,500, she can open 2 boxes before the next offer. if the £100k isn't discovered, the offer will be £20,000. mark olver says what the banker's promising is really good. the banker rings back and says there's a new offer now.

banker's offer:
£9,000

the banker confirms his other promise still holds true. sarah asks the audience, and a lady in the audience says she has terminal cancer and tells sarah to go on. noel speaks to the lady and she says that sarah just playing today will have a massive impact for the charity in terms of the publicity raised for it. noel then speaks to another lady in the audience who has terminal cancer.

sarah says
no deal

round 6
2 - sally-anne - £5,000
19 - steve - 1p

banker time, as sarah didn't find the £100k

banker's offer:
£20,000

sarah talks about the sums of money, and then she lifts the phone and is surprised to hear the banker is already there! john says he'd take the money, and sarah says it'd be mortifying if she went all the way and didn't get £100k. noel asks the ladies in the audience what they think, and they say it's hard because £20k goes a long way. 

sarah says
deal

round 6 - proveout - final box
18 - mark olver - 50p

banker time with £250 and £100,000 remaining

banker's offer would've been:
£36,000

noel opens sarah's box 7 and reveals £100,000

box 4 with meg contains the £250

sarah says she thinks she made the right decision, and £20k will make a big difference.

olly murs deal or no deal game report - 22/04/12 - celebrity special





today's celebrity player is olly murs.

noel says he doesn't know why any famous face would play the game, as there are no fallbacks for the celebrities! we get to see some video footage of when olly was on deal or no deal in 2007 and won £10, followed by a rundown of what's happened to him since then!

olly says this is weird, and he swears he's done this before. olly says it wasn't a nice moment when he won the £10, and he says he applied for another tv show afterwards and he's done well for himself since! he says box 14 is his lucky number and it wasn't lucky for him last time.

olly chooses a ball at random and it's number 3, which is the box he gets. he says he played with that last time!

round 1
1 - nathan - £500
olly says he had a strategy last time but it was horrendous!
15 - rupert - 1p 
7 - lou - £1
22 - joshua? - £5
13 - lee - £75,000

banker time
olly wonders if the banker's got grumpy in his old age, and the banker says he's listening to a joe mcelderry album. he says he thought olly was a baritone, but he turned out to be a tenor/tenner! the banker shows a clip of olly's walk of wealth from 2007, and he says noel looked like einstein back then.

banker's offer:
£8,500

olly says it's too early in the game to deal.

olly says
no deal

round 2
noel says he can't say "only here once" again because olly's back! olly says his chosen charity is brainwave, and they help children with brain injuries and development delay. 
5 - james h - £250,000 
katie next, and she reveals she's olly's digital manager and also works with one direction and jls! the banker rings and asks if she can get autographs, and he screams down the phone when she says she can. 
1 - katie - £50
olly chooses his dad next, and he says olly first expressed his desire to be a singer when he was a child. he then gets his sister fay to do their chicken dance!
4 - pete - £100

banker time
the banker says the £10 is winking at him. 

banker's offer:
£1,000

everyone boos the offer, and olly says it wasn't a great offer. the banker says he'd have offered more, but he tweeted olly yesterday and he didn't reply! noel then says it was katie's job to ensure he replied, and the banker rings and says jls and one direction tweeted him yesterday. 

olly says
no deal

round 3
21 - sarah - £1,000
olly goes for his aunt rachael next, and he tells a story of how embarrassing she was when she met robbie williams at the x factor!
9 - rachael - £750
noel talks about olly's success since he appeared on the x factor. olly asks when noel's birthday is and he says 22/12, but box 22 has already gone, so he chooses box 12.
12 - lee h - £20,000

banker time
the banker winds olly up about how he could win £10 again.

banker's offer:
£4,010

olly says
no deal

round 4
6 - ben - £5,000
17 - james m - £10,000
2 - kirk - 10p

banker time
the banker talks about the £10 still being on the board!

banker's offer:
£10,010

noel says that's the top of the game so far. olly says he really doesn't want to win a low amount for his charity. the banker rings and tells olly not to go on, as he's the patron of the charity and they might sack him as patron! olly wonders what the chances are of knocking out the top values in the next round, and he says he's done it before.

olly says
no deal

round 5
noel talks about the banker's fixation with the £10, and he comments on how nervous olly is. the banker rings and says the last time olly played, this was the round where he took out the top 3!
20 - john p - £100,000
8 - darren - £50,000
"not again" says olly! the banker rings and says this game is so 2007, and it's going to happen again. olly's sister fay tells him to stop focussing on the game he had before.
16 - ryan - £15,000

banker time
the banker laughs manically down the phone, and offers some special olly murs cheesy nibbles! he says he doesn't envy olly's position at all now.

banker's offer:
£2,010

the banker says he's had fun at olly's expense, but he recognises that olly has always been complimentary about his previous time on dond. he says if olly says no deal, he'll let olly go on one box at a time.

olly says
no deal

round 6 - box 1
olly says he's reluctant to go for box 14 as it had £10 in before.
19 - emma - £3,000

banker time
the banker says that almost made it worse.

banker's offer:
£3,010

olly says he thinks it's worth one more risk.

olly says
no deal

round 6 - box 2
18 - ricky - £35,000

banker time
olly says he can't believe it, and the banker laughs wildly down the phone. 

banker's offer:
£25 + dvd of groundhog day

olly says
no deal

round 6 - box 3
olly says he feels physically sick!
14 - faye - £250

banker time with 50p and £10 remaining...

noel wonders if this is the greatest magic trick ever, and he says the banker can hardly breathe as he's laughing so much!

banker's offer:
£2.99

olly says he honestly can't believe it, and noel says he can't either. he says he feels he's let his charity down, and noel says the publicity the charity has received makes up for the bad game.

olly says
no deal

banker's offer:
swap

olly says he swapped last time.

olly says
no swap

noel says he's seen some unbelievable coincidences on this show, and this would be one of the biggest if olly wins £10 again.

noel opens olly's box 3 and olly wins 50p for his charity.

box 11 with jeff contains the £10

noel says if olly had swapped again, he'd have won £10 again!

olly says he hopes people donate to the charity after the game today.

olly sings to finish the show...
