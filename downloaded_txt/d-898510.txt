rooster fishing
a very special day on the water is targeting the elusive “gallo” or roosterfish! using spinning gear and trolling live bait along shore just behind the waves, take a chance to catch that fish of a lifetime; known for it’s power and great fighting, the roosterfish is one of the crowning jewels for anglers to catch along the costa brava!.

fly fishing
a lifetime achievement for any fly caster is hooking into and fighting a 6 foot sailfish or marlin! we use a teaser method to bring the fish up to the boat, and the rest is up to you and your skill as a fly fisherman. we recommend a 12wt to 14wt fly rod for this species with plenty of nylon backing! ask us about special flys you might want to bring along for your big game flyfishing adventure.
