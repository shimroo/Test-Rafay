production line engineering
at badger scale we’re more than certified scale technicians. we’re qualified engineers that regularly work with manufacturing plant engineers and quality managers to design optimal weighing systems for your production line. our engineers customize scales to your line that include automatic data processing and collection, feedback loops and customized inline checkweighers.
our engineers have years of experience to help your team design & implement systems tailored to your company’s needs.





installation
from large truck scales to light capacity floor scales & food scales, badger scale installs the most precise equipment. our systems are designed for weighing accuracy and include cutting-edge data connectivity & computer system integration. save time by contacting us early in your production line design so our engineers can work with you to design the most efficient system.





inspection & calibration
our technicians provide routine preventative maintenance for your industrial scale systems to avoid future breakdowns and protect your bottom line. many iso standards require yearly calibration of weighing systems. badger scale routinely makes on-site visits to our customers to calibrate scales. unlike other companies, we also go the extra mile to inspect each piece of equipment, making sure everything looks right in the future. 





certifications
badger scale is fully accredited with the latest iso, fda and osha standards. we design specialized scales to be used in food processing plants, manufacturing factories, and bio and chemical laboratories. specialized scale features include sanitation-ready, corrosion-resistant, spark-resistant, lightning immune and waterproof. our technicians know all the osha standards and will arrive on-site with the required safety equipment & precautions.
