new mexicans for science and reason

what really happened in roswell, new mexico in 1947? are
there "hidden messages" from god encoded in the torah? is the
government of the united states spraying deadly chemicals on its
citizens? is the earth just 10,000 years old?
if you wonder what new mexico's scientists are saying about these
and other questions, you've come to the right site!
