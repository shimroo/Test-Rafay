what makes us different
dedicated to serving our community
on october 18, 1984, the rossberg family opened the doors of torrance bakery to the public. with only 1200 square feet of space and 7 dedicated employees, we set out to serve the people of south bay the freshest, most delicious cakes and pastries in town. the people of south bay took quite a shine to us, for over time the bakery became a city favorite and kept growing in order to give its customers the best products and service. today, torrance bakery serves the south bay from two locations with a total of 14,000 square feet, 78 employees, a separate wedding cake showroom and a sandwich shop.
