christ our centercentered in the love of god and led by the reverend molly blythe teichert, we welcome a broad spectrum of perspectives and ministry interests, and we strengthen our bonds of faith and friendship. we support each other as we grapple with the pandemic and everyday choices we must make to keep christ at the center of our lives.
















children our blessingwhile most presbyterian churches are rapidly aging, ccpc is an exception. we have a special calling to nurture the faith of children and youth, and to include them in every aspect of our church life.we are called to reach out and invite the young families in our neighborhood who have no faith affiliation to come to ccpc. we support parents, grandparents, and mentors in raising spiritually healthy children and youth.
