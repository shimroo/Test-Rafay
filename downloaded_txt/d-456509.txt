what people are saying

 

“as an abandonment survivor, i recommend susan’s work to those in the thick of despair. in the days i was at my worst, i remember reading the journey from abandonment to healing, and it was the first time i felt understood, less alone, and with a road map out of the depths of despair. i am forever grateful and continue to follow her work.”— toni kohn

 

“if there can be a pill for heartbreak of rejection, this book [journey from abandonment to healing] may be it.”— rabbi harold kusher, author of when bad things happen to good people



“every sentence [in taming your outer child] was a new insight.”— susan peabody, author of addiction to love

 

“the abandonment recovery workbook is a life-saver. it has a full arsenal of tools and steps to get your life back and heal your wounds.”— anon














people who have followed the program say…



“thank you for writing taming your outer child.  i have read many self-help books, looking for solutions to my abandonment issues that have plagued every romantic relationship of mine since childhood, and your book provided lightbulb moments and glimpses of clarity.  i appreciate your researching and writing on this issue and identifying the outer child.  your book has provided me with hope for change.”— c.l

 

“i came to susan when i felt my world was falling apart. not only is she an empathetic and warm presence, but she completely understands abandonment from inside out. it has been invaluable to have someone articulate and validate the turbulence that comes with abandonment and to do so from a place of expertise and compassion.”— anon



“the journey from abandonment to healing" was a game-changer for me!  now i can recognize why i'm triggered, and i have a process of self-care that allows me to navigate just about anything with internal compassion and strength!  deep gratitude to you, susan!”—lyn g.

 

“the journey from abandonment to healing is the book that changed my life forever. i can now understand my patterns, what created them and how to fix them from the root. it is just what it says - a journey. i’m still on mine. but the birth of mine started with this book. thank you.”— katrisha gibbs














what susan says“surviving a loss of love brings you on a journey to the center of the self, where a molten core of primal emotion simmers.  the program helps you redirect this energy toward building a healthy new relationship with yourself, and increasing your capacity for love and connection: akēru.
