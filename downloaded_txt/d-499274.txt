....helping restore the earth






 



we strive to produce quality native plants that will attract birds,
                 butterflies & other pollinators to your garden. we also produce larval plants to
                  provide food for these butterflies. we believe that we can do this with environmentally
                   friendly methods without using dangerous or systemic pesticides.

changing of the guard
 
dear
friends, we would like to let you know that as of march 20, 2024, pine ridge
gardens native plant nursery has transferred ownership and management. after 32
years at the helm, founder maryann king has sold the business to brent baker.
the nursery will eventually be relocated to brentâs property south of
dardanelle, ar, but the new facilities arenât quite ready yet, so for a while
he is continuing to operate at the former location on maryannâs property north
of london, ar. announcements will be made via the website and email once the
physical move is completed. please bear with us as we work through this
transition, as there may be a few kinks to be worked out, and as the transfer
has come right at the start of the busy spring season for the nursery. brent is currently reachable at pineridgegardens@gmail.com. the
official phone number for the business is changing to 479-970-9143.
 
a note
from brent:
 
for
those who donât already know me, some background:
i am a
dardanelle native and a 7th generation arkansawyer. i have had a
love for plants since as long as i can remember. i came by it naturally, with
numerous plant-enthusiast family members with various extensive flower and
vegetable gardens and houseplant collections. i was still single digit in age
when i first began growing my own houseplants with starts from my motherâs
houseplant collection. i would also dig and relocate random plants growing on
our propertyâ¦just becauseâ¦i didnât even know what some of them were at the
time. my first ever career dream was to work in a plant nursery!
 
later,
in college at the university of central arkansas, while working toward my
bachelorâs degree in environmental science, i had the great fortune of taking
plant taxonomy with dr. don culwell. i was beyond hooked! learning the latin
names of plants and how to identify native and naturalized plants around me
felt like my calling, so much so that the following semester when i was missing
that activity terribly, i began a special project under dr. culwellâs
mentorship, working on an inventory of the flora of yell county, which i later
expanded to include scott county and parlayed into a masterâs thesis for my
graduate degree in biology with a botany emphasis.
 
meanwhile,
shortly after graduating with my bachelorâs degree (21 years ago!), i took the
master gardener training course and learned about maryann and pine ridge
gardens from a classmate. i couldnât wait to schedule a visit and before the
visit was over, i had a job (âprobationary,â as i recall)! well, i worked
nearly full time for maryann for almost a year until i started grad school.
over the years since, i have helped at the nursery now and again and would
delight in bringing maryann seeds when i had the opportunity to collect some.
it was a blessing to be able to work alongside maryann and soak in her vast
knowledge of native plant propagation. maryann also introduced me to the
arkansas native plant society, in which i became an active member and have
served in several officer positions, as well as to the ozark chapter of the
society, for the which the fall retreat with maryann and the other members
became a cherished annual event.
 
after
graduating with my masterâs degree, i became involved with the arkansas
vascular flora project and co-edited the atlas of the vascular plants of
arkansas. even before the atlas was completed, though, i landed a
position as a botanist with the arkansas natural heritage commission, working
with the esteemed arkansas (and now southeastern) botanist and ecologist, theo
witsell. i also served as the anhc herbarium collections manager during my over
twelve years with the agency.
 
although
i loved my work at the anhc and still strongly support the agencyâs purpose and
mission, life events led to a great deal of reflection and reassessment. i kept
circling back to my first childhood dream. at the same time, maryann was
pondering the future of pine ridge gardens. it seemed like fate and so we
started planning and working toward this transition. that was a couple of years
ago, and some of you may be aware, some major hurdles kept delaying things on
my end. although at times it was very discouraging, i choose now to look at it
as a test to strengthen my resolve and give me more time to work closely with
maryann, hopefully setting me up for an even more successful nursery career!
 
i thank
maryann profoundly for her friendship, guidance, patience, and faith in my
ability and dedication to take the reins of pine ridge gardens, her pride and
joy. i am grateful and honored for the opportunity to carry on her legacy of
providing a wide variety of quality native plants for your home gardens,
businesses, schools, and agencies, and of supporting and fostering the
burgeoning native plant industry and the native plant enthusiast and
conservation communities!
 
a note
from maryann:
 
i want
to thank everyone for your support during the past 32 years.  as many of you will understand, this is a
bittersweet time for me.  however, i can
feel good about someone as knowledgeable as brent taking over the reins of pine
ridge gardens.  he will continue to be
dedicated to growing the best native plants available.  i know you will continue to support him as he
undertakes the huge job of transporting prg to his location south of
dardanelle.
 
sincerely,
maryann
king and brent baker
