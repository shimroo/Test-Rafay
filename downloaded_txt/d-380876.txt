fantastic finish (colour looks stunning in daylight, and at night - my wife loves it too, haha!), completly quiet single coils from emg (no hum at all!), nice action, bass was set-up near perfectly right from the shop (i only needed to correct a little the truss rod), works buttery smooth, no problem at all with it. satin neck - checked, strings - i'm rather a flatwounds guy, but man, these are the best roundowunds i had, hands down! the only downside is maybe, that the bass is rather on the heavy side for me, but not that much to bother. go and buy it! oh, i should add - service via mail is also excellent. i got all the answers to my questions before buying. top!
