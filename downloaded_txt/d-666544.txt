exciting news! after 
experiencing minor 
hurricane damage to 
the customer entrance, 
we are thrilled to 
announce that we can 
finally reopen our 
doors. we were 
incredibly fortunate, 
unlike some of the 
properties nearby, and 
we are grateful for 
your patience and 
support during this 
time. like everyone in 
this area it took days 
to recover power, then 
phone service, and 
finally drinking water. 
we look forward to 
welcoming you back!
