researching the masters, smith,
    bowers, hull & beaty families.   the
    joint labor of hundreds of family members over many years
    have contributed to this data.   my efforts,
    from 1987 to 1991, was to collect and organize this information into
    published books. 
the
    active portion of our work ended with the publication of our books, however
    with the advent of the internet a new potential now exists, as evidenced by
    your viewing this page.   i hope you find the material useful.
supplies
    of books for the families mentioned have been depleted however copies are
    available at various libraries scattered throughout the united
    states.  check the public libraries to
    determine locations in 25 states and the district of columbia.
