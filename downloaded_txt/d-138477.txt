jg k. ‘26 
when it comes to spaces to learn, develop, and grow as a human, campbell hall is not only one of the most supportive and loving places, but also communities.













alumnus angel santiago ’21
campbell hall teachers are amazing - every teacher cares about you and is invested in your growth by supporting you any way they can. i feel accepted and encouraged by them on the daily.













kelly d. '93 | alumna, parent of alumni
i was lucky to have been educated at campbell hall for 13 years, giving me a solid foundation to build upon. the campus and community were always my second home and to come back as a parent was a dream come true.













wondwossen d. | current parent
campbell hall has an unrivaled focus on the overall well-being of the child, both academically and spiritually, with a commitment to community and genuine interest in developing future leaders that are smart, kind, and compassionate.













mini tharakkal | middle school assistant principal, 7th grade science teacher
i absolutely love the sense of community and camaraderie at campbell hall. i see this among students, faculty and staff, and parents as well.













spicer emge ‘14 | alumnus
campbell hall is really invested in creating people who are thoughtful and empathetic. they put that care into every student.
