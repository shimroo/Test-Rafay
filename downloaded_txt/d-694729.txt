the conservation history association of texas welcomes you to the texas legacy project, an online archive of video, audio, text, and other materials collected through interviews and correspondence with the people who have shaped and continue to influence the protection of texas natural resources.
texas is unique in its vast diversity of land and resources, and in the variety of the conservationists who have sought to protect the state. the conservationists involved in this project include farmers, ranchers,  politicians,  landowners, citizen advocates, journalists, medical doctors, environmental attorneys, engineers, agency officials, and others from every region of the state.

the goal of collecting these materials is to document and recognize the many contributions of texans toward conservation of the state’s resources and protection of her citizens’ health. we hope that the people, lives, and works chronicled here will inform, encourage, and inspire both old and new conservationists in texas and elsewhere.
we urge you to also consider visiting three sister sites prepared and hosted by the conservation history association of texas:
one linked website is texaslandscape.org, a look at conservation history in the state through the lens of “place”, using a variety of maps describing stories about land, water, wildlife, energy, air quality and the built world.
a second related website is texasnotebook.org, a collection of drawings of the state’s mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and plants, posted as a reminder of the love of nature’s beauty and variety that has driven so much conservation work over the years.
and the third site is texasfauna.org, a compilation of audio interviews and literature references about texas  environmental history, viewed through the evolution of our relationship with our fellow creatures.
