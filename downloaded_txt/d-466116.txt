	 winds of change
	 
    


the other day, my brother kilborn the cat disappeared. this is a big problem since he has been consistently providing me on a daily basis with dessert (from his rear end).now, this weird looking dog truman has showed up.  first, he just started hanging out.next, the carrier he arrived in disappeared and this crate appeared a few feet from mine.don't get me wrong, he's cool and all (despite his huge nose), but i'm a little confused as to his status.

	 tired puggy
	 
    


how tired a pug is is directly proportional to how far its tongue hangs out.(my mouth is not open in this picture.)

	 foot binding
	 
    


as much as i try to pretend that i'm french, in the end, a pug's native roots are in china.  in the spirit of my heritage, my parents thought it'd be fun to bind my feet.  i guess this makes me more sexually attractive, so i'm willing to go through the process if it means some future hot action with that shih-tzu downstairs.

	 hot date!
	 
    


last weekend, isabelle's parents went on vacation.that meant that i got to spend some quality time with my princess.i get all crazy whenever i see her and i tend to show off by yelping and running in figure 8's while dragging my butt on the ground.she apparently was eager to see me as well. she had gotten a new haircut, i assume, just for me.so i marked the neighborhood, thus proving that i'm the man around here, and she reciprocated by letting me sniff her butt.

	 staying cool
	 
    


it's tough having a shortened palate in the summer. i haven't stopped panting in days. it's always nice to cool down with a shower though. especially with pug shampoo.

	 special dinner
	 
    


dad came home the other day and put a crispy fish burrito on the table in front of the couch. he then left to take a shower. i could only assume this meant it was mine. i had a little trouble opening the wrapper, but mmm mmm mmm was it good!!!

	 party animal
	 
    


last night, isabelle's dad had a birthday party. while i tried multiple times to enter the house to say hi to my on-again-off-again girl, i remained relegated to the patio.there i found beer.i was lucky enough to find a human to help a pug out.

	 the great pug run
	 
    


sometimes dad takes me on walks. other times he takes me on runs. in my youth, i was a long distance runner - the only pug i know of who's run a 10k in under 50 minutes. since turning 21 (3 in human years) i'm just into 100 yard dashes. but as the link above shows, i still gotz da skillz.

	 carlos
	 
    


at first i thought my dad was trying to throw me off by bringing a mirror on our morning walk. but upon careful testing, i noticed that the "image" wasn't mimicking my motions. it was in fact, carlos!i hadn't seen carlos for a few months so i figured i ought to remind him, by marking various objects, that the entire neighborhood was my turf. i'm not sure though if his subsequent markings were acknowledgement or annexation.

wow, it's been almost a month since my last post! while dad would like to play it off with this picture as me just "being on vacation," the real reason was that he was hogging the computer. sorry about the wait.
