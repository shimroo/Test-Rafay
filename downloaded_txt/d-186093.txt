welcome to hawaiianrainbow.com
 your home for hawaiian music on the internet
we play mostly traditional hawaiian music, meaning mostly in hawaiian language. hawaiian music includes chanting, music for hula dancing, the telling of stories, to communicate genealogy and mythology. while hawaiian music is relatively simple in melody and rhythm, it is complex and rich in poetry, as well as vocal styles. combine hawaiian music with a hula dancer to interpret the story, and you have one of the most beautiful cultural art forms in the world.
hawaiianrainbow.com is one of the most popular internet hawaiian radio stations. hawaiian music streaming – broadcasting hawaiian internet radio since 1999, this station has now grown to have almost 100,000 listeners per month in 150 countries around the world. i can only thank you for that. i’m glad you found hawaiian rainbow, and i hope you’ll tell your friends!
