						i came to see dr. rose last week for a breast augmentation procedure. the staff and meeting about everything made me feel super comfortable and i couldn’t wait for the op. when i took the bandages off the next day i was pleasantly surprised. i plan on other procedures in my near future and will definitely see dr. rose again.

						words can not express how satisfied i am with my “mommy makeover” from dr. rose at utopia plastic surgery. the experience from the time i entered the door for my initial consultation, to my surgery day, to the follow up appointments, was beyond my expectations. dr. rose and his staff took the time to answer all of my questions and really made me feel comfortable with the decisions i chose to make. after having 3 children, i chose to have a breast lift & augmentation, tummy tuck, and targeted liposuction. dr. rose’s lifetime experience, attention detail, artistry and technique were extremely evident in my results. i couldn’t be more thrilled with my new body and i would highly recommend dr. rose and utopia plastic surgery to anyone looking for top notch plastic surgery results.

						i just had surgery 6 weeks ago and i’m so happy that i chose dr.rose . i recently  had liposuction, breast implants and rhinoplasty and i can’t stop looking at myself my waist is smaller, stomach is flat, my nose is so cute and natural. i still look like myself but better then i ever have. also my implants look so natural i can’t believe how good they look! i couldn’t ask for more thankyou so much to dr. rose and his friendly staff.

						can't say enough good things about dr. rose and his staff.  the ladies there are all friendly and extremely professional.  brooke is absolutely amazing at injections and a true artist.  the surgery i had with dr. rose went better than planned.  the healing was virtually painless and dr. rose   answer all my questions regarding any concerns i had very thoroughly and made me feel extremely comfortable.  going into surgery i knew i was in the best hands with dr. rose and his team and his after care reaffirmed my thoughts.
