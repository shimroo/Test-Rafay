about moment in time photography












































i came to plymouth to study photography at plymouth college of art and design, way back in the late 70’s, and never left!  it is a beautiful place to live so close to the sea and moors.
i started moment in time photography when my daughters started school and have run the business from the studio for over 25 years. in the early years i specialised in weddings, photographing hundreds of weddings  and even the second weddings for two previous brides and two grooms!
the girls now have their own families and i now spend most of my time photographing babies , children and families in the studio.
the studio is set in a pretty terrace of shops on the border of peverell and mannamead areas of plymouth, a mile or two from the city centre and the a38 with free on street parking outside. thorn park and mutley park are just a stones throw from my back gate and can be included in a shoot.
the studio has a large selection of backgrounds and props and will hold up to 15 people. larger groups can be photographed as several groups and joined together!
i have a reception/viewing area where you can see the photographs from your portrait session on the large tv screen, select your favourite images and design your wall art.
