my infirst story








                                   
    i must take a moment to share how much i appreciate the professionalism and promptness bestowed by nazmon. this is the second time i had the pleasure of working with nazmon on a vehicle loan request. nazmon is highly responsive and member-centric. she provided sound advice about comparing vehicle packages and seeking multiple offers. because of her advice, the dealership actually offered me a better proposal. nazmon stayed the course, even after hours, to ensure my loan was completed and the dealership received all requested information before the weekend. she communicated with me every step of the way. i am thankful that superior member service still exists in this world because of individuals like nazmon. she is not only an expert in her craft, she humanizes the challenging process of obtaining financing.

   thank you for everything you do to always help me, with a smile, kealin! i never feel that my requests are a bother to you, and that is exactly what great member service is all about.

    i wanted to take a moment to compliment kevin young, who assisted me today at the branch at 5005 melrose avenue in roanoke virginia. kevin handled my issue efficiently and with great member service.  i am a member of a credit union in florida which is part of the co-op, and am in virginia visiting family.  after experiencing issues trying to complete a mobile deposit, i reached out to my member services line.  the member services representative suggested that i visit one of your branches for assistance, and i'm glad that i did.  kevin made a stressful situation so much better, and i am grateful.  i appreciate the way your branch treated a customer who is not even a member of your credit union.

    i wanted to take a moment to bring to your attention the exemplary service of ms. arllet vega martinez! ms. martinez went above and beyond to assist me in such a manner i was able to complete the process in an extremely short time. at every step, she informed me of the process and what to expect, and assisted me when needed. the experience just reaffirmed to me that i had made the right choice in placing my trust in infirst credit union. i hope you will convey to her my great appreciation for her assisting me through this loan process. truly remarkable!

    i wanted to share the most excellent experience my husband and i had working with ms. kyte to obtain a personal loan.  we have always had a great experience with infirst, but this time it was especially great.  from start to finish, she made the process of obtaining our loan fast and easy.  she kept us updated every step of the way and advised us when needed.  she was friendly, patient, and knowledgeable.  we never dreamed the process could be done so efficiently and quickly!
