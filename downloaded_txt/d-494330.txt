celiac disease research
through ongoing research and clinical trials, the center is helping health care professionals to recognize celiac disease and helping patients with celiac disease to better manage their symptoms.
center scientists are working to develop a cure and an alternative treatment to the gluten-free diet. in addition, the center is investigating possible links between celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases.
center currently recruiting newborns to study celiac disease
the center for celiac research and treatment at mgfc is currently recruiting for an exciting research study known as the cdgemm study. newborns and infants who have a first-degree relative (father, mother or sibling) with diagnosed celiac disease are eligible to participate. this multi-center effort is aimed at identifying patterns in gut bacteria that may one day be able to predict and/or prevent the onset of celiac disease.
a 14-day gluten challenge research study
what happens to a celiac patient if or when they are re-exposed to gluten? researchers are uncovering answers through a number of initiatives, including exposing study participants to gluten during a 14-day challenge. the center is enrolling patients ages 18 to 75 with biopsy-proven celiac disease who have been on a gluten-free diet for at least 6 months. participation includes six visits over 15 weeks.
