a knight's prayer

my lord, i am ready on the threshold of this new day to go forth armed 
with thy power, seeking adventure on the high road, to right wrong, to overcome 
evil, to suffer wounds and endure pain if need be, but in all things to serve 
thee bravely, faithfully, joyfully that at the end of the day's labor, kneeling 
for thy blessing, thou mayest find no blot upon my shield. this i ask through 
jesus christ our lord , who livest and reignest with god the father in unity 
with the holy ghost, for all ages of ages. amen.
 -from chester cathedral, england
founded in the year 1092
 
 
  
  
we will never forget this day,
nor the souls lost at the hands of our enemies.
it is we the people of the united states
that defy them, and we stand united
god bless america

the boomerang barb
yes, it was the sixties, and even the 191st had an 
underground newspaper.  while the barb infuriated some, it garnered a lot 
of laughs from the unit as a whole.  no matter what you may have thought 
about it, this is a piece of boomerang history.  while there were four 
issues of the barb run off on a mimeograph machine someplace, only one issue has 
come to this webmaster.  since the quality of the original was so poor 
after all these years, john crossman took the time to reconstruct this issue, 
and pass it along.   thanks, john.
