see what people are saying...i was very impressed with the entire process. cory has a wealth of information and a clear passion for this work. it was 100% worth the investment. as a trainer, i was enthused to hear all the wisdom cory had regarding my own physiologies, relationship to riding. i learned tips that will help my triathlon performance- and of course, my bike fit is on point. never felt more comfortable riding. would definitely recommend seeing cory for a bike fit if you are a triathlete.kyle v - grand rapids, milearn more
