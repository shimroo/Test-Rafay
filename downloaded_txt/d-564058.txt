co-op happenings....





the co-op has been quite active lately, its time for the blog to catch up.  last night we held our fall general membership meeting at the westcott cinema.  we screened the movie black gold. over 60 members enjoyed good conversation, locally grown popcorn, fair trade coffee, a eye opening documentary, and a chance to nominate themselves for the board of directors.  co-op member stefanie noble decided she was going to throw her hat in the ring nominate herself for one of the open positions.  more information about the election will be available soon.  on sunday night we held our 2nd annual harvest dinner at bc restaurant.  a big thanks to the farmers who participated, the folks who came for the farmers food and the bill collins of bc for preparing a wonderful meal.

cheese of the day: morbier (moor-bee-ay)a rich semi-soft cheese that tastes of nuts and fruit with an aroma of freshly-mowed hay. morbier is named after the french town of its origin.historically the producers of the cheese would cover the curd at night with ash inorder to preserve the moisture. the next morning the makers would thenadd a fresh batch of curd to the top of the ash and let age. morbier was then completed.  an excellent selection for either a table cheese or melting on breads.matthew the srfc cheese guy.

write to the new leaf





lets keep the conversation going.  post replys to this blog, write letters to the new leaf (our newsletter), talk to the staff.  the thing that seperates us from other stores that sell similar products is the fact that we are a cooperative.  lets celebrate the challange that presents to us, lets cooperate!
