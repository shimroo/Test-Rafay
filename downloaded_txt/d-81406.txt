welcome to the ihtfp gallery!

	the ihtfp gallery is dedicated to documenting the history
	of hacking at mit.

	the word
	hack at mit
	usually refers to a clever, benign, and "ethical" prank or practical joke,
	which is both challenging for the perpetrators and amusing to
	the mit community (and sometimes even the rest of the world!).
	note that this has nothing to do with computer (or phone) hacking (which we
        call "cracking").
	(more about the ihtfp gallery and 
	faq.)

      1997 are missing write-ups and photos, but we're working on
      improving this.  the
      timeline from 1997-present should be up-to-date, so please let
      us know if we're missing anything from it.
