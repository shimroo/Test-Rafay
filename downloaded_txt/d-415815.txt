doug cleveland




for doug cleveland it began at westboro speedway in 
					1975."first race of the season, said doug, "being a 
					rookie i started in the back of the pack and in the feature 
					i saw a hole that didn't end up being totally there and i 
					ripped the rear end out of the car. that was a pretty rough 
					track but i loved it."it's been a lifelong love 
					affair with nema from then on for the entire cleveland clan 
					with doug racing his own equipment for much of that time, 
					supported by brothers, uncles, girlfriends, and wife linda, 
					to whom doug proposed to at a nema banquet.his first 
					win came in 1977 driving for jim o'brien in st. pie, quebec.
and then it was over 16,800 days before the next one at 
					lee usa. he didn't have to wait as long for the next at 
					waterford this year. two end of season races."lee is 
					actually the better track for me," said doug. "waterford 
					seems to me like over the years i've had some decent runs 
					but never as good as i had this day. the strange thing is 
					the last two races that i've won i almost didn't really want 
					to go. we got there late both times. we got a good parking 
					spot both times. this time i got there late enough so i 
					couldn't make the first practice. i didn't have tires. 
					(bobby) seymour was out in indiana so i was going through my 
					pile of tires and i picked out the best ones i had. so they 
					were all used tires except for my right rear for the day 
					because peter valeri came over and said 'i understand you 
					might need a right rear tire.' i said 'well yeah, i do, what 
					do you want for it?' he said, 'go out and win.'"i 
					won my heat, walked over to him with a little trophy and 
					said 'i'm halfway there.' after the feature when i won it i 
					went over to him and said, 'i did what you asked! thank 
					you!'"towards the end of the race (paul) scally was 
					right there and he got inside me going down the backstretch 
					and actually got ahead of me but as we were coming out of 
					the corner i kinda squeezed him down and he had to back out. 
					i saw randy at the end of the straight away and i caught up 
					to him and slowed down in the corner to use him as a pick. 
					that's how i ended up winning it by two car lengths."
he won, as usual, with a car of his own making.
					"i bent the tubing, welded the tubing, made all the 
					suspension points, made a lot of the suspension parts. i try 
					to use whatever i can in the house and the garage instead of 
					going out and spending money on it."one time i needed 
					something to turn my fuel on and off right out at my 
					injectors and i was trying to figure out how to do it. i 
					found a curtain rod holder and made that work."a 
					mopar engine powered him to his last two victories. "i've 
					had help with this one through john andruk from circle 
					performance. i go down to his shop and he helps me out, but 
					i basically did the original mopar and i'm pretty much using 
					all those parts."i like the quickness of the car, 
					it's a small enough car so i can continue to work on it."
what's next for this nema legend?"two years ago 
					i was thinking of retiring, said doug "and every time i get 
					to that point i end up with a win, so i guess i'm going for 
					another season."i'm like a block of cheese. i just 
					get better with age."

gene and marilyn angelillo were, for decades, the 
					backbone of nema. starting in 1983 gene amassed 107 wins and 
					14 owner's championships. he also was president of the club 
					for several years with marilyn serving as secretary. the 
					majority of his success came with drew fornoro, with joey 
					payne, jr. and russ stoehr also winning championships for 
					him. racing royalty drove gene's cars, including the late 
					ted christopher, who won for him at waterford, jimmy 
					broderick, a waterford champion, and joe gosek, a classic 
					winner at oswego.
they were a perfect partnership in 
					nema and in life. if gene was the stern dad of nema, marilyn 
					was the den mother, looking out for everyone, and every now 
					and then keeping gene in line (not an easy task)!

gene's legacy transcends more than nema. along with way he 
					picked up an ardc championship, and his #45 dumo's desire 
					midget raced everywhere from florida to arizona. gene had 
					the means to field almost any type of race car, even on a 
					national level, but his heart was forever with nema and the 
					midgets.
while their accomplishments in nema are well 
					noted, their devotion to family was paramount in their 
					lives. if anyone could mellow gene, it was his grandkids. 
					marilyn and gene absolutely adored daughter laura, and 
					grandkids tiana, cami, and brooke. marilyn left us in 2007, 
					gene in 2010. laura kept the team going for one more year, 
					winning a last championship for gene and marilyn with russ 
					stoehr.winner of over 100 races, drew fornoro was a 
					9-time champion in the northeastern midget association 
					(nema) and raced 3/4 midgets, midgets and sprint cars 
					throughout the country. he was inducted into the national 
					midget auto racing hall of fame in 2017 and the new england 
					auto racers hall of fame in 2013. despite his 
					significant accomplishments in racing, drew's personality 
					was even bigger! he loved interacting with his fans after 
					the races, always a huge smile and kind word. he also loved 
					to orchestrate cookouts in the pits for all of the race 
					teams to enjoy. he held epic events at home during the 
					summer for his extended family and close friends. drew 
					passed on in may of 2023.
