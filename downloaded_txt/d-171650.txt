parent engagement at creative o  preschoolers' bay




our achievement
creative o is grateful to many supporters for their words of acknowledgment and encouragement


we were impressed at the way the teachers integrate the learning of languages, math, science and values into their lessons. the children were also provided many opportunities to develop and apply their creativity in their play and structured work. 
- edmund lim w k, principal of huamin primary school
there is so much love in the school environment and children are always encouraged to ask questions. when my children go into primary three, they have no problem at all with science because they learnt to do experiments at the tender age of five.
