brooklyn free school is beginning a new chapter



brooklyn free school is making a new radical shift. bfs is pausing its operation as a 5 day a week free school, to reflect and secure its legacy. it will share lessons and develop new infrastructure that supports both its social justice mission and ongoing financial sustainability, while offering classes, programming, and trainings that support teachers, homeschoolers, and small schools interested in making space for student voice and developing a anti-racist and liberatory pedagogy. for more information please contact jade@brooklynfreeschool.org.
