what some current pupillometer users have to say about the device:

 
"i work in a busy neurosciences community hospital. pupillometers are a must in icu's which care for neurologic critically ill patients. not only it eliminates the guessing game about pupillary size and reaction, but also guides therapy and affects management. in the setting of increased intracranial pressure, the pupil goes through a series of changes not visible to the naked eye or the penlight before it dilates and becomes unreactive. this brief period is critical to pick up and act upon. 
furthermore, many of our patients are comatose and or sedated with an unreliable neurologic exam. the pupillometer is particularly helpful in such settings. i can think of many cases where the pupillometer made a big difference in my practice"moussa f. yazbeck, md, president-society of critical care medicine northern ca chapter, neurocritical care unit, john muir medical center, walnut creek, ca“automated pupillary assessments with the pupillometer has truly revolutionized how we care for the critically ill in our neuro icu. device integration allows our pupillometer data to effortlessly auto-upload into our emr. this allows nurses to spend less time charting and more time providing patient care. the pupillometer provides accurate, reliable and objective pupillary reactivity measurements that we can trend just like any other vital sign."alex c. wilkie rn, bsn, ccrn, clinical specialist, university of california- irvine (uci) medical center, orange, ca“we have 14 units in our 14 bed neuro icu, and the nurses love them. it is part of their routine assessment, and has revolutionized the care of our patients. it is a staple of our evaluations for every patient, and is particularly helpful in patients with tbi, cardiac arrest, malignant edema and brain death.”david m greer, md, ma, fccm, faha, fncs, faan, vice chairman, department of neurology- yale school of medicine, director, stroke service- yale-new haven hospital, new haven, ct“use of the pupillometer has enabled our nursing staff to trend data and identify potential changes in patients who are often difficult to assess. the pupillometer is a valuable tool in our assessment ‘toolbox’!”michelle hill, ms, rn, agcns-bc, cnrn, ccrn, scrn, comprehensive stroke program coordinator, ohiohealth – riverside methodist hospital, columbus, ohio“our neuro/critical care team has found the pupillometer has added another dimension to our clinical assessment by providing objective data on pupillary response. by trending constriction velocity and npi, we have enhanced our clinical decision making at the bedside. the pupillometer has consistently provided accurate data on pupillary response.”mary kay bader, rn, msn, ccns, faha, fncs, clinical nurse specialist, mission regional medical center, brain trauma foundation medical advisory board member, mission viejo, california“we began with four units in our icu and now have 12. the nurses use it routinely to track pupillary changes. it is extremely helpful both for documentation and to detect any early changes that could lead to early interventions.”jefferson chen, md, phd, facs, vice chair of clinical affairs for the department of neurological surgery, director of neurotrauma, university of california- irvine (uci) medical center, orange, ca"it's great! the new equipment for the modern neurologist..."stephan a. mayer, md, fccm, fcns, director of neurocritical care and emergency neurology services, westchester medical center health network, valhalla, ny
