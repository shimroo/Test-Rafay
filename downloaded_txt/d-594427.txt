	 another year, another trip to shiner
    


another year, another trip to shineroriginally uploaded by tinaredwe took another trip to houston the year for bheeshmar's birthday. we stopped at shiner on the way again and had samples of beer at 11am and took the tour. we stayed with the kuglers and had a great dinner at ouisie's table. the next day we all (kids included) went to the st arnold brewery. we took a picnic lunch from central market and again drank samples at 11am. reminded me of going to the beer garden in germany when i was young.

	 renaissance festival
    


snack timeoriginally uploaded by tinaredthis weekend we took a trip to the renaissance festival.  on saturday we drove to conroe and went for a boat ride on lake conroe with the kuglers (claire, eric, lainey and ben).  we met the greggs (chris, christa, joshua and samantha) at the hotel, then we all went to burger fresh for dinner.  their burger was voted the best in texas by texas monthly.  sunday we all went to the renaissance festival.  we watched the joust (in the french section this time - duncan was mad that we were not in the section with the same joust maiden as last year), shot the bows and ate a bunch of fair food (funnel cake and turkey legs!)

	 trick-or-treaters
    


trick-or-treatersoriginally uploaded by tinaredwe went trick-or-treating with mason and his mom wendy as well as tommy and tuk.  mason was colt mccoy, so wendy borrowed my blond wig and went as colt mccoy's mom.  tommy was a wwii fighter pilot and tuk was amelia earhart - both super authentic costumes.  we circled the big block as this was the first year that duncan could really walk a long way without wanting to be carried - the candy helped motivate.  we met a creepy kid along the way who was obsessed with princess peach and followed us.
