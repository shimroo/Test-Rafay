this recognition speaks
for itself
welcome to the richmond region
usually the richmond region speaks for itself. our rich culture, incredible food, deep historic roots, gorgeous natural landscapes, creative vibes and diverse, welcoming community set us apart from the everyday destination. but sometimes we can step back and let others do the talking for us. cnn travel just named rva as the #1 town in america to visit in 2024 and quite frankly, we couldn't have said it better ourselves. come discover what the locals already know; the richmond region is the place to be in 2024.

come explore the first-ever mimosa trail
the ultimate path to that refreshing taste of sunshine is the richmond region mimosa trail which we believe is the first of its kind for a destination. whether you’re looking for a luxurious brunch experience, live entertainment, rooftop views, or even mini golf with your bubbly beverage, you’ll find just the right spot to brighten your day along the trail.
