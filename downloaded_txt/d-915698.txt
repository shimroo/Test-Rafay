 to my canadian friends 
in the past few weeks, the president of the usa has issued explicit challenges to the sovereignty of canada, both political and economic. in response to these challenges, some of my canadian friends who lie on the more progressive and of the political spectrum have expressed a slightly disconcerting attachment to feelings of nationalism. i understand where they’re coming from. over the past five days canadians have been engaged in a nationwide conversation about what it means to be canadian, what our country stands for, and in some cases, whether we shouldn’t just join with the united states anyway. ironically, ...

 from the parking lot 
the light is returning to the northern hemisphere and we’ve had clear skies for the last 10 days. this is a photo of the twilight with venus seen from my house looking southwest over apodaca ridge. cloud has since rolled in and a little blast of coastal winter is coming. republished. the post i sent out last week had broken links. my monthly round up of interesting links. these are posted nearly daily at my mastodon feed. democracy & politics it has been a full month of politics here in canada and in the us that has shaken a lot ...

 to my american friends 
an image of water carving a channel in a gravel path that diverges and then joins up again. it has been frantic weekend here in canada. the president of the united states implemented an executive order that imposed a 25% tariff on every single item exported from canada to the united states, except 10% on energy. in retaliation, our federal and provincial governments have imposed some selected tariffs on american imports to canada and in some cases we have closed markets for procurement for american services or for products like american produced alcohol. we are in a trade war that ...







 new squamish names on bowen island 
it’s a snow day here on nexwlelexwm/bowen island. after a couple of weeks of clear warms weather, winter seems to have finally gotten around to giving us a little blast of snow and cold. we’re looking at a week or so of colder than normal temperatures on the back of these squally snow events we’ve been having for the past twelve hours. after shovelling and salting the driveway, wrapping my water pump in a blanket and checking the heat tape on the pipes, i settled in to watch soccer and catch up on local news. it’s been 24 hours of ...

 the economic productivity conversation 
the photo shows my neighbour shane at the top his game, and the top of a tree, skillfully falling a 50 meter douglas-fir. so today is another friday, which is the day i set aside to do some reading and reflecting, and follow my interests down various rabbit holes. and today the rabbit hole is the crisis of “productivity“ in canada. the term productivity crops up a lot when policy makers, and those with an interest in how economic policy affects corporate activity begin talking about their worries and fears. productivity is simply an economic measurement that divides the gross ...

 a local example of what facebook has cost us 
when i first moved to bowen island back in 2001, there was a very active discussion board of bowen island issues called the bowen island phorum. this was a typical late 1990s bulletin board type website. locals could join and make posts and sometimes the discussions would cascade over four or five pages with replies into the hundreds on especially contentious or important issues to our little community. although that place drove me crazy with frustration a lot of the time, and i used to issue earnest warnings about the tone of some of our debate, which, probably seemed like ...
