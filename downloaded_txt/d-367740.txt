											what are some house warming gift ideas?
									 	

cooling comfort for your home
fans can make fabulous multi-purpose gifts for friends and family. the natural breeze fan with negative-ion feature is one model that “stands out” above the rest. this portable fan is remote controlled and it automatically cools the room to your target temperature, while adding negatively charged fresh ions to the room so you can breathe easier. homes tend to be well insulated and trap unwanted odors and lots of unpurities. making the air cleaner for your family is a wonderful gift option. 
the vornado 60th anniversary replica vornadofan air circulator is another fan with an exquisite design that allows it to effectively circulate the air evenly throughout the room. it creates a penetrating beam of air that travels farther than the breeze of most fans and the air blows in a continuous cycle that circulates the entire room. this fan would be perfect for a dorm room or sun room to circulate the air and help conserve energy.
