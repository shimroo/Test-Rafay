alumni week-end 2020
due to the global pandemic, alumni week-end, normally held in june, was rescheduled to october 10, 2020. however, because the lockdown rules are still in effect it is doubtful if any reunion will be held this year. we have heard that a general glaa, adelphian and cedar lake academy runion my be held that same date but it has not been confirm. 
because school will be in session, the events (if any) will not be held on the former academy grounds, but will be at the holly sda church on fish lake road. however visiitors can tour the grounds. a pot luck lunch will be at the adelphian junion academy following church services.
