cindy can't do it alone





i read in this morning's newspaper that cindy sheehan is calling it quits. she's not going to protest the war anymore or try to get an audience with president bush. she's just going to go home and try to live a normal life. she feels betrayed by congress, who after an amazing show of bravery on the iraq front, decided to go ahead and give in to what bush wanted as far as this "surge" goes. why? i can't figure it out. can someone explain to me why we elected a democratic congress? to act like this? what good did it do?i really feel for cindy. here she's put it all on the line, giving up years of her life to try to get this war turned around, stop the killing of innocents in iraq and stop the meaningless slaughter of our own soldiers. according to www.iraqbodycount.org, at least 64,632 iraqi civilians have been killed by combat since we started this pre-emptive war. 3,465 us soldiers have been killed in that time. just this month, so far, 113 have been killed.when will be stop this bloodshed? how will more killing end the killing? cindy, i'm with you--in feeling that this country is way out of wack with real life. i don't blame you for throwing in the towel. i just hope at some point you'll be swept in another wave of patriotism that proclaims that we will do no more killing in the name of peace, and that you won't be the only voice crying in the wilderness.

entertaining angels--the movie





we watched this movie last night, about the life of dorothy day, who started up the catholic worker movement.  we were shown a clip of the movie at the clergy couples retreat at the beginning of may.  oh yeah, i promised to tell you about that and haven't yet....it was basically perfect in every way, and i don't know what to really report about it, other than the location was wonderful--asilomar was the perfect place for such a retreat--and the speaker was great--dr. stephen muse, a psychologist, started with places i knew and was familiar with but then launched into something totally new and wonderful.  he's written books--i haven't read any of them yet, but i'd recommend them if they're anything like his presentations.  and the rapport between the attendees was wonderful.  there have been some shake-ups in this diocese in the last couple of years, and also there is great mistrust of psychology and touchy-feely things from some quarters of our clergy community, but i think just the right mix of people were there to make bonding as couples really a good thing.  we've never before had any get-together of clergy *couples*--we usually meet as wives or as priests, but never together.  it's been suggested for years but this was the first time we actually did it.  and i can guarantee you that all the people present will make sure it isn't the last! anyway, back to the movie--it was an interesting glimpse of the life of dorothy day and how she got started doing what she did.  it made me interested enough to want to pick up a book about dorothy day and find out more about her.  paul's been interested in her for years, and our friend jim forest wrote a book about her that i know has to be in the house somewhere....unless paul took it to the church with him.  i'll find out...and jim forest is the founder of orthodox peace fellowship, and we had a great conference over the weekend, albeit without jim.  he is in poor health and couldn't make the trip.  he lives in holland, though we found out he was in the states, but visiting family, not coming out here.  he worked as the editor for the catholic worker newspaper for a time, and knew dorothy day personally. we've been involved with the catholic worker house here in portland for the last 9 months or so, and have immensely enjoyed getting to know the people and the work of this ministry.  they have their potlucks on the first monday of each month, and then discuss what everyone is doing, the work in the house (they provide a place to live for women transitioning from prison or homelessness) and needs of the community.  it's about the closest to sharing everything in common that i've personally been involved with.

opf conference





i'm suddenly thinking, of course i should post about the upcoming orthodox peace fellowship conference on my blog, as there are local people (susan?) who may be interested in coming, and perhaps people from further away (mimi? dawn?) who'd like to come.  "upcoming" is an overstatement--it starts tomorrow!  sorry for the late notice. the orthodox peace fellowship is an organization of orthodox christians who are interested in discussing ways of waging peace in our parishes, communities, nations, and the world.  this year's conference is themed "living peacefully, locally."  speakers will include: david holden, psychotherapist, who will speak on living simply, locally, and our global impact and renee zitzloff, who is the coordinator of the minnesota opf chapter, who will speak on local chapters and community development.  and my own dear husband, fr. paul schroeder, will speak on friday evening on holy simplicity: st. basil the great and the ethic of sustainability. you can see more info about it on the opf website: www.incommunion.orgthe conference will be held in eagle creek at this retreat center:  http://www.collinsretreatcenter.org/and i am the newly appointed regional coorditor for the conference!  so you can email me at mamaelizabeth@earthlink.net if you'd like to come and i'll sign you up.  :-)  the day rate is $50 which includes the friday evening vespers and talk, and the saturday talks and workshops plus lunch.  you can also purchase dinner separately on friday and/or saturday nights if you wish.  the full conference rate, to stay at the retreat center for the weekend including meals, is $250.i hope to see some of you there!

kitchen work





we've gotten lots of outside projects done at our house in these six months we've lived here (yeah, it's been that long!) but not much inside besides just plain old organizing.  today we decided that there were things that *had* to be addressed in the kitchen.  we started noticing quite soon after we moved in that there was something not quite right about the cabinets....they are beautiful, but the hinges were coming loose.  we've thought that the wrong hinges were used, but it wasn't quite that bad.  it's that they used 1/2 inch screws.  what were they thinking?  that isn't going to hold anything!  so, the first project of the day is that paul replaced every cabinet hinge screw with much longer ones.this cabinet, i've thought ever since we moved in, need more shelves.  it had wood in the back but no tracks to put them up.  paul got them installed today.  now i have much more useable space in there and i don't have stuff all piled up on each other.and i'd thought as soon as i saw this cabinet that it would be the perfect place to store flat pans upright.  until i opened it and found a shelf in there!  so paul took it out today and now i can line up my cookie sheets and pizza pan and muffin tins and cooling racks.and here there was a disaster!  just too disorganized.  there was no shelf in this cabinet either, and all my appliances were in great disarray.  paul installed a half-shelf and now everything just fits in there perfectly!  and, after all that hard work, i decided to make my first ice cream of the season in my donvier.  easiest ice cream maker ever.  cookies and cream!

garden, may 2007





update of my garden! actually, this first radish picture is from...maybe three weeks ago? i've been getting radishes for quite some time already. they are very rewarding! easy to grow and quick, and what beautiful jewel colors!here's some of the tomato plants. i had originally thought, "i want 10 tomato plants this year!" (i had three last year.) and i went crazy buying them from the farmer's market, and then i had six. i thought, oh, that's enough. but then a. my neighbor brought me a cherry tomato plant when she went looking for a specific kind she likes--one for her and one for me! isn't that nice of her? and b. i realized that i didn't have any of the same varieties that i grew last year, and i was so pleased with how they turned out. so, i bought those varieties today and planted them. it was after i planted those that i thought, gee, our garden is looking swell! i should take some pictures. and here they are. carrotspeas (the tall ones) and beans (still pretty short); radishes in the fore and tomatoes in the backthe beautiful radishes i picked today. did you know that in addition to being a tasty snack out of hand, you can cook radishes? i like them in stews and stir-fries. you can also add the greens. kale! it's big enough to think about what i'd like to first make with it. caldo verde, or something different? i think i might just serve it tomorrow night when we go for house duty at the dorothy day house, all by itself, sauteed with garlic, alongside some pita veggie "patty melt" sandwiches that i found the recipe for in the oregonian yesterday. we bought five blueberry bushes when we first made the garden, and they are doing so well! i think we're going to have a lot of berries, for a first year. there were lots of blossoms.basil! my very favorite garden plant! it's coming up all over here, but it's been growing so slowly that i got impatient and bought a plant today and plunked it in the middle. we've already been enjoying basil from the farmer's market--we just ate pasta with pesto for dinner tonight.and the whole garden. we've been enjoying it immensely.

monday, may 14, 2007











yesterday we stopped at new seasons after our dinner out, to get ice cream to make ice cream sandwiches with the peanut butter cookies i had made (yum) and lo and behold, what did catch my eye in the dairy case but this! i first discovered straus milk when we were living in central california, out in the middle of nowhere. straus milk, it is not an exaggeration, is one of those little things that made living such an isolated life bearable. it is pasteurized but not homogenized, which means it's not raw milk but the milk and cream have not been bound, and usually when you open a bottle (which is glass and re-usable--take it back to the store to get your deposit back), especially of the whole milk, there is a clot of cream at the top that must be stirred in. (or skimmed off to be used separately!) this milk has such a wonderful flavor--i thought immediately after the first sip i took of it that *this* is what milk is supposed to taste like.when we moved to portland i kind of figured that straus milk was one of those things we were giving up by moving here, because they're in marin county (just north of san francisco) and i'd seen their ice cream here in portland but not their milk. my "local and sustainable" side is kind of twisting on itself right now, trying to justify drinking this milk.....but it's only from *california*, not mexico, or peru...okay, so it'll probably only be a once-in-awhile luxury. one i'll look forward to.

"grab the nearest book" meme





i just saw this on nissa's blog, and thought i'd just look to see what the nearest book was...grab the nearest book.1. open it to page 161.2. find the fifth full sentence.3. post the text of the sentence along with these instructions.4. don’t search around looking for the coolest book you can find. do what’s actually next to youso, when i looked to see what the nearest book is, i found....my bible.  really.  i don't even see any other books in the room.  doesn't that make me sound so spiritual!  godly, even.  okay, so let's see what's the fifth sentence on page 161.  uh, so page 161 is still in the biblical cyclopedic index, and there *are no* complete sentences.  thus fails this meme.  but the fifth term there is:hophni--fighterwho, as it turns out, was the son of eli, called "reprobates", guilty of unlawful practices, immoral, eli's warnings rejected by, cursed by a man of god, warned by samuel, ark takent to battle by, slain in battle, and news of, causes eli's death.  at least according to my biblical cyclopedic index. i wonder if this is an omen of some type?if you'd like to do this meme, let me know in the comments and i'll come check it out!

happy mother's day!





i signed up for a daily email from a speaker at the unschooling conference we attended in april, and i really liked his posting for mother's day.  he says to share what he writes freely, so i will, with attributions. the daily groove ~ by scott noelle www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove::a radical "mother's day" message ::  today is mother's day in many countries, andmothers everywhere are being honored and appreciated for the invaluablecontribution of mothering.that's the bright side...for many families there'salso a subtle dark side of mother's day: focusing on the *sacrifices* mothers makefor their families.  mothers' self-sacrifice is typically celebrated by reversingthe sacrificial current. for one day, the other family members take over themother's "duties"so she can be free (theoretically) to focus entirely on her ownpleasure.  don't get me wrong: i think one of life's simple pleasures iscontributing to the pleasure of others,and that includes the good feeling ofpampering mothers.  it's the undercurrent of *guilt* that so often taints thefun.  when the subtext is, "we're doing this stuff for you today because you*can't* have what you want the other 364 days of the year," it actually*perpetuates* the cycle of self-sacrifice, resentment, and guilt. so here's aradical proposition for every mother who has ever bought into the idea ofself-sacrifice as avirtue: decide that every day is mother's day! don't settle foranything less than a predominantly pleasureful path of mothering, and rememberthat the best way to raise kids who enjoy life is to let them see your commitmentto enjoying life yourself. :-)**(note to self-sacrifice addicts: if you thinki'm saying you should force yourself to be happy...think again!)**http://dailygroove.net/radical-mothers-day feelfree to forward this message to your friends!  copyright (c) 2007 by scott noellei like this because i'm often chagrined to hear that what some moms want most on mother's day is to get away from their little brats.  i think that's sad.  my children are what made me a mother and i celebrate motherhood!  when we decided to stop at two children because of realizing that overpopulation was really doing a number on our planet, i thought it was a good and responsible decision.  and i applaud people who have taken that principle even further and don't have any children.  yet, when i think about whether i could have done that if i'd had the consciousness before i had kids, i just don't think i could have.  childbirth was such an amazingly empowering moment in my life (times 2), and having the experience of bringing a child out of my body, feeding that child from my body, and nurturing that child (both of them) to maturity (ongoing) is just an incredible experience.  i know i wouldn't be the same person without being a mother. last night i received an email from a friend who had emailed some mom friends, thanking us for helping her along with her mothering.  and i think it's true: we do help each other in parenting, because none of us exist in a vacuum.  to all the moms out there, thank you for being good moms and for all the influence you've been in my life and my kids' lives.  it's a chain reaction--even if i've never met you, i've surely "met" something that you've influenced. and finally, on this mother's day, let's not forget the original intent of mother's day.  it was founded as an activist holiday.  it was a mothers movement to stop all war.  it was a call to teach our sons (and daughters, these days) to be peaceful and to resist the call of the forces that be to go out and kill other mothers' children.  julia ward howe is the originator of this movement, and i give honor to that mother today.  and i'll end by posting her mother's day proclamation here.arise, then, women of this day!arise all women who have hearts,whether your baptism be that of water or of fears!say firmly: "we will nothave great questions decided by irrelevant agencies,our husbands shall notcome to us reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause.our sons shallnot be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them ofcharity, mercy, and patience.we women of one country will be too tender ofthose of another country to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs."from the bosom of the devasted earth a voice goes up with our own. it says,disarm, disarm!"the sword of murder is not the balance of justice! blooddoes not wipe out dishonor nor violence indicate possession.as men haveoften forsaken the plow and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leaveall that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of counsel.letthem meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead.let them thensolemnly take counsel with each other as the means whereby the great humanfamily can live in peace,and each bearing after her own time the sacredimpress, not of caesar, but of god.
