so. summer.is amazing what a summer so far! i'm happy i'm not going to consortium. sorry aj :( we'll still hang out, ok? but even though it's summer, that doesn't mean the end of the drama. far from it lol. jimmy leaves in 6 days for the marines. ashley's family and leland. that just got alot worse. my oral surgery t_____________t it starts this friday.....but drunk cousins are funny, hickies to not even resemble misquito bites(soni...lol) graduation parties are fun if they involve blair, and numchucks. i finally got my movies back! don't walk to my house from bp. don't eat fries while laughing on the phone. should 2 minors really be driving around at 2 in the morning...? i should probably explain some of these thing furthers, but not right now. leland is about to pick me up so we can go to the hospital and find winston. he has his cat scans today and his parents are stupid. i love you all and later dayz.<3 kaitie

socially smartas a socially smart person, you are best with others in real-life situations.  this type of intelligence is closely linked to being 'street smart.'  theories and such are not much concern: the things that matter tend to be those which you can see, feel, touch - what you can really experience.  this knowledge comes to you both out of a natural knowledge, as well as learning from the situations you find yourself in.60% applied intelligence20% natural intelligence

your element is light: innocent, beautiful,kind-hearted and pure. you are so sweet youralmost angelic! you find joy in othershappiness and cannot stand to see anyone inpain. you want to make everyone around you feelgood about themselves and if someone is upsetyou can tend to become rather upset as wellwhich means you are sympathetic and raiseothers above yourself. being as kind andgood-natured as you are people have most likelyhurt you in the past but you pick yourself upevery time. you may look fragile but you arestronger then most tend to see. life isbeautiful no matter how you look at it and youunderstand that people make mistakes. noteveryone is perfect. you try to see the good inthe bad which is a talent few posses. dont everlet anyone change you. you truly have abeautiful soul inside and a heart of gold. .:-|what is your true element?|-:. -with anime pictures and detailed answers- brought to you by quizilla
