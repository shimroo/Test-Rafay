settle into one of our cozy rooms, overlooking the serene tidal inlet and offering a glimpse of ireland’s breathtaking landscape. whether you’re traveling solo, with friends, or as a family, our accommodations promise comfort and tranquility, with all the amenities you desire.
 our rooms include some irish lights furniture specially made for the nine crookhaven lighthouse houses that were built for the crews working for the commissioners of irish lights who lived there while they were building the fastnet rock lighthouse and mizen head fog signal station around 1905-10. when the crookhaven lighthouse dwellings were sold privately all the furniture was removed and sold off. each piece was marked mizen or fastnet, depending which house they came from. 
savor the flavors of west cork at our award-winning restaurant, where locally sourced ingredients are used to make fresh cooked to order dishes. from our breakfast to dinner, we strive to give you the best experience we can. 
explore the wonders of the wild atlantic way, with mizen head and barley cove beach just a stone’s throw away. immerse yourself in the beauty of ireland’s land’s end, where rugged cliffs meet the vast expanse of the atlantic ocean. whether you’re seeking adventure or relaxation, our idyllic location offers something for everyone.
join us for an unforgettable stay at the heron’s cove, where warm hospitality and unforgettable experiences await. book your stay now and embark on a journey to discover the magic of west cork.
