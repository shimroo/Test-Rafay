"best ant killer around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"i have used terro for years. its the best thing since sliced bread. you do have to be patient. use it and wait about 4 days. if you see more then use more terro and they will eat it and take it back to their colonies and eventually all the ants will be gone. just give it a try. i did and i love it. i would never use anything else."

"simply amazing"
"the army of black ants that have invaded our home have been defeated! they are gone, and in one day the battle was over. we tried the raid ant baits to no effect at all. we were killing ants with our bare hands till the wife brought the terro liquid home. simply amazing!"
