the 1800’s is where it all started for ffm.
our home was built in the 1860’s for a local businessman turned politician. for many years after his death the home served a respite care and ultimately became mountville pines. in 2001 steve and patty dietch purchased the home and started the nonprofit that is today faith friendship ministries to serve the most in need in our community who are afflicted with complicated and persistent mental illness. it is their foundation and legacy that we stand on today.click here to read sam matt fridy’s story.

ffm’s community of leaders, family, and friends gathered at the state capitol asking governor shapiro and elected leaders to provide emergency funding to keep the villa - their home open! 



































 

meet some of our precious family membersthe 24/7 supportive services our residents receive living at the ffm villa, care from the medical and psychiatric community, and involvement of local churches, businesses, and individuals give them a chance to live stable and even thriving lives. mental illness and other disabilities don’t define them, but they are a reality, and living alone is not healthy or safe.the funding for such care is less than 50% of its costs, so ffm has to raise charitable donations to bridge the gap. as regulations get stricter, the cost goes up, but ffm knows that god calls us to care for the least of these, and in doing so, god will provide the manna we need.
