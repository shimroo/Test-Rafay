"know, o prince, that between the years when the oceans drank atlantis and the gleaming  cities, and in the years of the rise of the sons of aryas, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars - nemedia, ophir, brythunia, hyperborea, zamora with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted mystery, zingara with its chivalry, koth that bordered on the pastoral lands of shem, stygia with its shadow-guarded tombs, hyrkania whose riders wore steel and silk and gold. but the proudest kingdom was aquilonia, reigning supreme in the dreaming west. hither came conan, the cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the earth under his sandaled feet" -- the nemedian chronicles
