"i would like to thank jodi and britt for the wonderful hiring experience that i had at aspen personnel. it was a very comfortable experience.  i felt more like a customer of theirs than an applicant applying for a job. although she actually works for the businesses that are looking for employees, i felt more like the client, as she took the time to find out what my interests were in order to make a better match for her business clients. jodi had me placed and i am very happy with my new position. i feel i am fitting in and without the help and experience from jodi and britt, i know i would never have found this position. aspen personnel service goes above and beyond in finding the right person to meet their client’s needs.  i would highly recommend them to any business looking for quality employees or an individual looking for work."

"making the decision to go with aspen personnel services was definitely the right one! both jodi and melissa were with me during the job search process every step of the way. they were on my team from day one and rooting for me! you could tell that they were committed to find the right job for me."

"prior to moving to spokane i reached out to aspen personnel service and submitted by resume - somewhat by mistake since i have not used a recruiter before (i've had two jobs in the last 31 years). i was pleasantly surprised when my mistake turned into a great position with a great company. jodi's insights into the market, into the companies and types businesses aspen supports, was extremely helpful and led me to focus on a position i otherwise had passed over several times in my job search. jodi sensed where my strengths were, and was able to deconstruct the posted position to reach an understanding that i would be an excellent fit, and she was correct. the people, the work, the leadership - an all around great experience and if you are a professional looking to maximize your search for a position in the spokane area, you will do well by contacting aspen and having them on your team."

i'm so grateful for aspen personnel! i have tried other recruiting companies, but never hear from them after my initial interview. jodi and britt always kept in touch with me and called me when there was an opportunity. though there were a couple interviews that i went on and i never got hired for, they always considered me for the next opportunity. they never gave up on me. i finally found a full time career with benefits. they are very professional and so easy to work with. i highly recommend aspen personnel so they can help find a career path for you.

"my experience with aspen personnel was excellent. the customer service, communication and collaboration were very positive. i was pleased to interact with all aspects of their organization. they were very professional, open to listening and understanding as well as very thoughtful. while it doesn't seem to be the norm anymore, they do seem to take an "old school" approach to interacting with their candidates.."

"i had such an incredible experience working with suzie at aspen! we originally connected through my giving a reference for a different applicant, but suzie was able to discern from our conversation that i could benefit from aspen's services, which i absolutely needed at the time. we set up an interview shortly after and within a few weeks, i was sent a job possibility that turned out to be my dream job. i am now happily employed doing that job for an organization i love, and taking new steps in my journey i didn't think were possible. thank you, suzie and aspen!"
