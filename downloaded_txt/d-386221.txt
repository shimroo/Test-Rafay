without the a-tcp, families would struggle to have that hope and optimism that their work and research provides. for this reason, the a-tcp needs to be nurtured just as much as the children and adults living with a-t. their existence, with our support, makes the world shine a little brighter for families like ours in anticipation of more life-improving therapies and a cure for a-t.

becky
a-t mom, fundraiser, and monthly donor





the time that the doctors at the a-t clinical center devoted to us meant more to us than they'll ever know. we felt their passion and their hope, and it was wonderful to hear that our child means as much to them as he does to us. though we were complete strangers to the group, everyone treated us like family.

corie sass
elliot’s mom





[my kids] are always so proud to ‘be helping the scientists find a cure for a-t’ and i am a little more hopeful that we are getting closer to real life interventions for charlotte and all kids with a-t.”
