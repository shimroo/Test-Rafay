a holy, happy, and healthy church
this ministry has been preserved by holiness, humility and integrity. we know that from age to age and generation to generation the unfailing word of god will stand.  the power of prayer, salvation and deliverance is still available.  prayer and breakthrough is not a thing of the past but rather it is still able to change your life today.

 “but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.”




				isaiah 40:31			

 “the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.”
