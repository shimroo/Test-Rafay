pices carbon savings













future (forecasting and understanding trends, uncertainty and responses of north pacific marine ecosystems ) is an integrative science program undertaken by the member nations and affiliates of pices to understand how marine ecosystems in the north pacific respond to climate change and human activities, to forecast ecosystem status based on a contemporary understanding of how nature functions, and to communicate new insights to its members, governments, stakeholders and the public.
