“for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” luke 12:34














luke matthew parlatore, a promising and charitable young athlete, passed away on january 27, 2002, at the age of 17. he was a dedicated young man who believed in serving his community and helping others. his numerous contributions to the red cross, vietnam veterans, and alzheimer’s foundation were worthy of several personal citations. an all-volunteer, not-for-profit scholarship foundation was established in his name in 2002 which remained active until 2013.  through the lifetime of the foundation, the intention was to award high school graduating track athletes with scholarships to their college of choice; as well as, contribute to community charities and local needs. the purpose of luke’s foundation now is to honor and perpetuate a very special and good-hearted young man’s legacy.













“… these character building aspects of track are the bricks that havebuilt what i believe is the most valuable lesson of my immediate life. this is the understanding that i must always keep myself vital and refined mentally, physically, spiritually and socially.”-luke matthew parlatore





our mission was to support young people who embody these ideas with the intention of developing future community leaders. the luke m. parlatore scholarship foundation believes that on staten island our “most valuable commodity” is our people. our efforts to encourage community service among high school students has had and will continue to have a positive impact on young lives and old friends.

while active, luke’s foundation awarded $150,000 in scholarships and contributed over $40,000 to local community charities. this was all thanks to family, friends, and local businesses’ contributions! we believe in leading by example. while luke’s foundation is no longer active, our collaborators have gone on to contribute to the following organizations.
