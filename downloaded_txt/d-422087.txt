the biggest truth bomb to come out of the ftx collapse...





 ...is this snarky utterance from sam bankman-fried, ceo of ftx, and democratic donor to the tune of $50m+, during a twitter interview with vox:all "sbf" is doing is lifting the veil here, saying something we all already knew: spouting left-wing bullshit and contributing to democratic candidates is simply a payment of indulgences, in order to protect one's wealth from being targeted by the rabid, ravenous progressive elite.will an embarrassed media now do more scrutiny before lionizing those who mouth all the right bromides and invest in all the right causes?  have they learned anything, as they watch the man/boy they once compared to warren buffet, devolve into the next bernie madoff?  have they become more insightful, seeing theranos ceo ("omg -  a female tech entrepreneur !!")  elizabeth holmes sentenced to over a decade in the stony lonesome?nah.maybe - if they were any actual journalists left in the industry - you'd see some mea culpas.but propogandists are gonna propagandize.  so they will give a moment's pause, and move on to more of the same...so one can say that's two truth bombs that came out here.although i should append the title with the addendum "so far..."

canadian truckers protest, and leftists...





 ...turn into fascists, as they do every time.the only good protest is a government-sanctioned protest - assuming the government is in the hands of the left, of course.otherwise you wind up on the receiving end of their anger and hatred, as seen in the wapost:punchline:analysis: #truth:

joe biden:  from saigon to kabul





 an old man still thinks it is 1972, and through the fog of a failing memory, forgets his past mistakes - or perhaps, thru the stubborn pride of old age, refuses to admit them, and double-downs with petulance.but reality intruded upon a sunsetting senility, and the song remains the same:  allies abandoned, the innocent being slaughtered, chaos, fear, and the coming of night - which, like winter in got, will last for a long, long time.the washington post, of all places:two weeks before saigon fell in april 1975, a 32-year-old joe biden was among the senators summoned to the white house for a top-secret briefing on the crisis in vietnam.though just a freshman, biden gave the president a clear message: the situation in vietnam was hopeless, and the united states should leave as quickly as possible, according to a column by rowland evans and robert novak at the time that described biden’s interactions with then-president gerald ford.other senators who supported biden at the time were taken aback by their young colleague’s “didactic performance,” the columnists wrote.nearly half a century later, biden’s attitude toward the u.s. withdrawal from afghanistan has been strikingly similar — even as events echo the frantic evacuation of americans and those who helped them in south vietnam.i had to look up didactic:...intended to teach, particularly in having moral instruction as an ulterior motive."a didactic novel that set out to expose social injustice"ignorance mixed with hubris, with a moral righteousness that will broke no argument.defines most liberals these days.  and if you think the fall of kabul is bad, wait until you see what joe and his cronies have in store for america... pictures from a (recurring) nightmare:
