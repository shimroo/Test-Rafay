rafting on the upper navua river




in the remote highlands of viti levu lies one of the most unique river trips on earth. slicing a deep chasm through the island's tropical interior, the upper navua river is our hidden pathway to a pristine tropical wilderness. shrouded in lush rainforest, fed by countless waterfalls, and protected by challenging rapids, the upper navua river is fiji rafting at its best.rivers fiji is proud to introduce you to the upper navua gorge. your exploration of this amazing river is perhaps one of the most unique journeys in all of fiji, if not the south pacific and the world. this excursion will take you through some of the country's most formidable and phenomenally beautiful terrain in the relative comfort of inflatable rafts. this is a special trip not because of one unparalleled attribute upon which the success of the trip is based, but many special and scenically significant places; each individually worthy of special recognition. there is not one waterfall but many (some say at least seventy); not one short stretch of a deep, narrow canyon, but kilometers. this is a place where black volcanic walls are at points barely five meters apart and over forty meters high and fringed by emerald rainforest. this is a place where man has been merely an intermittent visitor at best, where some of the wildest and most beautiful fiji can still be found.

kayak in the middle navua river




paddle an inflatable kayak through the gentle waters of the middle navua river through the heart of viti levu. the relaxed pace allows plenty of time to take in the surrounding sites of villages and people as we pass through the verdant jungle interior.as the guides prepare a delicious mid-day picnic lunch on the beach, we’ll leave our kayaks behind for a short hike to wainikavou waterfall. when roughly translated its name means, “water of the renewed,” so standing under the cascading falls will renew our body and invigorate our adventurous spirit.in the afternoon we paddle to the village of namuamua which is situated at the confluence of the navua and ‘luva rivers. here we will board a motorized longboat for the remainder of the journey through a breathtaking canyon with many waterfalls, exotic birds, and giant fruit bats.
