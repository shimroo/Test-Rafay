silly, but it makes a point.
							
the point? well. the point is multi-faceted. it blends the past with the future. it involves technology, innovation, progress... change... and us. the truth is, we get lots of praise for helping small businesses. but quantifying that praise here, in this very small spot, doesn't quite cut it. it's also very boring, unless you're me, which you're not. so i'm sticking a video here instead, one that's silly, but not. interesting, but real. fiction, but non. so enjoy. and don't forget to watch it! (that means you should look closely to find the little triangle surrounded by the little circle in the middle of the picture to the left. then click on it. ho hum. c'mon. it's 2017. are you at least starting to understand why we need each other?)
