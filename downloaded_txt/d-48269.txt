in
every person's heart, there is a void
- an empty place that can only be filled by one thing. each of us goes
through life seeking and searching for that one perfect fit, that thing
that will fill the void. many try to substitute other things, money,
drugs, careers, relationships, fame. many seek fulfillment through
mystical, religious or occult practices. but these things, however
attractive they seem, cannot truly satisfy that inner longing.
the
bible teaches that only the one who made man's heart can also fill it.
are you seeking fulfillment? are you lacking inner peace? not sure of your purpose
or direction in life? let jesus christ into your heart and know him as
you lord and savior. he is the
only way to truly fill the
void!
