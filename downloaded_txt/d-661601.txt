century drive systems ch-3 drive unit
century drive systems, inc. is a manufacturer of airboat belted reduction drive units (transmissions) and airboat component parts for the airboat industry. we commonly refer to our belted transmissions as a drive units, or airboat drive units. we have several models and ratios to choose from.
the ch-2 airboat drive unit is our 4" wide belt
  drive system. the ch-3 airboat drive unit is a
  5" wide belted reduction unit and our most popular airboat product. the all
  new ch-4 airboat drive unit has a 5" wide, 14mm belted drive unit and
  is now available for immediate shipment. our ch-3
  longbelt airboat drive unit lowers
  your heavy center of gravity by separating the engine crankshaft center and
  propeller shaft by 41.8 inches. our ch-3
  counter rotators can
  be used with any of the standard ch-3 or the ch-3 long belt drive units to
  create an awesome amount of thrust with the same
  power plant. we are also offering the counter rotating unit in the ch-4 with
  steeper ratios.the briggs mini drive unit is
  for the one or two passenger 10' to 15' ft light weight boat systems. this
  lower cost boat can open a vast market at $7,000.00 to $11,000.00 dollars for
  a complete boat and trailer. a big portion of the general public can not afford
  the $25,000.00 to $45,000.00 dollar airboats.
