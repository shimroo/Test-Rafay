your child's brain

february is rare disease month—a month-long focus on rare diseases, culminating on rare disease day, february 28th. currently more than 7,000 rare diseases have been identified with a significant proportion of them involving the developing brain and nervous system.  and the vast majority of rare diseases have a genetic basis. coping with a rare disease is often aptly described as a journey. and along that journey, questions and concerns will come up at every stage of life. where can a family member go for that information and support? often, a genetic counselor is an excellent option, especially for those contending with a rare, genetic disorder. listen to dr. bradley schlaggar, president and ceo of kennedy kriger and his guests talk about the role that genetic counseling plays in supporting families struggling with a rare disorder.outpatient building video tourjoin one of our patients as she takes you on a tour through all the fun and interesting spaces that you may see when you come to the 801 north broadway outpatient building. let peyton introduce you to kennedy krieger.
