putting off the repair is a bad option, because small foundation problems grow up to be big foundation problems.
your cheapest and easiest solution is available to you right now, and we offer several financing options that make it easier and make it possible.




why centex foundation repair
because when you’ve been focused on doing one thing with excellence for over 30 years, you know how to do it the right way.




1 
 

we’re always on the level.
a crack in your sheetrock doesn’t necessarily mean you need foundation repair! we’ve built our success on telling our customers the truth, and our reviews prove it






2 
 

we give you a true lifetime warranty.
far too many foundation guys offer fine-print warranties, and most go out of business before you can ever redeem it! but our warranty is legit, and 30 years on, we aren’t going anywhere.






3 
 

we offer you several financing options!
so we can approve you for a payment plan that’s custom-tailored to your needs.






4 
 

we give you more options
(heck, we even invented a new option with our exclusive centerbeam steel piering!) because every foundation repair is unique, and you deserve the solution that’s right for you. 










 



don’t wait! our
foundation inspection

is free of charge!
