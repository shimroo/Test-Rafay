my 8 year old daughter describes going to oapl as "where dreams come true". they offer us constant support and they always put my daughter's needs first. i couldn't recommend them more, they have become an integral part of my daughter's journey in using prosthetic arms.

i have been a patient of oapl for 19 years and have received consistently outstanding care from my prosthetist and the broader team. as an active person... i cannot overstate how critical this has been in not feeling constrained by my disability.

the walkaide 2 has changed my life. i use if constantly and it is so helpful, especially when i am fatigued. it helps lift my “drop foot” associated with my ms off the ground so i don’t trip. i have not had one fall since i have been using it. it is a wonderful device.

my current prosthesis is out of this world! undoubtedly the best i've had in forty years... if you're seeking expertise, understanding, professional advice, cutting edge technology and seamless collaboration with the ndis, i recommend you look no further.
