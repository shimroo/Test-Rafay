testimonials
what our customers have shared







we received the window and performed the installation at the st. theresa soup kitchen. it looks great and functions perfectly!! thanks for all your help on this project!
  ovation construction



"this was hands down the easiest and simplest quote request i've done. love the website and setup, wish everything was this easy."
sunbelt glaziers  



your quote process is pretty straight forward and amazing.
  alert glass



i called on a project with a national account, received preliminary pricing on the phone, with a follow-up hard proposal within 2-3 minutes.  exceptional quote turn around, not to mention the friendly and helpful conversation we had.  truly remarkable when considering many companies keep you bouncing through an automated answering system for 5 – 10 minutes.  thank you for your help on my project!
national glass and hardware llc  



our service team and techs. say, by far ready access is the favorite. due to the ease of service and great knowledgeable technical support. getting it right the first visit, that's good for us.  thank you for many faithful years of consistent specs and quality products. i'm amazed how many times a window opens and closes. ready access stands the test of time. we see it first-hand in the field.
ra service  



knowledgeable and always helpful!
treco construction/trefz mcdonalds  



kelly was great in assisting me with window selection and knew about local health codes and windows that would work for our restaurant project.
retail construction group  



awesome & fast service!!!
b&j glass  



ready access really cares about their customers.  they advise us of any irregularities in the order.  they are helpful and i would like many companies to care as much as they do about their customers.  i really like dealing with them.
ad3r technologies, inc  



in a time where customer service has become a lost art, ready access remembers how to treat their customers right.  prompt responses on emails or a call back, anna will make you feel like you are her only customer.  great pricing, quality product, but at the end of the day, it’s the great service that brings us back time and time again.
central florida glass & mirror  



great product, ships fast and employees are always helpful, i recommend! 
jillian schaul  



friendly staff, reasonable prices and great product.
donna mcnamara  



i’ve been working with jeff odom for years and am continually impressed with his commitment to customer satisfaction.  his down-to-earth approach to problem solving makes the difference in getting the job done. good reliable products need reliable back-up and jeff is there well after the window leaves the loading dock. 
commercial maintenance solutions  



i was hesitant to purchase windows for fear that i would get the wrong one and then be out the monies spent for custom windows. kelly was very helpful and reassuring throughout the entire process. even when i had a misunderstanding she took it in stride and was nothing but professional and courteous.
