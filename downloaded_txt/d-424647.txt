posted on march 14, 2019march 30, 2021prana studio new schedule and classes               begins 4/1/21 


 


yin is back!!!!
attention yogis!!!!!
this monday (4/5/21) the lovely nicole will be teaching  yin at 5:30pm. this class is available both in studio and on zoom.  sign up and reserve your spot now!
please let us know if you have any questions about the time change or about yin.
if youâ€™re a human who deals with stress and has a body- yin will most likely help you. if youâ€™re a yogi/athlete/crossfitter/active person whoâ€™s not already spending as much time in recovery as you do busting your ass- youâ€™re missing a major piece of the puzzle.
so come try it!! your body will thank you and your sleep will be heavenlyÂ ðŸ™‚
