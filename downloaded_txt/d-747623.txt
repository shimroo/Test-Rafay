our misson: to promote understanding and comprehensive management of lake and watershed ecosystems
 living on or near a lake brings unique pleasures. at the same time, problems arise creating the need for information and education. lake home owners, concerned citizens, lake associations and environmental professionals joined together in 1985 to meet that need with the formation of the illinois lake management association. excessive weed and algae growth, turbid water, sedimentation and bacterial or toxic contamination present a real threat to the ecological health and beauty of the inland lakes we treasure.
