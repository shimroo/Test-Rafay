elevate your experience with stunning new technology
introducing new kameleon kolors in five color shifting combinations

					we are introducing a dramatic new color-shifting technology that creates an 
					instantaneous, hard-hitting shift in color without a gray area or mottling 
					in between colors. the new kameleon fx packs, which are part of the 
					shimrin®2 paint system, contain pearls tightly controlled in thickness, 
					creating uniquely clean effects when applied in layers over black paint.
				

					click "learn more" below to hear insights from jon kosmoski and our expert 
					technicians where they provide an in-depth exploration of these brilliant 
					new kolor options.
