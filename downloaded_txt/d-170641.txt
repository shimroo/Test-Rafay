best of the best



lighting design & consultation
illuminations lighting design’s signature design is a space where every lantern, sconce, chandelier, up-light and down light balances a room for its precise intent.  using sophisticated computer technology, we create that balanced design weeks, or even months before the fixtures arrive.  when the lights go up, you will be truly amazed at how the beautiful interplay of light and shadow will make you feel at once inspired, and at ease.  that is what good home lighting plan is all about.

landscape lighting design & installation
if you have invested considerable energy into your outdoor spaces, you certainly will not want to leave them in the dark half of the year. landscape and outdoor garden lighting allows you to reap a full return on your investment. by highlighting unique architectural features of your building or home, as well as natural textures such as trees, ponds or shrubs, your outdoor spaces will find a second life beneath the moonlight. landscape lighting services such as lighting steps and pathways will also offer a sense of security to you, your family and guests.

fine art & cabinet lighting
what makes illuminations lighting and design so successful at art lighting? two key factors very difficult to find in a single company: customer interface and multi-disciplinary technical expertise. we expect our technicians to be good listeners and gather information first before beginning any project. customers who invest in recessed art lights are in reality seeking to express an intangible sense of atmosphere and aesthetic through a unique combination of specific art lighting elements, degrees of illumination, and complementary sub themes within the home’s overall decorative theme.

color, texture, form and shadow are the building blocks of all that we see. but only light can bring these elements to life
in many homes and offices, light is understood in its functional aspects. rarely is it understood in terms of its artistic qualities. lighting is more than utilitarian – it is theater! how an object is illuminated is just as important as what is being focused upon. that is what makes illuminations lighting design unique. we combine practical experience with aesthetic taste to light the stage of your everyday experience.


why illuminations lighting design?
each area of service is staffed with outstanding experts that understand the impact their efforts have on your home. no other lighting firm is able to provide such a well-rounded service line or a more informative lighting & home automation blog. but do not just take our word for it. just ask lance armstrong, george w. bush, or dozens of other commercial clients or residential clientele, across the great state of texas who have enjoyed our lighting services.


areas of focus
our main areas of focus include lighting design, landscape lighting, fine art lighting, display lighting, commercial automation, home lighting control systems and audio/visual media, as well as general electrical contracting. because we offer a full range of services, we can meet virtually any electrical and lighting needs. no project is too narrow, or too broad.
