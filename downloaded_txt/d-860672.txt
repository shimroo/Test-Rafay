transforming lives, one rescue at a time































about the breed



siamese cats are known for their striking appearance and lively personalities. with their sleek bodies, almond-shaped blue eyes, and pointed coats in colors like seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac, they are truly distinctive. beyond their looks, siamese cats are highly intelligent, social, and vocal, often “talking” to their owners in expressive, chatter-like tones. they form strong bonds with their families, following them around and seeking constant companionship. playful, curious, and affectionate, siamese cats thrive in interactive environments and are often described as being more like dogs in their loyalty and need for attention.
















help us!fostering is vital to austin siamese rescue’s mission. by providing a temporary home, you offer a safe haven for cats coming from shelters, abandoned, or neglectful situations or as a volunteer you help us with administrative duties that are vital for our organization to run smoothly. your role as a foster/volunteer is crucial in giving these cats a second chance at a happy life.

while our primary focus is on siamese cats, we also care for other breeds that come to us through mixed litters or urgent need of safety. we hope to find each of our cats the perfect forever home where they can thrive and share their unique personalities with a loving family.
