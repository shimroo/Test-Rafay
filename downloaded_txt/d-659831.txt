    why choose us →
  
























“life before cosmetology school was a different type of excitement. 
it was the type where i was seen as a hero and to some, a villain. the social work field provided me with lessons learned in which i used to with humility to exhibit towards others with these same life lessons,  i can now provide a more colorful insight to life while expanding my level of creativity.”
