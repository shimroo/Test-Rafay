not sure





i found a bug on a piece of clothing that was lying on the floor that i was about to wash.  it kind of looks like a bed bug, but have no bites and see nothing on the mattress and box springs.  if it is a bed bug, it was an adult.  when i went to kill it, it left a brown stain on the clothing.  is there a bug that kind of looks like a bed bug, but isn't?  we were traveling a couple of weeks ago and i have looked through my computer case which was close by and have found no evidence of eggs or bed bugs nor have at any time have i noticed any bites.  what do you think?
