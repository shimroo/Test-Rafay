monthly gardening tips
gardening tasks are similar everywhere but the timing is different.  these gardening tips
are written for the willamette valley, oregon, which has an unusual climate.  summers and winters 
are mild and the seasons change a month later because of the influence of the pacific ocean.

the pacific northwest is blessed with an abundance of plants that grow well in this mild climate. it is possible to have plants
blooming in your yard every month of the year. only plants that are usually available in pacific northwest nurseries and garden centers have been included. these lists will help find plants that will bloom each season of the year.

the plants are listed by size to make it easier to pick plants that fit into your landscape. the plants are separated into low, medium and tall according to this chart.

                  low             medium          tall
trees		below 15'	15' to 25'	over 25'
shrubs		below 3'	3' to 6'	over 6'
vines		below 5'	5' to 12'	over 12'
perennials	below 15"	15" to 30"	over 30"


this plant list was made for portland, oregon, which is in usda hardiness zone 8 and sunset western climate zone 6. all plants
in this list are hardy to at least 10-20 degrees. some are hardy to 30 degrees below zero. for areas outside the pacific northwest,
find your hardiness zone on the
usda hardiness zones map in the
plant lists, the number that follows the scientific name is the coldest usda hardiness zone in which the plant will survive.

below the usda hardiness zone number is a rating of the plant's water needs: low, medium or high.  watering can be reduced and simplified if plants with similar water needs are planted together.  some plants, such as acer palmatum, calluna vulgaris, daphne odora, erica sp. and rhododendron sp. will easily develop root rot if the soil is kept constantly moist.

the height and width given are average landscape size that can be expected in the portland area.  of course, this will be affected by soil, fertilizing, watering and pruning.  most trees and shrubs will reach mature size in ten to thirty years, but a few trees may take 100 years to reach mature size. perennials usually reach their full size in five to ten years.

plant descriptions are taken from the sunset western garden book, various oregon nursery catalogs and personal observation of mature landscapes in oregon.  plants grow about 20% larger in western oregon than in the rest of the usa.

rod accepted jesus christ as his savior in 1973.  he read the bible straight through from genesis to revelation seven times before he attended ozark bible college.  he has taught sunday school since 1985 and was an elder and director of children's ministries at his church.

the entire bible can be read in less than one year by reading three chapters a day plus one chapter from psalms or proverbs.  for an accurate translation that is easy to read, he recommends the new international version or the english standard version..
