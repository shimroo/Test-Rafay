welcome to housemaxx™ 

                                  the for sale by owner real estate property listing network - saving people thousands in real estate commissions! 

                                  sell, rent, lease, buy or purchase a home, business, land, farm, acreage, commercial, industrial or vacation properties throughout canada, usa, australia, new zealand and the united kingdom. 

                                  housemaxx™ empowers and provides canadians, americans and international property owners (sellers and buyers) the tools necessary to sell or buy homes privately while saving time and thousands of dollars. property owners work hard for their money and to build equity in their properties and don't want to give away a large % of their equity to a real estate agent so  when they are looking to sell and buy a 0% real estate commission is what motivates them to sell or buy themselves. and with the help of housemaxx™ it's a easy a 1, 2, 3! 

                                  with the advent of technology and access to information property owners don't need to pay high real estate agent commissions! with housemaxx™  homeowners can now sell their homes privately without paying high real estate commissions/fees and keep their hard earned equity. 

how do private home sales work? 

                                  the internet is allowing home buyers and sellers across canada and all over the world to benefit from "intermediaries;" also known as "cutting out the middleman" - realtorsï¿½ in this case. this means giving home sellers and buyers access online to information that was primarily restricted to agents and brokers with access to the mls®. 

                                  housemaxx™ empowers property sellers and buyers with a private home sale process that takes a little effort and provides a professional and rewarding approach to buy condos for sale in toronto.
