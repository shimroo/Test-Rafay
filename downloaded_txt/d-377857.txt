"spare me" by will mauricette trailer
enforced by local laws, intimidation and violence, sundown towns are white neighborhoods whose residents ensure black people leave town before the sun goes down. the term came from public road signs that indicated as much. "some sundown towns still exist," says filmmaker will mauricette.

the setting of the eight-minute "spare me" is sarasota in 1931, and the story is centered around a father-son relationship and a flat tire.
