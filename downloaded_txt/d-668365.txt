cardiff castle is one of wales’ leading heritage attractions and a site of international significance, walk through our gates and you will discover a story 2,000 years in the making.
from the roman occupation of britain to the norman conquest, through civil war turbulence, a victorian transformation and even the terrors of world war 2, these walls have seen it all.
wales is world-renowned for its castles but, here in cardiff, we’re proud to be a little different; having not only survived the centuries but evolved with them in a fashion few others can claim.

2000 years of history in the heart of the city
it all started in the 1st century ad by the romans who built the first in a series of forts. in the 11th century, the normans constructed the keep that still dominates the castle green to this day. the medieval lords of glamorgan began work on the house during the 15th century.
the bute family left their mark on the entire city in the 19th century, they also transformed the house into the opulent victorian gothic home it is today. during world war ii the walls which surround the castle were used as air raid shelters; a place of safety for thousands of cardiff citizens. a reconstruction of the shelters has been opened for visitors to explore.
