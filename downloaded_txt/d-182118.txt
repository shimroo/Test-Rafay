salvation
why do i
                                need to be saved?
god
                                leaves no doubt about our
                                condition. while we set our
                                standards of right and wrong by
                                society's values, god’s
                                standard is his own holiness. how
                                do we measure up? "all have
                                sinned and come short of the
                                glory of god" (romans 3:23).
                                it is only fair that god demands
                                holiness; that is how he first
                                created mankind. we have rebelled
                                against him as a race and as
                                individuals.
our
                                pathway away from god has brought
                                its consequences. "the wages
                                of sin is death" (romans
                                6:23a). the bible compares sin to
                                a cruel slave master. there is no
                                mercy in suffering, no freedom
                                from bondage, no lasting joy, no
                                hope for the future. most
                                frightening is the final
                                consequence of sin. the bible
                                warns that without god’s
                                salvation, death is the doorway
                                to eternal punishment (hebrews
                                9:27). 
it
                                is from this that we need to be
                                saved. from our own sin. from its
                                bondage. from its consequences.
                                "how shall we escape if we
                                neglect so great salvation?"
                                (hebrews 2:3).
how does
                                god say i can be saved?
god
                                is holy and god is love. his
                                holiness demands that our sin be
                                punished in full. his love
                                provides a way for us to be saved
                                from this punishment. how is this
                                possible? someone was willing to
                                suffer what we deserve. our
                                substitute had to be a sinless
                                man, able to suffer the full
                                wrath of god against our sin. the
                                only one able to take our place
                                was god’s son.
the
                                greatest display of god’s
                                love unfolded as his son left
                                heaven to become a man. born of a
                                virgin 2000 years ago, the lord
                                jesus christ lived with his
                                creation. he was unable to sin,
                                yet he showed compassion to
                                sinners all around him. men hated
                                christ because his holiness
                                exposed their sinfulness. they
                                decided to remove him by
                                crucifying him. he willingly
                                allowed them to nail him to a
                                cross of wood outside jerusalem.
                                they suspended him so they could
                                sit and watch him die. the climax
                                of god’s plan of salvation
                                had arrived as god covered the
                                earth with darkness. the bible
                                tells us that for three hours he
                                laid on his son the full
                                punishment we deserve to receive
                                for our sin. the darkness was
                                broken when jesus christ called
                                out with a loud voice, "it
                                is finished". he had
                                accomplished the mighty work,
                                god’s great plan of
                                salvation.
after
                                three days in death, christ jesus
                                rose from the dead. this is
                                evidence to all who saw him and
                                to all who read god’s word
                                that christ’s suffering
                                completely satisfied his father.
                                he was victorious over death
                                itself – the ultimate
                                consequence of our sin.
god’s
                                plan of salvation brings us into
                                the good of christ’s
                                suffering, death, and victory.
                                "for when we were yet
                                without strength, in due time,
                                christ died for the ungodly"
                                (romans 5:6).
                                "for god so loved the world,
                                that he gave his only begotten
                                son, that whosoever believeth in
                                him should not perish, but have
                                everlasting life" (john 3:16).
