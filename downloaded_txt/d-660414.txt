uga boosts georgiaâs economy by $8.4 billion

                                        the university of georgia contributed $8.4 billion to the stateâs economy in fiscal year 2024, an increase of $300 million from the previous year and a record for the stateâs flagship university. the increased economic impact was powered by growth in the number of degrees conferred at the graduate and undergraduate levels, an increase in externally funded research and the positive effects of ugaâs public service and outreach efforts across the state.

                                        from bringing more than 50 varieties to market to monitoring the growing economic impact of the blueberry, this series dives into the multidisciplinary university of georgia research behind the top-10 georgia commodity. âthe uga blueberry breeding program has been a key to the success of launching a significant commercial blueberry industry in georgia in the 1980s and helping sustain it for four decades,â said scott nesmith, professor emeritus in the college of agricultural and environmental sciences.

                                        as shocking images of the fire-blasted hills around los angeles demonstrate, wildfires have become an increasing concern in the united states, particularly in regions where suppression strategies have dominated for decades. a new study by university of georgia researcher yukiko hashida examines how prescribed burns could play a key role in mitigating wildfire risks.

                                        travis voyles has worn many hats: park tour guide, law clerk, legislative fellow, and now, secretary of natural and historic resources for the commonwealth of virginia. he credits his rural upbringing and his experiences at the university of georgiaâs college of agricultural and environmental sciences for his success. âa lot of people donât have the opportunity to be exposed to the agricultural community,â said voyles, who earned a bachelorâs degree in environmental economics and management in 2011.
