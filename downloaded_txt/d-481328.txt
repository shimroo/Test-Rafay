love your piper but wish it could do a little more? 

the piper pa 28, 32 and 34 series of aircraft are world renowned for their durability and overall reliability, but they weren’t built to maximize performance. 
fortunately, there are a number of cost effective aerodynamic improvements that we developed that can easily add 3 to up to 15 mph, while also improving rate of climb, slow speed handling (reduced stall speed, improved aileron control) and save you fuel. 
laminar flow systems, inc. has been manufacturing and selling these modifications since 1984 and we have thousands of satisfied customers worldwide. we invite you to look around and come see why we have the best made, lowest priced and best warranty of any modifications available for your piper.

what our customers say..
 







there is a definite 15-knot increase…the numbers show that it has paid for itself in one year.tom haganpiper lancei could not believe the difference. my performance improvements are way beyond anything i expected.carlos forsterpiper arrow ivthe performance change has been incredible…i can’t begin to explain how different the plane feels.john ferraropa 28 r200there is no doubt that your kit was responsible for our taking second place in the race.christoper framepiper lancethe installation was straight-forward with no surprisesmichael salishpiper arrowi see no one else other than robin thomas who makes a promise that if you’re not satisfied, no questions asked, you get your money back.jim rhoadspiper cherokee 140it had never lifted off that easily before…i am now climbing faster with a solid feel to the controls and the ride.david jacksonpiper cherokee 140i get approximately 200 feet per minute in climb increase and 15 knots in cruise. i know that i could save fuel instead of the extra speed, but i really enjoy the speed. i guess that explains why i have had the same plane for 30 years!james sandriinipiper seneca 11



 








our philosophy everything laminar flow systems makes has integrity, a design philosophy which puts the pilot 1st! we don’t sell anything unless it is guaranteed to give you increased cruise, climb & fuel economy performance.
