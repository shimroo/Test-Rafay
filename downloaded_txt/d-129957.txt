“…the charm, 50’s glamour, and sense of history win you over as you imagine relaxing by the bar and fantastic pool with clark gable and marilyn monroe, enjoying the desert air. a great location just out of town, near the main hiking trails and park entrance, tops it all off. seeing the dawn from a second-floor room is amazing. the owners have worked hard to save the building and its hollywood-star heritage, restoring this beauty to her former glory—worth every dollar of your stay!”— gr 




















 








 











 











 












 








“quaint, quiet, and friendly—we loved our stay at the palms at indian head. check-in and check-out were a breeze, even without someone at reception; our key and helpful instructions were waiting, and check-out was as simple as dropping off the key. the arrangement with red ocotillo worked out great—the food was fantastic, and the coupon was a nice touch. the hotel bar had delicious beer on tap, and every employee we met was friendly and helpful. our recently renovated room was comfy and nicely decorated. with plenty of parking and easy access to trails, it’s a great place to stay!”— sg
