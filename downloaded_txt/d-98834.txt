meet our veterinarian
dr. danielle (dani) lamarr initiated pet fixer mobile veterinary service in 1998 to reach out and help those in need. dr. dani graduated from tuskegee university school of veterinary medicine in 1997 and started practicing at the atlanta humane society as a way of giving back to the community. while there, she was fortunate enough to meet a sweet lady by the name of helen. helen was an elderly lady who smuggled her cat felix to the vet in her purse after the taxi driver told her, “no cats allowed.” helen didn’t have a choice: she lived in a retirement community, she did not drive, but she desperately needed medical attention for her furry friend.
after dr. dani cleaned out helens purse, she told her that she would never have to smuggle felix in again. from that point on, the art and compassion of house calls were born.

     excellent       based on 55 reviews                       j l  february 26, 2024    dr danni is a caring, knowledgeable and dedicated vet. her tech michael knew just how to handle my finicky dog. i love the convenience and the price is right as well             no ne  september 12, 2023    great job             rt morris-bodner  may 18, 2023    dr. dani is an incredible veterinarian. michael is very helpful & professional.  the care provided is excellent, our cats were happy & stress free after their appointments. the mobile service is so handy and much better for the pets.
thank you dr. dani, we really appreciate you coming all the way to our area and treating our cats with the best, most exceptional care possible. 5 plus stars!             terry farmer  may 13, 2023    after trying every recommended vet in town, i called these people and i couldn't be more happy with them! they were fabulous with my dog that challenges every vet in town because he is rambunctious. he was no problem for them. they are very knowledgeable and comforting. i had an emergency with my 20 year old diabetic while they were here and they took the time to fix him up good as new. thank you for all your efforts and skills. i couldn't be more impressed! i've found a vet!             nellie martins  march 10, 2023    i had such a great first experience with the pet fixer. my blue nose pit had an allergic reaction to some new calming chews i tried and i was able to get him treated. i ended up with a full wellness exam, vaccinations and new info on how to treat his ears and fur. i look forward to using their services again.             rebecca anne tullman  october 22, 2022    so far so good! my cat was sick for the first time in his life. i think he's only ever been to the vet for shots. but we had just moved a few weeks earlier and there had been lots of time in cars and lots of nights in different hotels and homes and he had just been settled in the new place for a couple of weeks and i didn't want to stress him by putting him back in the car. especially when he was sick. i was thrilled to find this option. also, since it wasn't something that required x-rays or testing, it was even lower stress. i emailed them two videos of him having a wheezing spell and they prescribed antibiotics.             joy johnston  october 15, 2022    dr. dani and michael provided wonderful care for my big shy dog murphy. she offered a detailed analysis and what would be reasonable to do to determine the cause of murphy's nasal congestion. love that they were able to fill the prescription on-site. what a wonderful service for those of us who don't drive and/or have shy pets who don't travel well.             joanna thomas  july 18, 2022    if you ever need a vet who goes over and beyond and walks extra two miles for you and your pet, call dani and michael now.
they truly care, do an amazing job, and always have an open ear for any questions. we love them so much!!!!
