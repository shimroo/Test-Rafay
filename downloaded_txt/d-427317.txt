how to use this website
    

all main pages have a navigation menu 
    at the left margin (picture panes accessed via thumbnail images do not, 
    but instead have a âbackâ button located at or near the bottom of the 
    panel to return the viewer to the referring page).
navigation menu description and color codes
on the navigation menu at top left it 
    can be seen that this site is divided into several sections, each one 
    devoted to some logical historical interest or activity, as follows:

getting 
      started: suggestions as to how to best make use of the 
      website and its navigational features, and a link to âwhat is new to 
      this siteâ page.
books: currently there is only one book listed, along with several links to get 
      immediate access to various book details and to an order blank. more 
      information regarding books by art reblitz is planned, but not yet 
      implemented.
articles and instrument profiles: the section provides access to historical articles and stories, as well 
      as to the many instrument profiles (or simple pedigrees) for hupfeld, 
      wurlitzer/philipps, welte, and others yet to be added.
the registry and rollographies: this section serves as both a registry of various 
      mechanical music items and as a research center. it features organized 
      lists or enumerations of many types, including (1) lists of extant 
      instruments and/or appurtances; (2) ledger information for various 
      mechanical music instrument manufacturers; (3) rollographies, both 
      internally generated and externally by other authors and/or 
      organizations; (4) survey forms for gathering additional information for 
      database lists and research; and (5) historical information pertinent to 
      the items or content presented.
reblitz 
      restorations: background information and restoration, tuning, and other services 
      provided by reblitz restorations and his associates, along with customer 
      comments, photos, and videos of restored instruments.
faqâs / 
      resources: audio recordings, some frequently asked questions, and links to various 
      mechanical music related resources, including venues, books, supplies, 
      and restoration sources.
contact 
      information: this section contains contact information 
      regarding book orders, technical inquiries and for reporting website 
      errors and problems, as well as a page detailing the evolution of this 
      site and various site policies.
 link errors: please report any errors regarding links to other pages and/or other 
      access problems to the mechanical music press webmaster at:

image thumbnail links to image panes
 please 
    note that throughout the site there are prominently featured thumbnail 
    images interspersed within the text, which are unmarked but functional links to image 
    panes that feature one or more much larger scale images, along with 
    oftentimes very detailed descriptions. an 
    illustration of this is the example thumbnail image picture pane link at 
    right. hold the mouse over the image and click, and see 
    what you get! there is a lot of otherwise âhiddenâ information 
    that can be quickly accessed by simply clicking on highlighted links 
    and/or the thumbnail images, and so donât miss out by ignoring these 
    links to additional treasures.
registry and rollography database reports
all registry and rollography database reports are in searchable pdf format. this means that when viewing any report in a a pdf reader, such as adobe acrobat reader, you can search the report for any string of characters. if, for instance, in a rollography report you want to find a particular roll number, tune, or composer it is possible to instantly find it by opening a search dialog box (usually using a key combination such as "ctrl-f") and then entering the appropriate character string.
