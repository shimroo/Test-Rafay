getting better water is easier than you think





if you had a glass of clean, fresh water, what would you add to it? probably not things like a little sediment, lead and chlorine. you just wouldn’t, so don’t settle for them now. an under sink or whole house water filtration system can help reduce those impurities and improve the taste and smell of your water.  

upgrading your home’s water is far easier than you may realize when you choose a water filtration system from solventum. our whole house and under sink systems can be quickly installed by any plumber or experienced diy homeowner. and replacing filter cartridges is a snap! 




















































play



























see the importance of your home’s water quality




watch: improve your water. improve your home. 




from the moment we wake up until we turn in for the night, water plays a big role in our daily lives. whether we’re taking showers, sipping coffee, filling dog bowls or brushing teeth, water is an important part of many home routines. see all the areas of your home where quality water can help improve your daily life. 


























filtered substances




household water can have a variety of impurities, and each home water filtration system from solventum has a list of which and how many impurities they are designed to remove. if any of these things are in your water, our filtration solutions could enhance your water quality:












                        sediment
                    
sediment from your water supply can damage your plumbing and appliances and also affect the taste of your water. the right filter can provide you with cleaner, clearer and better-tasting water while also helping to protect your pipes and appliances. 


















                        chlorine and chloramines 
                    
commonly used to treat municipal water, the taste and smell of chlorine and chloramines can be a problem. most people can taste and/or smell chlorine or chloramines at concentrations below five mg per liter and some at levels as low as 0.5 mg per liter.¹


















                        lead
                    
it’s clear that lead in water isn’t good for anyone, and it can’t be seen, smelled or tasted if it’s in your water. we can help you reduce it and improve the quality of your water. 


















                        microplastics
                    
microplastics are tiny fragments that form as plastics slowly break down. some plastics are designed to be tiny, like microbeads. they can find their way into water sources used for residential water supplies. 
























                        mineral scale 
                    
mineral scale forms from dissolved minerals in your water and may damage your plumbing and water-using appliances, like your water heater and washing machine. reducing scale can help reduce plumbing issues and expensive appliance repairs.  


















                        waterborne cysts 
                    
cysts are a dormant state of many microbes. when present in water, microbial cysts can become active and result in gastrointestinal illness.² 


















                        volatile organic compounds
                    
the category of voc (volatile organic compounds) includes several chemicals that are both man-made and naturally occurring. a voc reduction claim by the manufacturer indicates that the system reduces the concentration of some or all these chemicals.


















                        emerging contaminants 
                    
many pharmaceutical, personal care and hormone-disrupting substances are starting to show up in drinking water. reducing such emerging contaminants can help improve your drinking water quality.

from a single sink to your whole house 




household water can have a variety of impurities, and each home water filtration system from solventum has a list of which and how many impurities they are designed to remove. if any of these things are in your water, our filtration solutions could enhance your water quality:












                        why choose an under sink water filter?
                    
an under sink system reduces contaminants right at the tap or dedicated faucet to deliver cleaner, clearer water for drinking, cooking, making ice, coffee, tea or other beverages. these compact, easy-to-maintain systems are so easy to install you can do it yourself in under an hour, and in most cases, without cutting pipes or shutting off water to the entire house. replacing filter cartridges is also very easy.*

                        why choose a whole house water filter?
                    
a whole house water filtration system reduces contaminants at the pipe where your water comes into your house. that way, you can enjoy cleaner filtered water throughout your home. not only will you enjoy good flow rates at all your taps, you’ll also help protect your water pipes and appliances from corrosion and damage. depending on the water conditions and the filter system installed, each filter cartridge can last up to 6 months or even up to 12 months, before needing replacement.*

reference and notes
*replace filter cartridge no later than the timeframe of use indicated on the product. if the rated gallon capacity is reached or if there is a noticeable reduction in flow rate, or a change in odor or taste occurs before that time, then replace filter promptly.
