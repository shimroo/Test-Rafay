who do we serve?




““my experience at seed was both enriching and motivating. seed always pushed me to be better, and they pushed me to make college a priority. college is something major for me, my family, and where i come from. seed has prepared me so much for this step in my life.””

— artiase, seed dc '09, ohio wesleyan '13, trinity washington, '18

seed exists to change the odds



we believe in our students and graduates—that their potential is not pre-determined by their zip code, and neither are their dreams.we believe every moment is a chance to learn something new. our students have opportunities to interact with the world around them, both near and far, so that they understand how they are a part of it. we believe in the potential of a 24-hour learning environment to empower students to take ownership of their educational journeys and accomplish anything they set their minds to.
