indian heritage - info on indian art and culture









































follow on 



india is a
land of diverse cultures. the variations in physical, climatic conditions
and the extent of exposure to other cultures have greatly influenced the
traditions and culture of the different regions. there is an underlying
basic factor common to the whole of india, with variations in the practices
based on their local needs and influences. further, the greatness
of india has been in accepting the best from all the invaders and intermingling
the new customs and styles with the existing - this is visible in all aspects
- music, dance, painting, sculptures, architecture.

the
article, an excerpt from the introduction to the book "the art and architecture
of india" by benjamin rowland puts it all in a nutshell

indian-heritage.org, is a non-commercial site, wherein i attempt to 
collect and provide information on all topics relating to indian art, 
culture and tradition in my spare time.
information has been collected & compiled from books, media, 
professionals in the related fields. my thanks to all those who have 
helped me in this venture.

i am from chennai, tamilnadu, south india. my mother tongue is tamil, 
and as such there are several tamil words used in the site. wherever 
possible, i have
tried to provide an explanation for the terms.

i have received criticisms that i am deliberately avoiding certain 
topics, but this is not out of indifference to the subject, but lack of 
sufficient knowledge on the topic and time. i try to add information on a
 regular basis and appreciate the sharing of any genuine and relevant 
information, which will be featured in the site with all due credit.
