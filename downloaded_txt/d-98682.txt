holy trinity's capital campaign
 

what a wonderful evening for our community, honoring the founders of our church, with gratitude for their sacrificial giving to make sure the greek orthodox church was established in raleigh, the beautiful capital city of north carolina! over 350 of us gathered and raised an additional $350,000+ for our beautiful new sanctuary! the evening was full of a sense of warmth, purpose, fun and fellowship, as we saw the vision for our future while dancing together with the spirit of a healthy community! we honor them by building our lord's church for future generations! the holy spirit worked in each of us that evening, and we are looking forward to next year's gala celebration! stay tuned!
