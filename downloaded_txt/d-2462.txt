should i cut someone toxic out of my life?
i have someone in my life that i've determined is toxic and doesn't make me feel good. but it's so much more complicated than that – we have history, we've had good times together, and cutting them off completely feels like a big jump that i'm not sure i'm reaady for. if i cut them off, will i experience regret or negative blowback? what might go wrong if i do?  maybe i just need a pep talk...

help potty training a puppy
i have a 5-month-old puppy and i’m really overwhelmed with potty training. i feel like i’m taking her outside every hour to try and avoid accidents and half of the time we just end up staring at each other while she whimpers. i just have no idea if i’m doing this right or not. i’ve watched videos and stuff about rewards and reinforcement but it just feels like nothing is really sticking? any advice?
