a word from our pastor

at first baptist we strive to provide the people who attend our services with a friendly and meaningful experience. the singing is inspirational, the worship is exciting and the preaching is challenging. it is our desire to help christians grow in their spiritual lives where they can experience the abundant life and be a shining light in this dark world in which we live. our main goal is that everyone have the opportunity to experience salvation through the saving power of jesus christ. there are many ministry opportunities for all ages at first baptist. please come and join us each week for a time of dynamic worship and preaching from god's word.​sincerely, dr. chuck conley
