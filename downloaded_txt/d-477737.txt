what is carnatic music? : it is the classical music of southern india. the basic form is a monophonic song with improvised variations. there are 72 basic scales on the octave, and a rich variety of melodic motion. both melodic and rhythmic structures are varied and compelling. this is one of the world's oldest & richest musical traditions. 
			

why carnatic music? "...i [todd m. mccomb] value carnatic music first for the effectiveness with which it can build positive mental discipline. it helps me to focus and organize my thoughts, and it helps to eliminate negative mental habits..." - (details) 
			



			music is one of life's greatest pleasures.
	i intend this to be the best reference for carnatic music on the web.
	philip greenspun states that : the best thing someone can say about a web service is "i got my question answered there."
	if your question is not answered... please do ask.
	i  believe that a person is only as valuable as they are of help to others.
	your comments and suggestions are most welcome too.
