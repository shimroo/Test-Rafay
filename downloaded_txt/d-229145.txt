brenda was on the ball because she realized i had booked my departure incorrectly and was flying into the wrong airport for the tour. she called me at home and i was able to correct it with the airline at no additional cost to me. i was very thankful !

we cannot begin to say what an excellent job that our travel agent, cheryl has always done for us, she consistently does an outstanding job. we are not seasoned travelers and she has always been very patient with us. when we inquire about anything her response is both rapid and fitting. if we were to able to travel more she would be our first choice to utilize due to her fine attitude and talent.
