                                        wondered why you should keep a
                                        vintage chambers, rather than
                                        purchase an dull, ordinary,
                                        "modern" range?
if so, you
                                        may want to read the following:

thick,
                                    juicy steaks. . . 


steaks and
                            chops broiled with the tang of an outdoor
                            fire...grilled vegetables
                              to tease the most jaded appetite...fruits
                              and desserts with that brown, sugary crust
                              that comes only by hot, quick
                              cooking...these are the products of a chambers range...of the patented
                              smokeless broiler and griddle.
 

 

vegetables with all
                                  their health-giving goodness



   










                                fresh vegetables, green vegetables,
                                cooked in their own juices, with
                                health-giving vitamins and minerals
                                retained...vegetables tender yet
                                colorful, delicious yet
                                healthful...these are more products of
                                the chambers
                                range...of the patented thermowell.



rich,
                                    appetizing roasts. . .  
 

    tender
                                cuts, tough cuts, fresh meat, smoked
                                meat...all melt in your mouth when
                                cooked with the gas turned completely
                                off, on retained heat. they cannot dry
                                out or shrivel...they remain juicy. you will never
                                know how delicious a roast can be until
                                you have tasted one cooked in a chambers
                                range!

 

pastries
                                    baked to the queen's taste. . . 

 
your old
                            favorites, grandmother's sugar pie, aunty's
                            pound cake, all come out of the modern,
                            heat-controlled, retained heat range with no
                            fuss or bother. even the bride who "couldn't
                            boil water" can please her husband with
                            home-baked dainties - if she uses a modern,
                            heat-controlled chambers range.
