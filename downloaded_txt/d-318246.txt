the
u.s. naval landing party
was formed in the fall of 1997 by union naval reenactors
in the new england area and has since spread to include members across the 
country. our group portrays the activities of a landing party of union sailors 
and marines during the civil war -- a little known role for the navy in the 
1861-65 conflict.

we are a member unit of the navy & marine living
history association (nmlha) and offer enlistment to people
of all ages, gender, and races (yes, the u.s. navy was integrated
during and before the civil war). interested parties may apply to serve as
sailors, marines or civilians (the sole stipulation as regards age being that
children under sixteen must be accompanied in their enlistment by a responsible
parent or guardian). if you enjoy talking with the public and sharing a unique 
perspective on history, join the usnlp!
throughout the war between the states, 
the federal navy routinely landed  parties of sailors and marines ashore on 
raids, reconnaissance or to aid the regular land forces. these were ad hoc 
groups comprised of men from the ships of the local squadron. shore parties 
varied in size from a single lieutenant who might offer his services as staff 
officer for the day to an army general or up to several thousand men landed to attack fort fisher at wilmington,
north carolina. the usnlp represents a group such as might have been landed from
a flotilla of gunboats supporting the army along one of the many rivers that
laced the confederacy.
if you are interested in finding out
more about the usnlp, information on membership, subscriptions to the unit
newsletter "beat to quarters!", information is available on a
separate page. the links following the fort fisher illustration will take
you to original articles and research by the usnlp, to other sites with
information about the navies of the period and their role in the war, and to a
variety of resources for nautical reenactors.
"we
landed sixteen sailors and a boat howitzer, and they did more fighting than a
whole regiment of soldiers!"
(roswell lamson, lieutenant, usn)

"board in a manly
fashion!"
(david dixon porter, rear admiral, usn,
orders to the naval assault forces at fort fisher)
