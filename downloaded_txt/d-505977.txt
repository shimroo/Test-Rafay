new england council honors
        jack williams


jack williams was honored as a 2015 “new englander of the year” by the new england council.
      the award is in recognition of his remarkable career as one of our region’s most respected television news anchors, as well as his tireless work to help children find adoptive families through wednesday’s child. read the letter here!


 


the joy of giving 





2015 wednesday child grants have been sent totalling $455,000!

                                also, marci and i are proud that we were ahead of the curve when we established a scholarship at the university of oregon with preference given for students who have benefitted from adoption or foster family care services.  it is fully funded and will continue in perpetuity.  in the latest oregon quarterly there is a lengthy article on former foster kids who have prospered at the university of oregon.  our scholarship was established with personal funds and has no ties with the jack and marci williams endowment for wednesday's child (which focuses on group homes in new england looking after special needs kids awaiting adoptive homes).
