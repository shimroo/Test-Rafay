oregon state university was founded more than 150 years ago as a land grant institution, building on the idea that everybody deserves access to education. when it opened in 2016, the osu-cascades campus fulfilled a 30-year quest for higher education in what had been the largest region in the state without a four-year university. we are growing for central oregon and beyond.
