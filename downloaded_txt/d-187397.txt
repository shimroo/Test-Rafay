h5n1 update
anti-cruelty is urging cat owners to take precautions by ensuring their felines remain indoors to prevent the hunting and consumption of wild birds who may be infected with h5n1, or "avian flu." symptoms of h5n1 in cats include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, respiratory issues such as green discharge from the eyes and nose, or even neurological signs like tremors or seizures. 
if you notice these symptoms, contact your veterinarian immediately. according to the latest available information, at least 56 cases have been confirmed in domestic cats within the united states. anti-cruelty is closely following recommendations from the us food and drug administration and the us centers for disease control and prevention to reduce the risk of the virus's spread.
visit anticruelty.org/avianflu for more information and updates.
