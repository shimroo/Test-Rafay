seminar / reunie dr. khoe en wang kiu


zondag 8 juli zal er een seminar plaatsvinden in leiden met niemand minder dan sifu dr. khoe (de eerste leerling van sifu wang kiu) uit canada en sifu wang kiu, ons aller sifu/sigung. sifu dr. khoe komt voor ongeveer 1 week naar nederland speciaal voor sifu wang kiu en daarnaast voor het geven van een eenmalig seminar.
het seminar zal een dubbel karakter hebben, ernerzijds van reunie, anderszijds van nieuwe contacten. daarbij zijn alle wang kiu scholen uiteraard van harte uitgenodigd. zonder enthousiaste mensen kan een seminar niet plaatsvinden en daarom wordt iedereen gevraagd om te reageren op deze mail, inclusief alle leerlingen, assistent leraren en andere enthousiaste mensen. graag dus een bericht terug of je bij dit unieke seminar aanwezig zal zijn.
de kosten zijn 40 euro per persoon (incl. dvd). neem even contact op als je erbij wil zijn: 06 5205 1122.
kortom, genoeg redenen om erbij te zijn. we gaan uit van een grote opkomst, mede omdat sifu dr. khoe als 1 van de beste leerlingen wordt bestempeld door sifu wang kiu en mede omdat beide personen er voor ons zullen zijn! zorg ervoor dat je bij deze unieke dag aanwezig zult zijn zodat sifu wang kiu trots mag zijn op al zijn leerlingen en de leerlingen daar weer van!
wing chun klas uit 1982 (sifu wang kiu en sifu dr. khoe in het midden bovenaan)
groetjes, sifu martijn.

history of wing chun (by yip man)


the founder of the wing chun style, yim wing-chun was a native of guangdong in china. she was an intelligent and athletic young girl, upstanding and forthright. her mother died soon after her betrothal to leung bok-cho, a salt merchant of fujian. her father, yim yee, was wrongfully accused of a crime and, rather than risk jail, they slipped away and finally settled down at the foot of daliang mountain near the border between yunnan and sichuan provinces. there they earned a living by running a shop that sold bean curd.
during the reign of emperor kangxi of the qing dynasty (1662-1722) fighting skills became very strong in the shaolin monastary of songshan, in henan province. this aroused the fear of the manchurian government, which sent troops to attack the monastery. although they were unsuccessful, a man named chan man-wai, a recently appointed civil servant seeking favor with the government, suggested a plan. he plotted with shaolin monk named ma ning-yee and others who were persuaded to betray their companions by setting fire to the monastery while soldiers attacked it from the outside. shaolin was burned down, and the monks and disciples scattered. ng mui, jee shim, bak mei, fung do-dak and miu hin escaped and went their separate ways.
ng mui took refuge in the white crane temple on daliangshan. it was there she met yim yee and his daughter wing-chun from whom she often bought bean curd on her way home from the market. at fifteen, with her hair bound up in the custom of those days to show she was of an age to marry, wing-chun's beauty attracted the attention of a local bully. he tried to force wing-chun to marry him, and his continuous threats became a source of worry to her and her father. ng mui learned of this and took pity on wing-chun. she agreed to teach wing-chun fighting techniques so she could protect herself. wing chun followed ng mui into the mountains, and began to learn fighting skills. she trained night and day, until she mastered the techniques. then she challenged the bully to a fight and beat him.
ng mui later traveled around the country, but before she left she told wing-chun to strictly honor the martial arts traditions, to develop her fighting skills after her marriage, and to help the people working to overthrow the manchu government and restore the ming dynasty.
after her marriage wing-chun taught martial arts to her husband leung bok-lao. he in turn passed these techniques on to leung lan-kwai. leung lan-kwai then passed them on to wong wah-bo. wong wah-bo was a member of an opera troupe on board a red junk. wong worked on the red junk with leung yee-tai. it so happened that jee shim, who fled from shaolin, had disguised himself as a cook and was then working on the red junk. jee shim taught the six-and-a-half-point pole techniques to leung yee-tai. wong wah-bo was close to leung yee tei and they shared what they knew about martial arts. together they shared and improved their techniques, and thus the six-and-a-half-point pole was incorporated into the wing chun style. leung yee-tai passed his knolwledge on to leung jan, a well known doctor in foshan. leung jan grasped the innermost secrets of wing chun, attaining the highest level of proficiency. many masters came to challenge him, but all were defeated. leung jan became very famous. later he passed his knowledge on to chan wah-shan who took me and my sihing, such as ng siu-lo, ng jung-so, chan yu-min and lui yiu-chai, as his students many decades ago.
it can thus be said that the wing chun system was passed on to us in a direct line of succession from its origin. i write this history of the wing chun system in respectful memory of my forerunners. i am eternally grateful to them for passing to me the skills i now possess. when drinking of the the water, a man should always think of the source; it is this shared feeling that keeps our brothers together.
is this not the way to promote martial arts, and to project the image of our country?
