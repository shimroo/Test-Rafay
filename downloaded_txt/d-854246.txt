coster scott photographs





the art lover’s journey begins in boston at four seasons hotel one dalton street
“for this site-specific commission, boston-based photographer alexander coster scott captured the expansive views from the top of one dalton. he carefully annotated each photograph with the view by compass point, date and time the image was taken, along with his technical specifications. the round framing device recalls early photographic methods such as daguerreotypes and tintypes. the blending of the historical with the new is seen everywhere in boston., and these contemporary views hang in ever single guest room and suite.
kate chertavian (curator), lucy rosenburgh (curator), four seasons collection.
…a deeper dive into the hotel’s works reveal pieces from artist…alex katz, louis nevelson, terry winters, alexander coster scott, and james stroud.”
