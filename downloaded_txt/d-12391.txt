our paperback, "the over-scheduled child: avoiding the hyper-parenting trap" (formerly titled "hyper-parenting") explains why it is better -- in the short and long run -- for parents and kids alike to slow down, do less, and generally turn the volume down on family life. this book will make you feel happier about yourself as a parent, and calmer about your child as a person. best of all?  this is how to raise children who will succeed in life!





lists
and schedules, meetings and appointments, that need to be the best no matter
what - doesnt it sound like your life? if its not - its your childs.
parenting today has come to resemble a relentless to-do list. even
parents with the best intentions strive to micromanage every detail of
their kids lives and live in constant fear that their child will underperform
in any area - academic, social, athletic. the fact is, parenting
should not consume every last bit of our time, money and energy.
its not good for us as parents, and its potentially dangerous for our
children and their healthy development.
luckily, there is a cure for hyper-parenting. in their groundbreaking book, renowned child psychiatrist alvin rosenfeld, m.d., and longtime family-issues journalist nicole wise identify and attack this rampant phenomenon. with the strength of their combined professional and personal experience, rosenfeld and wise tell you how to identify the hyper-parent in yourself and prescribe clear, comforting steps to make parenting a happier and healthier experience
for you and your child.   read more...
