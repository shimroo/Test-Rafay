site news
if your audio isn't working with (most) modern browsers,
please use the site control panel to change your audio settings to 'mp3'.
be sure to click on 'save changes' in the lower-left corner to apply the setting. this step is necessary because unfortunately we are not able to modify the
'default' value(s) for any site settings at this time.

also, please note that this website has two different "search/lookup" features which 
are completely separate. while both modes accept english or thai search terms for fully searching our online thai dictionary, the "lookup" box in 
the upper left corner is generally the less useful one because it may provide too many results, and in a random order.

instead, consider using the dictionary search panel on the 
dictionary tab (at the top of the page) when looking up thai 
words and phrases. this search has a few improvements that you might find helpful. most notably, this mode uses frequency information from a thai news corpus to present the
search results in order, with the most common results first.
