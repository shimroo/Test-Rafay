anti-racism begins at homein 2017, methodist federation for social action made a commitment to focus special energy on dismantling racism within our church and society. seeking to do this work, we realized, “how can we call out racism and prejudice in others, if we haven’t done our own work within our own organization?”we have completed an organizational racial audit to help us move toward becoming a more anti-racist and anti-oppression organization. we invite you to join us in this transformational work. we can’t do this alone.
