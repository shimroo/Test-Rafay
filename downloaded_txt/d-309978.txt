saturday 2/15 7:00 am:  another windy one out there for ya.  pretty heavy stuff coming out of the north east that''ll carry throughout the day.  swell is picking up through the week and could line up for some fun waves. definitely worth checking back in the afternoon once the wind settles down.  we will be open from 10 am until 7 pm.
