keynote speaker
confidence























i had the pleasure of attending a continuing education event with janice as the speaker a year ago discussing dental practice image. the doctor and myself were thoroughly impressed with janice’s confidence, and took several ideas back to our office. we recently had janice come into our office for professional consulting. our office has never had a consultant come in, so we didn’t know a lot of what to expect. we were very impressed with her knowledge and wisdom that she shared with our office. her confidence with her suggestions made it impossible to doubt the outcome. we have begun to retrain ourselves in small things we do and things we say. i have absolute confidence that when we really get in our “groove” with her suggestions, that we will have a tremendous outcome!! already coordinating our next in-office consulting visit!! highly recommend!!!

			janice hurley is the real deal! thanks to our doctor, our dental team had the privilege of attending janice's seminars at the american dental association's annual meeting in washington, d.c. and most recently during our local dental convention in buffalo, n.y. her two programs, your image-your brand-your success and clinical etiquette were outstanding!

her material is honest, useful and immediately applicable! for example, the importance of our body language and social skills. we learned how the appropriate words can and will enhance our relationships with our patients and co-workers. janice's presentation style is engaging, interactive and fun from start to finish! she has the ability to connect with every person in the room and she does!

i highly recommend janice hurley to any doctor and dental team looking to take their practice to the next level!
