 favorite quotes
(march - april, 2011) 



"in my experience the most genuine form of therapy around these days is transpersonal therapy, also known as holotropic breathwork or rebirthing, combined with various other modalities such as sand play, myth, dance, dream work and emotional release work, typified by the primal therapy approach. these therapies explore our inner world and allow us to express hidden emotions" 
 -- lee albert,  amazing grace


"trauma essentially plays a role in causing or triggering most if not all mental illness."   -- robert scaer, m.d., the trauma spectrum



"huge amounts of evidence support the view that the "conscious self" is in fact a very small portion of the mind's activity. . . . (w)e can say that for the most part, the self is not divided by some line between a conscious and a nonconscious self.  rather, the self is created by nonconscious processes, as well as by the selection associations of these processes into something we call 'consciousness.'  to put it another way, we are much, much more than our conscious processes."   --daniel j. siegel, m.d. the developing mind, 1999 





"it seemed to me that the (ibogaine) session dealt with the major soul changes surrounding my childhood traumas.  it was as if the session was a major soul catharsis that happened so quickly and suddenly that i did not have the power to resist it.  the suddenness of the experience  was the perfect opportunity to reach down deeply into my inner being and take out whatever cancer was living there.  it felt as though the psychological backlog on my life was being downloaded in one massive inner encounter.   i was wafted along as though in a slipstream.  whenever i tried to hold on, the force of the flow would pull me away and back into the stream, i.e., i was forced to leave an issue and move on.  i saw things i would simply never have considered in my own psychological enquiry and indeed would have rejected were another to suggest them to me.  how then could traditional psychotherapy have worked for me?  suddenly i knew how much i didn't know and the years of confusion and self-argument and counter-argument began to dissipate into a knowing whole."  
--lee albert - amazing grace 





"since birth-traumatized infants tend to cry more than those not traumatized and since excessive crying by infants is a potent trigger for child abuse, it can be concluded that birth trauma is an important factor contributing to child abuse." 
 --  aletha solter  ph. d. in  tears for trauma:  birth trauma, crying and child abuse from primal renaissance:  the journal of primal psychology

primal therapy was discovered by arthur janov, ph.d. in the late 1960s. 
with e. michael holden, m.d., a neurologist and at that time, medical
director of the primal institute, dr. janov formulated a rich body of
knowledge relating to why and how primal therapy works (see the
bibliography reference below for a listing of dr. janov's writings).
criticized by some because he does
not reveal his techniques for inducing primal regression, janov has
steadfastly insisted that dissemination of this information into the
hands of the untrained is dangerous.
 a clinical psychologist and successful songwriter, dr. janov, in his late eighties,  presently operates the primal training center  in venice, california. his book,   sexualité et la subconscient was published in france 2006.  it will soon be published in the u.s. as sex and the subconscious. his forthcoming book, life before birth, is scheduled for printing in early 2011.  
the first primal center was the primal institute, which for many years was associated with its founder. the center is
presently operated by dr. janov's former wife, vivian janov. the
institute earlier published the primal therapy journal and still publishes the primal institute newsletter. to view a less than complete listing of its articles, click on  index. since
the late 1960s many articles and books have been written about primal
therapy. stephen khamsi, ph.d., a primal therapist in san francisco,
has compiled such a bibliography.
