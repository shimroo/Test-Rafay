-  mindy grossman we had a wonderful experience with crisp architects. we wanted a pool house the reflection our love of italy and food and we totally achieved this. i would highly recommend crisp architects. they were wonderful to deal with and we love our pool house. would love to use them again for a future project. -  piedmont1 jimmy designed our home, from the ground up, and he and lin chamberlain built it. we could not be happier. it was a wonderful and easy experience working with them, and the result is a great, comfortable, and charming home. jimmy and his staff were at all times helpful and responsive, and lin and his crew were the same. the house was built on time, in spite of difficult conditions (unseasonable ice, and cold) and it is solid, warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and easy to live in. jimmy was and is flexible and responsive in his approach to our needs, while maintaining a wonderful design aesthetic that is garnered many complements. i highly recommend jimmy for any project. -  sz kronovet i found crisp architects' website many years ago,  forging our dream of hiring jimmy crisp to design our hypothetical addition to our small  house built in 1785. ten years later, with a comparatively small budget than their norm, located across the river, in orange county, new york, i wrote an email to ask if we were worthy. almost immediately,  i was treated to a personal phone call from jimmy crisp, and began to feel the kind, white glove treatment they naturally provide.  from that first conversation, to where we are today at mid-construction of an incredible addition and renovation that crisp architects designed, i cannot say enough about the entire team and level of expertise.   they are not only the sweetest people, but they are true experts in their trade, and particularly with historic architecture.  communication with crisp architects is immediate, reaction to your ideas is open minded and responded to with honest, valuable feedback, usually adding a new way of thinking to consider. my husband appreciates how crisp successfully blended our old house architecture with the addition so beautifully, and how the team remains engaged with  you and the project until its completion.  we could not be more thrilled and we only hope to be able to hire them again for additional building on the property! never once did i feel like we had the small project across the river, and they have kept us in our modest budget.  we love crisp architects! -  laura bryson crisp architects are a wonderful team headed by james crisp. they listen well and then go off and create a beautiful plan. remodeling can be very stressful but with crisp architects as your partner you can be sure all the details are taken care of. we could not be more pleased with results. -  margaret van sicklen jimmy crisp and his team did an outstanding job designing our screened in porch, expanding family room, and new kitchen. jimmy's plan provided us with an improved indoor and outdoor living space that better accommodates the way in which we live, and in addition, allows us to maximize the use of our home. jimmy and his team could not have been nicer and more professional as we progressed from the early stages of this project through the construction phase. i will not hesitate to use crisp architects in the future. -  louis a parks we hired crisp architects to design and oversee the renovation of our 100 year old barn and carriage house home. their design was respectful of the historic nature of the house while bringing it up to date with all the necessary modern conveniences. i have nothing but positive things to say about our experience with crisp architects from the level of service of every employee to the beautiful end product. in fact, since our renovation, we have been asked several times to include our home in the historic homes tour in our area. -  d. gonickthank you!we’ve just sent you an email. click on the link in there to confirm your subscription.       close
