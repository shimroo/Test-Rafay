why aafp insurance 



















we answer to the academy, not to an insurance company 











a wholly owned subsidiary of the aafp foundation, we are solely responsible to you — the academy and its 129,600 members nationwide. 











we understand that family physicians are likely to spend more time caring for others than they do themselves 











with so many insurance and financial choices in the marketplace, it’s hard to know which is best for you. we offer a wide range of aafp-endorsed coverage from top-rated carriers. and we offer the guidance of insurance specialists who understand your unique needs. 











our group buying power adds value to the insurance products we offer  











our valuable insurance products offer exclusive pricing, benefits and features that may cost less than those offered to the general public and from those offered by other medical associations. our rates are negotiated using aafp’s collective buying power and designed to save you money.
