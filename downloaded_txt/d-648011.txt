auto racing is one of the most popular sports all over the world. it involves automobile car races set to the fastest time over a certain distance or time limit. auto racing began soon after gasoline fueled automobiles were made.
the main goal of car racing is to set the fastest time in a set number of rounds or time limit. the final order is determined by total amount of race time, with the fastest time in first place, second place and so on. any motorist failing to complete a race for any reason is considered as retired, or usually out.
there is a large range of types of auto racing, including grand prix racing, midget-car racing, stock-car racing, sports-car racing, speedway racing, drag racing, and karting, as well as hill climbs and trials.
dirt track racing is popular where cars race around an oval dirt track, and includes race types such as sprint car racing, autograss, banger racing, and autospeedway. similar events, but on a different surface, is car ice racing.

please join us

for a fire school being put on at pacific raceways on saturday, february 1st or sunday, february 2nd. mike evans has pulled together many people to make this happen. 
also, at this time there is no fire training planned at pir, so this is a great opportunity to learn and see another track if you haven’t already visited our fellow regions up north. 
there will also be flagging and communication refresher training. while this is geared towards our trackside volunteers, drivers are welcome as well! this is a one day event, but you can come to both if you’d like.
