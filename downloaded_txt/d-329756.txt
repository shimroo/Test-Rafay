i was so excited to get this i realized i never posted about it. my beautiful and loving wife @itcouldbepic got me this super sweet apple @swellbottle water bottle for our 4th wedding anniversary. not only is this particular s'well bottle cool looking, but it’s only available at the newly renovated apple store on the campus of apple inc. in cupertino, ca. pickle got the help of our friend @thelevicole who had connections at this store and had it shipped to #texas. if that’s not love, i don’t know what is. #wifey #loveher #swellbottle #1infiniteloop #apple

owncloud gmail smtp→
i’ve been playing with setting up owncloud on my raspberry pi, and i was struggling with getting it to send emails using my google apps email accounts using their smtp, and this is exactly what i needed. figured i would share in case some random googler needs the help....
"mail_smtpmode" => 'smtp',
"mail_smtphost" => 'ssl://smtp.gmail.com:465',
"mail_smtpauth" => true,
"mail_smtpname" => 'your_account@gmail.com',
"mail_smtppassword" => 'your_account_password',
