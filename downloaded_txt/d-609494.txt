running tips
when it comes to running, we've been there, done that, now serving 714 tips in 15 categories ranging from author intro to women's running shoes.











when the race gets cancelled
 marathons don't get cancelled very often. it takes a real act of nature. but if your race does get cancelled, some options: 
-look for a smaller race around the same time. if your big city marathon was cancelled, you might be able to find a small or midsize race within a few weeks of your original marathon. you may not have the huge crowds, but small marathons are often as well-organized and well-supported as large ones, with plenty of folks to point you along the course, even if there aren't bands on every corner and thousands of runners surrounding you. 
-plan your own. if you are really ready to run 26.2 on your appointed day, just do it! take one of your long training run routes, and figure out a way to add enough mileage to make the marathon distance. chalk it up to a training run, and look for another marathon to race.

take inspiration from the best
marathon running is not for the faint of heart, but it can be for anyone who wants to work hard, as the olympics take place in london, get inspired by the olympic marathoners. yes, they can train full time and have coaches and massage therapists, etc., but the distance is still 26.2, and all marathoners out there have completed the same distance, whether they do it in just over 2 hours or just over 6 hours. the marathon is a personal race, and anyone who finishes one deserves their medal.
if you are watching the olympics, don't be intimidated. be inspired!

got toe pain? could be sesamoiditis
i'm currently building up my marathon training again after some time of low mileage running. unfortunately, i have since developed a bunion, and i've had some pain under the ball of my foot that i suspect is sesamoiditis. i had problems with that before, and some extra padding in my orthotics did the trick eventually, as i build up mileage, my foot healed and adapated, so i expect that will happen again, but i'm going to the podiatrist to make sure i have the right kind of padding.
the sesamoid bones are small bones in the ball of the foot, below the big toe. if you have been increasing your mileage, or doing speed work or hill work, and you have pain here, sesamoiditis could be the cause. there won't be any visible redness or bruising, usually, and ice can help, but it's important to address whatever biomechanics are involved, so don't hesitate to see a podiatrist to make sure you get it right.

acclimation is the key to summer survival
are you training for a fall marathon? if you started training in the spring but are new to running, you may be in for a surprise when the summer heat kicks in.
the best way to manage long training runs in the summer is to acclimate yourself to the heat with some shorter runs. if your training schedule calls for 13 miles and it is a hot day, go for 10 instead, to get used to the heat, and then do the 13 the next week.

spring cross training: mow the lawn
there are many ways to cross train that don't have to involve a trip to the gym, and in the spring, runners with yards can feel that they get twice the benefits by mowing the lawn.
first, you get a nicer looking lawn, so you aren't an embarassment to the neighborhood.
second, you get a total body workout. pushing the mower works your legs, (especially if you have hills to deal with) as well as your shoulders and back. if you haven't mowed a lawn since last spring, you'll feel like you have had a bit of a workout!

care for calluses
all runners get calluses. they aren't anything to worry about, but they can be unsightly
some callus care tips:
-file your feet: buy one of those foot files from a pharmacy, or get a fancier one from a beauty supply store. file your calluses when your feet are dry, maybe before bed or before a shower.
-use bandaids as needed: sometimes a callus develops in the aftermath of a blister. if you have a blister on your foot, keep it covered with a band aid until it bursts, and then until it starts to dry up. if it eventually forms a callus, see the previous tip about filing.
