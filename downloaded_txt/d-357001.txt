what makes the formulary books i
& ii so invaluable 
is that they are from the inner workings of mr. slater’s shop


  
 the magickal childe   

new york's oldest witchcraft center.



this formulary grimoire is worth its weight in gold simply because 
some of the most effective and potent recipes for magick spells, incense and 
oils 
utilized in the craft are within their pages.
magic spells
slater guarded these recipes more tightly than a restaurant's 5-star chef,    
and now these secrets are available to you...
