welcome to artistic gardens & le jardin du gourmetherb seeds, plants, shallots, garlic, wreaths & flowersa family owned business since 1954!to keep our prices low we are updating our website and will be changing to www.lejardindugourmet.com we will keep taking orders on this website through 2025 but wanted to give our loyal customers a year to get used to the new set up.  our seed company offers you the option of trying a certain herb, vegetable or flower seed with a sample packet or ordering a larger packet if you have a bigger garden.  the sample packets are great as party favors or even school projects so every student can have their own packet of seed to start with. we also offer a large selection of herb  plants, shallots for planting and cooking, garlic (both hard & softneck), jerusalem artichoke, and ginseng seed.  in november we make chistmas wreaths & centerpieces and send them all over the us. wreath's and centerpieces make great holiday gifts and ours are all made right here with the freshes balsam brush from the northwoods of vermont!  our flowershop opened in 1985 and if you need flowers delivered locally in st johnsbury, vt or sent anywhere in the world.   you can call us or go to our  teleflora website!
