some people come to anderson valley to taste our award-winning wines. some people come for the family friendly events, like the wildflower show, county fair, and sierra nevada music festival. some want to enjoy the outdoors, hiking among the towering redwoods in hendy woods, or swimming in the navarro river. others just want to put up their feet and stare at the hills.
