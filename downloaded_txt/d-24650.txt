a community to be thankful for



nov 4, 2019




when you ask our registrants why they keep coming back to the british invasion the answer usually has something to do with community. the british invasion provides a unique place for people to share their passion for british motorcars. a lot of work and energy goes into the restoration and maintenance of the gorgeous cars you see on our field every year.
