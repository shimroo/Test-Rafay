welcome, new buckeyes!
 orientation will be your first real taste of life as a buckeye. orientation programs are different depending on which term you're entering and whether you're a first-year or transfer student. if you're a non-traditional first-year student (age 21 or older), you're invited to attend a transfer orientation program.
