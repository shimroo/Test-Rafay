our crew was busy today‚Ä¶

after a lot of work in the shop we revealed our newest creation for @hamiltonjewelers. to say we are overwhelmed with the opportunity to deliver again, with something so beautiful, for a town we love so much, is an understatement. our crew takes great pride in every project but getting to do a bit of magic for everyone who just happens to walk by is the absolute highlight of our spring. 

so many thanks to the team at hamilton jewelers, for their trust in our ability to create and their support of bringing beauty to our town.

she found her main squeeze! üçãüçãüçã

we were thrilled to help decorate this bridal shower today at @cobblestonecreekcountryclub. lemons, italy and the whole vibe was just perfect on a beautiful morning. 
also we are beyond thrilled with how the custom vinyl wrapped bar came out. i bet you thought it was tile! now available with custom printing along with backdrops, pedestals and more! it will give your event a truly custom feel!

drape goes up pretty quick when you have a crew like ours. we were happy to help the @ymcabhc with their annual chocolatta fundraiser. if you need to transform a space we can help and event drape is a great place to start.

the team at janet‚Äôs helped design and plan this italian wedding weekend in september and it was definitely the highlight of our 2022.
coordinating this whirlwind weekend overseas could not have been done without the fabulous @stefaniasilvestro_events. also the floral work was handled beautifully by our new friends at @laprimulacosebelleischia and these photos were magnificently captured by @giuseppegrecophotographer. 
we look forward to doing many more weddings in front of actual castles and are over the moon for this couple.

location: @torredimichelangeloischi and @aragonesecastle
venue: @cocomare_

we just love making an entrance at one of our favorite places to work @tpcjasnapolanaweddings. this welcome table decor and champagne wall seating chart was an excellent way to start off the evening!

it‚Äôs a dream to be a part of so many couples special day and we are loving all the great albums couples are sending us from last years weddings! this fantastic couple got married at @innatbarleysheaffarm and were photographed by @dmpfamilylife. we used the outstanding shots to help tell the story of how our decor fits in to make the magic happen!









we hope everyone is having a happy holiday season with family and friends. here is a quick photo tour of some of the doorways we decorate in @palmersquare. if you haven‚Äôt completed your holiday shopping it‚Äôs a great place to stop. plus you can grab some photos with our decor!

another holiday season begins and we have already been very busy. nothing makes us happier to turn on the lights at princeton nj‚Äôs most stunning corner and the storefront of @hamiltonjewelers. tonight we completed the install with a little snow and a lot of sparkle. go check it out and tag us in your photos!









back in may we celebrated our good friend @hairstylistkali and her upcoming wedding in ischia, italy. since it was derby day we definitely had some amazing mint jelups from @barcartevents and lots of roses to commemorate the occasion. 
when kali started looking for a florist in italy she knew she wanted to have @heydiffy (our gm and her big brother) as part of the design team.  fast forward to today and the time has come, part of our team are off to make final arrangements for our first international project in europe! janet and our team in nj have helped along the way choosing flowers, helping with the menus, printed items and lots more! we are looking forward to fantastic vistas, great meals, floral design challenges from the other side of the world and a lot of talking with our hands. we have partnered with a fantastic design studio on the island and can‚Äôt wait to take you along for the ride! stay tuned to our story and here for more!

this 50th birthday party we decorated this weekend totally rocked! as usual our team brought the theme of vinyl and classic rock to every element of the event. 
some of our favorite parts were the awesome photo backdrop with an incredible wig bar, vip pretzel passes and a awesome cake and pie bar made from vintage turntables. the birthday boy‚Äôs favorite part was the amazing vinyl shelf our custom shop built as a bar back that doubled as a gift from his family!

back in june we decked out this tent from our friends at @millers.rentals for the @mccartertheatre annual gala! we were thrilled to put together the florals, entrance and stage decor to celebrate the 1920‚Äôs theme. with help from our friends at @fennellidesign we put together a fantastic lighting design with chandeliers, string lights and lots of programmed fixtures to keep the dance floor active later in the evening! 
also special thanks to positive solutions for their help with the project planning!

a sip and see is usually more of a southern event but we are all for hosting more in the northeast! this fantastically fun afternoon event was a great way for the new mama to show off her beautiful new home and baby girl! 
shoutout to our friends @barcartevents for bringing the drinks and @kseventdecorations1 for help with the balloons!

watch our team transform the princeton airport for the @saveanimalshelter annual gala.  lots of drape, lighting, balloons and great table decor complete the look. 
thanks to @byconstellation and finnelli design for their help with the project!









flower bars have been very popular this year. using dried or fresh flowers guests can put together a bouquet that matches the occasion to take home! it‚Äôs a great activity that creates memories and adds something interactive in to your event. 
we have all sorts of styles of displays, helpful assistants to lead guests and can great a curated selection of materials to make sure everyone walks away with something unique.

whew! it is hot out there!
if you are sending flowers in this heat please help coordinate delivery so we can be sure to get the arrangement to your recipient on first attempt. otherwise we hope everyone is staying cool inside! if you need a floral delivery call, email or order online!










with every wedding we style we put a lot of thought in to what pulls your whole bridal party in to focus. sometimes doing something monotone and simple really lets the dresses shine. 
when whitney approached us with the idea of varied floral prints for her bridesmaids we embraced the look with simple, single material bouquets. when working with one material flawless selection and execution is key and we think our team nailed it!

one of you favorite events of the season was this ‚Äúsummer soir√©e‚Äù! with a theme that celebrated summer fun with a carnival and boardwalk atmosphere, we color coordinated everything from the vibrant purple carpet to the creative food stations. lush greens and lots of lounge/boho elements completed the look that entertained about 200 guests.

last week at @rats.restaurant there was definitely a baby in bloom! we were ecstatic about the the final results of the decor and activities like the flower bar. also the hot air balloon install came out perfectly! if you have a party coming up let us know if you need a decorating team!

i called janet makrancy's wedding & parties based on their good reviews. i had no idea how or if they could decorate an old battered park pavilion that my daughter chose to use for her "wedding dances in the park" (dances at a wedding reception hall were discouraged due to covid).
