jerry joseph’s release: baby, you’re the man who would be king is available now on cd, vinyl, digital download through cosmo sex school records!baby, you’re the man who would be king is a collection of songs written in a vintage camping trailer parked in jerry’s portland driveway in the midst of the pandemic, then recorded in nyc with producer eric “roscoe” ambel. the album features a band made up of some of new york’s best players, in a recording experience that was a bit out of jerry’s wheelhouse. the result is the quintessential new york record jerry has long wanted to make. jerry remarks, “considering the whole covid driveway origins, it’s surreal what we made and i’m just going to call it magic ... for which i am exceedingly grateful.”
