my name is steve. i have been keeping tarrantulas for 4 years i am a proud member off the british tarrantula society.
i own approx 200 tarantulas. these have just been installed in vivariums.the temp is 80 degrees. and the heating is still threw heatmats.the advantage off this setup is i will be able to keep more spiders.also with the sliding glass doors this is a added bonus as it gives further protection to the spiders. they are all fed on crickets. i shall soon be introducing pinkies.


terrarstika reptile show-hamm germany-20004
there is a trip being organised to this show on march 20004. i am in the process off doing a full report. 
i cannot stress this enough. never attempt to handle a tarantula. this can result in death off the spider.
i house all my spiders in tubs. these are purchased at fairs. also the local supermarket comes in handy.there is always a waterdish. the substrate is irish peat moss. i spray the tanks frequently to provide humidity.


i now have my own photos.i have removed tank equipment to improve photos and make the job off taking potos more easy
