underground homes or earth-sheltered houses, as some call them, 
                reside beneath the earth's surface (at least partially). these 
                houses are inexpensive to heat and cool since the surrounding 
                soil acts as nature's insulation. those who design underground 
                dwellings have come up with several methods for regulating the 
                temperature.

                      underground buildings (at least some) depend upon the soil 
                      that surrounds the walls and floors (or even ceilings) to 
                      provide insulation. others, however, have tubes channeled 
                      through them to bring in fresh air. still others use a heat 
                      pump to regulate temperatures. 





 


 
most underground dwellings are made of concrete. in some parts 
                of the country (or world), one can expect to pay 10-percent more 
                for construction of these earth-sheltered structures than for 
                a typical home. enthusiasts say, though, that at least 10-percent 
                or more is saved from lower maintenance and energy costs. subsurface 
                homes are not suitable, though for northern, permafrost regions 
                or for most areas on flood plains.

listen to the doe ...
the u. s. department of energy (doe) agrees with the energy savings 
                of underground or earth-sheltered homes saying, "if you are 
                looking for a home with many energy-efficient features that will 
                provide a comfortable, tranquil, weather-resistant atmosphere, 
                an earth-sheltered house could be right for you."

the doe differentiates between underground houses, which are 
                almost completely below the surface of the topsoil and earth-berm 
                homes which may have one or two sides exposed, such as elevational 
                and penetrational houses.
advantages ...
some other advantages of building underground are lower insurance 
                premiums, natural sound insulation, less susceptibility to fire, 
                high winds, hailstorms and tornadoes to name a few. privacy is 
                another issue stated by underground dwelling enthusiasts and homeowners, 
                which has lured them to build below the surface.
