resilience is about blending beautiful traditional african music with stories of hope and tolerance.   sharing difficult topics, samite opened the doors for the us to gain new knowledge and empathy with grace and sensitivity.  music definitely heals - a must see! ~ karen wacks, (lmhc, m.ed., mt-bc)                                                                                         professor of music therapy, berklee college of music
