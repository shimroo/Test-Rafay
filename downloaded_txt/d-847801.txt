erica grieg kisses a beloved iconic cherry blossom tree named ‘stumpy’ that bloomed for the final time at the tidal basin in washington dc on march 20, 2024.  ‘trees are poems the earth writes upon the sky’ wrote poet kahlil gibran. his final bloom was glorious with admirers bidding a sorrowful farewell as a renovation project for the eroding sea wall was set to begin by the national park service.  approximately 300 trees will be removed, including stumpy, a cautionary tale of climate change. he became a symbol of resilience, a miracle in our midst, blooming his little heart out despite the frail weathered condition of his fragile shell. he captured our imaginations, inspiring those who feel broken to transcend adversity.  stumpy’s destiny was dictated by nps with no regard to the pulse of the people. citizens overwhelmingly voiced their desire to ‘save stumpy’ as a national treasure. there were petitions. many believed at least giving him a chance by transplanting was appropriate.  “just try,” they said. another viable alternative was a smithsonian request for preservation in the permanent museum collection. it too was rejected. people refer to stumpy as ‘he’.  sometimes ‘she’.  seldom ‘it’.  some wrote love notes as an act of protest against his removal. others left memorial flowers and in one case, a bottle of maker’s mark.  at this troubled time in our world, he offered promise. something a fractured partisan nation could rally around. people saw him as an “underdog,” a “symbol of hope,” a “metaphor for our democracy.” “mommy why are they killing him?” said one little girl. a lady remarked: “they always try to cut us down when we get older.” psychologist evelyn sawhill made an origami crane and tucked it into stumpy’s peeling bark, whispering, “don’t be afraid.”  she pondered existential questions: do trees have emotions? feel pain?  do they have a soul that moves on somewhere in this mystery called life?  she believes stumpy felt the love by those who stayed so he wouldn’t be alone. “offering recognition and comfort and solace and understanding to any living thing is important.  people who have come to do that for stumpy have benefited more than we think.  and it is an honor,” she declared.the final days were bittersweet and poignant.  a rainbow appeared as if all of nature was offering stumpy a grand goodbye.  this tale has greater meaning than the fate of one little tree.  it is about our capacity to care and nurture rather than destroy so much in our path. when you erase beauty, it is an affront to the soul.  and yes, many found this misshapen marvel a magnificent work of art.   under a veil of secrecy, shrouded by black mesh fencing and amid the carnage of other felled trees, stumpy met his demise. he was so little, it took mere minutes. on this last sunrise, birds flocked near the isolated cage. one could imagine them bidding him farewell.  nature has an intricate language that humans have long forgotten.in “the wizard of oz,” dorothy said, “there’s no place like home.”  national parks are part of our collective home to nurture and protect. no one questions the need for renovation, simply the decisions made by nps with no regard for the will of the people. perhaps american citizens deserve a more compassionate steward of our land.  there is now an empty space where beauty once lived.  one can imagine stumpy somewhere over that rainbow, tall and majestic with eternal blooms.  rest now stumpy your journey is over. we will miss you dear little one.  you were loved.
