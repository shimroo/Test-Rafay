charlie's angels 3




according to production weekly magazine, in their august 29, 2024 issue, charlie's angels 3 is listed as in development. drew barrymore, nancy juvonen, and amanda goldberg (daughter of leonard goldberg) are the film's producers, along with columbia pictures (aka sony pictures), flower films, mandy films, and chernin entertainment.
for many years, drew, cameron, lucy, and mcg (director) have all shown public interest in producing a third film to follow up charlie's angels (2000) and charlie's angels: full throttle (2003). both films grossed over $100 million each at the box office.
in 2019, columbia pictures & sony pictures released charlie's angels, produced by and starring elizabeth banks. the film was a box office disaster, bringing in only $17 million. 
development does not mean this film is greenlit, but it does indicate there is interest in the project.  only time will tell if the new film will be produced. stay toon angels!
thanks to the charlies3sexysleuths instagram page, which broke the news early this week, with one of their fans, rodney_dollar, being the super ca sleuth who found out the details.

 new kate book not worth buying


 
  
news alert: beware of this new book: unveiling kate jackson: the life and legacy of kate jackson by lauren j. conner was brought to our attention. 
we purchased a copy and have read it. it is not worth purchasing.
the book is full of wrong facts. it does not go deep into any of kate jackson's actual career, cancer battle or her personal life.
the author does mention charlie's angels.  it is written that kate took the role in the reboot movie as the character alex carter. there's no character alex carter in charlie's angels. kate was not in any of the reboot movies.  
the book is mostly written is an abroad spectrum and not written with factual stories.  it looks to us that the book was written with an ai program.
scarecrow in mrs king, dark shadows, the rookies, baby boom, making love, or any of her other tv movies are not even mentioned in this book. 
and in fact when talking about her work in tv and movies the author never mentioned any of kate's project titles by name.
the book sells for about $13 on amazon. it is 71 pages long.  there is one photo inside and one on the cover.  
this book is not worth the money.
