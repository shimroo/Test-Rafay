 a charming inn, great service! our king suite was fantastic: spacious, comfortable, clean. we could not have asked for more, top notch!

 we had a wonderful week here! cannot say enough nice things about the staff at the inn, they kindly gave us some extra time before checking out during a bad snowstorm. room was much more than expected, it was very pet friendly (wood and tile!) and had an unexpected extra day bed perfect for tv viewing. it was quiet and private in our section of the inn, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

 such a cute inn! my husband and i only stayed 1 night but would have stayed longer if we could! it was in a great location and it was very clean!

 the inn was a fantastic place to stay for our trip to kennebunkport. the rooms were spacious and clean. it is right in the heart of kennebunk. the owners are wonderful people who went above and beyond to make our stay great. overall a wonderful stay and would highly recommend!

 this place is incredible. really nice, renovated rooms. awesome owners who are involved with every guest. this place is exactly what a new england inn should be.
