additionally, consider these factors:

reputable software providers: ensure the casino partners with established gaming companies.
player reviews: check feedback from other players about their experiences.
responsible gambling measures: look for features that promote safe gambling practices.

without a deposit, they have the advantage that nothing is actually risked. no own money is used. with a deposit, it is an addition. the account balance is thus increased in percentage terms with a corresponding casino bonus, but it is about more than the 100% offered, for example, because additional money could be booked with the free spins.
why do online casinos give offers of 50 free spins to their customers?
when a casino offers 50 free spins, it wants to create an incentive for the customers. there is no risk involved. rather, a registration is rewarded, possibly also an additional deposit. or several. the player gets an impression, gets to know a game and the entire casino.

nothing at all speaks against a casino bonus with 50 free spins or another number without a previous deposit, because no own money is risked at all. ultimately, however, must always be decided on a case-by-case basis and a blanket recommendation can not be given at this point.
conclusion to 50 free spins without deposit
an offer in an online casino to start with 50 free spins is interesting. it can provide for first profits and you get to know the casino. after all, everyone likes to accept gifts and this is nothing else. there is no real risk here. this ultimately leads to the verdict that under normal circumstances should participate in such a promotion. however, attention because of the rules is recommended.
