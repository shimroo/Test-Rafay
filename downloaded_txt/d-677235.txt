our mission
                        is to provide a tool of mastery of the mind using the auto-sugestive sciences, developing an opportunity for those who seek to 'remember' and rediscover their latent power, not only to self-heal, but also to unleash the vast potential from the vestiges of their sub-concious mind. to facilitate an opportunity for the seeker to study and explore the nature of the mind and consciousness, expounding on the concept of creation through thoughts. to assist in the search for the âawakeningâ tools as we naturally step into the âquickeningâ process of ascension.
