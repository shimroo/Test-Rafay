    what are ceramics?
  



























we are the voice of the uk ceramics industry.



from multinational ceramic corporations manufacturing in the uk to domestic sme manufacturers, we represent the collective interests of our sector.the uk ceramics industry is not a local or niche endeavour; it is a nationwide and foundational industry.this crucial industry has often remained hidden in plain sight, and its significance overlooked. while both stoke-on-trent and the pottery sub-sector are important, the uk ceramics industry extends far beyond these boundaries, encompassing a diverse range of products and applications.







































a critical enablerceramics manufacturing is a foundation role in various key sectors, such as steel and glass manufacturing, and these contributions are integral to the overall strength of our national economy. 















a diverse rangeour industry boasts a remarkable diversity ranging from advanced, high-tech ceramics used in aerospace, defence, and medical sectors, to everyday products such as bricks and roof tiles. 















a nationwide foundationit's not just a stoke-on-trent thing. almost every region in the uk holds one or more of the 150+ uk ceramics sites.



we want to build a strong and sustainable ceramic industry in the uk.we want to make sure the government recognises its importance, and we are a supportive and knowledgeable trade organisation championing this cause.we are ceramics uk. supporting manufacturing.
