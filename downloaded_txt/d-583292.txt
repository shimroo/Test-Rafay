our historic trains run on select weekends and holidays







welcome to the sumpter valley railroad!

when planning a summer visit to northeast oregon, be sure to add the sumpter valley railroad to your travel itinerary. history comes to life aboard the vintage trains as you travel through the heart of gold country in the scenic sumpter valley. running between mcewen and the historic mining town of sumpter, it's a guarantee that the whole family will enjoy this relaxing trip back in time without having to leave the comfort of the present.the sumpter valley railroad is open on select weekends and major holidays. round trips from mcewen usually take just over two hours, including a layover in either mcewen or sumpter.
some weekends we run short round trips from sumpter depot that take about 45 minutes.

 there are also many special events throughout the season.
we are wheel-chair accessible(except the caboose).

​great news!
many that follow the sumpter valley railroad restoration are aware that we are building a structure at our mcewen site to house our archive and book collection. the building shell is completed, and we are now seeking grant funds to complete the interior. we just received notification that we have been awarded a matching grant from the national railway historical society ( nrhs ) of $4600 to purchase and do the rough in for the hvac equipment. thank you nrhs!
