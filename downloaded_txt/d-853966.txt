about plowman's 
plowman's carts was started in 1990 by don plowman. the golf cart business was an outgrowth of a successful auto repair business and snowmobile performance shop,  don's been in the auto repair business for 25 years as well as the snowmobile high-performance industry. don bought his first yamaha golf cart in 1990. he found a need to make it faster, stronger and more of a sport utility vehicle than a golf cart. since then, plowman's carts has grown into a full service yamaha performance golf cart business and a yamaha performance golf cart parts shop. plowman's is a retail, custom build and design business, that is constantly trying to develop better factory products and produce custom yamaha products for speed, power, reliability and use.
