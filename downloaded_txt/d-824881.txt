i wanted to send a note of thanks to you and your team for the hard work they extended to us last friday. we were faced with hot temperatures in sections of our building and your team stayed late to work through the problem and get our casino cool again. our associates working and guests visiting that night appreciate all your effort!

the longer you have a service contract and buy preventive maintenance, the less you may think you need both of these going forward. but i’ve learned the hard way, we need them as much as ever.
