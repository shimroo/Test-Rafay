 testimonials


		  hi,    the stove arrived tonight after dark and it  is so beautiful.   there was 5 other people here (friends and  neighbors) and they were in awe.  rh	  
		  
		  
occasionally i am stunned when i find a business where the proprietor was on hand, knew the business and product in and out, told the absolute truth and was looking out for the consumer.! - janet a north hollywood, ca
 talk about amazing customer service and really caring person to person instead of just the $$.  so nice & refreshing.  also, my mom bought a stove from them about 8 years ago and they have taken care of that too, still working beautifully for her.  i highly recommend them, really amazing.
