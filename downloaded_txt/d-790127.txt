with our rural setting……stelle offers a simpler lifestyle and a safe, family-oriented environment. through cooperative endeavors such as gardening, tool-sharing, a dinner coop and a plethora of other social activities, stelle residents have created opportunities to experience authentic community and enjoy a high-quality of life.













the people of stelle……do not practice any one way of eating, living or believing. we tend to celebrate diversity and accept the opportunities and challenges that come with that. we are made up of families, couples, singles and retired folk. we have people who make their living as small businesses owners, teachers, college professors, preachers, nurses, holistic-health practitioners, truck drivers, contractors, auto mechanics, farmers and more. and oh… a wonderful crop of children. 













if you are looking for a nice place……to raise a family, retire, or get a step away from the rat race, stelle might be a perfect home for you — especially if you are interested in getting to know your neighbors and open to developing heart-felt connections with others. 

 

a quick historystelle began as an intentional community in the early 70’s. the people who started stelle were part of an organization from chicago that wanted to try their hand at creating the most positive environment (community) possible, where people could naturally evolve toward becoming more emotionally, mentally and spiritually aware and mature. 













these were lofty ideals for sure and a great effort was made toward creating stelle into an ideal community. but these early residents eventually discovered that it was easier to agree on a vision for stelle than it was to agree on how to get there. because of unresolved differences and lowering levels of consensus, the founding organization withdrew their involvement and about 1/3 of the residents moved away in 1982.since then, stelle has been an open community to anyone who would like to live here and the stelle community association (sca) was legally formed to take on the responsibilities of managing the community’s common assets (streets, greenbelts, water plant, etc.). 























there are still a few of the 1970’s residents in stelle but the community today is composed, directed and inspired by mostly newer residents who are from all walks of life. stelle is a truly democratic town. if someone wants to be involved in any aspect of the community, all they have to do is show up and volunteer their ideas and time.
