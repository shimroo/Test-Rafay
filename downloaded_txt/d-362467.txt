about topsy's

topsy's popcorn is a kansas city area tradition for over 60 years. originally opened as patsy's, topsy's is now proudly the oldest merchant on the country club plaza. our customers know it's true when we say topsy's is the taste of tradition. whether you choose buttery, cheesy, cinnamon-y, or caramel-y deliciousness, every bit of topsy's takes us back to a time when everything seemed magical.
and now, sharing the magic of topsy's has never been easier. today the topsy's family is made of twelve franchised popcorn and ice cream shops in the kc and outlying areas and our online show delivers our magic all around the world.
topsy's popcorn - it's the good stuff.
