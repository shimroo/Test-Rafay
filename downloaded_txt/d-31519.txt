indices to canadian censuses
automated genealogy hosts several projects to index canadian censuses.
over the last several years library and archives canada has digitized their
microfilms of the original census forms for several of the canadian censuses
and automated genealogy has organized volunteers to produce indices to the
people enumerated in these censuses. each project uses simple web forms to
allow volunteers to transcribe census data from the images into a database,
with the entered data being immediately available on the site. following
transcription further volunteers proofread and make corrections. anyone
with an internet connection can participate as a transcriber, proofreader,
or just by submitting corrections as they use the site. the status of each
census project varies depending on how long it has been active. there is a
link to the lac image of the original census page at the top of each
transcribed census page.

1901 census
the 1901 census was the first census that lac released images for
and the first one we indexed. transcription has been completed and
we are almost 70% through proofreading.

1911 census
transcription is now complete, proofreading is in progress. 
1906 census
the 1906 census was a special census of the three prairie provinces
of alberta, saskatchewan, and manitoba. transcription is essentially
complete, proofreading has not yet started.
1851 census
censuses were planned for 1851 for the then separate colonies of
canada (current day ontario and quebec), new brunswick, and nova scotia.
the census of canada was delayed until early 1852 so it is variously
refered to as the 1851 or 1852 census.
indexing of the 1852 census was started in august 2007.
indexing of the 1851 census of new brunswick
was started in june 2007 and has been completed.
indexing of the 1851 census of nova scotia, which is a
head-of-household-only census, has not yet begun.

1921 census
a limited number of new brunswick subdistricts are being transcribed.

linking projects
an interesting feature of the site is the ability to link various records
associated with a person together. this is done through the
link centre. projects are underway to
link records from several sources as well as between the censuses.
if this project were to be fully realized a researcher would be able to
look up any person in canada (from the era that census data is publicly
accessible for) and find all the person's census records, birth, marriage,
and death records, as well as photographs, newspaper stories, and other
online data. it is a very ambitious project but many hands make light work
and we have already linked over two million records! help us put together
the pieces of our shared genealogical puzzle by linking records for people
you have researched!
the linking projects include:


soldiers of the first world war linking
canadian virtual war memorial linking
dictionary of canadian biography online linking
british home children linking
halifax explosion linking
the illustrated index to the 1901 census
uploaded images linking
off-site marriage record linking
