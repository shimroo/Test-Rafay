low mount 3800 alt!
low mounts in stock today. newest design has tension belt assembly, cleaned, and blasted. 












hello in october 2021 -
i am still around.
i dont do much fiero work any longer.
i am still selling off my fiero inventory.
that does include one 3800sc series 2 and one 3800sc series 3 engines.
email me at fastfieros@fastfieros.com ( be warned: it takes me a few days to weeks to respond ) 
hello !  not closed, but not open for full business either at this time. i am not taking any new engine installations at this time. i am still selling off all fieros, and fiero parts however. you can consider this move as mostly trying to get rid of inventory that has been sitting here since 1996 to 2010. please email only. my number 972-880-6643 is still active, but my exwife has the phone and voice mail is too complicated to access for me. 
news flash:

none



none




   turnkey engine installations are no longer offered at fastfieros. please buy all remaining fiero parts and cars!
