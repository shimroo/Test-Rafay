jai uttal’slegacy of songs



over the course of the last several decades, many people have asked me: “when will you write your memoir so your legacy can be passed onto future generations?” well, i’ve certainly thought about it and, who knows, someday i may just do it.  but, in truth, my legacy lives in my songs and albums. every tear, celebration, heartbreak, and exultation has been expressed in these words, mantras, and melodies. they are the full total of me.  enjoy!




    access jai's legacy of songs
  


























a taste …dear friends in sound and heart vibrations,i have created an extensive collection of songs for you. from my first album, footprints (1990), to my latest release, dust & tears (2023), i’ve produced 21 full albums, including the grammy-nominated mondo rama (2002).in addition to singles, this brings the total to a mind-blowing 204 tracks! i invite you to explore and enjoy this journey.
