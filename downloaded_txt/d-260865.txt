land acknowledgement
as good samaritans, we respectfully acknowledge that we live, work, and provide care on the ancestral and unceded territory of the inuit, métis, and first nations peoples, who have called this land home since time immemorial.
we remain committed to improving relationships between nations and enhancing our understanding of indigenous peoples and their cultures. 
we reflect on and acknowledge the harms and mistakes of the past and ask all to consider how we can, in our way, move forward in a spirit of truth, reconciliation and collaboration.
