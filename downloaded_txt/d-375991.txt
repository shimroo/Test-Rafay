experience saugatuck & stay on lake michigan

 

welcome to lake shore resort, a peaceful retreat where you can relax, refresh, and reconnect.  with nature all around us and gorgeous views from every room, deck, and pool, we combine the tranquility of a waterside resort with a convenient location just three miles from downtown saugatuck. start your morning with breakfast overlooking lake michigan. by day, you can explore the area with our kayaks and bikes, hike the wooded trails on our property, take a dip in the lake, or wander the many shops, galleries, and restaurants in town. at night, come back to watch a spectacular sunset around the fire pits, or snuggle up and stargaze from our deck at the water’s edge.
