about me




mackmccoy


companion page to my bi-weekly gig as selector and mc of the long-running radio show, lost & found, which airs every weekday from noon-2pm on 88.1 fm wmbr, from the campus of m.i.t. in cambridge, ma. the show has a number of hosts, and i am on every other monday.   ----------  

what's it all about?    imagine a seedy mid-western city, boiled hard by ward bosses, corrupt bulls, and voluptuous extortionist dames...an entire town undergoing a mass psychedelic experience, highlighted by miscegenatious revelry, time-displacement of a frighteningly authentic nature, and the ability to construct witty verbal retorts at fantastic speed...or just check the playlists to your left.
  ----------- 
"kiss tomorrow goodbye" is a kind of success story. it is the story of a phi beta kappa scholar who succeeded in turning himself into a vicious and completely unmoral criminal - a man whose contempt for law, order and human life drove him relentlessly into a career of unrelieved evil. it is a story - punctuated here and there with brutal sexuality - of a drive for power, ruthless in it's performance and guided by a mind of strange, unexpected and terrifying dexterity.
