early childhood12 months - age 6play is the heart of early childhood and the key to creative and critical thinking. your child will take their first steps into a school experience, guided gently and joyfully through a day of meaningful work, play, and outdoor exploration on our beautiful 8-acre campus. visit our growing together page for information about our birth - toddler classes.















elementary schoolgrades 1-5academics come alive through stories, the arts and movement. children experience new intellectual challenges while they explore the beauty of the world through language arts, choir, string ensemble, practical arts, math and sciences.















middle schoolgrades 6-8new conceptual capacities awaken in middle school children as they approach adolescence and are eager to test their new intellectual powers. over the course of sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, students examine science, technology, engineering, arts and math and expand on their foundational understanding of language arts, history, geography, spanish, music and drama.














the low-tech approach to learningat mws, our screen-free classrooms are laden with hand-drawn chalkboard drawings and reverberate with the sounds of folk stories from around the world told from the heart. technology is a tool that students are taught to use only when they have gained confidence in their critical thinking skills through our digital citizenship curriculum. 
















spending time outside, every day.nature is a child’s playground. from gardening in the spring to sledding and skiing in the winter, your child will spend an impressive amount of time outside, taking in all nature has to offer.





























picture a school where your child is met with care, love, and stability. a school where your child can experience the true magic and wonder of their childhood.

"we immediately felt a connection. the energy of the property was of love and belonging. i felt as if i was right where i was supposed to be."






"our kiddos get enough screens at home, what we found at mws was a sanctuary for play and imagination"






"my children feel known and supported by teachers who believe in them"






 "our two older children have made the transition from mws to a large public high school and are thriving in all areas including math and science while taking ap french classes" 






"mws is a place where young children are allowed to exist as children – playing, pretending, exploring, and creating.  it’s a school where classroom and subject teachers are allowed space and freedom to teach their classes and for each of our kids, the experience was unique and life-changing."
