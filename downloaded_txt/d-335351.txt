kym's nude paintings




 


 






kym ward artistwelcome to kym's world. here you will see the new me, the artist who still paints, the rescue mommy who loves her cats, the hula hoop girl who loves to put a hoop around her waist and dance, the healthy eater who loves eating vegan and organic foods that are grain free and without sugar and most recently the lady who is remodeling her house, turning it in the the gallery and sanctuary she has always wanted. i lost my mom last april in a horrible way and for a time that story was on this page. you will find links below this that will take you there but mom would want me to live my life not relive my life. so, visit when you can. i will be posting links to my youtube channel where you can join me in my hula dancing, i will be sharing my art which includes nude paintings of me on the beach and more.
