mexican political party demands respect from donald trump... by calling him a faggot



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest






earlier today a mexican political party which bills itself as the 4th largest in the country launched a television spot demanding respect from u.s. presidential candidate donald trump... by calling him a faggot.





in the ad a member if the nueva alianza party expresses frustration at how mexicans are currently being portrayed worldwide and takes trump to task by dedicating the following message to him: "heeeeey puto!"

the phrase is commonly heard at mexican soccer stadiums and directed at the opposing team and can be translated as "hey faggot!"

earlier this year the international soccer federation (fifa) imposed fines on several soccer teams that participated in the last world cup for using the homophobic chant.

just last week the mexican national team announced a new campaign to eradicate the chant from their soccer stadiums.

mexican soccer fans, on the whole, defend the "puto" chant as being innocuous, common place and that "puto" can have several meanings including "cowardly," "unmanly" or "spineless." but at the core of the insult is the intention of questioning a man's masculinity or making him feel less than a man.

the mexican band molotov has often run into trouble for their song "puto" which they use to rile up fans at their concerts.  this video is an excerpt from a documentary about the band in which the band, music critics and radio dj's discuss the meaning behind the word.

hi, manny: for you to say that homosexuality is like animal sex is irresponsible. i am a homosexual. are you sure you hate me for my lifestyle? jesus said about the adulteress woman: "he who is without sin among you, let him be the first to cast a stone at her." 

hear this first: god asked you to love one another unconditionally. i invite you to meet with me to get to know us as human beings first and i guarantee you will think differently. maybe afterwards we can do a sparring session. take care and i will be praying for you and your family. thank you.

former dominican republic president's anti-gay comments are disparaging and offensive: u.s. ambassador



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest






earlier this month i did a series of blog posts on dominican republic ex-president hipólito mejía and comments he made in new york and new jersey opposing marriage equality and using the word "mariconcito" to refer to gays as he brought a new presidential campaign bid to the east coast of the united states [the english translation for "mariconcito" is "little faggot"].
one of the things that bothered me so much about the comments and woke me up from my blogging slumber was that he seemed to feel it was perfectly good to make those comments while visiting the united states and get away with it. thankfully, new york city council speaker melissa mark-viverito caught wind of my blog post and released a stinging rebuke which was then picked up by a number of media outlets.

by the time mejía returned to the dominican republic three days later he was defending his usage of "little faggot" as a commonly used colloquial term and extending apologies to those who might have "misinterpreted" his intentions.

apparently my blog posts also caught someone else's eye: diario libre reports today that the openly gay u.s. ambassador to the dominican republic sent what seems to be private correspondence on official letterhead directly confronting mejía on his statements.

"your remarks in new york and new jersey regarding homosexuality and gay marriage recently came to my attention," ambassador james 'wally' brewster states in a missive dated april 10th, "using words like 'mariconcito' are disparaging and dismissive of a 
community to which i belong. i am specially shocked and disheartened by your recent insensitive dismissal of those who have different sexual orientation than you because we have spent time together in each others' homes."

the ambassador goes on to explain how words like "mariconcito" can cause harm even if that might not be the intent and adds this: "it is particularly offensive that you chose to make your remarks in 
the united states. president obama has worked tirelessly to fight 
discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) 
people and communities. same-sex marriage is legal inmost of the united 
states, including new york and new jersey, and fighting anti-lgbt 
discrimination is integral to our diplomatic advocacy for the protection
 of human rights around the world."

it's unclear how diario libre got their hands on the letter or why the chose to publish it today - fifteen days after the letter is dated - but it comes two days before the modern revolutionist party (prm) decides whether mejía will be chosen as their presidential candidate.

in the letter, brewster also addresses mejía's opposition to marriage equality on the basis of procreation calling them discriminatory: "in particular, your arguments surrounding marriage, as strictly for 
reasons of procreation, not only discriminates against the lgbt 
community but also eliminates a large number of people who either cannot
 have children or choose not to procreate."

the dominican republic has a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage but, when asked about the ambassador's letter this morning, it's the only topic mejía addressed.

"on friday, ex-president hipólito mejía said that his religious upbringing and catholic beliefs prevented him from supporting legalizing marriages between people of the same gender," el nacional reported, "nevertheless he said he respected people who had the valor and responsibility of expressing their sexual preference for people of their same gender."

he might be highlighting his position on marriage equality time and time again because it resonates among the people he wants to draw votes from and the religious groups in the island who have always warned that the united states sent brewster to the dominican republic to force same-sex marriage on the population.

according to diario libre, the ambassador's letter closes with this: "as an ex-president of the dominican republic and public figure, your comments reflect a negative view of your nation's dignity. there are many dominicans here and in the exterior who fight for equality for all of god's creations, a fight i hope you value and lead."

brewster added that his husband, bob satawake, was available to sit down with mejía to have a dialogue.

diario libre only posted an image of the first page of the ambassador's letter.  here is the excerpted text...

the honorable hipólito mejía
calle juan tomás diaz #8
la julia
santo domingo, dominican republic

dear president mejía,

your remarks in new york and new jersey regarding homosexuality and gay marriage recently came to my attention. using words like "mariconcito" are disparaging and dismissive of a community to which i belong. i am specially shocked and disheartened by your recent insensitive dismissal of those who have different sexual orientation than you because we have spent time together in each others' homes.

young people struggling with their identity listen to public figures and when you say "little faggot" it wrongly reinforces self-doubt and that they are seen as something less by the community.  this isolates them from their family and can have terrible consequences, including suicide. further, the use of pejorative terminology perpetuates bullying, discrimination against minorities, and encourages abuse throughout society. even if you did not intend the words to be insulting they still had that effect.

it is particularly offensive that you chose to make your remarks in the united states. president obama has worked tirelessly to fight discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgbt) people and communities. same-sex marriage is legal inmost of the united states, including new york and new jersey, and fighting anti-lgbt discrimination is integral to our diplomatic advocacy for the protection of human rights around the world.

in particular, your arguments surrounding marriage, as strictly for reasons of procreation, not only discriminates against the lgbt community but also eliminates a large number of people who either cannot have children or choose not to procreate.

i apologize if i insulted anyone but i am not a homophobe: former dominican republic president hipólito mejía 



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest




news portal acento is reporting that former dominican republic president and current presidential candidate hipólito mejía is pushing back against reports first made by blabbeando that he used derogatory words against the gay community last week during a campaign stop in the united states.

"i never meant to make fun or belittle human beings who have been marginalized and harassed," mejía said in a statement. "if that was misinterpreted as an insult, i have no problem offering my apologies and reiterating that it was not, nor is, nor would be my intention; that's not how i behave."

mejía was referring to the spanish word "mariconcito" which translates to "little faggot" in english and which he used last week when he joking that a campaign consultant suggested he practice sitting down like a "mariconcito" when doing media appearances if he wanted his poll numbers to increase.





in today's statement mejía defended himself by saying "mariconcito" was just a commonly used colloquial term which "activists" misinterpreted as being homophobic.

the comments caught wide-spread spanish-language press interest in the united states last week and in the dominican republic this weekend after new york city council speaker melissa mark-viverito released an official statement deploring them and asking for an apology.

lgbt groups in the dominican republic have mounted a campaign asking people not to support mejía in his new presidential bid based on the comments.

in new york, well-known political commentator gerson borrero filed this blistering video op-ed on the time warner cable's new york 1 en español calling on new york city politicians of dominican descent to stand up against mejía's homophobia.





"i think there are dominican politicians here in new york and in particular those who call themselves 'progressive' who should denounce that one of their presidents has shown up here to sow his hate," borrero states, adding: "did someone swallow your tongues? or are you afraid of hipólito? he who stays silent grants consent. don't be cowards! don't fear the pig! or are you laying in the same pigsty?"

last week mejía also made comments opposing same-sex marriage during an interview with a local univision affiliate and during a meeting with latino reverends at the office of new york state senator ruben diaz, sr. in the bronx - a leading opponent of same-sex marriage rights.

it's worth noting that at least one of the leading local dominican politicians borrero implicitly takes to task for not speaking up about mejía was seen yesterday at senator diaz's office.

— luis sepulveda (@luissepulvedany) april 7, 2015
that would be new york state senator adriano espaillat who would be a powerful voice against mejía's homophobia but seems more beholden to reverend diaz these days.

at least one person in the dominican republic sees mejía's attempt at an apology to be somewhat of a victory for lgbt rights in the caribbean nation.

creo que es la primera vez que un líder político de rd pide disculpas por sus declaraciones. http://t.co/ps8at1bs39
— jose carlos nazario (@jcnazario) april 8, 2015


"i think it is the first time that a political leader in the dominican republic says he is sorry about his declarations" tweeted jose carlos nazario late this afternoon.

update #1: at least one dominican lgbt rights organization is saying that the former president has apologized directly to them and wanted to meet with them on friday. here is what the organizers of the annual dominican lgbt pride caravan tweeted tonight:

el expresidente hipolito hoy nos remitió disculpa y nos solicitó una reunión para este viernes darnos sus excusas a la comunidad lgbt
— orgullo_rd (@orgullo_rd) april 9, 2015
 "ex-president hipólito forwarded us an apology today and asked us for a meeting this friday to explain his reasons to the lgbt community"

update #2: other dominican presidential candidates are responding to mejía's homophobic outbursts.  today during a radio interview luis abinader said that he was certain he would be his party's candidate for the presidential elections and that he would extend an invitation to mejía to become one of his campaign consultants but he also said this...



"i believe we should respect the sexual orientation of all dominicans. there cannot be prejudice, there cannot be any type of limitations or exclusions. that's where i stand."

in june of 2014 abinader had already drawn fire from a prominent evangelical pastor for a letter he sent to lgbt organizations supporting their rights. rev. paulino moya warned abinader he could lose the catholic vote if he continued supporting "sodomites."

update #3: in the wake of mejía's comments at least one lgbt-rights organization in the dominican republic publicly expressed support for the former president. "hipólito has no ill will towards lesbians and gays," said someone who identified herself as biemba from the santo domingo north homosexual and gay collective when interviewed by radio station z101.

on thursday, april 9th, mejía was more than happy to appear at an unrelated protest surrounded with members of the organization carrying rainbow flags as their president asked gays and lesbians to forgive him

nyc speaker "appalled" about homophobic comments made by former dominican republic president hipólito mejía

re:

homophobic remarks by dominican republic president hipolito mejia during a visit to nyc


new york—
“i
 am appalled that a former dominican republic president and a potential 
future presidential candidate has used a derogatory term that is 
offensive, inappropriate and hurtful toward lgbt people. president mejia
 needs to apologize to the lgbt community in his
 country and here in new york, where he made this unacceptable 
statement. leaders are called to unite people, not divide us. that 
includes those who invited him here and stayed silent when 
discrimination occured and even worse, laughed at it. i stand with the
 lgbt community here, in the dominican republic and elsewhere, and i 
will not be silent when bigotry shows its ugly face.”


during a 
visit to new york city and new jersey, president hipólito mejía made 
several remarks against lgbt people, including saying that his campaign 
handlers wanted to change several things about him
 and tried to convince him to sit "the way a little faggot does." you

i won't act like a faggot just to increase poll numbers: dominican republic presidential hopeful hipólito mejía



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest






last week former dominican republic president hipólito mejía brought a new bid for the caribbean nation's presidency to the united states.  i hadn't paid much attention until ny1 noticias played a clip of statements he made while in new york citing the bible and saying he opposed same-sex marriage.







"i call bread 'bread' and wine 'wine.' the other day [senator ruben diaz, sr.] asked my opinion regarding same-sex marriage," mejia says, "be fruitful and multiply? there is no way you can do it that way!" meaning gays cannot procreate and, hence, should not be able to marry.

neither the statements nor the setting were a surprise. mejía enjoys a strong relationship with senator diaz, perhaps the leading latino anti-marriage equality voice in the nation, and has allowed the senator to host previous press conferences.

for his failed 2012 presidential bid, you might remember mejía questioning president barack obama's place of birth as diaz laughed uproariously (nys senator ruben diaz, sr. endorses "birther" dominican republic presidential candidate).

but what may seem to be an impromptu response to an issue raised at the house of diaz apparently is a campaign speaking point. speaking to a much wider audience on the local ny/nj univisión affiliate mejía reiterated his opposition to marriage equality using the same terms.







"there is no way you can impregnate your [same-sex] male partner, there is no way, or your female partner."

at the diaz event mejía admitted he once confronted gay issues with overt homophobia. "in the past i used to have a have a deadly antagonistic stance [against gays]" he says, "nowadays i can even laugh about it."

if that was in the past, he seems to have forgotten about it the next day when he made a campaign appearance in new jersey.






standing before a campaign flag that promises "equality," mejía doesn't mention same-sex marriage but jokes that his campaign handlers wanted him to wear a wig during media appearances if he wanted poll numbers to improve.  then he says: "there are people who can change everything about you, even the way you sit down" and says they tried to convince him to sit "the way a little faggot does." the place erupts in laughter.

the fact is that the dominican republic is one of the few latin american nations that bans same-sex marriage in its constitution so all this talk about being a bellwether against gays getting married is just pure political demagoguery.  it is also something being used by religious forces in the dominican republic to rile up opposition to u.s. ambassador james "wally" brewster who is openly gay and married.

late last month ambassador brewster spoke at a gathering of openly gay u.s. ambassadors in washington, d.c., and movingly described the attacks he and his partner bob satawake had received from dominican evangelicals since their arrival. while the current government has been mostly mum on the issue, they certainly have backed and supported brewster behind the scenes.

but in freely raising the marriage equality issue during his campaign visit to the united states, mejía is sending a clear message to dominican religious conservatives: vote for me and i'll make the gay go away.

miley cyrus banned in the dominican republic for allegedly promoting lesbian sex



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest






the national commission for public performances in the dominican republic announced today that they were banning a september 13th miley cyrus concert for, among other things, promoting lesbian sex.

"the national commission for public performances in the exercise of the powers given by the constitution of the republic through regulation 824 of law number 1951article 4306 - the purpose of which is to prevent public performances that offend the morals, good customs and relationship between friendly countries - imposes this ban based on miley cyrus' common engagement in acts during her concerts that defy morals and customs in ways usually penalized by dominican law," a statement reads.

they add that cyrus "uses inadequate attire, corrupts language, uses perverse imagery and phrasing, uses phrases with double meanings, glorifies crime, violence and denigrating acts against civility and promotes sex, lesbian sex and the use of inadequate objects in public."

being gay or lesbian is not a crime in the caribbean island but religious fundamentalists have grown increasingly vocal in their opposition to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues and have, as of late, targeted the openly gay u.s. ambassador to the dominican republic james "wally" brewster and his husband bob satawake.

dominican president danilo medina has so far offered veiled support to the u.s. ambassador by appearing with him at public events and praising his work. but he has yet to use his huge popularity to push back against the rising tide of homophobia in the dominican republic and certain government offices including national police authorities that say that accepting gays in the police force would violate the dominican constitution and, now, this ridiculous step by the national commission for public performances.ff 
the new york post and the associated press have already picked up the story.  the national commission for public performances in the dominican republic deserves every bit of international ridicule they receive as a result of today's actions.

esteban paulón gets married to pablo cirlini



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest









in the four years since argentina became the first latin american country to pass a marriage equality law 9,362 same-sex couples have decided to get hitched according to the latest numbers released last week.

the law would not have become a reality without the years of patient and expert lobby work of the argentine lgbt federation (falgbt) and this week the agency decided to mark the anniversary by accompanying a russian lesbian couple as they received their marriage license (same-sex couples can get married in argentina regardless of immigration status or nationality).



marina mironova and oxana tamofeeba are seeking political asylum in the south american country and news of their wedding came on the same week that russian president vladimir putin arrived in the country to visit argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner.

putin has been pillared as of late for his lack of action and outright defense of several so-called "anti gay-propaganda" laws that have flowered in russia under his watch and as the relationship between russia and the united states has increasingly deteriorated he has looked to left-wing governments in latin america for support.

last week alone he touched ground in cuba, nicaragua, brazil and argentina and met their respective presidents raúl castro, daniel ortega, dilma rouseff and cristina de kirchner and also connected with evo morales of bolivia, nicolás maduro of venezuela and fidel castro as well.  none challenged him on russia's homophobic policies at least publicly.



in the meantime a more personal story was taking place behind the scenes. 



four years ago esteban paulón was single 32 years of age and fighting for marriage equality with the falgbt as a volunteer. yesterday at 36 and as president of the organization he married the love of his life pablo cirlini.

as argentine senator rubén giustiniani put it yesterday on twitter "when we passed the marriage equality law one of its principal advocates used to say 'i don't even have a partner!', today esteban paulón gets married. congratulations!"

cuando sancionamos el matrimonio igualitario1 de sus principales impulsores decía:"yo no tengo ni pareja",hoy se casa.@epaulonlgbt fecidades
— rubén giustiniani (@rgiustiniani) july 19, 2014


in the days before the wedding the couple made the usual arrangements and applied for a marriage license. to their surprise - four years after argentina passed their marriage equality law - the marriage license application they were given at the santa fe notary still listed spaces where a "husband" and a "wife" could sign the document.

esteban took to twitter to say that it was a little shameful that the local civil marriage bureaus had yet to update their forms but said that having to sign the document as a "wife" was not going to keep the couple from getting married.

others shared similar stories: @alejodip also said that when he and his partner applied for a marriage license in 
santa fe he also had to write his name in a line where the word "ms." had been 
penciled out and the word "mr." had been penciled in.

the santa fe government took no time to apologize to the couple on twitter and vowed to work with the falgbt to modernize documents in the near future.

at the end of the day all three couples are legally married, congratulations to all three couples.

sen. ruben diaz offers free rides to dc, doesn't mention anti-gay nom rally



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest







my friend scott rose brought this to my attention yesterday and i find it both desperate and hilarious.

as the battle for marriage equality in the united states winds down and the anti-gay national organization for marriage slips into irrelevance, the organization has been desperately trying to rally participants for one last hurrah: the so-called "2014 march for marriage" scheduled for june 19th.

as in years past, nom's president brian brown has turned to new york state senator ruben diaz, sr. as his savior having shown proven ability to rally thousands of people to previous anti-gay rallies.

from one of brian brown's increasingly desperate newsblasts:


i just recently got off the phone with my good friend, new york state
senator, rev. ruben diaz, who will be speaking at the march again this year.  he told
me that he plans to bring down over 100 buses to the march from the bronx this year!

he is calling it the "second annual bus vigil to washington."  he plans to depart new
york at 4:00 am
 in a spiritual convoy of activists coming to the nation's capital to 
defend marriage!  that's over 5,000 people — overwhelmingly
latino and african-american constituents — that a single political and 
spiritual leader wants to bring to washington dc this summer!


diaz is calling it the "second annual bus vigil to washington" because in his pitches for the rally he actually never mentions the nom or the word "marriage" for that matter.







excerpts:


i'd like to invite you to participate in the "second vigil on wheels to washington." we will be traveling to washington, dc - the nations capital - to testify and say that we are still a powerful church... we are offering any pastor or organization that wishes to accompany us to washington a bus completely free of charge. each bus holds 55 passengers and we will send the bus to any place you tell us to do so... the bus will pick you up there, will bring you to washington and will bring you back to the same spot. and you won't have to pay for a single thing... join us! take advantage of the opportunity. ask for your bus! fill the bus! and let's go to washington!  let's go on a trip! visit the monuments in washington and testify that jesus heals and saves and is the king we await. 


that's right. reverend diaz is selling the free bus rides to dc as an opportunity for people to visit the various monuments throughout the city.  a wonderful opportunity for members of latino churches throughout the area who might not get a lot of chances to visit dc. 



this is not the first time diaz has rallied people to anti-marriage equality demonstrations using deception. at previous rallies i have heard church leaders say that they had no idea they were being taken to such a rally and i have heard other religious leaders that they felt pressured to participate or risk losing the senator's support.



but this is the first time diaz has been caught at it so openly. hilarious.



by the way, as long as you can fill a bus with 55 occupants, senator diaz says he will send the bus wherever you want it to go and transport everyone to dc. all you need to do is call (718) 991-3161 and ask for reverend samaris.

chile: hate messages spray-painted on the outside walls of lgbt-rights organization movilh



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest






photo captured by chilean web magazine north.

this past weekend several of chile's leading lgbt-rights organizations held a "unity" march in observation of the international day against homophobia
 and transphobia which, by some estimates, drew as many as 50,000 people.

the country recently elected president michelle bachelet on a platform that includes debating marriage equality although she has since put it on the back burner saying that the debate won't happen until at least next year.

the country has also seen a series of vicious anti-gay attacks and murders in the last few years including daniel zamudio who was beaten to death in 2012 and whose aggressors carved swastikas on his body using broken beer bottles



sometime during sunday night or monday before dawn someone
 spray-painted a number of hateful messages outside the offices of the movilh, one of the leading lgbt-rights organizations in the country. the messages read: "death to faggots", "aids-ridden faggots", "put your marches up your 
ass, fucked faggots", "more aids, less fags" and "do me a favor aids, 
and kill more faggots".

there has been an outpouring of support for 
movilh and international condemnation for the attack. the united nation's office of the high commissioner released a statement in spanish through it's south american regional office which they call on the state to investigate the crime and hold those who did it accountable. the chilean government under bachelet has also responded quickly sending a spokesperson to the site of the attacks to express strong support for movilh and a commitment to address the crime.

if you would like to express support for movilh, please 
take a couple of minutes and drop a line or two on their facebook page: movilh chile.

us ambassador james brewster and husband meet with dominican president and wife



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest






l-r: us ambassador james brewster, dominican president danilo medina, his wife cándida and brewster's husband bob satawake (via twitter)

earlier today the new us ambassador to the dominican republic james "wally" brewster and his husband bob satawake were among several diplomats and their spouses who met with dominican president danilo medina and his wife cándida at a ceremonial diplomatic cocktail that had been previously postponed.

the event sparked a diplomatic row earlier this year when vatican envoy to the dominican republic jude thaddeus okolo - in charge of the event - sent a private letter to all diplomats announcing that ambassador brewster's husband would not be invited claiming that to do so would violate the dominican constitution which bans same-sex marriages. diplomats reacted in anger and refused to attend the event unless mr. satawake was extended an invitation.



vatican envoy jude thaddeus okolo at today's diplomatic event.

the vatican envoy must have gotten the message because the event finally took place earlier today with the attendance of mr. satawake. 

dominican vice president forced to withdraw homophobic 'family code' draft from consideration: in the meantime the big news in the dominican republic last week was the swift introduction and removal of proposed changes to the island's 'family code' which would have championed 'traditional catholic family models' into the dominican legislature.



homophobic dominican cardinal lopez rodriguez and the dominican vice president

dominican vice president margarita cedeño led the draft language committee and requested that the proposal be withdrawn almost as quick as it had been announced arguing that she now understood that it should have been first presented to the public for debate before being presented to the dominican legislature for approval.

the bill drew withering criticism from left and right with newspaper 7 dias calling it "a trojan horse launched by the most extreme wing of conservative dominican ideology.

the paper said the proposed language championed heterosexual marriages above all mentioning single parent households only twice and only when talking about welfare recipients.

proposed changes to the family code would also have narrowed down and eliminated reasons why a couple should be granted a divorce except for one single expansion:  in the case a partner demonstrates "homosexual or lesbian conduct."

the proposed language also drew criticism from left an right for lowering the age at which someone was allowed to marry from 18 years of age to 16 in the case of boys and 14 in the case of girls.

no word from bishop okolo on whether he deems 14 year old girls ready for marriage. 

the washington blade visits lgbt advocates in the dominican republic: finally. in light of these developments my friend michael k. lavers traveled to the dominican republic a couple of weeks ago and gauged the impact of the arrival of the openly gay us ambassador to the dominican republic for the washington blade. 

many of those advocates were the only ones who spoke up for ambassador brewster before he took office and brewster thanked them for it at a meeting that took place in february which also drew homophobic responses from the religious right in the island.

“we are defending a person who is homosexual, that is gay and has 
come to occupy his country’s public position in the dominican republic,” said delvis ventura of the dominican lgbt-rights and hiv prevention organization amigos siempre amigos, “we are defending the right that we have to occupy public
 positions equally as gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans people. this is 
why we are defending wally.”

brewster had elicited some criticism from the dominican religious right when he met with a number of lgbt-advocates in february as well.

three years after nude photo scandal roberto arango comes out



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest







it has been almost three years since cuban-born roberto arango resigned from the puerto rican senate in the wake of a scandal over a number of nude photos from a grindr profile were leaked to the press.  initially arango denied he was the man in the photos and then he acknowledged some of the photos were his but alleged he had taken them to document his weight-loss under a new diet but he never admitted whether the photos came from a personal profile on the popular gay men's hook up app or whether he was gay.



the news became tabloid fodder in the united states and arango is still listed on several lists of the top sexual scandals to hit any politician but behind the scandal also laid the past of a man who had previously voted to deny rights to the lgbt community in puerto rico and sided with some of the most conservative factions in the island.

in 2004 he mocked a san juan mayoral candidate during a political rally by implying he was gay and holding a plastic duck and making quacking noises when speaking against him ("pato" or duck in spanish is a word often used as a slur against gays in puerto rico).

in 2007 he embraced a conservative religious coalition and personally received thousands of signatures they had collected against same-sex civil unions as he vowed to defend so-called christian values in the puerto rican senate and prevent changes to the civil code.  that year he also led efforts to amend the puerto rican constitution to ban recognition of any unions that were not those between a man and a woman (the effort ultimately failed).

and in 2009 he defended secret efforts by conservative colleagues in the senate to pass a bill banning adoption rights for same-sex couples as i documented in a previous post.

after resigning from the senate arango retired in the united states where he said he wanted to dedicate more time to raising a daughter from a previous marriage and concentrate on his personal life.

and then last may he reappeared publicly to urge the conservative party in which he had served as a senator to back a number of measures to protect members of the lgbt community from discrimination (the measures would pass).

it was a welcome sign that arango might have come around on his past efforts against the lgbt community.

there were rumors that arango might be paving his way to return to puerto rican politics but the scandal and the unanswered questions about his sexuality remained.

today, three years after the scandal, arango finally came out in a radio interview with noti uno an excerpt of which was posted on youtube...







here is the exchange:

reporter: following the controversy over the photos there was a lot of speculation about your sexual preference. isn't it time for you to state whether or not you are a homosexual?
roberto arango: well, the day someone asks me i will give a reply. in that respect, i have nothing to hide.
reporter: are you a homosexual?
roberto arango: yes. and on top of that i am a businessman. on top of that i am a father, i am a brother, i am a son. on top of that i like doing community work and volunteering. on top of that i like helping different communities. i like it and i am someone who likes to bring changes and progress and to give opportunities to those who want it.
reporter: when did you realize you were one.
roberto arango: i think it happened when i accepted it and i may not be a psychologist or a specialist in that field...
reporter: and did you accept it before your exit from the senate?
roberto arango: no. it was after. my exit from the senate and the process itself was what led me to accept myself.

audio of the entire half hour interview in spanish is available here.

update #1: metro reports that arango is preparing to launch a campaign to become the mayor of san juan.

update #2: full 45 minute interview, in spanish, as later posted by noti uno:

transgressive or regressive? jennifer lopez and ricky martin hook up in latest wisin music video 



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest







when two of the biggest latino music stars in the world play lovers in a music video does the world pay notice? particularly if one of the stars is known for a series of high-profile heterosexual relationships (jennifer lopez) and the other is known as the biggest latino personality to have ever come out as being gay (ricky martin)?

that's the case in a video released today as the lead single from puerto rican singer wisin's first solo album and titled "adrenalina":






wisin was able to pull this high-wattage stunt because he was part of one of the most successful reggaeton acts in the music industry over the last decade - wisin & yandel - and happened to be among the latino music acts that supported ricky martin when he came out.

ricky himself featured the duo in a cut from his first album after coming out called "frio"...





that particular song also speaks of unrequited love from a man to a woman.

both of these songs were launched as singles after ricky's very prominent coming out in 2010 so they weren't necessarily covering up for his sexuality so the fact that he is still be considered to play up a heterosexual romantic role in videos like these might be transgressive in itself but it certainly stand out that ricky has yet to release or participate in a music video that also highlights same-sex love.  i raised this issue previously when it came to one of the most beautiful songs on his last album and one of its most homoerotic as well "tu y yo" (spanish language lyrics here),

and yet, last week in chile at the viña del mar music festival ricky didn't shy away from homoerotic play. here is his performance of his hit "shake your bom bom"...






full viña performance here.




also, woof!...

dominican republic: diplomats boycott event after husband of gay u.s. ambassador is asked not to attend



email thisblogthis!share to xshare to facebookshare to pinterest






bob satawake and his husband james "wally" brewster as photographed by dominican magazine ritmo social.

just as it seemed a diplomatic row might have been averted last week when the dominican republic expressed full support for out u.s. ambassador james "wally" brewster and denounced its own ambassador to the vatican for publicly criticizing a meeting brewster held with lgbt advocates, a brand new diplomatic controversy has emerged over brewster's marriage to bob satawake.

as last week's controversy was playing out, reports have emerged that an earlier kerfuffle erupted over a cancelled january 22nd diplomatic event in honor of dominican republic president danilo medina.

organized by the dean of the diplomatic corps, the gathering was meant to be a private opportunity for diplomats and their spouses to honor the president but, as acento reported yesterday, the dean himself raised objections about extending an invitation to ambassador brewster's husband and made a personal call to ask the ambassador for his understanding and consideration. 

from a private letter sent to all diplomats after questions were raised about the decision as translated from spanish:

1. reasons why the partner of the u.s. ambassador was not invited to the diplomatic cocktail in honor of the president of the dominican republic: the partner of the u.s. ambassador is not accredited as a "wife" but, instead, as a "dependent" of the ambassador. in the constitution of the dominican republic, same sex marriages are not recognized. thus the dominican authorities cannot officially recognize him as his "wife." 

2. this explains why he was not invited to accompany the ambassador. 

3. it would be incorrect and in some ways offensive to the entire diplomatic body to go against the constitution and, worse yet, in front of the president of the republic and in the presence of representatives from all the diplomatic missions accredited by the dominican republic. 

4. the dean of the diplomatic corps has spoken to the u.s. ambassador regarding this impasse and has asked for his understanding regarding this question, particularly about its delicate nature as he well knows.  we expect the ambassador to accept this calmly and with due consideration. the use of prudence would insure a proper way to handle this issue.  

5. this does not imply any prejudice in the understanding, respect and tolerance the colleagues from the diplomatic corps have towards the u.s. ambassador, mr. james w. brewster.

6. an authority from the foreign affairs ministry called on saturday, january 18th, to express that the "foreign affairs ministry" has no objection regarding to the attendance of the partner of the u.s. ambassador. naturally, the responsibility then falls on the diplomatic body. 

7. later, speaking to an authority from the foreign affairs ministry, it was acknowledged that the largest obstacle still remained: the fundamental question raised by the constitution. the dean reaffirmed that it would be completely wrong for the heads of the missions to go against the constitution in front of the president. the ministerial authority immediately recognized the severity of the circumstance and how local media might make an issue out of it.


archbishop okolo with dominican republic president danilo medina.

the letter was signed by the dean of the diplomatic corps which happens to be the new envoy from the vatican to the dominican republic archbishop jude thaddeus okolo originally from the african republic of chad. 

in october, bishop okolo replaced polish archbishop josef wesolowski after he escaped the dominican republic fleeing sexual abuse allegations.

the dominican foreign affairs ministry was not the only one who expressed having no issue with showing ambassador brewster the respect of treating his husband as his spouse. as acento reports, "several diplomats refused to attend and the event had to be suspended."

the foreign affairs ministry was also the government entity that stepped up last week when the dominican ambassador to the vatican criticized ambassador brewster and expressed full support for the u.s. ambassador.



u.k. ambassador to the dominican republic steven m. fisher.

update (feb. 20th, 2014): when acento broke the news about the cancellation of the diplomatic meeting on tuesday several conservative religious leaders immediately tried to spin the story by applauding diplomats for allegedly taking a "principled" stand against same-sex marriage and staying away from the event.

unfortunately for them whoever is leaking internal diplomatic letters to acento responded by disclosing a letter steven m. fisher wrote to archbishop okole in response to the reasons given for not inviting mr. satawake to the event:

his excellency, i am writing to you regarding the e-mail you sent on january 20th of 2014 regarding the "reasons why the partner of the u.s. ambassador was not invited to the cocktail organized by the diplomatic corps in honor of the president to the dominican republic."  

i regret the very difficult situation in which this decision has placed me when it comes to my participation in the cocktail reception. i believe this decision unjustly discriminates against a member of the diplomatic corps in a way that is unjustifiable. additionally, it is my understanding that these issues should have been discussed by the diplomatic corps with enough time for each ambassador to give their point of view. 

i reiterate the suggestion i made via e-mail on january 18th to modify the invitation so it equally includes everyone. 

in the case the decision remains the same by not treating everyone equally or shows disrespect for someone's civil status, i am afraid i unfortunately won't be able to participate in the cocktail.
in other words, vatican envoy jude thaddeus okolo was not only advised that the dominican foreign affairs ministry in representation of the government had no issue with inviting mr. satawake to the event but other diplomats clearly warned him they would stay away if he insisted in discriminating against him.

don't blame the gays for this diplomatic fiasco. blame the new vatican envoy to the dominican republic and conservatives from the dominican republic who insist on treating the u.s. ambassador and his husband with such disrespect.
