about p.u.r.e.™ 



since 2001, we have educated families that are searching for the best-matched, residential treatment programs for their teenagers. as parent advocates, we have been down this road with our own teen that needed placement, and understand the importance of this major emotional and financial decision.sue scheff, the founder of p.u.r.e.™, recognized this need after her daughter was harmed in a teen-help program and her family was duped by misleading and false information online. after winning a lawsuit against these programs, she understands how parents can fall prey when they are desperate to find help. scheff continues to advocate for parents with education, resources, and wisdom.
