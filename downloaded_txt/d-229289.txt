upcoming kirby





was cleaning up a few things on the old site, and figured since i still get a fair level of traffic here thanks to old links and search engines i'd quickly mention that mark evanier has a coffee-table style artbook on kirby coming out this fall, kirby: king of comics.  this is not the comprehensive biography he's long promised, that is still in progress and will follow in a few years, but an art-heavy book designed to appeal to both established and casual fans.as always, check the new home of the kirby weblog for updates and more details.  it's a big year for kirby reprints (massive hardcovers of the heart of the ff run and most of the fourth world will be available by years end, plus a lot more).

and so it begins...





come on, no one ever dies forever in comics....thanks to the kind invitation of randolph hoppe, the jack kirby comics weblog will now be hosted by the jack kirby museum.  so i guess i can call it "the official kirby weblog" now.  hopefully this will bring more traffic to both the weblog and the museum site (and there are some big plans for that site).  there'll be some changes, as i figure out wordpress and the options it provides, but for the most part more of the same, an almost daily dose of kirby from his long career (actually, i was just curious and it looks like i've posted about 590 kirby publications in 566 days, so i slightly beat the daily goal i set for myself, though i did have to resort to a lot of covers to fill in the fallow times).i'll probably pop by here for the next little while to post the occasional reminder and update, and leave the archives here for posterity (although old posts and comments have been imported to the new site, and i'll be upgrading some of the earlier scans over time).  and a tip of the hat to blogger/blogspot (still the home of my other two weblogs) for a year and a half of remarkably solid performance for a free service.  i highly recommend it if you want to start a weblog of your own.  also to photobucket and imageshack for image hosting.and thanks to everyone who read, linked, e-mailed and commented, and i hope to see you all at the new digs.  update your bookmarks and links to: http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/kirby/

the destiny of blog and man alike





this might be my favourite kirby page from marvel in the 1960s.  so much so i don't have the heart to tamper with the lettering.that's the last one, i promise.  announcement (which some of you have figured out, in general terms at least) later today.
