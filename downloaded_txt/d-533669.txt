about



mark joseph steakhouse opened its doors in january of 2001 down a quaint cobble stone street just north of the south street seaport and south of the infamous brooklyn bridge. combining excellent food with polished service in a comfortable atmosphere affords us the opportunity to make sure that each of our guests has the authentic new york city steakhouse experience that has become synonymous with the mark joseph steakhouse name.taking charge of the dry age process on site has given us total control over the quality of meat that is served. having our owner hand select our meats and then dry aging each short loin on premise in a temperature and humidity controlled refrigeration unit, insures that our guests are always served the finest quality meats. using a special infrared oven that heats as high as 1200 degrees allows us to perfectly char each steak serving our guests consistently prepared foods from our extensive dinner and bar menus. our signature dish, a 40 oz porterhouse, arrives at the table sizzling in its natural juices. meat fans are in luck! our menu boasts a 38 oz rib steak, a 20 oz sirloin, and a 12 and a 16 oz filet mignon.
