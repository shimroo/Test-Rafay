western states legal foundation (wslf) is a non-profit, public interest organization founded in 1982, which monitors and analyzes u.s. nuclear weapons programs and policies and related high technology energy and weapons programs, with a focus on the national nuclear weapons laboratories.  

wslf recognizes that nuclear weapons affect the environment, 
      the economy, the role of violence in society, and democracy itself. rather 
      than enhancing our "national" security, nuclear weapons threaten our 
      fundamental human security. wslf seeks to abolish nuclear weapons, compel 
      open public environmental review of nuclear technologies, and ensure 
      appropriate management of nuclear waste. grounded in nonviolence and 
      rooted in both international and environmental law, the principle guiding 
      wslf's activities is democratization of decision making affecting nuclear 
      weapons and related technologies.
program 
      areas: 

research and 
        analysis on current u.s. nuclear weapons policies, ongoing nuclear weapons research, testing, and production activities, and their impacts on international security.
research and 
        analysis on other high technology weapons programs, such as ballistic 
        missile defense and efforts to further militarize outer space, which 
        threaten international stability and make the elimination of nuclear 
        arsenals more difficult to achieve.
assisting 
        communities affected by the health and environmental impacts of nuclear 
        weapons research and production and of other nuclear technologies. 
        



affiliations: 

      wslf is a founding member of the abolition 2000 global network 
      to eliminate nuclear weapons.  wslf has been a member since 1989 of the alliance for nuclear accountability, 
      and is affiliated with the international association of lawyers against nuclear arms, the international peace bureau, and the global network against weapons and nuclear power in space.
