homewhat is a divorce mediator? who hires them and what do they do?
divorce mediators long island is where two parties in a divorce sit down with a third party, the mediator, to attempt to reach an agreement as to how they will separate.   the mediator facilitates the conversation but doesn’t make any decisions for the couple; rather their role is simply to bring the ideas of each person together so that some consensus can be reached.    a divorce mediator can also help couples who are approaching separation or divorce but haven’t filed any papers yet and still hope to resolve matters fairly and amicably .
during this process, which can take 3-10 sessions depending on how contentious things get, there’s no judge or court involved. the mediator doesn’t have the power to impose a solution and can only facilitate discussion, so it’s up to the couple to agree on terms. if they don’t reach an agreement that both parties can live with, then they’ll have to go their separate ways without any assistance from a trained professional.
the two most important issues for people in many divorces are children and money . in mediation, this means that these topics will be discussed in detail , but other things might also be brought up depending on what matters most to each individual.
what is a divorce mediator?
types of divorce mediation
different kinds of divorce mediators work in different ways: some specialize in one area—for example, custody resolution only or finances only—while others are trained to handle all aspects of divorce.    there are also hybrid mediators who handle custody, property division and support issues.
some divorce mediators work with clients one-on-one, while others facilitate group sessions where the couple meets with other couples who are going through similar challenges. this approach can be particularly helpful for people whose main difficulty is communicating with each other because they see how another couple handles conflict and hear their advice about what’s worked for them .
mediators might offer different kinds of services depending on your needs: some hold formal hearings where you’ll present evidence, call witnesses and generally follow the same rules as if you were in court; others use more informal processes that involve less strict procedures but which allow you to work through your issues calmly and privately .
mediators who’ve gone through training with the american academy of matrimonial lawyers (aaml) or any other such organization also subscribe to a code of ethics that requires them to keep everything they learn about their clients strictly confidential until they’re required by law to disclose it.    this can help couples feel safe sharing information knowing it won’t be shared with anyone outside the mediation room unless absolutely necessary .
how do i find a divorce mediator?
there are two ways: you can ask for recommendations from friends and family members, or you can search online using your city and state in combination with “divorce mediation.”    you have the most success if you look for someone who works within your budget and has experience helping people with the same kind of issues you’re experiencing.
what qualifications should my divorce mediator have?
the most important qualification for a divorce mediator is that they’ve completed extensive training in handling all aspects of divorce—custody, property division, support his or her state recognizes as valid .    you can also look for someone who specializes in whatever area matters the most to you: if you need help with custody but don’t care so much about how assets are divided, then call an attorney who deals exclusively with child-related issues; conversely, if money or finances matter more than anything else, find an attorney who’s experienced in this area.
you want a divorce mediator who understands your point of view so they can help you communicate it to your spouse in the most effective way.    when choosing a mediator, ask about their communication style and whether they’re able to talk things out reasonably with people who have opposing viewpoints .
what are divorce mediation costs?
mediation doesn’t cost much more than hiring an attorney, but you might end up saving money because there are no filing fees or other expensive procedures involved.   the price will depend on the city you live in, the mediator’s experience level and any additional services he or she offers (such as negotiation sessions between spouses after initial mediation).
one thing to keep in mind is that divorce mediation takes longer than hiring an attorney. you’ll probably meet at least two or three times before you can come to an agreement and sign a divorce decree, and it’s possible the process will continue after that.    on the other hand, mediation is faster than going through court because there are no hearings or formal procedures to follow—which means less stress for everyone involved .
what do divorce mediators cost?
the price varies depending on where you live, how experienced your mediator is and what services he offers (such as negotiation sessions between spouses after initial mediation). you may receive a discount if you meet with your mediator more than once.
