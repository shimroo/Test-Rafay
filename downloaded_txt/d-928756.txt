hey guys! hope you're all happy and rested from your break and ready to 
start up with the garden again this sunday at 10:00 am in the rice 
community garden (for any newcomers, the garden is right behind mudd 
lab, in front of the mob building). the garden needs a bunch of work 
from being neglected all break, and i also can't wait to see you all 
again. remember it's a three-day weekend, and you probably don't have 
much better to do anyway since class just started, so come on out and 
bring your friends!

hi everyone! 
 
here's what's coming up this semester for rsvp children's:
 
depelchin's: our monthly visits to the children's center will continue
this saturday, january 29. if you'd like to come, please e-mail me (i'm
planning to take 10 people as usual) and tell me if you have a car (b/c
we need transportation!) the time commitment will be 1-3 (we'll probably
meet a little earlier than 1). hope you can make it!
 
children's awareness week: i'd like to get a committee together to plan
our first children's awareness week. it'll be much like hunger &
homelessness week last november, if you remember, except of course with
a different focus. i need a lot of help and ideas, so please, if you are
interested, e-mail me! i'd like to have a meeting sometime next week so
tell me what day would be good for you. 
 
thanks and i look forward to working with ya'll again this semester :-)

hey!  i am a sid junior who is taking the semester off to work as the
volunteer coordinator for the national ms society in houston.  i am
responsible for getting approximately 3000 volunteers at the various
sites along the route for the ms-150 over the weekend of april 16th-17th
(huge, i know!). the tour itself starts at two houston stadiums, stops
overnight in la grange, and ends on sunday at the state capitol building
in austin.  though this is my first tour with which to be involved, i
have heard from volunteers, staff, and riders alike that it is an
amazing and fun experience.
 
though there are tons of volunteers needed for the actual event in
april, we desperately need volunteers for the biker packet pick-ups
around houston in late march and early april.  i would love to see rsvp
involved with this event!  rice students always make a great impression
wherever they go, and this opportunity is for a truly worthy cause.   i
am including a schedule for the packet pick-ups for you to send on to
your club members and anyone else that you know that would be interested
in helping out such a wonderful organization (and a fellow rice
student!).

sunday, february 27, at 9 p.m. at sammys.  for those of you who dont know, 
spring fling is an annual festival held on campus for houstons 
underprivileged children (like project pumpkin last semester).  we need help 
getting the kids, publicizing, recruiting volunteers, and finding student 
organizations to sponsor booths, among other things.  if you want to help 
out, just e-mail me at julia7@rice.edu or come to the meeting this weekend.  

thanks!

the 8th of march is the international day of women. warmest greetings to

"this is a man's world
but it wouldn't be nothing
nothing without a woman or a girl
..
without a woman or a girl
he's lost in the wilderness
he's lost in bitterness"

happy march 8th!

  rice ems is in need of volunteers to act out different
scenarios for training new emts. volunteers can be "patients" or
"bystanders" and this role-playing  can be very entertaining.

if you are willing to help out with this fun event, please email rachana
patel at rachana@rice.edu.  extrication day is sunday, april 17th from
1-5pm. it would be a great way to give back to the people that are always

volunteer @ the houston humane society! orientation session thursday 
march 24th - meet at the rmc?s circular drive @ 2:45 p.m.!

-----------------   *   -----------------   *    -----------------   *  
   -----------------   *   -----------------

additional information:
if you would like to volunteer at the houston humane society, you must 
attend an orientation session there first (one and you?re done for 
life!), which is why there is now (finally) one scheduled only for rice 
students! after attending the session, which usually takes less than an 
hour, you can come back to the humane society anytime - on your own, or 
with various "carpool" groups of rice students!

the rice only orientation session will be thursday, march 24th! we'll 
all meet at the rmc's circular drive (the side closest to the baker 
institute/jones school) at 2:45, so don't be late and you can get a 
ride over! please rsvp to me, waitsman@rice.edu. (and remember, the 
more the merrier - so bring all your friends!)

volunteering at the hhs in this capacity means that you will be able to 
play with, pet, brush, and walk dogs and puppies; and socialize, brush, 
and pet the cats and kittens! so, take some time off from studying and 
come play withthe animals!

dear lovely reps/anyone else who would like to help,

children's week is this week!!!  

1) i have flyers for you to pick up in the cic (10 tabletop trifold-type flyers per college to 
be put out on tables in the commons.  please get them out asap b/c the "week" 
officially starts tomorrow! 

2) the clothing drive is going on right now. please make sure there is a donation box 
in your commons and flyers posted.  speaking of the clothing drive, i'd like a group of 
you to go out one night this week, door to door, to kindly ask your fellow college 
members for old clothes or money.  this was very effective for the drive we had last 
semester.

3) on thursday, at the kiddo concert (see below), bring by the boxes and money from 
the drive

4) e-mail me back if you are picking up flyers so i know they all went out.  also e-mail 
me about when your college plans to go door-to-door so i k now this is getting done.  
and finally, tell me who will be delivering clothes to the kiddo concert so i know we 
collect all the clothes from each college

just so you know, here's a brief rundown of the week:
tues: visit to texas children's at 10am (we are bringing activity sheets and leis to the

rsvp is holding its annual spring fling this saturday, april 16th, from 12 to 
4 p.m. in the will rice quad.  spring fling is a festival for underprivileged 
children in the houston area, with fun booths centered on learning sponsored  
by rice clubs and organizations.  we are looking for volunteers to help out 
by setting-up, registering groups, assisting with transportation, and guiding 
the groups around the festival.  this is a great and easy way to help out the 
houston community.  if you can help out in any way between 12 and 4, please e-
mail tam@rice.edu and let us know what time you can be there and what you 
would like to help with.

hey rsvp!

this thursday, april 14, between 5 and 7, we're hosting our first kiddo 
concert.  we've invited kids from the nehemiah center from pre-k to first 
grade to perform a couple of songs for us.  then, we're turning around and 
giving them a concert.  pizza and drinks will be at the event, and the 
concert will feature tomorrow's past, the very awesome juggling club, the 
saucy salseros, a special martial arts performance by michael vick, and 
more!  all of rice is invited, so bring yourselves and all your friends.  
the kids would also love volunteers to play with them.  if we ask, they'll 
even sing "lean back" swagger and all. we will also have games and activites 
set up-including a very competetive game of tag.  come!! play!!  eat!! and 
support children's awareness week.

for kid's sake,

preetha pkurian@rice.edu and tam tam@rice.edu

hey rsvp, 
the year's almost over, but the children's committee still has 2 events
to complete
1)      depelchin children's center - last monthly visit of the year:
saturday, april 23, 1-3pm.  i'm taking a max of 10 people. please e-mail
tam nguyen (one of the new children's chairs) if you would like to go.
also specify whether or not you have a car, so we can make sure there is
enough for transportation.
2)      communities in schools needs 10 volunteers to guide 10 small
groups of middle school students on saturday, april 23 from 10:00 - 1:00
pm (if you want to do this, don't sign up for depelchin). you will be
leading them through a scavenger hunt on campus as they tour rice.
picnic lunch and other activities will be done as well.  we really need
people to sign up for this, so if you are free this saturday, please
help us out!! contact geneva rhee (gwrhee@gccisd.net) for more
information.
thanks and good luck with the next couple weeks, as they will likely be
hectic!

actually, for the communities in schools tour, you are only needed from
10-11 for the tour/scavenger hunt, therefore, you could sign up for
depelchin too :-) e-mail me as well if you would like to participate in
either/both events.

sorry for being a little spammy about this, but i think it's important.


read all the way to the bottom and sign your name...

i went to a party,
and remembered what you said.
you told me not to drink, mom
so i had root beer instead.
i felt proud of myself,
the way you said i would,
that i didn't drink and drive e,
though some friends said i should
i made a healthy choice,
and your advice to me was right,
the party finally ended,
and the kids drove out of sight.
i got into my car,
sure to get home in one piece,
i never knew what was coming, mom
something i expected least.
now i'm lying on the pavement,
and i hear the policeman say,
the kid that caused this wreck was drunk,
mom, his voice seems far away.
my own blood's all around me,
as i try hard not to cry.
i can hear the paramedics say,
this girl is going to die.
i'm sure the guy had no idea,
while he was flying high,
because he chose to drink and drive,
now i would have to die.
so why do people do it, mom
knowing that it ruins lives?
and now the pain is cutting me,
like a hundred stabbing knives
tell sister not to be afraid, mom
tell daddy to be brave,
and when i go to heaven,
put "daddy's girl" on my grave.
someone should have taught him,
that its wrong to drink and drive.
maybe if his parents had,
i'd still be alive
my breath is getting shorter, mom
i'm getting really scared.
these are my final moments,
and i'm so unprepared.
i wish that you could hold me mom,
as i lie here and die.
i wish that i could say, "i love you, mom!"
so i love you and good-bye.

beautiful apartment for you! :-)
 
2 bed/2 bath at the providence at kirby-super safe.
 
living, dining, kitchen, big walk-in closets, built in bookshelf, washer
and dryer, dishwasher, balcony, and a sparkling pool.
 
nearly furnished or unfurnished, based on your needs.  available may 13.

 
we would transfer the lease to your name, so you can extend it for as
long as you would like.  (the current lease expires mid july, but you
can extend it at the same monthly rate.)  you can go until school
starts, or if you're living off campus next year, you can just stay
here! if you do this option, you can renew for our current rent rate (i
think) which is significantly lower than the sticker price. 
 
email ginnys@rice.edu or kswanson@rice.edu for more information and
price! :-)

hey guys,
if you're staying in houston this summer grace is looking for some people to
help them out with moving.  here is some info below:


the gulf region advocacy center, or grace, is organized for the purpose of
supporting and providing quality representation to indigent persons charged
with capital crimes in the state courts of texas and louisiana.

houston is the largest u.s. city without a public defender system.  though
the harris county district attorney's office has long maintained specialized

units for capital trial and appellate work, never has there been a
defender's
office devoted exclusively to capital trials of the indigent where public
interest lawyers can work together, share skills and materials, benefit from

economies of scale, engage in systematic impact litigation and become
specialists in indigent capital trials.

grace is such an office.

we have outgrown our current office and just managed to scrape together
enough funds to put a down payment on a new property.  unfortunately it is
not in a state to occupy.  any hands that can contribute to our renovation
efforts would be very welcome.  we would be especially grateful if you have
any building, construction or painting experience but if you don't, please
don't let that put you off.  we don't either!



if you are interested in helping out on a saturday (even just for a couple
of hours) or know anyone who would be interested, please don't hesitate to
contact us.



nadia harrison or scarlet granville at 713 869 4722 or email me:
nharrison@gracelaw.org or just show up on saturday (address: corner taylor
st and union st, houston 77007, just off washington near downtown)  we'll be

there for quite a few saturdays to come.



thanks for reading this,



nadia

message-id: 

a summer of hard work has finally paid off and it looks like we're 
all set on sites for the 2005 o-week outreach day!  thank you to 
everyone that has contributed to getting us ready ahead of schedule!

the advantage of this is that we have the on-line registration form 
"hot" a full week in advance of students arriving for o-week.  in 
addition, i will be able to hold one spot at each site for an 
advisor, returning student, or faculty/staff member that is 
interested in being a site leader.  the details are available and you 
can sign up on the web site (http://www.rice.edu/service) in the 
outreach day section or just e-mail me, but essentially we're looking 
for people who will be responsible for keeping things running 
smoothly at the sites on outreach day.

never been a site leader before?  don't worry - it's easy. basically, 
you get there a little early, gather your group, and distribute name 
tags; make sure you take everything with you that you need (lunches 
for the group, supplies, etc.) at the work site; get on the right bus 
and help the driver navigate; take the lead at the service site; have 
the group fill out and sign a thank you card; make sure everyone gets 
on the bus home; and, finally, facilitate a short reflection 
discussion.  everything you need is provided for you. see, very easy! 
it's a job that requires minimal effort, but is essential to the 
day's success.  with all of the sites to choose from, you're sure to 
find something that interests you!  please consider taking some time 
to help the cic.

i hope all of you have had a great summer and i look forward to 
seeing you in a few weeks!

mac

here's a chance to help bridge the digital divide and give back to the rice

staff the opportunity to learn how to use computers for basic tasks such as
word processing, email, and internet.  classes are held in mudd lab on
monday, thursday, and friday from 11-12:00, as well as monday and tuesday
from 6-7:00pm.  we are greatly in need of volunteers to help teach the
classes (it's only a one-hour weekly commitment for the semester).  fluency
in spanish or computers is not necessary.  if you are interested in helping,
please contact gina upperman, upperman@rice.edu.

subject: [allrsvp] hurricane relief efforts
message-id: 

in the fallout of hurricane katrina, there are potentially up to 
25,000 citizens of louisiana and the surrounding states that are in 
need of immediate housing. the greater houston chapter of the 
american red cross currently has 10 shelters operating in the area, 
many of which have already reached capacity. to fill the remaining 
need, thousands may be relocated to the reliant astrodome.

the harris county citizen corps (as well as the american red cross, 
volunteer houston, and other agencies) is reporting that their 
immediate needs have been met. the buses of refugees have not yet 
left the new orleans area, so their arrival is not expected until 
late tonight or into the early morning hours. many volunteers have 
already been mobilized in the greater houston area, but they are part 
of a larger disaster-relief infrastructure. it is anticipated that 
there will be a need for more volunteers in the coming weeks, but it 
may take several days for those roles to develop.

volunteers new to disaster relief are invited by the american red 
cross to participate in a training session on wednesday, september 7, 
10:00-11:00am, at their main campus (2700 southwest freeway). for 
more information or to register, call their information hotline at 
713-313-5480. please be patient, as this line has received a high 
volume of calls in the last 48 hours.

finally, volunteer houston has set up a form on its web site to 
register as a volunteer and assist with disaster relief operations. 
you will be contacted as needs arise.

more information, particularly on direct disaster relief, will be 
disseminated to the university community as it becomes available. 
please check the community involvement center web site 
(http://www.rice.edu/service) for up to date information.

message-id: <00b501c5ae9f$7de43cb0$549f2a80@jenwang>

hi all,
 
welcome back! we're going to kick off our gardening season this sunday,
sept 4, at 10:00 am. cookies will be provided! we'll meet everyone
(newcomers are very welcome!), pull up lots of weeds (let's face it,
that's what gardeners gotta do), pick limes (there are hundreds of ripe
ones on our lime tree), and maybe do some planting (spinach, broccoli,
herbs, and garlic are just a few of the good ones for fall) . we'll wrap
up no later than noon, and you can come and go anytime.
 
a brief intro to the garden: rice has an organic community garden
located on campus behind mudd lab, in front of the mob headquarters,
just inside what is now entrance 21
(http://www.rice.edu/maps/maps.html). in the past we've planted all
sorts of vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs, and this year we'll be
planting all sorts of whatever you want. it's not heavy work, just a fun
and laid-back way to wake up to an otherwise work-filled sunday. the
harvest is donated to a local women's shelter or similar establishment
where fresh produce is hard to come by. 
 
if you have any questions, drop me an e-mail at jyw@rice.edu. i realize
sunday mornings might not work for some of you because of church or
whatever reason, so let me know if you have another time in mind. we
like to avoid dawn and dusk because of mosquitos, and afternoons because
of heat.
 
i look forward to meeting you! have a great weekend!
 
jen
your new garden coordinator

i need 1-2 people for each of the following shifts to supervise volunteers
headed to houston food bank:

 

friday:  12:30pm-5:30pm

saturday:  7:30am-1:00pm

saturday:  12:00-5:30pm

sunday:  12:30-5:30pm

monday:  7:30am-1:00pm

monday:  12:00-5:30pm

 

*** work time on-site is 1/2 hour later and earlier than times listed. ***

 

transportation will be provided by the university.  they will be responsible
for checking in volunteers at the rmc circle drive before they get on the
rice shuttle.  they will be working on their own (i.e. no staff to guide the
activity), so they need to be comfortable taking control of the situation
and getting everyone settled in at the houston food bank.

 

we're getting a number of calls now and are trying to find the most
appropriate placements for students.  see the cic web site

(http://www.rice.edu/service) for up to date information.

this is from my friend megan with csm:  "i recieved a call this morning from
my good friend ruth at the new kidcare here in houston. she was calling
(even though she knew it was our off season) to see if i possibly had
connections to any volunteers. if you don't know of them, they usually make
about 900 sack lunches a day to pass out to hungry kids in houston, but with
the disaster in new orleans they're wanting to make many, many more. all the
lunches will be going to the churches and various shelters where folks are
staying here in the city (in addition to still feeding the hungry kids). she
said that weekdays or saturdays would work for a volunteer group. so let me
know, or get a group together and let ruth know." 


my note--it's probably best to contact kidcare directly:

message-id: 

updated information available at http://www.rice.edu/service.

**********

the outpouring of emotion we have seen in the last 72 hours has been 
a true testament to the character of the rice university community. 
the community involvement center has received calls and e-mails from 
alumni, undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, staff, 
associates, and every other constituency with offers of assistance. 
whether directly impacted by this disaster or struggling to deal with 
the grief they feel for others, there is a sense of common purpose 
among us.

the harris county citizen corps continues to handle the relief 
efforts at the reliant astrodome and has not made any requests for 
assistance.  other supporting agencies, however, are now prepared to 
start volunteer-driven efforts.  the houston food bank will be open 
extended hours this holiday weekend and needs volunteers to help sort 
the large shipments of donations being received from around the 
county, state, and country.  the american red cross currently has 13 
shelters in the greater houston area and is always looking for 
volunteers training in disaster relief.

in addition to these (and other direct service opportunities), there 
are also a number of drives to collect goods for the refugees.  calls 
are out for food, clothing, cleaning supplies, child care items, and 
many other necessities.  if you have these on hand and wish to make a 
donation, collection points are available on campus, as well as 
throughout houston.  please remember, however, that a $1 donation to 
the houston food bank can distribute $20 worth of food through their 
network.  whether you choose the houston food bank, your religious 
community, american red cross, salvation army, or any number of other 
agencies, your monetary donation can be stretched beyond your 
purchase of goods.

the community involvement center web site 
(http://www.rice.edu/service) is being continually updated and 
contains all the information you need to make a difference in this 
time of need.  all of the opportunities listed above are outlined in 
detail at this site.  resources are also available for:

* monetary donations - online donation sites for several agencies.
* donation of goods - information on collection sites for on-going drives.
* direct service - learn how you can be involved in hands-on service 
with relief efforts.
* training opportunities - find the training you need to help with 
direct refugee assistance.
* general information

updates will continue to be sent to the campus community as other 
opportunities develop.  if you wish to notify us of efforts in which 
you are involved, please contact the community involvement center at 
713-348-4970.

efforts.  please note the most recent requests to help with the

**********

harris county citizen corps - those wanting to volunteer in direct 
service to help the katrina disaster victims who have arrived in 
houston should go to the mcnee street parking lot just north of 
reliant stadium, between kirby and fannin.  a map of reliant park is 
available at http://www.reliantpark.com/parking/map1.html.

if you intend to travel by metrorail, exit at the reliant park 
station.  students, please be sure to bring your metrorail pass as 
well as your rice university id.  be aware of metrorail's hours of 
operation (http://www.ridemetro.org/pdf/routes/700-redline.pdf) and 
your own personal safety.  individuals, as always, are discouraged 
from traveling alone during the evening hours.

enter reliant center on the west side of building.  volunteers should 
go to the 2nd floor of reliant center and identify themselves as 
being with harris county citizen corps.  about 300-500 volunteers 
will be needed on the scene at all times around the clock.

**********

houston food bank volunteers are still needed throughout the weekend 
for several 4-hour shifts.  interested individuals are encouraged to 
sign up at http://www.rice.edu/service/hfbreg.htm.  this will help us 
prepare houston food bank staff for the volunteers.

houston as a temporary shelter and medical clinic for the 
katrina-disaster victims as of september 2. about 5,300 evacuees are 
expected to be phased into the facility. as with the astrodome 
shelter, around-the-clock volunteer coverage will be needed.

if you intend to travel by metrorail, go north and exit at the main 
street square station. walk south to polk and then east 7 blocks to 
the convention center. students, please be sure to bring your 
metrorail pass as well as your rice university id. enter at the polk 
street entrance (south end) and report to hall e on the south side of 
the convention center. a map of downtown is available at 
http://www.houstonconventionctr.com/map_&_directions/downtown_map.pdf.

individual volunteer shifts will last four hours. volunteers should 
appear on site 30 minutes before start-of-shifts. be aware of 
metrorail's hours of operation 
(http://www.ridemetro.org/pdf/routes/700-redline.pdf) and your own 
personal safety. individuals, as always, are discouraged from 
traveling alone during the evening hours.

volunteers must be 18 years of age or older. wear cool, comfortable 
clothing you don't mind getting dirty and closed-toe shoes, and bring 
a water bottle. volunteers do not need to register in advance, but 
may be turned away if there are enough volunteers for the shift.

rice university athletic department
http://riceowls.collegesports.com/

items collected: athletic clothing and sneakers for men, women, and children

drop off location:  office of sr. associate athletic director, steve 
moniaci - autry gym, room 113

the rice university athletic department will stage a clothing drive 
to benefit those who were victimized by katrina. our goal will be to 
collect gently worn athletic shoes and athletic wear, to include any 
t-shirts, sweats, collared shirts, shorts, etc. the drive will be 
primarily directed to the student athletes and athletic department 
staff here at rice, but is most definitely open for donations by 
anyone inside or outside of the rice community. the drive will begin 
immediately and will run through september 12, 2005. all donations 
collected will be turned over to the salvation army for distribution.

**********

as noted earlier, in addition to these (and other direct service 
opportunities), there are also a number of drives to collect goods 
for the refugees.  calls are out for food, clothing, cleaning 
supplies, child care items, and many other necessities.  if you have 
these on hand and wish to make a donation, collection points are 
available on campus, as well as throughout houston.  please remember, 
however, that a $1 donation to the houston food bank can distribute 
$20 worth of food through their network.  whether you choose the 
houston food bank, your religious community, american red cross, 
salvation army, or any number of other agencies, your monetary 
donation can be stretched beyond your purchase of goods.

the community involvement center web site 
(http://www.rice.edu/service) is being continually updated and 
contains all the information you need to make a difference in this 
time of need.  all of the opportunities listed above are outlined in 
detail at this site.  resources are also available for:

* monetary donations - online donation sites for several agencies.
* donation of goods - information on collection sites for on-going drives.
* direct service - learn how you can be involved in hands-on service 
with relief efforts.
* training opportunities - find the training you need to help with 
direct refugee assistance.
* general information

updates will continue to be sent to the campus community as other 
opportunities develop.  if you wish to notify us of efforts in which 
you are involved, please contact the community involvement center at 
713-348-4970.

sorry i didn't include this in the last email. 
 
*** a few notes for those of you with those styrofoam cups full of soil
and seeds ***
1. water your seeds every couple days to keep the soil moist. remember
to poke holes in the bottom of the cups and put a place underneath to
catch the water.
2. with any luck, the seeds should germinate in 2-4 weeks, so you will
see it above the soil. move it to the windowsill so it can get the max
amount of sunlight. bring it by the community garden on the next sunday
at 10am, or if you can't make it, bring it to the next rsvp meeting. the
garden is located behind mudd lab, just inside entrance 21. 
3. if you have any questions or problems, email jen: jyw@rice.edu
thanks for your help!
 
also, email jyw@rice.edu if you're interested in helping out the
community garden at rice!

subject: [allrsvp] hurricane relief efforts - update
message-id: 

updated information available at the community involvement center's web site:
http://www.rice.edu/service.

**********

volunteer training session - the counseling center, in collaboration 
with the community involvement center, will be offering a one-hour 
training session on monday, september 12, 12:00-1:00pm, in the rmc 
grand hall. this training session does not replace the training 
provided by the american red cross for their shelter operations, but 
will prepare rice university community members for some of the issues 
they will face while working with hurricane katrina evacuees. 
information covered will help prepare those who plan on volunteering 
through direct service activities at reliant park and the george r. 
brown convention center. all students, faculty, staff, and alumni 
expecting to participate in the relief efforts are strongly 
encouraged to participate in this session. lunch will be provided for 
all participants. please rsvp to jen allee (allee@rice.edu) by 
10:00am on monday, september 12.

rice volunteer time (rvt) for staff and faculty - in recognition of 
the great challenges we face as a community in houston, rice will 
provide up to 8 hours per month of release time from 
regularly-scheduled work, during the months of september, october and 
november, for a total of up to 24 hours per employee of "on the 
clock" time for local volunteer work.  this time is being staggered 
in order to accommodate time off within the work schedule, and also 
to encourage volunteerism over the extended period of need.  more 
detailed information on the policy and a required form are available 
on the cic's web site.

**********

the needs are constantly changing as we continue to assess the way 
the rice community is able to lend support during these relief 
efforts.  the information below only represents the most recent 
requests and a small proportion of the total need.

**********

food and clothing donations - while there is an on-going need for 
food donations to the houston food bank, many agencies previously 
accepting donations of clothes have asked for the deliveries to wait 
thirty days.  "we took as many donations as we could," said star of 
hope ceo randy tabor, "and we accepted clothing, toys and books when 
it seemed everyone else turned donors away. but now we're totally 
full - the kindness of houston and out-of-towners has helped us fill 
five warehouses, that's 98,000 square feet of assistance to our 
evacuees." he said.  please check agency web sites before dropping 
off additional donations of clothing and review the "donation of 
goods" section of the cic's web site.

child care - the houston area association for the education of young 
children (haaeyc) has accepted responsibility for organizing child 
care at the reliant park complex.  volunteer information (including 
job descriptions, schedules, and sanitation tips) are now available 
at their web site and linked through the cic's web site under "direct 
service" opportunities.

food service - in coordination with local and state governments, 
interfaith ministries for greater houston has been given primary 
responsibility to feed the evacuees from louisiana at the george r. 
brown convention center.  second baptist church is serving as the 
central administrating arm of this collaborative relief effort. 
participation in operation compassion is open to everyone.  training 
is mandatory, as required by law for food handling, in order to 
volunteer for operation compassion and you must be 18 years old or 
older (unless accompanied by an adult or guardian) to serve. more 
information on the required training session and registration is 
available at the cic's web site under "direct service" opportunities.

reliant park - changes have been implemented in the volunteer 
staffing needs at reliant park.  volunteers are now needed for shifts 
of at least four hours, 5:30am-11:00pm.  please visit the "direct 
service" section of the cic's web site for more information.

**********

the community involvement center web site is being continually 
updated and contains all the information you need to make a 
difference in this time of need.  all of the opportunities listed 
above are outlined in detail at this site.  resources are also

interested in a leadership conference?
	free november 4th and 5th? 
rsvp will completely subsidize this leadership conference. please read
below for more details, and contact ed, cara, or mac if you have any
questions.

details: 
university of houston - clear lake will host its ninth annual student
leadership conference at our campus.  this conference provides over 400
student leaders from around the country additional leadership skills and
a chance to network with their peers.  our theme this year is
"leadership boot camp:  back to basics".

this year, we have recruited award-winning campus speaker jonathan
sprinkles to deliver his inspiring keynote address "diversime
university", and he
will also present two educational sessions ("say what you mean and get
what you
want" and "reenergize your organization".)  

our student participants come from a variety of backgrounds and levels
of
leadership experience. students attend from community colleges, private
and
public colleges and universities; are undergraduate and graduate
students;
and range in age from 18 to 63!  many of the students who attend our
conference hold leadership positions in student government, student
organizations, and program boards; however, we also encourage students
who
are just embarking on their leadership journeys and trying to discover
their niche.

**********

the needs are constantly changing as we continue to assess the way 
the rice community is able to lend support during these relief 
efforts.  the information below only represents the most recent 
requests and a small proportion of the total need.

please note that some volunteers are needed for the katrinatexas.org 
project as early as this coming monday (september 19).

**********

katrinatexas.org - houston katrina assistance and resource 
e-formation systems (k.a.r.e.s.) is a collaborative initiative of 
non-profit organizations and volunteers committed to providing a 
comprehensive, up-to-the-minute one-stop clearinghouse for all 
information relating to evacuee-support efforts throughout the 
greater houston area. it maintains a web site devoted to 
katrina-related needs at http://katrinatexas.org.

volunteers are needed to staff a telephone information center at 
george r. brown convention center to be utilized by evacuee-callers 
who lack either web access or the know-how to use such access to 
identify and secure needed resources. the information center will be 
in operation 8:00am-8:00pm, seven days a week until the needs of the 
evacuee community are met. individual volunteers will be asked to 
take on shifts of 4 hours. volunteers should have good interpersonal 
skills and be comfortable using a computer to identify resources for 
evacuees. the community involvement center will be organizing 
volunteers for 8 shifts in the coming weeks. to sign up as part of 
the rice university effort, please visit 
http://www.rice.edu/service/katrina/ktorgreg.htm.

if these shifts are not convenient for your schedule, please contact 
donna willis by phone (281-575-9993 or 281-682-1115) or e-mail 
(soulset22@aol.com) to sign up for shifts at other times.

reliant park - on september 12, judge robert eckels announced plans 
to have all the remaining katrina evacuees transferred to alternative 
housing and have the reliant park complex phased out as a temporary 
shelter by early next week. during the phase-out period, many 
volunteers will be needed to help with "breakdown and cleanup" of the 
site. they will assist with packing and removal of cots, signage, and 
other elements of the temporary shelter arrangement that has been in 
place since the katrina evacuees arrived at the complex. information 
from the command center at the reliant complex reflects that there is 
an urgent need for 1200-1500 volunteers per day (up until 11:00pm) 
through saturday. please call 713-209-2000 for more information.

clothing distribution (4100 main street) - south main baptist church 
(4100 main street) needs volunteers to work in our clothing center 
monday through friday, 10:00am-1:00pm.  volunteers should be prepared 
to help clients (hurricane survivors) select clothing in appropriate 
sizes for their family. each client is assisted one-on-one with a 
volunteer.  for more information or to schedule a time to volunteer, 
please contact sally reed by e-mail (sksreed@aol.com).  individuals 
are discouraged from just showing up, because we never know what days 
we will have lots of clients.

neighbors2neighbors.org - now that immediate food, shelter, and 
clothing needs have been handled, the next step is helping evacuees 
achieve some semblance of normalcy and independence.  in the next few 
days, large shelters such as the astrodome are expected to stop 
shelter services. some of the hurricane katrina evacuees have already 
returned to their former states of residence or moved to other 
states.  still, many evacuees have decided to make houston their home 
permanently or in the short-term--making them our newest neighbors. 
your commitment is needed to help ease the transition for individuals 
and families wishing to stay in houston.

as a volunteer in the neighbors2neighbors.org program, you will be 
matched with a family that is moving from emergency accommodations to 
dignified and independent housing for at least a 6-month period. 
specifically, as a volunteer neighbor you are asked to:

* help transport the family to their new home, if necessary
* help the family set up utilities (phone, electricity, etc)
* help the family obtain or move furniture and household items
* help the family locate the nearest grocery and other stores
* help the family become oriented to their new neighborhood
* help the family locate schools for their children
* help the family access resources to locate family members, if necessary
* provide information and referrals to local agencies and offices, as needed
* visit the family at least three times in the first 30 days

for more information on how to get involved, visit the 
neighbors2neighbors web site (http://www.neighbors2neighbors.org) and 
register as a volunteer.

household goods needed - a large number of families displaced by the 
hurricane have successfully located more permanent housing. this, 
undoubtedly, offers a ray of hope, but it is just a beginning. now 
the task of furnishing their homes begins. consider those items we 
use on a daily basis with no regard (beds, pillows, tissues, tables, 
cutlery, towels, telephones, wastebaskets, etc.). those displaced by 
the hurricane have the same needs.

as our contribution to the relief effort, the shady acres church of 
christ (730 west 26th street) is sponsoring a drive for household 
items to assist these families. we're collecting furnitures, 
kitchenware, linens, and other household items to help these families 
as they work toward rebuilding their lives.  items may be dropped off 
thursday, september 15 through saturday, september 17, 9:00am-7:00pm.

subject: [allrsvp] alternative spring break information
message-id: 

what is an alternative spring break (asb)?
an alternative break program places teams of college students in 
communities to engage in community service and experiential learning 
during their summer, fall, winter or spring breaks. students perform 
short-term projects for community agencies and learn about issues 
such as literacy, poverty, racism, hunger, homelessness, and the 
environment. the objectives of an alternative break program are to 
involve college students in community-based service projects and to 
give students opportunities to learn about the problems faced by 
members of communities with whom they otherwise may have had little 
or no direct contact.

alternative spring break to dominican republic
are you interested in an international trip for spring break?  don't 
want to spend your vacation doing the usual trip to cancun, but still 
want to hang out with fun college kids?  then apply for the 
alternative spring break trip to the domican republic, sponsored by 
the community involvement center.  working and living directly on the 
orphanage grounds in the rural towns of monte cristi and esperanza, 
our team will be serving the orphanage as well as the local 
community.  we will be working in a number of areas, including 
tutoring at the orphanage, teaching in the local school, and manual 
labor projects at the orphanage.  for more information on alternative 
spring break trips or to apply, please visit 
http://www.rice.edu/service.  the deadline to apply for this trip is 
friday, september 23 at 5:00pm.  if you have any questions, please 
contact alex triantaphyllis (ast@rice.edu).  information on other 
alternative spring break trips advised by the community involvement 
center will be available monday, october 24.

alternative spring break coordinator applications
interested in being a coordinator for one of the alternative spring 
break (asb) trips advised by the community involvement center?  as a 
coordinator, working in conjunction with the sponsoring student 
organization and the community invovlement center, you will help 
decide the agency and domestic location at which your group will 
serve.  we expect that there will be at least five asbs running this 
spring and are looking for energetic, excited, and dedicated students 
to help in their planning and implementation.  asbs offer a great way 
to spend your spring break doing something that allows you to travel, 
make new friends, help those in need, and have fun all at the same 
time.
through our asb program, rice students and faculty become more 
active, community-minded citizens.  coordinator applications for the 
dominican republic trip are due september 23, while the deadline for 
all other trips is september 30.  for more information or to apply, 
please visit http://www.rice.edu/service.  if you have any questions, 
please contact alex triantaphyllis (ast@rice.edu).

hi everybody,

hermann park needs your help! the storms this past weekend did a lot of
damage to the park and left it covered with leaves, limbs, and litter. the
city of houston has been working double shifts to try to fix these
conditions, but it's a big task so they have personally approached us and
asked for our help. if you have even as few as one or two hours free this
week, please let us know (at   mehveen@rice.edu) so
that we can coordinate a group to go out there.

 

also, just a reminder, animal farm permaculture sign-ups are going on until
wednesday. we have extended the deadline for sign-ups to wednesday, 10:00
pm. here's the information we had sent out earlier about it:

 

this coming weekend, october 1-2nd, we will be doing animal farm
permaculture, in which we learn about environmental sustainability and then

hi everyone,

we're looking for project coordinators for the environmental committee. this
is a great leadership opportunity, and you would only have to devote a few
hours in a month or every other month to it. we need multiple project
coordinators for the near future, one for our visits to hermann park (an
ongoing project throughout the year), one for the arboretum (another ongoing
project throughout the year), and a third for the armand bayou nature center
(a one or two-time event). if you're interested in learning more details
about these leadership positions, please feel free to email us. 

 

to those of you going to animal farm permaculture, we'll see you this
weekend!

thanks!

get a little dose of the outdoors by coming out to the garden tomorrow,
oct. 9, from 10-11:30am. you can stay for as long or short as you want
and help us clear out the last bed and plant some yummy fall things. now
that it's cooled down a bit, it should be very pleasant out there. as
usual, there will be cookies (possibly homemade). hope to see you
tomorrow!

hi folks!
great immediate response thus far on the volunteering!!-clearly, the way to 
get attendence at children's committee meetings would be to sponsor a 
pumpkin. i called the coordinator and got an extension on getting a group 
together, so at least a couple of rice groups will be going. if you guys can 
email me and let me know what you guys are interested in, that would be 
awesome. please do this by this sunday! 

they really need people for the upcoming thursdays but that's from 9-3. most 
people have classes but if there's interest, i'll commit to one thurs from 11-
3.

for the event:
i need to know which dates work the best. we'll get a group together for both 
weekends so give me a day preference. the shifts are only 2.5 hrs long and 
are done wayyy before parties. let me know your top 3 and we'll commit to 3 
so that most everyone can participate one way or the other. below are the 
shifts repeated from the last email.

 >event assistance
we anticipate that each of these will be very popular, high 
attendance days.  various volunteer assistance is needed in our 
happy haunt, educational craft and activity trick-or-treat stations, 
inflatable playground, several vendor booths, costume contest, and 
pumpkin lighting.
shift times:
3:30 to 6:30pm - friday, october 21st

message-id: 

rsvp,

don't forget about this monday night's meeting!  the meeting will 
take place at the same time and location as usual, 9:00pm in the rmc 
miner lounge.  come by for free ben and jerry's ice cream as a reward 
for all your hard work this semester!  with project pumpkin and 
outreach day just around the corner, you'll need the energy!

then stick around for a discussion about a new initiative that is 
taking shape on campus.  don't miss this opportunity to learn about 
the university's quality enchancement plan (qep), which will provide 
you more structured opportunities to get involved in community-based 
research.  these new opportunities will be led by rice university 
faculty working with our community partners, many of whom you already 
service through rsvp!

*****

the qep is part of the university's reaccreditation process with the 
southern association of colleges and schools (sacs), which take place 
every 10 years.  it is intended to give the university a means of 
implementing a wide-ranging "course of action for institutional 
improvement by addressing one or more issues that contribute to 
institutional quality, with special attention to student learning." 
in other words, come up with a plan that will enhance learning.

rice university has a long history of committed service to the 
community.  the qep presents us with a unique opportunity to 
institutionalize this commitment, while also improving the quality of 
education that students receive.  the focus of rice's qep will be on 
community-based research at the undergraduate level.  through both 
curricular projects (those directly linked to course work) and 
co-curricular projects (academic work independent of a course) 
students will be able to work on activities that help solve community 
needs.  these community-based placements will be integrated into the 
learning culture at rice and help better prepare students for the 
rigors of academic research.  in addition, there will be a greater 
focus to introduce houston as a learning environment, through civic 
experiences such as volunteering, for first and second-year students.

*****

i hope to see you on monday and please e-mail me or stop by the cic 
if you want to learn more about the qep!

message-id: <1130284815.435ec70fd91f0@webmail.mail.rice.edu>

hey guys!

i'm rupal, the coordinator of the trick-or-treat for unicef project for the rsvp
children's committee.  unicef, the united nations children's fund, works to
ensure that children around the world receive the essentials for the best start
in life, including education, nutrition, good health, and clean water.

trick-or-treat for unicef is a fundraising project for unicef, and i need your
help with it.  all you have to do is carry around a small carboard box
(provided) and ask people to donate however much money they'd like, whether
it's the change in their pocket, or a couple of dollars, to your box.  this is
a really easy project to take part in, but one that nonetheless makes a
difference in many children's lives.

if you'd like to participate in this project, simply pick up a trick-or-treat
for unicef box from the community involvement center's (cic) office any time
this week and sign it out.  you can also pick one up from me if you see me
around campus.  then start collecting!  we'll only be collecting for the rest
of this month, so you can bring your filled boxes back to me at the next rsvp
meeting next monday.  thanks!!

remember to turn your clocks back an hour on sat night :d

hi everyone!
 
i hope your weekends went well. for those of you thinking about applying
to go on an alternative spring break trip, there will be an
informational session on tuesday, nov. 1 at 9:00 pm at sammy's. there
will be a representative from each trip, so you can hear about all the
options (both domestic and international) and ask the trip coordinators
questions. also, in case you can't come to the meeting, applications
will be online from oct. 31 - nov. 10 at
http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~service/asb/asb.htm
 
these trips are really amazing - people come back getting a whole lot
out of the experience, and it's a really good use of your time during
spring break! feel free to email me any questions and i can get your
questions to the right people.

stop by tonight's information session to learn about the 2006 alternative spring
breaks!  it will be held tuesday, november 1 at 9:00pm in sammy's.  alternative
spring break programs places teams of college students in communities to engage
in community service and experiential learning during spring break.  students
perform short-term projects for community agencies and learn about issues such
as literacy, poverty, racism, hunger, homelessness, and the environment.  the
objectives of an alternative break program are to involve college students in
community-based service projects and to give students opportunities to learn
about the problems faced by members of communities with whom they otherwise may
have had little or no direct contact.  outside of the service projects, trip
coordinators also arrange fun activities to get to know the community.

there are five projects to choose from and you will have a chance to hear
directly from the student coordinators of each trip.

* rice pre-medical society (rpms)
  medical outreach project in tula, mexico
* community involvement center
  border u.s./mexico issues in reynosa, mexico
* advance
  building service trip with habitat for humanity in birmingham, al
* community involvement center
  environmental and historical work in yellowstone national park
* community involvement center
  service trip to a native american reservation in pine ridge, sd

applications are now available on the community involvement center's web site
(http://www.rice.edu/service) and are due no later than 5:00pm on thursday,
november 10!  for more information on the trips and how to apply, please
contact alex triantaphyllis (ast@rice.edu), student asb coordinator, or jen

we're looking for project coordinators for the environmental committee. this
is a great leadership opportunity, and you would only have to devote a few
hours in a month or every other month to it. we need multiple project
coordinators for the near future, one for our visits to hermann park (an
ongoing project throughout the year), one for the arboretum (another ongoing
project throughout the year), and a third for the armand bayou nature center
(a one or two-time event). if you're interested in learning more details
about these leadership positions, please feel free to email us. 

 

to those of you going to animal farm permaculture, we'll see you this

outreach day is coming up on november 12 and rsvp is looking for site
leaders! 
 
being a site leader is a great way to volunteer and have a leadership role
at the same time. in short, you will have to keep your group organized and
be in charge of communicating with the volunteer agency to figure out what
the group needs to do. other specific responsibilities include: showing up
to the meeting area 15 minutes earlier, signing your group in, organizing
how to get the group to the site, writing a thank-you card to the agency,
passing out evaluation forms to the participants, and making sure people
arrive back to campus. 
 
when: saturday, november 12. morning shifts last from 9-11:30 and afternoon
shifts are from 1-3:30
 
where: one of 25 awesome locations to volunteer including bering omega, star
of hope, houston food bank, i have a dream, planned parenthood, and big
brothers/big sisters
 
why: because you're a nice person! 
 
how: sign up on http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~rsvp/forms/odaysignup.html and make
sure to check yes on "are you interested in being a site leader?"
 
still not convinced? leadership roles in service work are perfect for
resumes and you can expect an awesome free lunch with food from chipotle,
domino's, house of pies, buffalo wild wings, cookie bouquet, and einstein
bagels! 
 
if you have any questions, feel free to email me at kleu@rice.edu
please sign up!!
 
have a great week!

message-id: 

today is your last chance to apply to a 2006 alternative spring break 
(asb)!  alternative spring break programs places teams of college 
students in communities to engage in community service and

environment.  the objectives of an alternative break program are to 
involve college students in community-based service projects and to 
give students opportunities to learn about the problems faced by 
members of communities with whom they otherwise may have had little 
or no direct contact.  outside of the service projects, trip 
coordinators also arrange fun activities to get to know the community.

this year there are five projects to choose from:

* rice pre-medical society (rpms)
   medical outreach project in tula, mexico
* community involvement center
   border u.s./mexico issues in reynosa, mexico
* rsvp
   building service trip with habitat for humanity in birmingham, al
* community involvement center
   environmental and historical work in yellowstone national park
* community involvement center
   service trip to a native american reservation in pine ridge, sd

and be sure to bring your sleeping bag if you plan to be courageous and 
spend the night outside with us!

on thursday, rice is having its first ever dining hall fast!  sign up online 
at www.rice.edu/rsvp.  skip a thursday meal of your choice (breakfast 
counts!), and all donations benefit americas second harvest.  tell your 
roommates, friends, *everyone* to sign up!!

on friday there will be an opportunity after dinner to bring the remaining 
servery food from north servery over to hermann park to share with the folks 
residing there.  ill give more details about this later in the week.

hey rsvp!

to finish out hunger and homelessness awareness week this week, rsvp will be
joining up with ivcf on friday evening as they head over to hermann park to
share dinner with the folks residing there.

there is prayer starting at 6:20 in front of hanszen if you'd like to join,
if not then **meet at either hanszen or brown commons at 7pm** and we'll
collect the extra dinner from the serveries and walk or drive on over to the
park together to serve dinner and talk to the people. it typically takes
about an hour and a half total, and you are welcome to participate in ivcf's
bible study afterwards at the park, and if you'd rather not there'll be a
group heading back to campus.

if you are interested in coming tomorrow night then send me back an email
with your name, phone number, and the servery you'll be meeting at (hanszen
or brown) so that we'll know to wait for you!

thanks, and p.s. awesome job to all those who have been participating in and
helping out with with all the recent rsvp events and efforts!! you guys do
good work :o)

hi there,

i noticed your name and email on the rsvp website.  i am actually a rice
graduate and recently began working as the resident services coordinator at
chelsea court apartments.  here at chelsea court we offer affordable housing
for houston residents and also house over 160 hurricane katrina evacuees.
my main job is to get them the support and resources that they need,
including federal aid, vouchers, furniture, employment, etc.  we are having
a holiday party at our apartment complex on december 8th and 9th from 3pm -
6pm and i wanted to see if anyone from rsvp would be willing to come out and
set up some sort of activity for the children (like project pumpkin - arts &
crafts activities) or even just pass out educational information to the
residents.  really, if there is anything you can do to help, we would
appreciate your support.  please feel free to contact me if you would like
to get involved!

message-id: 

hey all!

i know, it's cold! but we need to harvest at the community garden! i'll
be going out to the garden tomorrow, friday, at 1 pm to harvest our
radishes, beans, lettuce, carrots, and chinese cabbage, and to bring them
over to bering omega, the aids hospice located near campus. this should
take about an hour.

if you want to help out, just stop by the garden at 1. i would love to see
you! if i don't though, good luck with the rest of your exams/papers, have
a wonderful, relaxing break, and get ready for an exciting semester of
gardening starting in january!
