the love songs featuring “weird al”!
may 16, 2022
hello lovers!
so, like, it’s been a while. i hope you’re doing well etc etc etc…
the pandemic really put a crimp in our lifestyle of playing shows, making records, hoping our cars weren’t getting broken into during band practice, and posting videos that a number of our 2.4m facebook followers inexplicably deem inappropriate. in fact, we had just put out a record – “the loneliest whale” – before lockdown and, besides a short road trip with the subhumans, we never really got to tour-promote that record.
dominic – he who runs blonde medicine, the label who released “the loneliest whale” – came up with a comically ambitious alternative promotional tactic…
dominic: “think the beatles “help” meets an episode of “scooby doo”
us: “dude, that’s ridiculous. ok, we’re in.”
so we’ve spent the last year working with longtime the love songs’ love interest, mike foxall, toying, tinkering, and toiling over this, our first animated film. it features some really special people, like kirk hammett (metallica), dexter holland (offspring), and nardwuar (vancouver, british columbia, canada) among others. it is currently in a relationship with the film festival circuit so we don’t have a release date, but we would like to share this trailer.
love,
songs
p.s. oh, right, did i forget to mention – this also features “weird al” yankovic!!!!!!!!
