what clients say





i’m really blown away!

five month update: wow. i have exactly the measurements i asked dr. mendieta for… i’m really blown away. my figure is gorgeous and looks completely natural… i’m a petite woman and so i didn’t want a big booty, just some lipo to slim down and a little bit added to my (formerly flat) butt to give it a nice curvy shape… dr. mendieta gave me exactly that.
