the dream of vtp was to foster the creation of tools for easily constructing 
		any part of the real world in interactive, 3d digital form.
this goal would require a synergetic convergence of the fields of cad, 
		gis, visual simulation, surveying and remote sensing.  vtp gathered 
		information and tracked progress in areas such as procedural scene construction, 
		feature extraction, and realtime rendering algorithms.  vtp wrote and supported 
		a set of software tools, including an interactive runtime environment (vtp 
		enviro).  the tools and their source code are
		freely shared to help accelerate 
		the adoption and development of the necessary technologies.
during its active years, the project helped hundreds of companies and 
		thousands of students to implement realtime 3d terrain in their 
		products, research and education.
you can still download the full vtp 
		3d software, or if you only need geoprocessing,
		download the vtbuilder tool.  
		most of the subject pages below are outdated, but may still be useful 
		collections of educational info.
