welcome to sound cyclists


sound cyclists bicycle club is a member-run bicycle club in fairfield county, connecticut that has been organized since 1977. annually we provide more than 1,300 organized rides and other cycling-related activities for our members and the community, which stress safety, fun and fitness for all levels of riders.

this website is divided up into two areas. the opening is designed to serve the public so they can get to know all about the club and what it has to offer. the members info section contains more specific information for club members and where a login is required to access the full ride schedule.




we host social activities and the bloomin' metric®, which is one of the northeast's premier cycling events, offering rides from 15 to 60 miles. the club also provides the opportunity for cyclists to improve their riding skills. as an advocate of safe cycling in fairfield county and the state of connecticut, sound cyclists actively supports cycling and related charitable activities in the area.




the club is open to everyone and you can join us for a $35 annual family membership. we offer a variety of group rides, both on and off road, from beginner to expert levels, so you will find the right pace ride for you. if you are new to cycling, check out our information for new and less experienced cyclists.  our rides span scenic fairfield county, the adjoining areas, and we also offer multi-day out-of-state rides.

our routes are available to members through ridewithgps, a .gpx formatted file and also make available custom detailed cue sheets. we schedule social activities throughout the year, both post-ride gatherings and social events. our events calendar appears in the members info section. as a member you can take advantage of our bike shop program with more than 30 shops offering free safety check-ups and discounted prices.
