junipero







main content start



 



junipero, affectionately known as jro, is located on the east side of campus, in the community of dormitories known together as wilbur hall. many in-dorm activities and “off-the-farm” events are planned throughout the year for both intellectual and recreational purposes.
 








 







how did junipero get its name?
junipero is the spanish word for the juniper tree. wilbur hall, where junipero is located, is named for ray lyman wilbur, a stanford alumnus, who served as dean of the stanford school of medicine, stanford university president (1916-1943), and u.s. secretary of the interior. junipero is one of several dormitory names referencing natural features, in honor of dr. wilbur’s love of nature.
