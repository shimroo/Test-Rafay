our heritage 
legendary western entertainers roy rogers and dale evans, stars of radio, film, 
records, television and personal appearances, were heroes to millions of fans from 
the saturday matinee era throughout the television era. the names of roy rogers 
and dale evans personify the values, tradition and spirit that are at the heart of our 
rich american heritage. their names are synonymous with integrity, honesty, quality 
and family values. they were superstars who consistently delivered a wholesome 
brand of entertainment suitable for the entire family. 
royâs films and tv shows were based on a formula that included action, romance, 
music and comedy. they had something for everyone.  his pictures contained some 
of the most innovative action sequences ever recorded on film. none of the major 
studios at that time could even come close to capturing on film the exciting action 
that was a part of every rogers film. the musical production numbers in some of his 
films rivaled those of mgm.  royâs screenplays were well written and always had a 
moral lesson for the legions of boys and girls who saw his films.  off screen, roy 
lived by the same high standards and moral code he portrayed on screen.  he had a 
more positive influence on the lives of boys and girls growing up in america in the 
40âs and 50âs than any other single individual.  roy and dale loved children and 
spent a lifetime devoted to children and childrenâs charities, including the happy 
trails childrenâs foundation for abused and neglected children. 
our history 
the victor valley child abuse task force was formed in 1982 with the mission of stemming a rising tide of child abuse, 
neglect, abandonment and death in the high desert of san bernardino county in southern california.  in 1992, the name 
was changed to the happy trails childrenâs foundation, to reflect the participation and support of roy rogers and dale 
evans, king of the cowboys and queen of the west.
the happy trails childrenâs foundation built the cooper home in apple valley, ca, the long-time home of roy and dale, 
to provide a safe haven for children-at-risk who have been severely abused and/or neglected. a generous bequest from 
the estate of george harold cooper provided the financial base for the home and a house donated by dr. and mrs. philip 
marsden was moved to a 40 acre apple valley site donated by tom and lynn hrubik.  the house was remodeled to 
become the foundation office and two cottages, a cafeteria building and two support services buildings were constructed 
to house and provide services to the children
today, the cooper home serves as a long-term residential care and treatment center for severely abused boys. the day 
to day operations of the cooper home are provided by trinity youth services, a national non-profit child care organization 
with more than 40 years experience operating childrenâs programs in 14 group homes and foster family agencies. happy 
trails childrenâs foundation in partnership with trinity youth services continually operates the cooper home at maximum 
capacity with 44 boys between the ages of 10 and 16, plus we have a lengthy waiting list!  these are boys who have been 
so severely abused, child protective services has removed them from their homes and the courts send them to us for a 
very intensive treatment program of group and individual therapy.  since the cooper home opened in 1997, more than 
850 children have received shelter, care and treatment services. 
situated on 40 acres of land in the high desert, the cooper home is surrounded by panoramic vistas of snow-capped 
mountains and natural desert terrain under healthy, smog-free skies.  our pleasant cottages and well-manicured outdoor 
play areas provide a peaceful, serene environment in which children can begin the healing process. 
child abuse
the problem of child abuse is a very serious problem that is growing in epidemic proportions.  throughout the past few 
months, newspapers and news broadcasts have been filled with tragic stories of child abuse, molestation, kidnappings, 
beatings, and death. the number of severe cases of child abuse appears to be increasing at an alarming rate.  there is 
an urgent need for the services provided by the cooper home.
research has shown that children who are abused often become abusers as adults.  they tend to repeat behaviors they 
learn as children.  our primary goal is to break that chain of abuse!  we believe that every child should be able to grow up 
in a loving and caring environment, free from fear and abuse. 
we need your help! 
no matter how successful our fund raising efforts, we are never able to raise enough money to meet all the needs of the 
children in our care. there are numerous ways that you can help support the work of the foundation. one of the easiest 
ways is by making a gift by cash, check or credit card.  by using your credit card, you may gain valuable points or airline 
miles. we also accept gifts of real estate. if you have owned your home, land, investment property, farm or ranch for 
many years, a charitable gift of that real estate to the foundation can be particularly advantageous tax wise. if donated, 
you avoid capital gains tax and realize a charitable deduction for the full fair market value of the real estate. the 
foundation also accepts gifts of stocks and bonds, art, jewelry, firearms, coins, and other collectibles. you receive a 
charitable deduction for the full fair market value of these assets at the time of the gift. also, we invite you to remember 
happy trails children's foundation with a charitable bequest in your will or trust. contact your accountant, attorney or tax 
advisor for more information about the tax advantages of charitable giving. we are most grateful for your support!
