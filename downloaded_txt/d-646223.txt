”sacred vandalism”












  

artist statementthe freedom to be irreverent with my art has led me on a journey that others are graciously walking with me. collectively as artists our goal is to help counteract the damaging media narratives that we are constantly exposed to. my newest body of mixed-media portrait work is in conjunction with some amazing souls; lee broda (producer/poet/actor), merit leighton (actor/singer), tchad drats (musician/artist), finn carr (actor), chad vivas (artist/painter) and anabelle munro (director/producer/actor). these mesmerizing people are larger than life in gritty unretouched images, which are transferred to canvas and given to each of them so they can create a personal story from their vast amount of unique gifts, beauty, scars, cuts, happiness, healing and joy. ”sacred vandalism ~ the loving desecration of the self.” is designed to celebrate the pure human in all of us.
