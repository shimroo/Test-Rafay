schwinn stingray oc choppers








the rebirth of cool, 
sold out, hard to find...

  
20" schwinn orange county 
choppers
 



orange county choppers 
and schwinn have combined to produce one of the coolest bicycles ever brought to 
market.  it has a wide, motorcycle-size rear tire and a riveted saddle seat. the 
custom-stretched chopper frame includes a wedge-shaped piece of metal where a 
motorcycle's gas tank would be. the bike even parks like a real motorcycle, 
thanks to a double-leg kickstand that raises the front wheel when locked down. 



a 
closer look reveals amazing detail. the word "sting-ray" in white lettering on 
the tires. black dice inner-tube caps. clear-coated flame decals. the sting-ray 
weighs a healthy 45 pounds and feels like it would last forever. this chopper is 
a great cruiser. schwinn is producing just 3,500 of these first-edition 
sting-rays. these are destined to be sought-after collectables like the old 
schwinn sting-rays of the 1960s and '70s. here's a chance to buy one for 
yourself as an investment while the price is still affordable. or get one for 
your kid so he or she can have the coolest ride in the neighborhood.

 part chopper. part 
cruiser. 100% muscle bike -- the new schwinn sting-ray is an exciting, 
chopper-style ride. built with customized parts -- like the big boa rear tire 
and signature v-back handlebars -- it's no wonder schwinn sting-rays are 
endorsed by orange county choppers. straddle the saddle and hit the pavement... 
the rebirth of cool has arrived.



  
features:


*custom stretched 
chopper frame with gas tank and gusset. 
* 20" x4" super wide v line rear 
slick tire. 
* 24" x 2" narrow front tire mounted on extruded 
alloy rims. 
* adjustable cruising saddle with built in sissy 
bar, riveted upholstery and schwinn embossed logo.

* dual crown 
sting-ray twin barrel chrome forks with color matching 
paint. 
* chrome steel chain guard and heavy duty double leg 
kickstand. 
* clear coated schwinn flame decals with machined 
aluminum head badge. 
* alloy linear pull brake with alloy 
lever. 
* 3 piece custom sting-ray cranks with iron cross 
pedals. 
* sporty and stylish front 
fender. 
* highway front foot 
pegs.
  
history of the 
bike:
  
it all started in a little chop shop near madison, wi. a couple of 
schwinn engineers had a vision for a revolutionary bike. one that would take its 
cues from the great american chopper. with a raked-out fork, knees-to-the-breeze 
seat position and enough bad-boy character to raise eyebrows, their creation was 
no ordinary bike. like its namesake, schwinn's newest creation was born from one 
desire: to create something totally different, something that only the newest 
generation would appreciate. and so, a new breed of sting-ray was built for a 
new breed of rider. 


  discover the bike 
everyone is talking about. it's the rebirth of cool. born from the classic 
schwinn sting-ray of the 1960s and '70s, the new schwinn sting-ray is an 
exciting, chopper-style ride. it features v-back drag bars, a 
knees-to-the-breeze low-ride saddle, a unique wishbone kickstand and the 
signature big boa tire -- just like a motorcycle!



schwinn and orange county choppers 
team 
to bring back the 
sting-ray

 


january 23, 2004 -- madison, wi - schwinn bicycles, 
one of america's favorite and most recognized brands, has joined forces with 
orange county choppers, the company that has garnered worldwide recognition for 
building custom motorcycles and is featured on the popular discovery channel 
show "american chopper," to create customized schwinn sting-ray 
bicycles.

 


the schwinn 
sting-ray, widely regarded as the most popular bicycle ever created, is 
returning to stores for the first time in more than 30 years. the new sting-ray 
sports a contemporary design that takes its cues from great american 
motorcycles. to commemorate the redesign of this classic, schwinn has partnered 
with orange county choppers (occ) to use the occ logo on all editions of the new 
sting-ray for mass retail sales, as well as use of the occ name for sting-ray 
parts and accessories.

 


"the original 
sting-rays of the 1960s and '70s were very cutting-edge and took their design 
cues from muscle cars," explained byron smith, schwinn's chief operating officer 
& president. "the new sting-ray takes its cues from customized motorcycles, 
and who knows custom motorcycles better than orange county 
choppers?”


 





the classic schwinn 
sting-ray was introduced in 1963 and remained on the market until 1979. there 
were essentially four models: the basic sting-ray; the sting-ray deluxe (that 
added chrome fenders and white wall tires); the sting-ray super-deluxe (that 
added a springer fork); and the krate series (that added a five-speed "stik 
shift," shock struts on the rear seat and had a 16" front tire and a 20" rear 
tire).







how to date schwinn bicycles


(you will need a magnifying glass, pen and paper, or a digital camera.)





(1) ~ face front of the schwinn stingray you are trying to date.  look at the front tube    of the 

         bicycle and locate the schwinn name plate.



(2) ~ look to the left-hand side of the schwinn nameplate to find a 4-digit number.  write

         this number down of photograph it with a digital camera.



(3) ~ use this number to date the bicycle.  schwinn made the bicycles at their chicago plant 

          in the 1970's and used a 4-digit code to give the date and the year of production.



          (example: 2453)



          the first three numbers represent the day of the year the bicycle was made, so in the

          example, it would have come off the production line on the 245th day (sept. 2) of the

          year.



           the last number is the year of production.  knowing that the original stingrays were 

           from the 1970's, you know to add 1970 to the number.  in the example, the year would 

           be 1973.



electric version



24-volt, 250 watt motor powered by 2 sealed lead batteries in a case designed to resemble a v-twin engine and controlled by a motorcycle-style twist grip

fowl crossings










why did the chicken

cross the road? 





why did the chicken cross the road?  why don't we confer with some famous people?  maybe, just maybe, they will be able to enlighten us on this enigmatic, if not controversial, issue.
 
sarah palin:   the chicken crossed the road because, gosh-darn it, he's a maverick!

barack obama: let me be perfectly clear, if the chickens like their 
eggs they can keep their eggs.  no chicken will be required to cross the
 road to surrender her eggs.  period.




elizabeth warren:  the chicken had learned from her mother that an indian tribe was located on the other side of the road, and by crossing the road she would become a member of the tribe. 
john mccain:   my friends, the chicken crossed the road because he 
recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the 
chickens on the other side of the road.  hillary clinton:   what difference at this point does it make why the chicken crossed the road. 
george w. bush:   we don't really care why the chicken crossed the road.
  we just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not.
  the chicken is either with us or against us.  there is no middle 
ground here.  dick cheney:   where's my gun?  bill clinton:  i did not cross the road with that chicken.  al gore:  i invented the chicken. 
john kerry:   although i voted to let the chicken cross the road, i am 
now against it!  it was the wrong road to cross, and i was misled about 
the chicken's intentions.  i am not for it now, and will remain against 
it.  al sharpton:   why are all the chickens white? 
dr. phil:   the problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize 
that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before
 it goes after the problem on the other side of the road.  what we need 
to do is help him realize how stupid he is acting by not taking on his 
current problems before adding any new problems.  oprah:   well,
 i understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants
 to cross the road so badly.  so instead of having the chicken learn 
from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, i'm going to 
give this chicken a new car so that he can just drive across the road 
and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.  anderson 
cooper:   we have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not 
yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.  nancy grace:   that chicken crossed the road because he's guilty!  you can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.  pat buchanan:   to steal the job of a decent, hardworking american. 
martha stewart:   no one called me to warn me which way the chicken was 
going.  i had a standing order at the farmer's market to sell my eggs 
when the price dropped to a certain level.  no little bird gave me any 
insider information.  dr seuss:   did the chicken cross the 
road?  did he cross it with a toad?  yes, the chicken crossed the road, 
but why it crossed i've not been told.  ernest hemingway:   to die in the rain, alone. 
grandpa:   in my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  
somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough 
for us.  barbara walters:   isn't that interesting?  in a few 
moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, 
the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting,
 and went on to accomplish it's lifelong dream of crossing the road.  aristotle:   it is the nature of chickens to cross the road. 
bill gates:   i have just released echicken2014, which will not only 
cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents and 
balance your checkbook.  internet explorer is an integral part of 
echicken2014.  this new platform is much more stable and will never 
reboot.  albert einstein:   did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?  colonel sanders:   did i miss one?




well, so much for the experts!  i guess, we'll have to continue to draw our own conclusions.   remember, as long as there are roads and chickens, this perplexing question will continue to plague mankind.  



alas, we still cannot come to an agreement regarding creationism and evolution:   which came first?  the chicken?  or the egg?



rather than tax our brains with such profound problems, why not lighten the mood with some good old fashioned humor?










                    what is your favorite animal?
  













 

 our teacher asked what my favorite animal was, and i said, "fried chicken." 

 she said i wasn't funny, but she couldn't have been right, because everyone else laughed. 

 my parents told me to always tell the truth. i did. fried chicken is my favorite animal. 

 i told my dad what happened, and he said my teacher was probably a member of peta. he said they love animals very much. 

 i do, too. especially chicken, pork and beef. anyway, my teacher sent me to the principal's office. i told him what happened, and he laughed, too. then he told me not to do it again.the next day in class my teacher asked me what my favorite live animal was. 

 i told her it was chicken. she asked me why, so i told her it was because you could make them into fried chicken.she sent me back to the principal's office. he laughed, and told me not to do it again. i don't understand. my parents taught me to be honest, but my teacher doesn't like it when i am.today, my teacher asked us to tell her what famous person we admire most. i told her, "colonel sanders."

 guess where i am now...

run by idiots





a country founded by geniuses but run by idiots



attributed to jeff foxworthy:if you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license, but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.if
 you have to get your parents’ permission to go on a field trip or to 
take an aspirin in school, but not to get an abortion — you might live 
in a nation that was founded by
 geniuses but is run by idiots.if you must show your 
identification to board an airplane, cash a check, buy liquor, or check 
out a library book and rent a video, but not to vote for who runs the 
government — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but
 is run by idiots.if the government wants to prevent stable, 
law-abiding citizens from owning gun magazines that hold more than ten 
rounds, but gives twenty f-16 fighter jets to the crazy new leaders in 
egypt — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is 
run by idiots.if, in the nation’s largest city, you can buy two 
16-ounce sodas, but not one 24-ounce soda, because 24-ounces of a sugary
 drink might make you fat — you might live in a nation that was founded 
by geniuses but is run by idiots.if an 80-year-old woman or a 
three-year-old girl who is confined to a wheelchair can be 
strip-searched by the tsa at the airport, but a woman in a
 burka or a hijab is only subject to having her neck and head searched —
 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by 
idiots.if your government believes that the best way to 
eradicate trillions of dollars of debt is to spend trillions more — you 
might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by 
idiots.if a seven-year-old boy can be thrown out of school for 
saying his teacher is “cute,” but hosting a sexual exploration or 
diversity class in grade school is perfectly acceptable — you might live
 in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.if
 hard work and success are met with higher taxes and more government 
regulation and intrusion, while not working is rewarded with food 
stamps, wic checks, medicaid benefits, subsidized housing, and free cell
 phones — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is
 run by idiots.if the government’s plan
 for getting people back to work is to provide incentives for not 
working, by granting 99 weeks of unemployment checks, without any 
requirement to prove that gainful employment was diligently sought, but 
couldn’t be found — you might live in a nation that was founded by 
geniuses but is run by idiots.if you pay your mortgage 
faithfully, denying yourself the newest big-screen tv, while your 
neighbor buys iphones, time shares, a wall-sized do-it-all plasma screen
 tv and new cars, and the government forgives his debt when he defaults 
on his mortgage — you might live in a nation that was founded by 
geniuses but is run by idiots.if being stripped of your 
constitutional right to defend yourself makes you more “safe” according 
to the government — you might live in a nation that was founded by 
geniuses but is run by idiots.what a country!how about we give god a reason to continue blessing america!

cows, the constitution and the ten commandments












this cable guy humor is funny... 


but unfortunately it's true!
(the man's a genius!!!)everyone concentrates on the problems we're having in our country lately: illegal immigration, hurricane recovery, alligators attacking people in florida ... not me -- i concentrate on solutions for the problems -- it's a win-win situation. dig a moat the length of the mexican border. send the dirt to new orleans to raise the level of the levees. put the florida alligators in the moat along the mexican border.
any other problems you would like for me to solve today?
think about these:
1. cows2. the constitution3. the ten commandments
cows:
 is it just me, or does anyone else find it amazing that during the mad cow epidemic our government could track a single cow, born in canada almost three years ago, right to the stall where she slept in the state of washington? and, they tracked her calves to their stalls. but they are unable to locate 11 million illegal aliens wandering around our country. maybe we should give each of them a cow.
the constitution:
 they keep talking about drafting a constitution for iraq . why don't we just give them ours? it was written by a lot of really smart guys, it has worked for over 200 years, and we're not using it anymore.
the 10 commandments:
 the real reason that we can't have the ten commandments posted in a courthouse is this: you cannot post 'thou shalt not steal' 'thou shalt not commit adultery' and 'thou shall not lie' in a building full of lawyers, judges and politicians, it creates a hostile work environment.
also, think about this..... if you don't want to forward this for fear of offending someone -- 

you are part of the problem!
get 'er done!
