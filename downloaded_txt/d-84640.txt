testimonials



i’ve been using the gymamerica online personal trainer since 1999. it’s been an irreplaceable part of my off-season training and consistently gets me the results i’m striving for.
brad ausmus, 17-year mlb veteran




my gymamerica workout program pushed me a lot harder than i would on my own. i feel stronger than i have in years.
ted donato, 13-year nhl veteran




soccer really works the lower body and cardio, but you also need upper body strength. using the gymamerica online personal trainer, i was able to create a program that was right for me.
tisha venturini, gold-medalist, us olympic soccer
