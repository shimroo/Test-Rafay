susan bankey yoder has always
            had a deep love for all animals and is forever studying and learning
            from them. her enjoyment of the outdoors, combined with a keen
            eye for detail produce dramatic renditions of wildlife in their
            natural surroundings. gouache, an opaque watercolor and acrylic
            are her choices for primary medium. she decides which paint to
            use according to how it will best suit the subject, claiming
            a special feeling for the properties the paint will give her.
