promoting rescue, rehabilitation, and responsible pet ownership since 1973. pet orphans of southern california (posc) is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization dedicated to the advancement of companion animal welfare and to combating overpopulation, abandonment, and the need for euthanasia. we have been rescuing, rehabilitating, and placing animals in loving “forever homes” for over 40 years. posc provides broad community support through our humane education program and our diverse client services (medical/financial, spay/neuter, training assistance, and counseling) to encourage responsible pet guardianship.

promoting rescue, rehabilitation, and responsible pet ownership since 1973.
posc is committed to serving its community by rescuing adoptable homeless dogs and cats, providing them with exceptional care, and then carefully matching them with suitable adoptive families.
as the oldest and largest private humane organization that has its own shelter in southern california, posc has been rescuing and re-homing animals for over 40 years. we want to continue helping our community by making sure all our rescued pets continue to get the care they need even after they go on to forever homes.
