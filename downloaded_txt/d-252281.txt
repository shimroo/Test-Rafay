boylston, massachusetts
is a small town in the east-central part of the state, about 10 miles northeast of worcester and 33 miles west of boston. it lies within worcester county and the wachusett reservoir is located in the northwestern portion of the town and covers approximately 4,800 acres of land. incorporated in 1786, boylston became a thriving industrial town in the 19th century with a sawmill, gristmill, clothier, mill, fuller mill, oil mill and a blacksmith shop along the nashua river. however, with the building of the wachusett reservoir in the late 1890s, the town suffered a loss of nearly 2,800 acres of land. the resilient residents persevered, however, and agriculture became the primary industry. today, boylston is a picturesque community that is mainly residential with a few small businesses.  a historic museum is located in the old town hall building in the center of town, and the old stone church in nearby west boylston is one of the most photographed historic sites in the area.  the town of boylston is also home to an outstanding botanical garden that features trails, beautiful gardens, an orangerie, classes, tours, a gift shop and much more. 

the wachusett reservoir is the second largest boy of water in massachusetts. it is maintained by the massachusetts water resources authority and supplies water to the city of boston. the reservoir is fed by the nashua, quinapoxet and stillwater rivers, along with the quabbin aqueduct and is part of the nashua river watershed. since wachusett is the main water supply for boston, there are restrictions on recreational activities in the reservoir and not all areas are open to the public. however, a network of fire roads are open to the public and provide great access for hiking and cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and wildlife watching. the deep, clear waters of wachusett reservoir also offer excellent fishing opportunities for lake trout, brown trout, salmon and smallmouth bass. field trips are offered at the reservoir to schools and other groups on topics that range from water's behavior and physical properties to the cultural and natural history of the watershed area. 

boylston, and the whole central massachusetts region, offers a wide variety of attractions and entertainment opportunities. the city of worcester has museums, theater and performing arts, fine restaurants and shopping, along with the broad meadow brook conservation center and wildlife sanctuary. orchards and farm stands, camping, golf and historical sites are all abundant in the area. for those who love winter sports, the wachusett mountain ski area offers skiing and snowboarding at one of the premier ski resorts in southern new england. wachusett mountain has a total of 20 trails, 111 acres and a 1,000 foot vertical drop, along with an award-winning base lodge. although small, boylston is not a secluded town  one million people live within a 25-mile radius. however, the town exudes a rural charm that wont disappoint those looking for a traditional and tranquil new england setting.
