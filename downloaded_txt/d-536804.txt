woodwind instrument advice, reviews, care, repair & maintenance.
 whether you're interested in buying an instrument, 
              maintaining your flute or clarinet, hints on saxophone repairs or 
              just plain curious about woodwind - you'll find something to interest 
              you here, presented in a clear and relaxed manner.

life has been rather eventful since i last posted 
              an update. by way of preparing for the start on the new saxophone 
              manual i invested in some new camera gear. this meant that very 
              little of my existing software would work with the new kit - so 
              yet more had to be invested. and then, of course, none of the software 
              would work with my old version of windows...and none of my computers 
              would work with the latest version. having sorted that little lot 
              out i then found i had to figure out a whole new workflow. it's 
              not been my idea of fun.
              and then, to top it all, i managed to slice the top of my left forefinger 
              clean off. i think i'd have felt a bit better about it had it been 
              a work-related injury but it happened in the garden while i was 
              doing a spot of pruning. as my good friend quipped "i told 
              ya - the only safe garden is a beer garden!"
              so that put a stop to work - and pretty much everything else - for 
              a while, but i'm pleased to report my finger is well on the way 
              to a full recovery and i'm getting back into the swing of things.
which means i've finally got around to running up 
              a new review - and this time it's the new tj evo (2024 model) alto 
              that gets the workbench treatment. go check it out, it's quite an 
              interesting horn...

              as for the rest of the site, you'll find hard-hitting reviews that 
              show no fear or favour; commonsense advice about looking after your 
              instruments; myths debunkified; clear explanations and maybe one 
              or two laughs. so fill your mug/glass/pipe/atty, give your mouse 
              a buff and click on. you know it makes sense....



latest reviews: "don't blow it - 
                    bench it!" 

 



new: 
                    tj's revamped intermediate alto turns up on the bench - and 
                    eyebrows are raised.



recent: 
                    a brand new eastman 652 '52nd street' tenor drops on the bench 
                    - and i take a peek to see if the street goes anywhere...or 
                    turns into a dead end.





a borgani obs soprano turns up on the workbench - and 
                    boy was this horn full of surprises...

 
                  looking for a lightweight tenor? the nexus select's claim to 
                  fame is that it weighs about as much as a selmer mkvi - but 
                  have they cut too many corners...? 


the 
                  rare and rather distinctive kohler empor baritone comes in for 
                  a shakedown and gets the full monty. well worth a look - and 
                  check out the accompanying overview of the repair process.


 
                    boutique horns are everywhere these days, but this remy is 
                    priced a cut above most of the competition. i put it on the 
                    workbench to see exactly what you get for your cash.
                    since the review was published, another example has turned 
                    up... 



the 
                  lupifaro platinum baritone. not quite a review, more of a comparison 
                  between it and two other strikingly-similar models... 
a 
                  brand new conn-selmer premiere 380v turns up on the workbench, 
                  and puts on a fine show. 



i've 
                    always had something of a love/hate relationship with italian 
                    horns. the playability is usually excellent, but the build 
                    quality often lets them down. how well did the borgani oba 
                    alto fare...? 


another 
                    addition to the borgani vintage tenor review - this time it's 
                    the joe lovano model that gets the treatment.





had 
                    a yanagisawa t-wo33 tenor in for a service, so added my thoughts 
                    on it to the review of the t-wo32


a 
                    very rare buffet super dynaction soprano turns up for a tweak, 
                    and i just couldn't resist running up a review of it. i'm 
                    glad i did, too, because it turned out to be quite a surprising 
                    horn.
