link | comment | share | flagoh, how i've missed you!january 23, 2011 | 11:03 ami haven't posted in a little over 6 months and i can't remember the last time i read my friends' entries.  i've missed it, actually.facebook has sort of taken my attention in terms of being a social outlet, but i missed the blog aspect.  i need a place to share my thoughts, experiences and random conversation-starters; it's time i try lj again.yeah, i realize i "came back" last year for about 2 posts and then left again.  shit.  i hope this time it lasts longer.there are many of my lj friends who aren't on facebook or we haven't connected there yet.  i miss them.  another good reason to come back.so much has been going on, including a wickedly cool new job, a wonderful boyfriend and the prospect of moving later this year.  much more about that soon.  for now, a simply declaration of my return.

link | comment | share | flagfriendshipjune 09, 2010 | 11:29 ami was reminded last night that there's more to friendship than just a label.  despite being friends for many years, sometimes people drift apart and lose the connection that once brought them together.also, it's ok to end a friendship when the nuturing isn't reciprocal.i actually feel better today about it all.
link | comment [2] | share | flagso much for being "back"june 08, 2010 | 11:51 pmi haven't really posted anything since may 23 -- the day after i had announced my return to lj.fuck.i read blogs all the time and really do want to post more.  i suppose i just don't make the time for anything substantial.  i tend to post trivial short status updates on facebook instead.i'm at a place where i could really use the outlet, so i must get better.anyway, it's almost wednesday.  hump day.goodnight, all.
