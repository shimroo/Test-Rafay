interpretive summary: effects of aspergillus oryzae prebiotic on animal performance, nutrients digestibility, and feeding behavior of backgrounding beef heifers fed with either a sorghum silage- or a byproducts-based diet
this experiment evaluated the effects of the dietary inclusion or not of aspergillus oryzae prebiotic (aop; 2 g/d) in two contrasting diets: sorghum silage-based (ss) vs. byproducts-based (bp), on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and feeding…




news
interpretive summary: feeding a saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product before and during a feed restriction challenge on milk production, plasma biomarkers, and immune function in holstein cows
postbiotic fermentation products have the potential to improve health and support anti-inflammatory functions when fed to lactating dairy cows. since dairy cows experience disruptions of the intestinal barrier function at various stages of their life, for…




news
interpretive summary: feeding thermally processed spray-dried egg whites, singly or in combination with 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol or peroxidized soybean oil on growth performance, digestibility, intestinal morphology, and oxidative status in nursery pigs
swine can be exposed to a variety of nutritional stressors that can affect their well-being and productivity. three stressors of concern include grains with naturally occurring mycotoxins, oxidized proteins in feedstuffs due to overheating during…




news
interpretive summary: effects of cottonseed meal on performance, gossypol residue, liver function, lipid metabolism, and cecal microbiota in geese
the shortage of feed resources and the rising price have become one of the significant challenges for animal husbandry worldwide. considering the strong tolerance and adaptability to roughage of geese, less expensive crop byproducts are used in goose feed…




news
interpretive summary: predicting the metabolizable energy and metabolizability of gross energy of conventional feedstuffs for muscovy duck using in vitro digestion method
metabolizable energy (me) is one of the major factors in formulating diets for ducks and most studies on the me values of ingredients have been conducted on peking ducks, with limited research on muscovy ducks.




news
interpretive summary: the development of a semisynthetic diet deficient in methionine for adult cats for controlled feline nutrition studies: effects on acceptability, preference, and behavior responses
previous studies that determined the requirement of amino acids (aa) in cats utilized experimental diets that do not represent commercial cat diets available in the market. using this type of diets can present a challenge when applying aa requirements to…




news
interpretive summary: effects of a saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product-supplemented diet on fecal characteristics, oxidative stress, and blood gene expression of adult dogs undergoing transport stress
saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (scfp) is a yeast product containing bioactive fermentation metabolites, residual yeast cells, and yeast cell wall fragments. in this study, scfp was investigated for its impacts on fecal characteristics and…




news
interpretive summary: performance and milk fatty acid profile of beef cows with a different energy status with short nutrient restriction and refeeding
lactating cows can undergo periods with a negative energy balance due to feed shortages, which trigger metabolic adaptations to support cow maintenance and milk yield. we explored beef cows’ response to a short feed restriction (4 d, 55% of their energy…




news
interpretive summary: effects of replacing inorganic salts of trace minerals with organic trace minerals in the pre- and postpartum diets on mineral status, antioxidant biomarkers, and health of dairy cows
trace minerals (tm) are important for oxidative balance and immunity of cows. different forms of tm are available for dietary supplementation of dairy cows. we tested whether replacing inorganic salts of tm by organic sources of tm in both pre- and…









about the american society of animal science (asas)the american society of animal science is a membership society that supports the careers of scientists and animal producers in the united states and internationally. asas is a 501c3 professional membership organization.for over 100 years, asas broadened membership to more than 5000 members. we’ve developed diverse and dynamic membership programs, and fostered the growth of the premier journal in animal science and the premier animal science meetings.
