education decisions are political decisions – and we need friends of public education making those decisions at the local, state and national level.that’s why your support of mea recommended candidates and your voluntary contributions to the mea political action committee (mea-pac) and the nea fund for children & public education (nea fund) are critical. since dues dollars cannot be contributed to political candidates, your contributions to mea-pac go to supporting pro-public education candidates in local and state races in michigan, while contributions to the nea fund support friends of public education running for federal office.make a contribution today – and then don’t forget to vote for friends of public education in upcoming elections!
