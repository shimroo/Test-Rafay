which cousin has he become? who are brian's mysterious young wards? what really happened at the battle of glenmorgan? why does a mere sergeant possess two of the three royal swords? can one family stand against the corrupt rulers of two worlds? what if one of its own members goes bad?					    the throne is the thousand tale of ireland's monarchy, from its establishment under brian boru after he survives the battle of clontarf in 1014 through to the scheduled end of the interregnum in 2001, the subsequent second battle of glenmorgan, and its aftermath.					    these stories are told around the lives of pelik and samadaya, the unrepentant and repentant (respectively) versions of cain, whom to kill attracts a curse, and whose death produces only a temporary reset, until what remains is reorganized and the dead man starts anew with a younger body, and a temporary loss of memories. but when those memories return, the conflict between the two adversaries, one a friend of god, the other his enemy, renews once again, usually around who will occupy ireland's throne. after all, from the mid fifteenth century, she is the world's only superpower. 					    sutcliffe's christian sf books may appeal to fans of c.s. lewis and j.r.r. tolkien. it spotlights christian ideas in a high-tech society very different from ours. this is soft science fiction, sword but not sorcery, good clean reading, and an exciting, fast-paced page turner--suitable for both teenagers and adults.					        	     if you want to review books in the interregnum  or in the throne, contact us. the website information on the timestream has been expanded, reorganized, and updated. an article on the weights and measures of ortho earth (hibernia) is available and so is a travel guide to the central part of tara.		        	    for those who become confused in following the story line of books in the interregnum or the throne there is also a genealogy of the recent hibernian royals and a glossary of terms used in the interregnum available. these two files are now included in each of the books.		        	     there is also now a historical timeline of some major events in hibernian history (the alternate history  of planet ortho) located here and an explanation of hibernian heraldry here to assist in following the books.					for interviews or book signings contact  rick sutcliffe      buy here                               arjay link page    changing links   bored links    geourl                          arjay copyrights  this arjay enterprises page was last updated	2019 06 09
