great news! carroll county school system's transportation department is transitioning to a new bus information application called my ride k-12.  parents and students will be able to download this application to their cell phones, so they have more accurate pickup and delivery estimated times under normal daily operations. additionally, if there is an unexpected delay, my ride k-12 allows transportation to send out messages specifically to the riders and their families. we believe that my ride k-12 offers overall faster and more improved communication. the my ride k-12 application will replace notify me as of march 1, 2024. you may access the application via internet at https://myridek12.tylerapp.com/ or you may download the my ride k-12 application, please see the attached parent user guides for download and use of our application.  to register your student on the app you will need to enter the following information: student id numberstudent date of birthprimary emergency contact namewe appreciate your partnership as we continue to find ways to provide premier service to all carroll county families.
