monday, november 15th, 2021: dang, it's been a while. i have removed a couple of things from my website that weren't relevant. i have no clue what to do with this site. send me an email if you still remember me from back in the day.
monday, june 11th, 2012: woo, new macbook pros from apple! also, meebo is being discontinued, so i removed the chat box. maybe i will be bother to do something about it sometime and get a suitable replacement. i'm still here. send me some email. word. over and out.
monday, august 28th, 2011: happy birthday to my sister. you'd have been 25 today.

klara (claire) from germany, sorry about not seeing you on meebo earlier. email me, my address is above.
monday, april 4th, 2011: wow, almost 2 years with no updating. i'm going to try to be on meebo more often, so you guys can talk to me there. i also added a few buttons of various sizes you can use to link back to me if you'd like.
wednesday, august 5th, 2009:  an interesting time to be alive. much has changed in the years, and yet much has also remained the same. bluebomber.com has been around for almost a decade now. it started as a personal project and has grown to be larger than i ever expected. i am unsure what to continue doing with this site at the moment, but will keeo it going in some way.
in the meantime, if you've got any ideas or just want to say something, you can do so in the box when i happen to be online.
