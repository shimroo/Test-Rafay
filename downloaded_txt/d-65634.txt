gsr-sp is currently having some administrative challenges and is in the process of reassessing how it can best fulfill its mission.  as a result, gsr-sp is not accepting any new applications, including owner referral postings, and cannot courtesy post for other rescues and shelters at this time.  we hope to have more information about the future structure and services of gsr-sp soon.
