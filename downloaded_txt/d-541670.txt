our purpose



blue ridge children’s advocacy center (cac) provides a safe, compassionate environment for children and adolescents impacted by abuse and neglect. we are committed to reducing trauma, promoting healing, and empowering child victims through advocacy, education, and evidence-based treatment. our dedicated, highly trained staff provide compassionate care, meeting each child at their developmental level to help them share their story with a trained interviewer in a gentle, supportive environment. we guide families through the process, offering resources and support at every stage. together with a network of professionals, we respond to child abuse through a coordinated effort. by fostering a comprehensive community response, we help break the cycle of abuse and support children on their journey to becoming healthy, resilient adults capable of forming trusting and loving relationships.
