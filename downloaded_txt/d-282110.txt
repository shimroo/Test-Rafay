abstract publishing was established in 1972 with the sale 
                of advertising for the antique shop guide for chicago and vicinity. 
                since then, abstract publishing has been considered a specialty 
                publisher, producing guidebooks, directories and workbooks concentrating 
                on specific areas of interest and communal focus. abstract publishing 
                has also been involved in traditional hard-backed and paper-backed 
                book production during the late 1970s and early 1980s. in 1988 
                abstract publishing made a transition from printed books to digital 
                media duplication and ultimately to the lucrative software development 
                and publishing arena. in 2002, the decision was made to bring 
                back and combine the traditional printed proprietary publications 
                of the past with the digital and internet-based wave of the future.
