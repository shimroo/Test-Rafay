"a prince of the piano and vibraphone."
– robin leach, las vegas review journal may 2017
"christian is one of the most creative musical director, pianist and vibraphonist in the world."
– stephen sorokoff, broadwayworld.com feb 2017
"tamburr is a treat to watch and hear, as his mallets dance across the vibes and notes are accentuated by his body language, all in service to the music."
– ken franckling, jazztimes 2016
"tamburr and his group are well within the jazz tracdition. he sets the pace of collective improvistaion with never-ending energy, with the mallets going from a slow feathery touch to a blurring speed. his phrasing when soloing is thoughtful and slowly simmers as he resolves his musical ideas."
– jack mccray, the post and courier, charleston, sc
"i love this cd. i can't hear enough of it. it gets to the end and i just push play again..."
– penn, penn and teller
"one of the most inventive and creative vibraphonists i have heard in years."
– eric cohen, waer jazz 88
"...world-class jazz in every way."
– tommy saville, bbc radio nottingham
"i am honored to recognize such legendary jazz artists as the christian tamburr quartet..."
– jeb bush, governor of the state of florida
"the hottest young vibes player on the scene today. christian is pure throwback to the swing of hampto, the technique of norvo, the coolness of tjaderall all wrapped into one package - plus his on stage musical presence is a force by itself."
– bob masteller, owner of the jazz corner hilton head island
