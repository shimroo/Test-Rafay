fraudulent calls have been reported where caller id displays first peoples' phone numbers, specifically 1-301-784-3000 or 1-800-655-8335. these scammers are disguising their identities by mimicking our phone numbers in an attempt to obtain sensitive account information. if you ever receive such a call and you’re unsure whether the call is legitimate, do not provide any information and simply hang up and dial 1-301-784-3000 or 1-800-655-8335, entering the numbers yourself.
