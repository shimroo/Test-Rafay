	 preschool open house, october 24
	 
    





tenth's new preschool got off to a great start in september. it has combined a literature-based curriculum with the music together program to provide a rich learning environment for kids. the small size gives the program a warm, intimate feel and children receive lots of individual attention. 



the preschool has just announced that next year it will be adding a five-day pre-k class. if you'd like to learn more about the program, meet the staff, and tour the room, plan on attending the open house, next thursday, october 24 from 7-9 pm. for more information, visit the preschool website.

	 managing stress and anxiety
	 
    


there are still a few seats left for the saturday morning seminar, "managing stress and anxiety." the website says this is an activity of the nurses vocational group. that's a bit misleading: it's not just for nurses; anyone can come. the nurses are hosting this for the rest of us, because they are concerned about how stress may affect our health.

arlene navarro and christine hayner, both counselors at 2200 arch counseling services, will facilitate the session which runs from 9-11 am. we are offering it at no cost. but space is limited to thirty participants. if you'd like to come, please register here.

	 the website is upon us
	 
    


after more than eight years of blog posts, dmc news has reached its final day of posts. not that i am ceasing to blog, but that my blog posts will move to the new tenth website that begins sometime tomorrow. it is fitting then that i fly away tomorrow across country to phoenix to refresh my creative energies. i am scheduling the proverbs posts, so that they continue while i am away.

so beginning sometime around mid-day tomorrow, you will be going to www.tenth.org to find blog postings.

	 good sense and anger 
	 
    


proverbs 19:11

good sense makes one slow to anger,
and it is his glory to overlook an offense.

here is a good measure for how much good sense you have: how do you respond to
offenses? are you quick to retaliate? do you quickly throw back a verbal jab?
do you get easily flustered? do you dash off curt emails or text messages? then
good sense is lacking.

	 what is fitting 
	 
    


proverbs 19:10

it is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury,
much less for a slave to rule over princes.

it is not fitting for a fool who has done nothing to earn or deserve wealth
to live in wealth. like a pig with pearls, he will treat his wealth with
disdain, not merely indulging in worthless pursuits, but turning what is
beautiful and noble into base objects. there is something to appreciating what
is of value and beauty. unlike the tragic figure who appreciates such things,
but cannot restrain his vices, the fool neither appreciates what is good nor
recognizes his vices.

	 the liar's destiny 
	 
    


proverbs 19:9

a false witness will not go unpunished,
and he who breathes out lies will perish.

this is the same proverb as 19:5, except that it spells out what is alluded to
in the previous one which states that the liar will "not escape." he
will perish. however much he may try to lie his way out of such a destiny, his
lies only serve to secure that destiny. punishment will come; judgment will
take place and the verdict will be death.
