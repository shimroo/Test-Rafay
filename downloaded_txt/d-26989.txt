by 


adaxxus · posted friday at 06:46  pm

								heyo all new modder to wwe here, 
	 
	i have made a custom titantron for my caw and i would like to mod it in but i am unsure how to. is there anything i can use to properly format it into the game? 
	 
	another question i have is those custom name displays in game for people like jimmy uso, is there a way to get one of those for my caw? 
	 
	thanks, 
	adaxxus
