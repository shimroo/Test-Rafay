soft snow, family nostalgia and gary





 when you leave the first tracks of the morning on your country road, you feel a sense of pride. our paper didn't come this morning, so even the driver's tracks were not there. i wondered if everyone is sleeping in today. i also enjoyed having the whole road to myself while walking north and then turning around.it was quiet and peaceful and pretty as an inch or two of new, fluffy snow has fallen overnight. this past week annie has been working and traveling in texas with austin being her home base for a while. since she had a geocaching event, she decided to work remotely around those days and then enjoy the president's day weekend doing a little traveling. one trip took her to beautiful san antonio where she stopped by the catholic school where her grandma tibbs attended in the late '20s/early '30s. mother and her sister june attended st. ursuline academy while their aunt anna completed business studies in san antonio. on sunday's, aunt anna, who lived at the gunter hotel, would pick up mother and june (both parents had died) and take them to brunch at the hotel. since those days of long ago, annie and i had the opportunity to enjoy the gunter hotel brunch with mother while we all visited san antonio a few years ago. after aunt anna, a widow, completed her business studies, the three moved back to manistee, mich., where they lived in the beautiful douglas family mansion.   keeping the nostalgia tour going, annie drove to oakdale, louisiana, yesterday.  she visited some love family points of interest, including the house where bill and his twin sister margaret grew up. after the house sold a few years ago, it became an office building. in bill's childhood, the house served as a small hotel as well as their residence annie also visited her grandparents' graves, her dad's high school and other places around oakdale. while annie was in oakdale sending us photos of her stops, bill was attending the lady zags game in spokane.  one player on the opposing team was from lake charles, louisiana, where bill earned his college degree.  lake charles is about 30 miles from the gulf of mexico so, it was a serendipitous moment of family nostalgia, for sure. we're pretty lucky to have a confirmed and frequent traveler in the family who appreciates her heritage and shares the visits to family spots with the rest of us.thanks, annie.  today, the gentleman below is celebrating his 90th birthday.  talk about a sandpoint icon and a good friend. that's gary pietsch, former publisher of the sandpoint news bulletin, a weekly paper which served the community and its outskirts for decades. gary has also written a few books about the area, and i'd be safe to say that he might just be a walking encyclopedia for sandpoint's history. our family connections with gary and the pietsch family are almost too numerous to mention. we can talk 4-h, we can talk journalism, we can talk hereford cattle, we can talk about the beautiful irises gary and his first wife carol gave me or the relationship i've enjoyed with gary's kids---the list goes on. gary was my boss when i worked summers for the sandpoint news bulletin.  he came up with fun assignments for me to do, including a two-page story about the selkirk hereford ranch moving its herd to dillon, mont. i followed the move with my camera and enjoyed an afternoon touring the 30,000-acre spread where the herd, started by howard and mary ellen thomason, moved. gary also assigned me a series of stories and photographs which made up a tabloid newspaper insert about the 1973 boy scout jamboree at farragut state park. and, guess what?  that's where i met bill. we have so many reasons to celebrate gary, as do his family and his many friends here in sandpoint. so, that's what we'll do today, and we sure hope he has a good time learning about how appreciated he is in this community. happy birthday, gary. happy sunday to all.

saturday slight





  i had a friend tell me a couple of weeks ago that she does no social media. "i'm a talker," she said.  she went on to tell me, during our first phone conversation in nearly 60 years, that her kids know that when they have news to share, to please call her. she wants to have a conversation. ever heard of one of those? i know the answer for most folks my age but still must muse about communicating in the world where we now live.efficiency in discourse, it seems these days, is best established by sending acronyms or a set of letters or even single letters standing for words that you're supposed to automatically know or through emojis. btw, do u no what no?this morning i read an item in the new york times newsletter dealing some ancient history in communicating. in case you've forgotten, it was called "email." from the times . . . .   "before texting, email was an efficient way to communicate, and the
 way we communicated was in sentences, paragraphs, fully developed 
thoughts."we hadn’t yet glimpsed the future where “k” or a thumbs-up emoji was considered communication."i look at these new means of communicating and wonder if maybe that's why our world is so screwed up. people send "efficient" messages to others and assume (ass-u-me) that the receiver knows what they are talking about. the receiver reads the message and comes up with or responds according to his or her own inferences or conclusions.  never mind that the sender, who didn't know how to spell the acronym which was supposed mean "bathroom in the forest," properly spelled "bif," actually typed "biff" which, among other things, means "brief, informative, friendly, and firm." what's the receiver to do if the sender meant to "meet me at your favorite 'bif' instead of "please keep your response "biff"?things could get dicey with this kind of communication happening at all levels of our society. maybe that's an explanation for why so many changes that was supposed to happen yesterday are suddenly not going to happen today, after all.  the plan probably changed because of confusing messaging. i think my friend has the right idea. it is still important to talk directly to people not only to establish some real human contact but also to have the opportunity to make sure the messages exchanged are correct. and, if talking won't do, maybe emails with complete sentences might be better than confusing text messages.of course, talking directly to people involves listening, and i'm guessing in many cases our society could use a refresher on listening skills. just some saturday morning musings. it's a quiet day here at the lovestead.  we're dealing with some blah weather, and there's not too much excitement on the agenda today.  bill will go into spokane and watch the lady zags, and i'll pretend to work hard keeping the "home fires burning" while enjoying snatches of college basketball games.  i knocked on the young love's door yesterday. bill and i went to dinner at mickduffs last night. i love restoration of the building (once the post office, then the library, then a title company) where the restaurant moved a few years ago. it's neat when the old-time sandpoint historical buildings get a facelift, and this one turned out to be exquisitely beautiful.  plus, the food is good. sad aspect:  we recognized very few faces while dining, 'cept for our neighbors, the anderson/derosier clan and allison sletager who came back to teach at sandpoint high. mccarley derosier's ranch hat. below:  allison sletager.it was pretty neat talking with allison, whose assignment mirrors what i taught at shs:  english and the monticola yearbook. i also taught her sister and her mom patsy and, later, worked with patsy for several years at sandpoint high school. we are so fortunate in this community which offers a positive all-around public education experience that lures so many of its students back to pass their education and hometown values forward. i sincerely hope that tradition survives the chopping block.  wishing everyone a happy saturday. game day for zags7 p.m. pst on khq, channel 6. gonzaga vs. pepperdine.  let's it make it 20 wins!go, zags!!!

you're  from sandpoint and we're proud





 on to state! congrats to the sandpoint bulldogs, 5a iel regional champions!  final score sandpoint 59 lakeland 50.                                      --jason duchow🏆🏆🏆🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏆🏆🏆hallelujah!you're from sandpoint,andwe couldn't be any prouder!💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓bill picked this flower out for me yesterday when he happened along in yoke's as i was selecting some flowers.  he had an orange miniature rose in his basket, but when he learned i was in an azalea mood, he took the rose back and put the azalea in his cart. later, it appeared on the kitchen island. before going to yoke's, i had purchased some chocolates for him at the sugar tooth candy store on cedar street bridge. then, upon arriving home, i figured that since i already had my azalea, he could start in on his chocolates. so, we both started valentine's day yesterday, a day early.  but the sweetest thing we could ever imagine happened last night when we watched our son's girls varsity team earn their way to state. it's a tearful thing for a couple of proud parents who have watched their son play around with a basketball and study basketball like a professor and then teach the sport to others throughout most of his life. and, for his team, whom willie has obviously loved this year, to reach their season-long dream and to do so in such a poised and unselfish fashion-----that's a valentine for the entire community and for all the families and coaches who have nurtured and cheered on these young women throughout their lives. i especially loved some thoughtful, mature and very wise words uttered by a sophomore who scored 33 points in last night's win over lakeland. jordan shared these thoughts in the max oswald's daily bee story, in the link below. from jordan tomco:    "i was really focused on winning for our seniors, winning for 
brecken," tomco said. "her favorite thing to do is play basketball and 
she couldn't do that tonight ... we really fought for her and all of our
 seniors. brecken and i have a goal of making it to state every year and
 we got one step closer to that tonight."tomco said due to her 
hours and hours of hard work in the gym, putting up tough shots like the
 ones she made to help sandpoint to the win ... that gave her the belief
 in herself she needed coming into yesterday's game."all those 
hours aren't for nothing, practice makes perfect," tomco said. "i had to
 believe in myself, manifest it, and make it happen."fyi:  sophomore brecken mire, one of sandpoint's star players, sprained her ankle in tuesday night's game.  we can all take a lesson from what jordan had to say.  it gives me great hope in this unsettled and disturbing world that there are still young people who are grounded and who have figured out the truly important aspects of life. https://bonnercountydailybee.com/news/2025/feb/13/prep-basketball9/this seemed like a good rural stop-sign message for today and for all who love. 💙💚💛💜there is a lovely idea in the celtic tradition that if you send out goodness from yourself, or if you share that which is happy or good within you, it will all come back to you multiplied ten thousand times. in the kingdom of love there is no competition, there is no possessiveness or control. the more love you give away, the more love you will have.🏻author| john o'donohue (excerpt from his book, anam cara, 25th anniversary edition.)artit|amanda cass💚💜💙💖happy valentine's day.  spread some love today. love, love, lovelove, love, lovelove, love, lovethere's nothing you can do that can't be donenothing you can sing that can't be sungnothing you can say, but you can learnhow to play the gameit's easynothing you can make that can't be madeno one you can save that can't be savednothing you can do, but you can learnhow to be you in timeit's easyall you need is loveall you need is loveall you need is love, lovelove is all you needlove, love, lovelove, love, lovelove, love, loveall you need is loveall you need is loveall you need is love, lovelove is all you neednothing you can know that isn't knownnothing you can see that isn't shownthere's nowhere you can be that isn't whereyou're meant to beit's easyall you need is loveall you need is loveall you need is love, lovelove is all you needall you need is love (all together now!)all you need is love (everybody!)all you need is love, lovelove is all you needlove is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)(love is all you need)love is all you need (love is all you need)yesterday (love is all you need)oh (love is all you need)(love is all you need)(love is all you need)source: musixmatchsongwriters: paul mccartney / john lennonall you need is love lyrics © sony/atv tunes llc, shapiro bernstein & co inc, mpl communications inc

thursday this, that and tbt





 it was 4 degrees when bridie and i went for our walk this morning around 6:15.  so, the temps have gone up, but there's a wind. after our walk, i told bill that today felt the coldest of all the single-digit days we've had this week.  by this evening, the cold snap will be a memory with the overnight low in the 20s.  plus, we'll probably be receiving some more snow. my sister laurie sent me a photo of the puzzle that she and her pal nattie just completed. she called it little annie and cb. pretty close resemblance, and nattie seems to be proud of his work. below:  i feel honored each year when colleen and jack let me know about their first calf of the season. it may be cold outside and spring may feel like a long ways away, but these little babies get the ultimate treatment in jack's barn when they first say hello to the world. when i went by to take some photos of the babe and its mom yesterday, i had some help too, just like laurie.  though the kitty cats acted a bit shy,  they kept their eye on me during the time i spent in the barn. mama cow did not seem to mind my presence, while the little one was still thinking about his new world outside mama's tummy. seated:  christine moon, chet howell.  standing:  betsy nelson and patti howell. my friend chris and i did some catching up yesterday at sweet lou's.  when we were just about to leave, the belwood sisters, betsy and patti and patti's husband chet howell came to the booth next to us. after meeting chris, they told us that their mom nita and chris's mom betty moon had known each other through a club at dover many "moons" ago. no pun, chris. my kids spent some of their formative years at patti's day care. i decided we needed a photo because whenever "old sandpoint" folks get together, it's a fun treat.  game day for sandpoint high school girls basketball. a win tonight over lakeland, and they'll go to state. a loss and they'll have one more opportunity on saturday. games are played in sandpoint at les rogers gym. we learned tuesday night that these games are not streamed on hudl in this area. still, we'll be keeping track of the score. tip-off is at 6 p.m. go, bulldogs!!!  let's do this!🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀below is an "i think this is neat" image. it's kellen moore, former boise state quarterback. kellen has been hired as head coach for the new orleans saints.  he's making the state of idaho and boise state proud.  plus, the folks in prosser, wash., are probably pretty proud too. it's also game day for the zags. we have to stay up late to watch tonight's game. tip off is at 8 p.m. pst. the game will be telecast on espn. gonzaga (18-7)  plays san francisco (20-6)  tonight in the kennel. could be a tough match-up, as so many in the wcc are this year. go, zags!!!!thursday throwbacks . . . . little annie and rambo, painted by grandma tibbs. my first home on euclid.debbie and my former student/clemson university professor keith morris. keith had interviewed debbie in her food bank role for a story he was writing.  shs track team of yesteryear (1964-1966)  a few old-time sandpoint youngsters seen here. i have a brother in that picture. kathy chambers and the wow chauffeur. jean eakin and laura delamartermike martin and his teacher.below: mike's uncle james, his grandmother jean, his teacher and his grandfather jim martin.  a couple of family matriarchs, virginia and helen. brother mike, his wife mary and niece laura. mother and the younger siblings, jim, laurie and barbara, back in the day. below:  laura, debbie and willie at two mouth lake. laurie practicing with pache. below:  bill and kiwi, foster and liam at twin rivers campground.
