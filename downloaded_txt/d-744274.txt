ayurveda

                        an ancient traditional system of medicine, ayurveda is considered to be the oldest system of
                        health care, with literature going back 5000 years and an oral tradition that is much older.
                        ayurveda helps the healthy person to maintain health and the diseased person to regain health.

homeopathy

                        homeopathy originated in 1796 in germany, and was discovered by dr. samuel hahnemann, a german
                        scientist. homeopathic medicines are derived from natural and herbal sources. a remedy chosen on
                        the basis of a person's whole being including psychological, emotional and hereditary
                        information, instead of just an individual illness will trigger the self-healing mechanism.

                            yoga 
the root for the word ‘yoga’ comes from the sanskrit word ‘yuj’ [pronounced ‘yug’],
                        which means ‘union’ - a union of the mind, body and spirit. it also embodies a union of one’s
                        self with the universal self, with the supreme spirit. this holistic science emphasises that
                        such a union is necessary for a person seeking his or her good health and well-being.

naturopathy
naturopathy is a natural healing technique using the healing powers of nature. the
                        principle of naturopathy is that the accumulation of toxins is the root cause of all diseases,
                        hence prevention of such accumulation and elimination of existing toxins is the route to health.
