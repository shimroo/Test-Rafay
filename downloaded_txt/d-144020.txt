‘report card’ warns washington state failing to meet targets in key energy and environmental areas


this morning we sent our latest report card for washington's future analysis out to media and legislative lists. this time our focus was on environmental and energy policies. once again, data shows washington state is not where headlines and political claims suggest we would be. 
for example, washington state is not a "leader" in reducing co2 emissions. despite expensive policies, our emissions have increased over time. we'd need to have 3 more covid-sized economic shutdowns to reach our 2030 target goals.  that's not realistic or desireable. 
some may be skeptical of wpc and may be tempted to dismiss our analysis as data from a "right-wing" organization (despite our non-partisan, free-market identity).  but the data comes from government sources. it's not wpc data, it's publicly available official data. we just need washington's leadership to be brave enough to look at it and re-think current policy.
