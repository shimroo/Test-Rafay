[the program] was amazing honestly. i loved all of my teachers, i made friendships that i still have. and it’s been like truly the foundation on which i built my business. it was really an amazing experience.

sarah crowe

textile & apparel design, st. john's, nl canada



















our instructors all work in the industry which is awesome for us because we get to hear what it’s actually like when we’re out on the road. our classes lay a really good foundation in the first semester and then as we move through, we get to work more and more hands-on in the lab. so, it sets us up for success once we enter into our career.

emma harris

primary care paramedicine, st. john's, nl canada



















i found online learning at cna so accessible to me as an autistic person with adhd. the barriers i had faced in traditional school models were removed and i actually accomplished the president’s medal of excellence for highest academic achievement in my program.

linda brown

diploma in business administration (human resources management), st. john's, nl canada



















my experience at cna has proven to be very valuable in my post-graduation endeavors and led to being the first cna grad to work with the fastest growing electric vehicle manufacturer in the world.

mark comeau

diploma in mechanical engineering technology (manufacturing) co-op, amherst, ns canada



















i’m lucky enough to be able to be doing exactly what i went to school for. i still use design and administrative skills i learned while completing my diploma every single day. it was a solid foundation to build my career on.

jessie meyer

diploma in graphic design, st. john's, nl canada



















i've wanted to pursue this line of work since i was around 14 years old. i was an air cadet in my teenage years, and it's a dream come true to be a part of an amazing college.
