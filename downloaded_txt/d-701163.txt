bringing food to neighbors & helping people find home


















































community-supported social enterprise



bringing food to neighbors



helping people find home



our nine thrift stores are never the same twice! when you shop in our retail and online stores and donate items, you help us increase food and housing security in northern michigan. and you help keep 6 million pounds of items a year out of landfill. join our team — we’re hiring employees to pursue their life and career goals with our support and encouragement.



our food rescue program collects soon-to-expire, fresh, healthy food, and distributes it to food pantries and community meal sites on the same day, at no cost to the pantries. we provide the logistics to distribute purchased and rescued food throughout a five-county region. healthy harvest  helps get food from local farms to the shelves of area pantries. and our good meals team makes thousands of meals a week for the emergency food system. 



our housing and homeless services team is working to make homelessness rare, brief, and one-time in northern michigan. our street outreach team helps people living unsheltered find housing. the goodwill inn offers emergency shelter for families and individuals. patriot place offers transitional housing for veterans, and our supportive housing programs build long-term housing success for vulnerable neighbors.
