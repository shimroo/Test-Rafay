learn morelouanne & stephen midgleycoquitlam hello gary, 
we just wanted to send you a note to thank you again for such an entertaining show you put on for our son‚Äôs 7th birthday. you were not referred to us. we just happened to come across your website and we liked what we saw. you had lots of pictures of your show on your website with lots of kids young and old laughing and smiling. we hoped you would be a ‚Äúgood investment‚Äù. 
it turns out we were more than pleased with our investment. from the moment we met you, we could tell you were the real deal. we had 12 boys aged 7 here at the house and your show was a hit with each and every one of them, especially our birthday boy owen. he still can‚Äôt believe he was inside a balloon! 
you were very entertaining and not just for the kids. we only wish we had a group photo of you with the kids with their balloons. you went over your time with us and i had to get the cake out fast! not many entertainers go over their time. we will think of you for our youngest son‚Äôs birthday when he‚Äôs a little older. 
thanks again. we loved your way with the kids and your great magic. 
sgt todd fookscomander - rcmp white rockit was delightful watching the children faces with each new trick gary performed.
it was even more delightful watching the faces of the parents watching their children having such a wonderful time.
karichilliwackhey gary, i just wanted to say thank you very much!!!
the kids had a blast and i am amazed that you held the attention of 15 kids for an hour that was a trick on its own üôÇ our son is still talking about it as well as his friend, not only were the kids hypnotized by your talent but the parents really enjoyed the show as well. thank you again and i can assure you that i will be a returning customer in the future. thanks!
lauragary i just wanted to thank you for making the trek out to dunbar and for entertaining the kids so thoroughly.
i already got emails last night from parents telling me that their kids absolutely loved the whole party and had a great time. i loved listening to the kids full out laughing. 
you were so patient with them too ‚Äì i could learn from you ‚Äì haha!! 
thanks again. 
carmen vitalilittle wise guy preschoolgary is excellent with the children and is able to manage a large group,
‚Ä¶even the really challenging ones.
tracythanks gary.
you really made the party. zayne and the kids had lots of fun, and you got rave reviews from several parents.
we were very impressed by your obvious skills and experience in dealing with young kids. you‚Äôre very patient, you have a great sense of humour and staging a sword fight against the parents was awesome. all the boys were talking about it at daycare today. zayne also liked it that he got extra armour that nobody else got, because he was the birthday boy. 
thanks again,
