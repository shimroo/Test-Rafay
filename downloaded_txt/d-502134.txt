quality education 



we believe a well-rounded education should include knowledge about the physical, mental, chemical and energetic pathways. our courses include ancient wisdom and modern research, but at the heart of all courses is a profound respect for each animal’s own ability to self-heal, when given the right support. our courses teach you how to give that support to your animals with essential oils, hydrosols, and herbs, and tcm as well as how to reduce stress through natural management and understanding animal behaviour. we offer leading essential oils & natural medicine courses for animals online. 

































we have a course for you! 


















if you want healthy pets 




 




our courses give you practical tools for every day animal care with essential oils, hydrosols, herbs and nutrition. if you want to reduce the use of synthetic chemicals (medicine, wormers etc), and support your animal’s ability to heal, here’s a good place to start. 







if you work with animals 




 




are you looking for interesting and relevant cpd? would you like to add another tool to your skill set?  essential oils integrate with other modalities easily. whether you are a vet, therapist, trainer or farmer, we have courses and webinars for you 







if you want to help others 




 




the animal psycharomatica certificate is a professional level course. apa is an holistic animal wellness system, that includes self-selection of aromatics, tcm animal ethology and energetics, for a healthy body, mind and soul 





























questions? contact us







let them choose! 











we are all about self-selection here. everything we do is guided by animals and their right to choose. animals have an innate ability to know what they need to stay healthy, known as zoopharmacognosy. we use this natural knowing when offering essential oils and other aromatics for them to select, but also when doing acupressure, or in any modality we use. it is a simple and gratifying way to provide the animals we love with the medicine they need. offering choices also reduces stress, the primary cause of dis-ease.  it is always a joy to witness the innate intelligence of animals and nature, here are a few snippets for you to enjoy too. 



 






 














 














 







 












what our students say 












i had such a fabulous time with nayana and her team (humans and animals) learning apa level 1. nayana has a truly natural and relaxed manner of teaching, the passion for the subject and living it everyday with her animals is evident everywhere. thank you so much!!!



sarah













this course is really packed with deep knowledge about animals and how to take care of them naturally! eye opening for some parts. there was always great support via email, if help was needed. thank you so much for sharing this with the world!



karin schumacher

















i thoroughly enjoyed the “essential oils for animals – an introduction” course. just a short and sweet course that contained plenty of information, videos, recipes and recommendations. a fabulous introduction to the world of essential oils for animals – thank you!



joanne hutchison













i really enjoyed the animal psycharomatica level 1 course. the amount of knowledge i gained far exceeded my expectations. i had many questions when putting the theory into practice and nayana supported me every step of the way.
