wordpress vs custom cms - key features and benefits
if you’re in the market for a new website, it’s important to know the pros and cons of wordpress vs a custom cms. a proprietary cms requires an in-house team of programmers, and you’ll have to pay monthly licensing fees for support. you’ll also have to wait for help from the help desk, which could be slow and infrequent, and you’ll probably be stuck with a problem until it’s solved. a wordpress-based website is free to use, and its ubiquity means that it is almost always available and has dedicated support.a custom cms is more secure than wordpress. while wordpress’s code is widely available, it’s bloated and often unreadable. it can take hours to load a page if you’re selling products, while a custom cms is built to suit your specific needs. in addition to optimizing page speed, a custom cms also limits third-party integrations. with a custom cms, you can include virtually any tool or feature you want.a custom cms offers more flexibility, and it’s not limited to presets, and the developer will be your partner. with a custom cms, you can also use third-party commenting services and a cloud content delivery network to improve your website’s loading time. it’s not free, but it is well worth the price tag. the only difference between wordpress and a custom cms is the price.the price difference is negligible when it comes to features. a custom cms will be more expensive than a wordpress theme but will be worth it in the long run. consider that a customized cms is the foundation of your online house. if you hire a cheap contractor and use inferior materials, the foundation might be weakened. a custom proprietary cms will be a better choice for your business.a custom proprietary cms is a bit more expensive than a modified wordpress theme. while both are great for websites, a custom-made proprietary cms is more secure. a custom cms is like building a home on undeveloped land, where city zoning laws can’t constrain you. you can do whatever you want with it, and it’s entirely up to you which one is right for you.a custom cms allows more direct user input. you work with a web developer to create the best possible cms for your specific needs. then, you have control over the entire process. unlike wordpress, a custom cms allows more direct user input. because it’s designed for your business needs, your site will be unique, and your site will be faster. it’s a custom cms with fewer bloats.when you’re looking for a custom cms, you’ll have a lot of freedom. for example, the custom solution will allow you to specify your needs and then test the cms to make sure it meets them. additionally, a custom solution will cost you more money, but you’ll end up with a more personalized cms. it’s best to choose one that suits your business and your customers.cms vs custom coded websites while wordpress has many benefits, custom cmss are usually more expensive. a custom cms has a more personal touch and allows users to input their needs directly. while both systems are popular, there are some differences. a wordpress-based website can be customized without a designer’s help, and a custom-designed cms will be tailored to your exact specifications. the custom cms is more customizable than a standard one.a custom cms offers more control. besides being fully customizable, a custom cms also allows you to add features and customize them easily. it is also more secure than a wordpress-based website. depending on your business, the customized cms might not be the right solution for your site. when choosing between wordpress and a custom cms, it is important to consider what works best for your business.

my son got busted for having mre meals in his locker at school
beverlyhillsburpclub:my son’s school principal called me yesterday to let me know they had searched my son’s locker and found a tall stack of mre meals. needless to say, i was both confused and shocked by this. what junior high school kid keeps a supply of those in his locker? for that matter, what student of any level does something like this?i talked to him about it when he got home. he was annoyed. he was not annoyed that i knew, but that he had supposedly been busted. he said there was nothing in the school rule book about keeping food in your locker, and there was not actually a rule against food swapping in the cafeteria.i rolled my eyes about that and asked where he had gotten them and why he was doing it. he said he learned where to get them in bulk online at a discount. i never knew about it because he had them shipped to his boy scout troop hut, where he is the quartermaster.he takes them to school because some of the kids can not stand what their parents bag them for lunch, and they can not afford the cafeteria every day based off their allowance. others use the fact that they do not have to prepare the items as a way to snack healthy during the long school day.i was actually a little impressed. there did not seem to be anything hinky going on. i went over the rules myself and then called the principal back.he scratched his head over it. there was nothing technically wrong about keeping mre meals in a locker, so he is going to let my son keep doing what he is doing. they certainly can not ban food and snack swapping in the cafeteria.
