welcome 
                    to the chilakoot bowhunters archery club. our club was founded 
                    in 1953. chilakoot is a club for the whole family, dedicated 
                    to the sport of archery.
we have a large, 
                    heated clubhouse with a 20 yard indoor range. lighted outdoor 
                    practice range with distances out to 60 yards. there are also 
                    numerous trails on our beautiful 53 acre wooded site, with 
                    targets set up for shooting at marked and unmarked distances.
along with member-only 
                    league shooting and club events, we host several public shoots 
                    throughout the year. our club is located just across the river 
                    near somerset, wisconsin, about 5 miles from stillwater, mn. 
                    in addition, the club owns 20 acres of land for camping and 
                    hunting in burnett co., wisconsin.
