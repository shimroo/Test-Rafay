the following process will apply to all base visitors. limit of 3 per sponsor, 3 or more will need to be placed on a base access list (bal) request (obtained via 9sfs.eal@us.af.mil). uber drivers will need to complete the pre-enrollment sheet labeled (uber – dbids pre-enrollment)

1.  completion of the pre-enrollment via any smart device(for visitors who have never been onto the installation) https://dbids-global-enroll.dmdc.mil/

2.  submission of qr/alpha numeric code (this is provided from the pre-enrollment site), 3.  copy of driver’s license 4.  (uber drivers only) completion of pre-enrollment worksheet 5.  sponsor would then provide the following with visit dates and email the vcc via org box 9sfs.vcc.registrationrequest@us.af.mil.
