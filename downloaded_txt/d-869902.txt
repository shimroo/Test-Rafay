just 
        wanted to say thanks for a cool gift idea and great service. every year 
        i've been trying to come up with a guitar related gift for my husband. 
        you can only give a guy so many t shirts, and this was about the same 
        price. - 
        sandra, chicago 
"i 
        received a gigmate as a birthday gift from my girlfriend, this thing is 
        great...she's a keeper !"
john, ohio 
"i've 
        been playing out for 25 years and the gigmate has saved me at gigs more 
        than once - everything's there in one place, thanks for a great product" 
        - by the way, i had to order another one for my son who's learning guitar, 
        so far i think he likes the tools more than the guitar
joey d, ca 
been 
        a jerry donahue fan for years and saw your link on his website. forget 
        fancy gadgets, the gigmate has stuff you actually need
