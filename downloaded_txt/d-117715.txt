featured foster
theodore
sweet theo was found living in a small colony of cats in passaic. he appeared to be a little older, and had clearly been previously tnred (as evidenced by the ear tip), but he was just too sweet to be left to live outside.









featured cat
tallulah
tallulah has been with us since kittenhood and would really love to find a home of her own. growing up in the shelter environment was not ideal for a single kitten. she can be a bit mouthy when she wants your attention, but this is just her way of communicating that she wants to play and she is quite harmless.









featured dog
diesel
this fun ~1 year old "pitsky" is smart, athletic, adventurous, and playful and would love an active home. he's a good-natured guy who likes to play with other dogs, already knows "sit" and will be a fast learner and a+ student in obedience school.









featured small animal(s)
ozzy & wilbur 
these two little guys came to us from the same home, but had been separated when one of them got a uti and they started fighting. once here, we tried getting them back together, and it was the sweetest reunion! they went right to snuggling each other in the same hidey!




we exist to provide second chances and bring change to the lives of animals we save in our community. with your help, we can make a difference.

over the past four months, three local animal rescues have been working together to rescue 16 dogs from a retiring breeder in blairstown. over the last week, the breeder released the remaining nine dogs, marking the end of a "decade of breeding horrors."
a group of rescuers from the ramapo-bergen animal refuge, inc. (rbari), second chance pet adoption league, and a pathway to hope have been steadfastly working to take in the "designer" dogs. the rescuers were not permitted inside of the barn that the dogs called home, but as each one emerged, they were "trembling and terrified," according to rbari.

byrbari


paterson animal control and a handful of involved shelters and rescue groups have made significant progress in a mass cat rescue at a home in paterson where 120 cats and kittens were found on feb. 15.
this mass rescue comes after the elderly woman who lives in the three-floor home called with what paterson's chief animal control officer john decando described as a cry for help. since then, around 80 cats and kittens have been removed from the home.
as of early monday morning, there were 30 to 40 cats left, decando said.
donna moussa of homeless tails and samantha agosta of fowa rescue went into the house and retrieved 10 more cats at around 10 a.m. on monday morning. two volunteers from the west milford animal shelter waited outside the home. they took five of the 10 cats to their shelter.
all of the cats that have been successfully removed have been taken in by homeless tails, ramapo-bergen animal refuge, st. hubert's animal welfare center, fowa rescue and other local shelters, where they are receiving any necessary medical treatment and will be put up for adoption.
