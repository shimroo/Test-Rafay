“i’ve been a member of the fht for seven years. i started as a holistic therapist and broadened my qualifications to sports. i love how versatile the fht are, which helps me with a broad range of qualifications to stay insured and protected. the opportunities to post articles on the website and within the magazine is also great as i love seeing what other therapists get up to.”helen sweeney, mfht
 
“i am proud to be a member of the fht. i believe it is vital for all therapist’s to have the support of a professional body that sets out protocols in a code of practice, updates its members on changes to legislation, encourages them to either expand or update their skills, to maintain the highest professional standards and ensure the public are in safe hands with fht practitioners.“angela wheat, ffht
 
“i have been a member of the fht for all of my career and truly value the support i receive from a professional body. i’m proud of my membership and its values for maintaining high standards within the holistic therapy industry. i am pleased to show off my membership certificate in my therapy room; it sets my business apart and provides an element of trust and assurance for my clients, that i work to a nationally recognised code of conduct“jane eaton, mfht
