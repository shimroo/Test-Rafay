image of gail.





grosse pointe animal adoption society has lost someone very special. gail jarvis passed away unexpectedly on may 25, 2023. if you've adopted or fostered a gpaas cat or dog, you probably talked to gail. her mission was finding the perfect home for our adoptables. her joy was talking to fosters and adopters and discovering that gpaas cats/dogs had become loving family members. after she retired from a long career with the state, gail started working/volunteering – without exaggeration – seven days a week at the shelter. for her, it was a labor of love. for 25 years, our lives and the lives of adoptable animals were enriched by gail. we at gpaas and those in the community she helped will profoundly miss her.there will be a memorial service on june 7th at a.h. peters funeral home in grosse pointe woods from noon until 2:00. it is open to the public.
