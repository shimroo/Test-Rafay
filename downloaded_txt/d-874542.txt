what our visitors say



















a must see experience. so peaceful and quiet. – cindy & dan














this was so beautiful. my husband and i were married in a certain spot 36 years ago and we just got a picture of the place we were married in elizabethan gardens the whole experience was wonderful and it brought back beautiful wonderful memories. – donna














these gardens are the perfect place to social distance and get some fresh air. the scenery is beautiful. – sheryl














we are very happy to have found these well-maintained gardens. on the day we visited, the gardens were not particularly busy, so our visit turned out to be a quiet garden stroll to the soundtrack of nature . . . mossy coatings, spanish moss hanging from trees, frogs, lizards and something new around every turn. – jean-maurice














we visited the gardens for the butterfly release and enjoyed it immensely. our daughters loved watching the butterflies come to life and fly away before their eyes. the staff educated us on what butterflies enjoy and what we could add to our gardens to keep them happy and returning. we were even able to purchase a few plants at the small greenhouse they have on the grounds. not to mention the beauty and serenity of the gardens. all the hydrangeas were in full bloom and beautiful. it was like walking through a fairytale. – ashley














you must see these gardens... just beautifully planted and very well maintained!! – susan














lovely afternoon with the family and learning a little history as well. beautiful scenery and sitting areas. – gladys














my husband and i discovered a visual coastal treasure chest while visiting beautiful elizabethan gardens during our recent vacation to the outer banks area! elizabethan gardens is a must see! the gardens are filled with precious and unique ‘gems’! i took seemingly a million photos! i’ll forever remember this amazing visit! – brenda
