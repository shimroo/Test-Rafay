the wednesday club for the performing arts, the oldest music organization in the united states, was organized on may 17, 1882 and incorporated exclusively for charitable and educational purposes in 1915. in may, 2019, this unique organization will celebrate 137 continuous years of showcasing its performing members in recitals and its 131st season of presenting renowned artists on a concert subscription series, a series presented at the forum auditorium in harrisburg beginning in  1931 and currently at other venues throughout central pa.  in addition to its touring artist and performing member concert series, the emerging artist concert series, featuring young musicians who are starting their professional performance careers, was initiated in 2010.  categories of auditioned memberships include young concert artists, collegiate concert artists, resident professional concert artists, and ensemble artists.  supporting memberships include past performing member and patron member categories.   the wednesday club’s mission has remained intact since 1882:  to promote and support the performance of classical music by outstanding musicians of all ages and to make classical music accessible to people of all walks of life.  each season, 12-15 concerts are presented throughout the region.
