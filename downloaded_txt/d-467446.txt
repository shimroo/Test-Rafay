"one thing have i desired of the lord, that will i 
			seek after; that i may dwell in the house of the lord
			 all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the lord, and to 
			enquire in his temple." psalm 27:4  













				where we were; where we went;
				 where we are; 
				where we want to go: 


 "if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?" psalm 11:3. 
				

  				"and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste 
				places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; 
				and thou shalt be called, the repairer of the breach, the 
				restorer of paths to dwell in." isaiah 58:12. 
"thus saith the lord, stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for 
				the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye 
				shall find rest for your souls. but they said, we will not walk 
				therein."jeremiah 6:16.
seek them! repair them, and walk in them!

    			"now, some will tell you, and they will begin to reckon, 
				and reckon, and reckon when the latter rain is coming. 
				i would rather that you would reckon right now whether you have 
				brought eternity into your reckoning concerning your individual 
				self. consider whether you have brought eternity daily to view. 
				if you are right with god today, you are ready if christ should 
				come today. 

			
    			what we need is christ formed within, the hope of 
				glory. we want that you should have a deep and earnest longing 
				for the righteousness of jesus christ. your old, tattered 
				garments of self-righteousness will not give you an entrance 
				into the kingdom of god, but that garment that is woven in the 
				loom of heaven--the righteousness of jesus christ--will. it will 
				give you an inheritance among the sanctified. that is what we 
				want. it is worth more than all the worldly gain; it is worth 
				more than all your farms; it is worth more than all the honor 
				that finite beings can bestow upon you."  1sermons 
				and talks 202.
"what we want to know is, are you 
				individually, daily preparing that you can unite with the family 
				of heaven? are you quarrelsome here? are you finding 
				fault with your household here? if you are, you will find fault 
				with them in heaven. your character is being tested and 
				proved in this life, whether you will make a peaceable subject 
				of god's kingdom in heaven."  1sermons and 
				talks 203. 
				

  "satanâs skill is exercised in devising plans and methods without 
		number to accomplish his purposes. he works to restrict religious 
		liberty and to bring into the religious world a species of slavery. 
		organizations, institutions, unless kept by the power of god, will work 
		under satanâs dictation to bring men under the control of men; and fraud 
		and guile will bear the semblance of zeal for truth and for the 
		advancement of the kingdom of god. whatever in our practice is not as 
		open as the day belongs to the methods of the prince of evil.

    		"men fall into error by starting with false premises and 
			then bringing everything to bear to prove the error true. in 
			some cases the first principles have a measure of truth interwoven 
			with the error; but it leads to no just action; and this is why men 
			are misled. they desire to reign and become a power, and, in the 
			effort to justify their principles, they adopt the methods of satan. 
			. .

    		"if men resist the warnings the lord sends them, they become 
			even leaders in evil practices; such men assume to exercise the 
			prerogatives of godâthey presume to do that which god himself will 
			not do in seeking to control the minds of men. thus they follow in 
			the track of romanism. they introduce their own methods and plans, 
			and through their misconceptions of god they weaken the faith of 
			others in the truth and bring in false principles that work like 
			leaven to taint and corrupt institutions and churches. 

    		"anything that lowers manâs conception of righteousness and 
			equity and impartial judgment, any device or precept that brings 
			godâs human agents under the control of human minds, impairs their 
			faith in god, and separates the soul from him. 

    		"god will not vindicate any device whereby man shall in the 
			slightest degree rule or oppress his fellow man. as soon as a man 
			begins to make an iron rule for other men, he dishonors god and 
			imperils his own soul and the souls of his brethren." 7 testimonies 180-181
