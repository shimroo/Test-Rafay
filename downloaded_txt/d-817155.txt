					welcome to bayprofs				

					bay area professionals for firearm safety and training				

bayprofs has been committed to safe, quality firearms training in the san francisco bay area for more than 35 years. we estimate  that during that time we have trained more than two thousand people. 
as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation our focus is providing excellent training and not financial gain. instructors are un-paid volunteers who are nra certified instructors with extensive, personal experience including teaching shooting, training and/or competition.  it’s one way we give back to the community.
we limit class size to assure individual attention. with four or more instructors in each class we can achieve a student-to-instructor ratio of better than 2 to 1. in each class our students will have the benefit of instructors having an aggregate of around 100 or more years of experience with firearms.
we teach a basics of pistol shooting class monthly, with personal protection, range safety officer, california concealed carry, and nra instructor level classes also available.
our currently scheduled roster of classes is listed on our classes page
