                                        chaining ad5204 digital potentiometers


i’m using an arduino to control two (maybe more – i haven’t tried
                                    yet) ad5204 digital potentiometers. here’s some info about adapting the
                                    digital pot arduino example to work with daisy chaining.

rdqcutils quartz composer plugin


during my weekend of procrastination, i created a quartz composer plugin. as i need
                                    some new patch i will probably add it to this plugin, so it will continue to grow.

mapping a value to a new range


a handy formula that i usually have to look for when i need it – make a value
                                    fall into a specific min-max range. this is the math that gives you a new, scaled up
                                    or down, value.

escbox



i made a big red button to replace the escape key. a museum that i’m consulting
                                    for needs this for a touch-screen kiosk that runs crayon physics.

iphone and processing


i made a couple simple demos for the vis145a students at ucsd to show how we can use
                                    an iphone as the interface to processing sketches.

creating visual rhythm in processing


i’m teaching processing to art students at ucsd and the course’s
                                    professor has basically asked them to create visual rhythm. i made a few sketches to
                                    show a simple way in which this might be accomplished.
