						kennebec equipment rental pass mods as the headline 
						event on tuesday night. several oxford championship 
						divisions will also join the card on tuesday including 
						the richard spaulding roofing street stocks, the dow 
						excavation limiteds, and the 207 brand rebels. 
						the street stocks and the limiteds will both have a 50 
						lap points race paying $1,000 to win. the rebels will 
						have a 25 lap $500-to-win points race. these events will 
						use the weekly handicap procedures and use the same tire 
						rule as all other weekly races.wednesday night's 
						event will of course feature the 2nd annual coa 300 
						along with the ness supermodifieds. also on the card for 
						wednesday night will be the mad bombers as they will

						2024 
						oxford 250 lap board





          







we would like to thank 
						everyone who made this 250 weekend a success. 
						it takes a lot of people to make this thing work. 
						this year we had the challenge of mother nature 
						during the 250.  
						we want to thank all of the fans who waited patiently 
						during the rain delay. 
						
and a huge thanks to our volunteer track drying 
						heroes.  without 
						your help the rain delay would have been really long. 
						with your help we were able to get the race completed in 
						a reasonable amount of time.

thank you so much!
