the panorama factory 
    from smoky city design, llc is a panoramic stitching program for 
    windows and mac. it creates high-quality panoramas 
    from a set of overlapping digital images. the panorama factory transforms 
    (warps) the images so that they can be joined seamlessly into panoramas 
    whose fields of view can range up to 360 degrees.




    larger image
the panorama factory creates images that rival those made by rotational and 
    swing-lens panoramic cameras. not only can the panorama factory facilitate 
    creation of immersive vr worlds, it also provides features for the fine-art 
    panoramic photographer who wishes to work from ordinary 35mm images or 
    images captured with a digital camera.

        were, i must admit all over the place from a hand held job. in no time 
        at all it made me a genius. -l.c.
