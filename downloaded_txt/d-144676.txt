welcome to our informational web site 
      for acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) 
      patients, dedicated to providing you with 
      information, advice, and stories to help make informed decisions 
      regarding your treatment options and other acoustic neuroma management 
      issues.

acoustic neuroma is a 
      double-edged sword.  on the one hand, the expected 
      outcome from acoustic neuroma treatment really depends 
      on the choice of treatment and the experience of the team. the outcomes 
      range from permanent disability to no complications whatsoever. a good 
      outcome is never guaranteed; all we acoustic neuroma 
      patients can do is try to increase our odds by choosing our treatment from 
      an informed viewpoint. on the other hand, there really are no 
      acoustic neuroma specialists that can give you 
      accurate up-to-date information for all options. you
      must 
      see the provider of each type of treatment separately,  have each one 
      give you their statistics and their expectations for your outcome, then 
      make up your mind yourself.
