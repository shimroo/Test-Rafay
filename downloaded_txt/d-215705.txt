what are freebie sites about?


you have probably heard about the popular quote that says "there is no such thing as a free lunch" or you might have seen those many ads on the internet that says "click here to get a free ipod"... and probably believed that it was a scam. well, you should not! there is a new kind of freebie system that does give away free gifts, and this site was created to show you just that!



check out this video compilation of news sources that reported this whole freebie ordeal is very real!!! sites such as nbc boston, g4 techtv, wired.com are all included... 




read on to more details of how exactly it all works! if you follow the info provided on my network of sites carefully, you will get whatever freebie you want... guaranteed!!!

*** *** brief overview *** ***



freebie sites can afford to give expensive items like a free ps3, a free wii, or a free xbox 360 premium because advertisers, loaded with cash, pay them to do so! you're never asked to pay for your gift...ever! however, in order for freebie sites to get something small in return, all they ask of you is to try the advertiser out for a bit. for example, there are tons of people who tried out video professor or blockbuster (totally legit/popular companies) by signing up for their services. a lot of freebie participants have stayed with these big-name companies after their trial period and continue to love their services, while others have chosen to just quit. either path you choose, you are allowed and you will get credit for signing up. after all, advertisers pay freebie companies, who in turn reward you, to encourage you to join, and hope you stay on!


many offers range from $3-7 for the trial period. these "pocket change" costs usually cover shipping and processing fees. however, there are also many totally...totally free offers too! on every freebie site these costs and the crediting time is mentioned so you can choose whatever you like (from lists up to 40-100 offers). as outlined on the "hot freebies" link to the right, this is step 2. step 1 is signing up for the site.


in the last step, the member then gets a couple of friends/referrals to do the same process and they get credit when they do a simple "offer" (i.e. spend like 5-10 minutes signing up to an advertiser). this is not a pyramid scheme, and thus, your referrals do not need to get their own referrals. for every person that tries an advertiser out, the advertisers pay freebie companies around $50-60... put it this money together and the freebie site buys your gift for you! tax and shipping included.


of course, at first glance anyone will think this is a scam or an illegitimate pyramid scheme. as a matter of truth, that's what i did, and that's what everyone else assumes before they understand how this system works and why it still exists - it's perfectly legal and a pretty darn easy system to benefit off! this is a new form of marketing called "incentive affiliate viral marketing" - where companies reward you for trying them out and letting your friends know about it. think of the gift you receive as "cashback" or a rebate, if you like, from the advertiser to you, thanking you for your time.


another way to think of it:


if you never knew about this site and wanted to join blockbuster, you will go to their website, and sign up using your credit card. that's it! you would not be rewarded for doing so.


however, now that you know about freebie sites, you will understand that advertiser's pay a lot of commissions to other companies (the freebie sites) to link to their site. these companies then give you a gift, as thanks, for joining their advetisers (like blockbuster). you don't have to be full time members, but even free trial periods count. this way you get something back, instead of getting nothing back (like the first case).


the way it works:


you -> signup to a -> freebie site -> links to -> advertisers -> pay affiliate commissions ($$$) to -> freebie site -> uses the money to send gifts to -> you

*** *** full explanation *** ***




is this a scam?


never was, and it will never be! 


if you look through all the proof shown below, on individual sites in the "hot freebies" section, and on the thousands of websites around the net, you will see the sites mentioned on this blog is 100% legit! i can give you such a guarantee, that i would even bet my life on it! really! there is a really good logic to all this that makes it a win-win-win situation for everybody (yes, 3-way win: you, the freebie company, and the sponsor/advertiser). read on...


how can they give a free stuff? c'mon, what's the catch?


no catch! seriously. wait, don't run away, keep reading...


the way this works has been all well planned, and because of this one of these freebie companies, the original starter of this freebie world (called gratis internet aka. freepay), has given away, at least, over 17,000 ipods (worth more than $5.35 million). read pda live! article about this.


that was way back in july 2005! at the time i'm writing this, it's now jan 2006. with the release of the ipod nano, then the ipod video, they've now must've given over 30,000 totally  free ipods, and growing strong everyday as they release new sites every couple of months when the latest gadgets comes out). this original freebie company has now given away, until today, over $16 million worth of freebies (jan 2006). that's one company alone! now, there are many many more freebie companies that spawned up since the success of this company's business! they're not all legit, but the sites i mentioned on my network of freebie sites are definitely legit, cause they're proven to be so. i've done tons of research on these sites, and i guarantee that you will get your freebie -whatever you want - if you don't scam the site!


if you go to the freebie company's website proof gallery (link in proof section below) you'll see hundreds of the pictures that were sent in. however, as you can see by the article - tens of thousands have got their totally free gift! not only from this freebie company but the many other ones that exist on the net. look at the links to your right  for more available legit freebie sites (all of which work the same) and read on...


you see... the way it works is this... companies are willing to bribe their customers to try their products. if people signup for their products/services, some percentage of them would most definitely like the service/product and stay on. when a certain percentage of new customers stay on, the sponsors would have achieved their goal of paying for people to signup. this money is then pooled together in order for you to get your freebie! simple, isn't it?


this is a new strategy called "incentive viral marketing" - companies that pay people to try them out and let others know about them too! cool, isn't it?


if you want to learn more, please talk to me live (if i'm in the online status) above. otherwise, please leave a comment! 


what's the logic behind this?


here's a simple example of how these things work...


we'll take the common freebie everyone wants these days: a free ipod - nano or video!


1. you signup using the link at the bottom.

2. get 5 friends/co-workers/relatives to signup (6 people in all)

2. each of you'll do a simple, cheap offer - most are for under $10. i did a 30-day trial that only cost me $1. many free offers are also available - something as simple as signing up for ebay and placing a bid!

3. each offer that you  and your referrals do the advertiser/sponsor pays the freebie company a bounty between $30-90. that's right - it is that much! they really, really want you!


let's say the average bounty/commission paid to the freebie company is $60:


6 ppl x $60 avg. per offer = $360 - the cost of an ipod plus extra profit for the freebie company


so, you see, it all works out for everyone! you get a free video ipod or a free ipod nano, the freebie company can make some profit on every signup it gets, and the advertiser can get potential customers. everybody's happy (win-win-win  situation)! but, i'm sure you will be most happy cause you got your gift for free, and can get many many more! :)


this sounds like an illegal pyramid scheme? is it?


oh, no - definitely not! as much as people would like to believe it upon first impressions when they see these kinds of freebie sites ("no such thing as a free lunch", right?), these sites are definitely not an illegal pyramid scheme! (or else it would be so well known, it would shut down right away!). this is in fact a widely adopted, legitimate form of marketing called 'affiliate marketing'. it has been used for over a decade and makes up a large portion of the billion dollar online marketing industry. this concept has now been re-factored to what people now call "incentive viral marketing" - companies that pay people to try them out and let others know about them too!


in a fraudulent pyramid scheme (like the picture above), people are recruited to make payments to others above them in a hierarchy while expecting to receive payments from people recruited below them. freebie sites never get any money directly from you or those you refer...nor do you receive any money from those you refer or whoever referred you...ever! freebie sites get their money from the sponsor who pays them huge commissions for attracting new potential customers...people like you! that's exactly why it isn't illegal!


secondly, in the case of these freebie sites, all you have to do is get x people (where x depends on the value of the freebie - for eg, an ipod needs 5, psp - 5, xbox 360 - 8, etc.) to sign up under you, do an "offer" (eg. signing up on ebay), and get credit for it... period! your referrals do not have to find their own referrals in order for you to get your freebie! they only find referrals if they want a freebie of their own. this is a 1-tier system - not like a multi-tier illegal pyramid scheme.

how do the companies make profit giving away freebies?


great question! how can a company make profit while giving away free stuff? well, there are many ways.. or else, they won't be currently in business! i don't know all their secrets, but here are some proven theories:


1. the company buy ipods (or other freebie products) in bulk for a very, very cheap cost. the wholesale costs are much lower than market costs, so they save tons of money in this way.


2. every day thousands signup and hundreds do an offer. this gives them an ongoing profit margin till someone "checks out" and gets their free video ipod or their free ipod nano.


for eg. 250 people do an offer x $60 average commission

= $15,000 profit for the company!!!


till someone "cashes out" a near $300 ipod - the company has this money, and gets more and more everyday due to the continuous attraction of new members!


3. many people try to scam the company and they get caught eventually! when they get caught, their account is put on hold indefinitely... meaning they will never get the free video ipod or their free ipod nano! the extra money made by this person for doing his/her offer or getting referrals is an extra bonus for the company. (i'm sure you won't try to scam them ;))


4. some people find it hard to get referrals so they find it hard to finish the site. however, i'm sure you know at least 5 ppl who are willing to try this out! (you know at least 5 people (professors/relatives/friends), right?) there's nothing to loose - just a free video ipod or free ipod nano to gain! if they're skeptical, point them to this site and let them see all the proof and explanation we have to show. we're also sure that anyone will be convinced after they see the information we have to provide.


5. some people join the freebie site without using a referral link. when this happens the freebie company is very glad that when the new person does do an offer, they do not have to give credit to their referrer (making them one step closer in getting their freebie), and thus, they make more money for themselves. this usually happens to people who are new to this whole freebie world, but if you like the information and opportunity i've given you to get wonderful, expensive, freebies, please help me out and signup under me using the provided links to the freebie sites i pointed out too. i would definitely appreciate and welcome it...  :)


lastly, other than this, most freebie companies are smart and they do have a well planned business system. if you signup to any of the sites on the right, you can be rest assured they're totally legit as there is lots of proof to show for it. if you can't find any, let me know (talk to me live by clicking the support button on the top-right position, or post a comment), and i'll show you everything you need to address your questions and concerns!


i want to see some cold, hard proof...


check out the links to articles, videos, and pictures on the bottom of this site, and on our "hot freebies" dedicated product pages! we got pictures, videos, and even articles from popular sites. lots of it - thousands to be more precise! you cannot imagine how real all this is - pinch yourself - your definitely not dreaming!


who can participate?


- most sites are only available to folks from the united states. however, due to the great opportunity for sites to make money worldwide, more and more sites now also allow people from canada, the uk, germany, and australia. as this freebie world continuously expands, freebie companies are now branching out to other countries like france, hong kong, and more! just checkout the sites (look to your right) and see their terms and conditions to which countries they allow. on some cases, if you contact the admin on "smaller" sites or if they have a "custom freebie" option, they will allow you to join if you just want cash (paypal)!


- you must be 18+ on most sites, but on some sites the age is set as low as 13 years. just check the freebie site's terms of service (tos) to learn what the minimum age is set at or ask the site's admin. do not fraud your age at any cost!


some basic rules to follow. 
you must strictly abide by this or your account will be placed on hold...


- only one person per household, per shipping address, per unique individual, per computer, per isp/ip. this pertains to each freebie site. you can always join more than 1 freebie site. (look at the links to the right or below for more "proven legit" freebie sites)

- do not use public networks (dorm rooms, library, etc.) to signup, login, and/or participate

- do not enter any fake information - on the advertiser site and the freebie company's site.

- do not use proxies to fake registrations. they know if you use a proxy because they have all the proxy lists and good fraud protection software!

- do not do an "offer" (ie. signup at the same sponsor) more than once! meaning, if you did offer "abc" on site "xyz.com", you cannot do the same "abc" offer on site "jkl.com".


generally...


do not scam - any traces or knowledge of a scam in progress or has been done, and "poof", you are banned! no way to say sorry. one and only chance, so do it right the first time!


that's it! easy enough to follow ... just remember, don't try to scam, and you'll get your free video ipod or a free ipod nano, or whatever other freebie ... guaranteed!

how to get referrals?


it isn't too hard to find 5 people (more or less depending on the value of the freebie). many even find more than 5, cause this deal is just that good to pass off!


who can you get? they could be anyone (outside of your household) !!! you could get your friends, co-workers, relatives, (ex-)boyfriend/girlfriend, teacher/professor, etc. surely, you know of at least 5 people who would want a free video ipod or a free ipod nano!


if they're skeptical, point them to this site, and trust me - any "open-minded" person will believe it when they see all the proof we got to show them!


ok, i'm interested. what exactly do i have to do?


great! glad to see you wanna start getting freebies! who wouldn't, right? there is nothing better in the world than getting great expensive stuff for free and proving to all the skeptics out there that you can actually get expensive free stuff! make your friends jealous, and they'll want in - all the better for you to get your freebies faster as they can be your referrals! ;)


lastly, if you need a freebie item and need to know which site you can find it on, please post a comment (or talk to me live via the support link on top) and i will let you know. remember, all freebie sites are not legit, but the ones mentioned on my sites are most definitely legit! i've researched a lot, and have lots of proof about them. if you disagree, post a comment, and i'll show you all the proof!


* note: i mentioned how you can get a free ipod video or a free ipod nano throughout this guide, but you can get several other freebies! look at the links to your right, or post a comment if you want something for free and want to know which freebie site can give you that. i'll point you towards a proven legit site, so that you do not get scammed. do not trust other sources for what they have to say! i've personally received thousands of dollars of freebies (i can show my proof pictures to you if you like), and i'm trying to help you do the same... or perhaps even better?
