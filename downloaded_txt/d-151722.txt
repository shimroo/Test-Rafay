celebrating our fortieth anniversary this year,
dna lounge has been one of san francisco's most popular nightclubs
since 1985, hosting an always-eclectic variety of events,
including all-ages live music, 18+ dance parties, burlesque shows,
lecture series and private parties.  
two stages, four dance floors, six bars and a full-service
late-night restaurant and cafe!

most recently declared both "best dance club" and "best live music
venue" in the sf weekly readers' poll, dna lounge has won over 80
"best of" awards from local publications like the guardian, sf weekly
and 7x7 magazine, and has been voted "best dance club" every year
since 2008.
