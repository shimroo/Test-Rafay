dance theatre southwest was founded on the principle that pre-professional training in classical ballet, as well as other dance forms, could be of the highest quality in a nurturing atmosphere that at the same time provides a healthy and safe environment. all classes, from pre-ballet through pre-professional, are taught from a holistic point of view, encouraging the person as well as training the dancer.


nestled in the largest city in new mexico, the land of enchantment, dtsw continues to set standards of excellence known throughout the southwest.
