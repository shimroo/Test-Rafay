estia & estia taverna are the first of their kind 
the homelike ambience is accentuated with an indoor courtyard, complete with whitewashed walls, a deep blue ceiling and a living olive tree that symbolizes the greek goddess athena's gift to the citizens of athens.
we used materials such as hand-chiseled jerusalem limestone floors, hand woven rugs, vaulted ceilings, antiqued stucco walls, wood plank floors and exposed wood beams to evoke the traditional atmosphere. a series of dining areas feature rustic farm tables, dark wood chairs with beige cushions and dining nooks with upholstered banquettes. 
we have three locations in philadelphia, radnor, and marlton. estia is located at 1405-1407 locust street across the street from the academy of music. estia is open seven days a week for lunch, dinner and pre-theater meals. for more information, please call 215.735.7700. estia taverna has 2 locations — 140 w route 70 in marlton, nj and 222 n. radnor chester road in radnor, pa. for more information, please call 856.596.5500.















when you eat greek food like this, you can see yourself on a mediterranean diet forever.
roger y charleston, s.c.
