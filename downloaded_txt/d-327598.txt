ginger archer bradford reviewed kitchen sales and kitchen sales gallery october 14, 2016 · unbelievable! awesome! professional! summer helped me design my new kitchen and knows all the places to refer you to for the things kitchen sales does not provide for a beautiful result. my project has come to the end of day #4 and everything is coming together nicely. i wanted to get rid of my 70's cedar shake decor, lazy susan corner, and bring my kitchen in to the new millennium. so far, so good! i can not thank you enough! 
sandra north reviewed kitchen sales and kitchen sales gallery october 15, 2015 · i bought cabinets to hang in my garage and did a total upgrade so when my garage door was opened it looked like an extension of my home. beverly cupp was amazing in understanding my project and her suggestions were unlimited... absolutely fantastic staff very helpful and friendly atmosphere thank you beverly & kitchen sales
 
michael cates reviewed kitchen sales and kitchen sales gallery february 24, 2016 · trina kirby walked alongside us from the first visit to our home to estimate the water damage, to the kitchen design, cabinet and countertop selection, choice of complimentary hardwood and tile flooring, paint colors, and follow up following the project's completion. her sense of taste and style was in perfect tone to ours, and her desire for our satisfaction was always evident. highest recommendation! 
larry w clark reviewed kitchen sales and kitchen sales gallery june 4, 2015 · my spouse and i met patrick to plan our new home. he was awsome, very knowledgeable, interested in our needs and we look forward seeing his ideas and designs. it's good to know our builder has a working relationship with these quality folks.
