hey fun time folks,
come and join me on the gold coast as i indulge in two of my favourite things, playin' choons and low stakes gambling.  that's right, the good people at the star on the gold coast have invited me over to play a free show on saturday june 22.  it's a 5.30pm start out in the garden, a perfect opportunity for a refreshing beverage as the sun goes down and plans are propositioned for a party of epic proportions.  did i mention it's free?  see ya there!
cheers!
