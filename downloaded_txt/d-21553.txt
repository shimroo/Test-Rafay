wednesday, 2/19/2025, 10pm - judy carmichael's jazz inspired




the piano duo of stephanie trick and paolo alderighi specialize in ragtime, stride, boogie and swing arrangements of the classics from the great american songbook. both have busy performing schedules individually, but it’s their four-hands/one piano concerts and recordings that are unusual in the jazz world and are internationally celebrated. there were very few pianists focusing on the early jazz piano styles when i started my career as a ragtime and stride pianist, so i was especially delighted to discover paolo and stephanie, two pianists who not only carry on this tradition beautifully with their playing but also educate and evangelize about it through their outreach programs in america and abroad.

josephine bolling mccall-the lynching of elmore mccall. for decades, elmore bolling’s family believed myths perpetuated by white people—and even by rosa parks—about why he was killed: that he was involved in a love triangle or that he had insulted his assailant’s wife. though josephine bolling mccall’s father was killed when she was 5 years old, it was not until she was 60 that she discovered an article in the chicago defender describing the real reason for her father’s killing: “enraged whites jealous over the success of a negro, are believed to be the murderers of elmore bolling.”

caveat magister, a writer and philosopher, explores psychomagic, which uses symbolically significant actions to engage the deeper psyche. he discusses stepping out of comfort zones, embracing risks, and turning life into art. caveat provides design principles for this transformation, like giving up control and making meaningful choices, and stresses the role of honesty, vulnerability, and individual expression over corporate structures. ● design principles for turning life into art include giving up control, creating conditions for interesting things to happen, and making meaningful choices. ● honesty and vulnerability are important in creating psychomagical experiences. ● finding community can be challenging, but engaging in ritual acts in public and seeking out like-minded individuals can help. ● embracing individual expression and intrinsic motivation is key to incorporating psychomagical experiences into daily life.
