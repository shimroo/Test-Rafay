welcome to musicease,the free music notation editor
musicease software has been involved in the development of music notation software for over 35 years. special attention has been paid to creating a good user interface. in particular, constraints have been used so users generally need have no knowledge of or pay attention to the positioning of notational elements. other techniques from artificial intelligence have also been incorporated to make our software more powerful. the standard version of musicease is now completely free.





ease of use
the musicease notation editor contains a large amount of knowledge about music notation. this allows you to quickly create professional looking scores without knowing music copyist rules. for instance, stem direction, beam scope, slant and end positions, and slur shape and location are all automatically determined. (the user can then edit these if desired.) slurs can be inserted with a single keystroke combination.





christian virtual hymnal 20k
musicease professional contains support for creating new hymns and choral works
           that can be imported into the christian virtual hymnal 20k and quickly rendered in 
           any of the many different ways provided by that program.
