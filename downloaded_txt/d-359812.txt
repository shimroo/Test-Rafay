debra stromquist




i have been breeding and raising dachshunds for over 50 years (most of my adult life). even after a dog has stopped breeding, they remain with me as an important part of my family. to me, these dogs are like little people in dog suits, and they will never be abandoned or "put out to pasture," so to speak. additionally, if for any reason you are unable to continue caring for one of these beautiful and loving creatures, i would be more than happy to take them back and ensure they find a good home.

what others are saying










brandon j
i got my darling sophie from deb she really knows her stuff with these dachshunds. sophie is a beautiful registered long haired full red and is so calm and sweet you almost don't notice she's a trouble making dachshund. thank you, deb!






asheria h
very nice and responds quickly. she provided information on how to take care of a puppy for the first time. she had multiple documents organized and ready to be filled out. overall a great experience!






kailynne r
my boyfriend and i just got our beautiful dachshund puppy from deb and we could not be happier! deb made the whole process very easy for us and as first time dachshund owners she was kind enough to give us extra details about the breed and some tips! her dogs are gorgeous and well taken care of, we were able to see both mom and dad at pick up and know our girl is going to be a charmer! 11/10 great experience and amazing dogs!






angie s
my experience with mrs debbie was great. her puppies are sweet and the little boy we purchase was absolutely beautiful. if you're looking for a beautiful sweet dachshund you can't go wrong with mrs debbie. we plan on getting another one from her in the future. thank you again mrs debbie. we love our boy very much and are very happy with him.






michael j
my wife and i purchased a 12 week old dachshund from debbie and are absolutely in love. he has a great loving personality and is well socialized with humans and other dogs. the mom and dad are very well kept and fed. the puppies have plenty of room to free roam and learn from their parents. debbie vaccinates the puppies and gives you a card to show proof and she has them micro-chipped. debbie shows great care for the parents and the puppies. definitely recommend!
