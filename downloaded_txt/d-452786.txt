welcome to the deutsche eiche – comfort in the heart of munich since 1864
the world-famous deutsche eiche (german oak), located in the centre of munich, 200m from viktualienmarkt, is a prime example of quintessential munich architecture. with its listed neoclassical façade dating back to 1864, and its local cuisine, it is faithful to its tradition. at the same time, its 36 modern rooms offer the latest technology and classy, tasteful 21st century design. the hip gärtnerplatz quarter, with its countless bars, clubs and leisure facilities, marienplatz and pedestrian zones, as well as the banks of the river isar and several museums are only a few steps away. it is also easy to reach the neue messe (for trade fairs) or the moc (munich order center) using public transport.
