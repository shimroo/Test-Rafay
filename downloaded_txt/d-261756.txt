we build legacies, not commodities
we have “learned our trade” in the industry ever since our company founding in 1971. nuaire has maintained its commitment to offer its customers the best containment for the best long term value rather than follow the tendency of some to transform the cabinet into a cheap commodity.
 





we configure for your application
our engineering-driven philosophy believes that our most important differentiator is a design that is fully wrapped around your needs. from control systems, to access heights, to custom products, we offer the maximum choice in configuration while building on a safe and reliable foundation. 
 





we value your customer experience 
we don’t believe in “sell and forget.” from one of the industry’s most comprehensive warranties on biosafety cabinets to a service department that answers your phone call live, we offer the best long term customer experience possible to ensure your investment in us pays dividends for decades.
