every once in a while i add something to it, but it's not often, and
there are many things that could be added...


ukraine - a short list of resources


on tyranny

these are dark times, and the spectre of tyranny again haunts the west.  this excellent book by yale historian timothy snyder, illustrated by nora krug, will tell you all you need to know: 
how to recognize emerging tyranny, and how it can be defeated.



in may 2022 prof. snyder released an audiobook version of on tyranny with an additional 8 hours on the war in ukraine. 
this is the best material on the war i have seen, highly recommended!

professional biography
(in reverse chronological order)


fom august 1993 i worked at sun labs (part of sun microsystems, inc.) which morphed into 
oracle labs (part of oracle) in 2010.  i retired in june 2022.
i held the titles of senior staff engineer, distinguished engineer and director at sun; research director and architect at oracle.


 my oracle home page is archived here (pdf). 

look 
here for more details. 


before that i was a post-doctoral researcher and research fellow at  the 
department of computer science
of the
university of manchester,
where i worked on the 
mushroom research project,
investigating hardware and software implementations
of dynamic object-oriented languages.  i also developed and taught industrial
courses, in smalltalk, c, unix, object-oriented methods and other
topics for the 
peve (post-experience vocational education) unit.



from 1984 to 1987 i studied for my 
 ph.d. in the semantics of object-oriented
languages, 
also at
the 
department of computer science
of the
university of manchester.
here's a list of my publications from that work.

from that era, here's a story i posted on usenet which has been extensively circulated (html version 
here). 


my m.sc., obtained in 1984, was about
 implementing smalltalk-80 on the icl perq.

i've been interested in astronomy since i was seven. i have a bunch of
