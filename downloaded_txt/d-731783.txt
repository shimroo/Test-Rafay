									the abbott center began in 1991 as a private practice dedicated to the hands-on treatment of chronic pain. inspired by a childhood desire to help patients with diseased muscles lead a more normal life, christina abbott is fulfilling her dream through her thriving treatment center.

although neuromuscular therapy is the focus of the abbott center, the gifted staff offers a wide range of services to promote well-being for those who are healthy as well as to support those who are learning to manage their chronic pain, muscle tension, and stress.
