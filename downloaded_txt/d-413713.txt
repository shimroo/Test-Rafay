yes sir ole mitt is a real representative of the people. what amazes me is how many so called rpv conservatives that support him. not me. i am done with the gop. the links on the sidebars are removed or being removed. it is ron paul for me.

	 	i'm back - i know...no one cares! ha!
	 	
    	


 greetings! i have time to blog again. there will be some changes in the scope of spark it up. the biggest will be my view of politics has changed. i will have more on that in the future. i do plan on sharing my views on politics but not as the main focus of the blog.
  there will be lots of 2nd amendment talk. guns - guns - guns. more focus on my local scene and home life. nascar and cigars and music. i also hope to have some guests posting from time to time. the main thing is that i will have fun and i hope my readers will also. kilo out.
