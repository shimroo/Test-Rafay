our company has represented a host of artists over the past 30 years.  we currently have two prestigious estate galleries and are in the process of redesigning and renovating our museum/art gallery.  from these facilities we have decided to add the marketing of original artworks to our product mix and are looking for selected artists whose concentration and intensity focuses on or depicts western, southwestern, or european landscapes and cultures. from our extensive base of avid collectors as well as our connections with corporations, financial institutions and the like., we are excited about being able to place some unique artworks.  if you would like to discuss this matter further, please send a letter of interest to cairn studio, po box 400, davidson nc 28036.
