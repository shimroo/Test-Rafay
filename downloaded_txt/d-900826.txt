antique clocks in perth: welcome to dutch antiques
founded in 1980, we repair and restore barometers and antique clocks, since 2002 in perth.
we also have a wide variety of antique clocks, antique barometers, scientific instruments and other interesting antique items for sale.
when your clock has missing parts, you can count on us to hand craft the replacement to suit its original age and style. additionally, our clockmaker’s experience and our extensive library of resources allow us to maintain that authenticity. for barometers, on the other hand, our workshop has a range of parts for replacement or restoration. we also restore painted dials and cabinets when you need us to.
