having perfected their distinctive and inimitable musical expression along a path that spans their almost 20-year long career, processofguilt are today one of the main driving forces on the portuguese underground. delivering massively heavy riffs on top of a punishingly precise, quasi-industrial, rhythm section, the band possesses a unique intensity that attracts listeners from a broad spectrum of music genres.

vastly experienced when it comes to playing live – having even shared the stage with bands like godflesh, cult of luna, or napalm death and a spot at the recent editions of resurrection fest in viveiro (spain) and ieper fest (ypres, belgium) – their performances are pure displays of ferocity that leave no one indifferent. this ferocity also earned them main stage privileges in the most renowned portuguese festivals such as swr metalfest, amplifest, reverence valada, and voa. 
in 2022, after four successful albums («renounce», 2006; «erosion», 2009; «fæmin», 2012, «black earth», 2017) and three collaborations with other artists ( 10’ split w/ caïna, 2007; «the circle», 2010; 12’ split w/ rorcal, 2014) with the release of «slaves beneath the sun», processofguilt reaffirm their musical vision as one with no parallel in the portuguese and european underground.
