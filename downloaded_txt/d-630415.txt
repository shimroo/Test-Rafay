strange dolls, creepy gothic hand made dolls




what are these strange creatures?these dolls are not something you will find in a toy store. they are hardly something you would buy for a child. they are misproportioned, strangely dressed, and they have a character uniquely their own.each doll is entirely hand made using polymer clays, vintage fabrics, acrylic paint, and sometimes real human hair or teeth. each piece is one of a kind. individuals who love to collect odd, creepy, or gothic dolls will love strange dolls.
