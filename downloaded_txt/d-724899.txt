done by mrs. caroline t. moore, author of the three volumes of abstracts
of the wills of the state of south carolina, a fourth volume abstracts of
the wills of charleston district 1783-1800, and an additional volume
abstracts of the records of the secretary of the province 1692-1721,
published in the period 1960-1978. the present volume contains
information about wills and estates and a list of marriage licenses
1812-1823. with few exceptions, the original loose wills and estates
papers for charleston district do not survive from this period.
therefore, much of the information in this record cannot be found
elsewhere. as is the case with many records, there is information
included from an earlier time, sometimes many years earlier. a number of
soldiers died in 1815, and people from other districts in south carolina
were called on to administer their estates. price $25.00.

by southern historical press) $32.50. these deed abstracts cover the

tryon county, north carolina, minutes of the court of pleas and quarter sessions 1769-1779 soft cover, 234 pages, indexed. $30.00

tryon county was formed in 1769 from the western portion of mecklenburg county and abolished in 1779 to form lincoln and rutherford
counties.  prior to the border survey of 1772, it included all or portions of the south carolina counties of york, chester, union,
spartanburg, laurens, greenville, and newberry.

the single most important record for any north carolina county is the minutes of the court of pleas and quarter sessions.  lists of deeds proved and recorded are found in the court minutes, as well as lists of wills proved or administrations on intestate estates taken out.  the construction of roads and the road juries (sometimes called road gangs) who were to lay out and maintain the roads are spelled out in these records.  small court cases (usually over debt), depositions, jury lists, tax officials' names with their districts, tavern licenses and tavern rates, and care of the poor of the county are among the many kinds of records included in the court minutes.

petitions for land from the south carolina council journals volume vii: 1771-1774 by brent h. holcomb.  hard cover, 420 pages, indexed.  price $45.00 plus mailing.

the petitions for land found in the council journals are probably
the best source for immigration and migration in the colonial
period. many petitions indicate that the petitioners are foreign
protestants who came on the encouragement given by south carolina.
some petitions indicate migration to south carolina from other
provinces; some indicate slave holdings of low-country planters;
still others give information on persons who died before their land
titles could be perfected and the heirs are named. in the period
covered in this volume, the first petitions for land in the newly
established townships and other areas are to be found: orangeburg,
amelia, williamsburg, purrysburg, the welch tract, saxa gotha,
kingston, fredericksburg, queensboro, etc. all of the petitions are
properly referenced so that the reader may obtain copies of the
appropriate pages from the original journals if desired. 

parish registers of prince george winyah church, georgetown, south
carolina 1815-1936 by brent h. holcomb. hard cover, 200 pages,
indexed.  $30.00

the year of 1996 marked the 275th anniversary of the establishment
of prince george winyah parish. since vital records in south
carolina are largely a twentieth century phenomenon, the
publication of any record containing records of births, marriages,
and deaths prior to that time is important.  the prince george
winyah registers are even more important because of the loss of
records in georgetown district for the antebellum period.  as we
approach the twenty-first century, we are realizing that nineteenth
century and early twentieth century records are gaining importance.
the first known register of prince george winyah parish begins in
1815 and ends in 1916.  the second register, 1916-1936, is included
also in this volume. these registers contain records of baptisms,
burials, confirmations, marriages, and lists of communicants. the
burials of elderly persons in the first few decades of the first
register are for persons who were born in the colonial period.  the
entries in these registers for slaves, negroes, and free persons of
color will be a boon to those interested in african-american
history and genealogy.

south carolina deed abstracts 1768-1772 books i-3 - e-4 (published by
southern historical press)  $40.00


these volumes are a continuation of the abstracts prepared under
clara langley of the works progress administration in the 1930s
(published in four volumes by southern historical press).  until
the establishment of county courts in south carolina in 1785, all
deeds were recorded in charleston.  while the deeds in these deed
books (i-5 through z-5) were recorded between 1783 and 1788, within
these deed books are instruments dating from a much earlier time,
some as early as 1703. after the border surveys between the two
carolinas in 1764 and 1772, many lands formerly deemed to be in
north carolina fell into south carolina. for that reason some deeds
refer to lands granted by north carolina, sometimes called "north
patents." in the period beginning in 1783 we find some deeds
recorded from the commissioners of forfeited estates and the
commissions of confiscated estates. within the bodies of such deeds
are found the names of such persons whose land had been 
confiscated, usually indicated as "lands formerly the property
of..."  the names of these persons are not indicated in the deed
index, only the persons who purchased the land.  therefore, these
abstracts will be clues as to the disposition of lands of many
loyalists.
