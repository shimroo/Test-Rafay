found some extremely rare photos of a prototype (and unreleased) pinball machine by stern that were never released to the public.  the game is called clone and was designed by dixie rinehart, who sadly passed away in 2019. the photos were found inside of the developers orbitor 1 game, which were discovered by bills game world (here in colorado).  ive been asked by a few people to post hi-res pix from my previous post. so here they are.  thanks and enjoy

purchased a medieval madness le a few back and they ended up making a topper, larger display and better sound system for it.  took me a while to get it, but finally did.  looks amazing.

picked up a very nice saturn kiosk today. its working but the fluorescent light was burnt out and the console battery was dead. after replacing the cr2032 battery i had to find an f30 t12 cw 30" bulb. even though its not an arcade game, i really like the way it looks.  anyone else collect video game kiosks?

classic 80s movie based on arcade games.
december 30, 2012


 
the one, the only, the ultra-collectable... attack from mars!â â this game was produced in 1995 by bally/williams, manufacturer of the greatest and most collectable modern pinball machines on the planet. this is one of the most collectable and sought after games of the 90's. for most modern-day collectors, this machine is in their top two games to own list!â  if you have never played an attack from mars, you are in for a sight, sound and gameplay feast. this game is tough to beat with it's ultra-fast play and excellent theme.â  who doesn't want to defend the planet earth from nasty martians? i know i do! this game will blow your mind!â  it's one of my personal favorites!

          you'll love hearing the martian threats, military commands and ethnic character voices from around the globe as you do battle to save the planet! this game has a fast and wicked style of play with three different ramps, loads of standing targets, rollovers, pop-bumpers, slingshots, vibrating martians and best of all, the martian mothership in the center. it is guarded by stationary targets that drop down via a motorized mechanism to reveal the hidden center drop target that must be struck an increasing number of times as you move through the defending countries.â  each hit that the martian mothership takes will cause a shaking vibration on the ship and a simulated explosion strobe lamp flash!â  this game is full of so many different game modes, multiball modes and video modes that your head will spin!â  the thumping music track will put you in the mood to kick some martian butt!â  can you survive long enough to "rule the universe"?!â  the game is extremely easy to understand, but incredibly difficult to master!â  this bally masterpiece goes great in any home gameroom! your neighbors will never leave!. -pinallclinic
