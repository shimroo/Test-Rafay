how liberals blogs see her:
                katherine jenerette, the "sarah palin of the south."
january 4, 2010


"... poor old henry brown will also probably lose his   primary battle, possibly even to katherine jenerette, the "sarah palin of the   south..." and an update on january 12th "...south   carolina's most responsive-- and attractive-- political leader, katherine   jenerette, [shows] how strongly an extremist teabagger like herself can   absolutely crush-- that word again-- any pathetic republican   establishment hack the party choses to field. jenerette may be poohpoohed by the   media, but she's every bit as compelling to the brainwashed beck/limbaugh masses   as marco rubio is. and she's looking   like a winner to replace henry brown in south carolina's first congressional   district-- even handily beating insider favorite carroll "tumpy" campbell iii by   more than double. ...more from a left wing blog "down with tyranny"

november 5, 2008


on wednesday, katherine jenerette, a former us congressional field   representative for the 1st district, a veteran of the persian gulf war, and a us   army reserve officer announced her bid for the 1st district us congressional   seat in the 2010 and the beginning of her campaign. âyesterdayâs election demonstrated clearly that the 1st district will be a   battleground in the 2010 election,â jenerette said from fort bragg were she is   presently training in middle east counter-terrorism and special operations.   âwhen a four term incumbent republican in a âsafeâ republican district holds the   seat with a slim margin of only four percent of the votes - that spells big   problems in the next congressional election,â jenerette said. ...more from here

south carolina:  flood gates open for charleston  congressional seat: about jenerette ââ¦ sheâs kind  of got that sarah palin thing going on,â
january  13, 2010


katherine  jenerette, a veteran of the us army and the persian  gulf war, former brown staffer, tea party activist, and photogenic mother of  four who garnered 19 percent of the primary vote against brown in a  three-way race in 2008, has also already been in the race. while insiders  question her ability to win either the nomination or the general election, they  note she has several advantages, including some name id from her 2008 race,  being from horry county  in a primary field possibly dominated by charleston  area contenders, and being the lone female in a race with a half-dozen or so  males. âsheâs sort of an outsiderâ¦ sheâs kind  of got that sarah palin thing going on,â ...more from the southern  political report

if it's reagan principles you want, katherine jenerette is your gal ~ from carolina politics online
may 26, 2008


the one candidate that really stands out to me out of the three, however, is katherine   jenerette. a history professor, mother of four, and a  lieutenant in   the army reserves, i think mrs. jenerette is the total package that disgruntled   conservatives and others disoriented with the republican party are looking for.   read and learn: ...more from a conservative blog

what others are saying

"katherine   jenerette, 39, a us army reserve officer and a republican activist,   might[will] seek the gop nomination. jenerette ran against brown in last yearâs   primary, garnering 19% to brownâs 70% in a three-way contest. observers describe   her [jenerette]-- admiringly -- as âpalinesque,â a reminder of just how much of   an icon the governor of alaska has become."
