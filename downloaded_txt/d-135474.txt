midway
landing on richland chambers reservoir texas 

we started building midway landing in 1985 near
corsicana texas. a
few years before richland chambers lake started to fill . i knew that it was important to get in a good boat ramp and build
a protected cove. also i wanted to get a jump on the competition ,  although it was several
years before other campgrounds or marinas were built on richland chambers
reservoir. it did give me a chance to get the best customers first and we
did ! i've found that letting my customers advertise for me i get the kind of campers and fisherpersons
we all like. i consider midway a fish'n camp, not a big fancy marina or a yacht club. we run a well
maintained quite campground on richland chambers reservoir and strictly enforce our rules to protect
our customers . we have 30 acres and i live on
the property so i keep a good eye on things. some campers stay year-round
on richland chambers lake others just show up when the
fish are biting but that's ok (they bite often). even if your not a great fisherman the people down here don't
mind helping you do better. so come on down to richland chambers and give us a try. the fishing and
camping are great!
