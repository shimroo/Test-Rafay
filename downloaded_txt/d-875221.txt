uncle bubba's © is your complete source for all things country! 
in business since the last century ... o.k., o.k. ... since 1989,
				in the grandest place on earth, the great smoky mountains of western
				north carolina.
we enjoy country for the warmth, nostalgia and comfort of the
				natural earth and wood tones. we love bubba for the sheer fun
				of it! learned a long time ago that everyone knows a bubba, has
				a bubba, or is a bubba.
our treasures are most unique. many are limited quantity, or one-of-a-kind
				(handmade quilts, or collectibles and antiques). so a lot depents
				on just how fast your are: "first come-first served."
