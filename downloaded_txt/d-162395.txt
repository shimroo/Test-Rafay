intense gang violence displaces over 1,200


posted on: 1 november 2024
by: bryan schaaf



in recent days, 1,200 haitians have been displaced by gang violence.  the kenyan-led security force is under-staffed and under-equipped for pushing back gangs let alone holding cleared neighborhoods.  even if they could, it is a temporary measure until there is an effective, accountable government in place.  so far the transitional presidential council is remarkable only for the level of infighting.  residents of contested neighborhoods lack food, water, and health care.  reaching them is challenging for even the most professional humanitarian organisations.  despite all this, other countries continue to send flights of deportees to haiti which is reprehensible.  read the fhe full article linked and below for more information.

israel, haiti top list of countries where journalist murders go unpunished


posted on: 31 october 2024
by: bryan schaaf



 
the committee to protect journalists reports that globally no one is held to account in 80 percent of cases where journalists are targeted.  haiti was included due to the aggression of criminal gangs who have destabilised already weak administrative and judicial institutions,  however, the targeted killing of journalists is not new in haiti.  jean dominique, immortalised in a documentary entitled "the agronomist", was murdered in 2000.  israel was included for the at least 128 journalists and media workers killed amongst over 40,000 civilian casualties.  journalists in haiti, gaza, and other conflict- affected countries around the world are heroes who deserve both respect and protection. the full al jazeera article is linked and below.

kenyan police advance team arrives in haiti


posted on: 25 june 2024
by: bryan schaaf



at long last, a kenyan advance team of police officers arrived in haiti.  it is hoped the first security forces will arrive soon after.  with sufficient support, the kenyan-led multi-national force (mss) could eventually reach 2,500 security personnel. as 80% percent of of port-au-prince ia controlled by gangs and insecurity has metastasized in other departments as well, the mss has a very challenging task ahead.  one hopes this will be the last foreign intervention in haiti - but the seeds of insecurity will remain until the haitian government invests in its own people and can maintain security.  the full article by miami herald journalist jacqueline charles is linked and follows.

haiti health care system on verge of collapse


posted on: 24 may 2024
by: bryan schaaf



according to unicef, haiti's health system is "on the verge of collapse" with six out of 10 hospitals in the country barely operational. unicef emphasised that violence, mass displacement, dangerous epidemics, and increasing malnutrition have put the country's already weakened health system under great strain but it may be supply chain breaks that cause it to collapse. getting vital supplies, health care staff, and patients to where they need to be has become logistically challenging and dangerous due to gang-violence.  it remains unclear, even after all this time, when the kenyan-led security force will arrive - and without security, access to health care will suffer.  the full bbc article by jaroslav lukiv follows.

 haiti’s health crisis grows as gangs destroy hospitals, pharmacies


posted on: 2 april 2024
by: bryan schaaf



even in more peaceful times, haiti's patchwork system of governmental, charity, and private sector health care facilities were insufficient to meet the needs of the population.  conflict with and between gangs has caused the situation to deteriorate further with over 30 private and public health care facilities having been vandalised or forced to close.  those still open often lack staff, stocks, and security.  haiti has only enough vaccines to last until the end of the month, health care facilities throughout the country struggle to have pharmaceuticals delivered through largely gang-controlled port-au-prince, and cholera is spreading on top of increasing food insecurity and malnutrition.  at this point, the situation is so difficult that re-establishing security would in and of itself be a health intervention.  the full article by jacqueline charles of the miami herald is linked and follows.

a transition beset by challenges and uncertainty


posted on: 23 march 2024
by: bryan schaaf



in the past, haitian politicians used and had influence over gangs.  now the gangs hold the power, controlling 95% of port-au-prince as well as the artibonite and ouest departments. gangs charge "fees" for using national roads, kidnap and have attacked government and civilian infrastructure, including the national airport, national palace, and a prison which freed 4,000 criminals, swelling their ranks.  embassies and international ngos are evacuating their staff leaving haitians feeling abandoned when most in need.  a transition council is being formed and the kenyan-led multi-national securtiy support mission (mss) remains pending.  more information on the increasingly grim situation follows in a new humanitarian piece by daniela mohor.

what's happening in haiti?


posted on: 7 march 2024
by: bryan schaaf



the much-awaited kenyan-led multi-national force is nowhere to be seen - and even if it were, it may not be enough to stop the chaos.  gangs control 80% of port-au-prince, have attacked the airport, and are banding together to force for the resignation of ariel henry.  according to a miami herald article by michael wilner and jacquline charles, the u.s government has asked henry to move forward with the formation of a transitional council — a mechanism that would involve the appointment of an interim prime minister to replace henry, compelling his resignation. the situation has been urgent for a long time but the lack of action may result in the toppling of the government and the overwhelming of the haitian national police.  a new humanitarian article by daniela mohor below provides more information the humanitarian impact.

aid delivery depends on talking to 300 gangs


posted on: 15 october 2023
by: bryan schaaf



no matter how bad insecurity ever has been, the international committee of the red cross (icrc) has always maintained an important presence in haiti.  with approximately eighty percent of port-au-prince being under gang control, the icrc must maintain constant communication with many of the 300 gangs and manage their ever-shifting alliances in order to provide assistance to the most vulnerable.  in response to haiti's worsening situation, icrc intends to increase its humanitarian efforts including by expanding training for emergency health staff, ambulance services, and support to over-burdened health care facilities in insecure neighborhoods.  the full bbc article by vanessa buschschlüter is linked and follows.

violence spreads north with over 10,000 displaced


posted on: 29 september 2023
by: bryan schaaf



unchecked violence continues to spread like a cancer in haiti, with over 10,000 displaced from their homes in the north.  suspected gang members attacked a police station in saut-d'eau and the zanmi lasante (partners in health) facility in mirebalais has also been attacked.  the kenyan-led peacekeeping force is still more idea than reality and despite the violence, the united states continues to deport haitians.  the peacekeepers will face a much worse security situation than any previous peacekeeping force.  more information follows in the reuters article below.
