grand old police blotter: bass fail edition





a very important person gets caught red-handed:

prominent washington pr agent david bass is a suspect in the theft of two bottles of liquor from vip hotspot café milano earlier this month, according to records obtained by the washington post.

d.c. police released a surveillance video which shows two men entering the georgetown restaurant through the kitchen in the early morning hours of july 1 after it had closed for the night. one man is seen grabbing two bottles — one grey goose vodka, the other campari — from behind the bar, while the other appears to act as the lookout.

at least a dozen acquaintances of bass’s who have reviewed the footage say the second man is bass, and records name him as a suspect.

a fixture on the washington social scene, bass, 49, is the president and ceo of communications firm raptor strategies and was deputy publisher of the weekly standard from 1997 to 2004.
the question is not whether bass will sell pruno to his fellow inmates, but whether he will be shunned after his release for the quality of his selections.

the unflushable mickey kaus





the unemployable hack has been reduced to hat tipping ace of spades for links on how "leftists" don't work but just sit around and smoke dope.

it's not clear whether disability payments or trust funds are keeping kaus alive at this point.  

maybe he can send his clips to donald trump and offer his services as ambassador to white los angeles.

always low racists





walmart may have sold off its stock of confederate flags (except those appearing on the mississippi state flag), but it still has plenty of pro-confederacy p.r.  the second result on a search of "confederate" at walmart.com is a book entitled "confederate south carolina."  you'll not be surprised to learn that the book does not portray confederate south carolina as a shithole of barbarity, but rather as a land of pale heroes. 


from the amazon.com page for the book (because walmart doesn't provide a description):
the civil war never left south carolina, from its beginning at fort sumter in 1861 through the destructive, harrowing days of sherman's march through the state in 1865. included here are the stories of confederate civilians and soldiers who remained true to their cause throughout the perilous struggle. an english aristocrat risked his life to run the blockade and become one of the defenders of charleston. the haskells of abbeville sent seven sons into confederate service. many south carolina women made heart-rending sacrifices, including a disabled woman from laurens county whose heroic efforts preserved mount vernon, the home of george washington, from wartime ravages. author karen stokes details the lives of men and women whose destinies intertwined with a tragic era in palmetto state history.
no points for guessing what else these men and women have in common.the author also writes confederacy-era romance novels -- one involving a "shocking crime committed at [the hero's] plantation by enemy soldiers"  -- and a "non-fiction" book about how sherman made life tough for certain palmetto state civilians. she really doesn't like sherman.




to be fair, walmart.com also sells books about the civil war that aren't crap, as well as a confederate soldier's cap, a biography of robert e. lee for young readers which co-stars "mammy, the negro nurse," and a poster of jefferson davis' inaugural. 



walmart -- and amazon -- should continue to sell these books, even if most of their intended audience is illiterate, if only to document how delusional living neo-confederates still are.

politicho hack lacks depth perception, brains





"ap photo shows a gun pointed at ted cruz’s head," screeches a politicho hack.


except for the facts that the photograph doesn't show a gun, and doesn't show anything pointed at ted's head, that's exactly right.



politicho's desperation for wingnut traffic continues apace.

right now, rick santorum and lindsey graham are parsing dylann roof's online manifesto for anti-christian sentiment.
using their interpretation of christianity, they won't find it.

heritage of hate





senator lindsey graham, whose parents ran a whites-only criminal establishment in the 1970s, says the confederate flag is "who we are."

he is right about that, if nothing else.

rand "poodle" paul is a honest as your average wingnut blogger





buzzfeed lays out the not particularly shocking news that rand paul's ghostwriter exhaustively researched paul's books in the comment sections of free republic and the e-mail forwards of your mentally unstable uncle. 


one of many examples:

then, paul cites a fake thomas jefferson quote again to lead off the chapter “living everyday in fear of your government.”

“when governments fear the people, there is liberty. when the people fear the government, there is tyranny,” paul cites jefferson as saying.

but again, the thomas jefferson foundation notes they “have not found any evidence that thomas jefferson said or wrote” these remarks.
i suspect that poodle paul's books also didn't explore the contradictions between tommy's rhetorical opposition to tyranny and his practices of enslavement and rape. because of a little fact that buzzfeed forgets to mention, namely, that paul's literary collaborator, jack hunter, is a racist piece of shit.  for paul and his pals, liberty is a whites-only proposition.
