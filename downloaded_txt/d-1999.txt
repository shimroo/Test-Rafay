important information for pua and pua-related fpuc
unemployment compensation benefits recipients
 

please note: this information has been updated as of august 5, 2020


as part of efforts to combat recent fraudulent activity, the pennsylvania treasury department (treasury) and the pennsylvania department of labor and industry (l&i) are arranging for all recipients of unemployment benefits under the pandemic unemployment assistance (pua) and the federal pandemic unemployment compensation (fpuc) programs to receive payments by electronic deposits onto debit cards.  applicants who request payment by direct deposit will, until further notice, receive benefits through deposits onto debit cards.
pua claimants who have not requested or not yet received a u.s. bank reliacard
reliacards provide a secure, reliable, and prompt method of delivering funds. you should expect to receive your reliacard debit card within about seven to ten days following the issuance of your initial payment by l&i. even if you did not select debit card as your method of payment, you do not need to do anything more to obtain your u.s. bank reliacard.1 it will be delivered to you automatically. the reliacard will arrive in a plain envelope, with a postmark from indianapolis, in. you should be careful not to discard this piece of mail. 
you will receive pua benefits payments through the reliacard, which is a prepaid visa debit card. the reliacard offers a fast and secure way to receive benefits payments, while also providing easy ways to access your money. with reliacard, you can make purchases anywhere visa cards are accepted, get cash back with a purchase, pay bills, and withdraw cash2 at more than 3900 in-network atms in pennsylvania, all without incurring fees. you can monitor your card balance and transactions using the reliacard mobile app or cardholder website at usbankreliacard.com. you can sign up for email or text3 alerts to let you know when your benefits are received. you can also transfer funds from your reliacard to your bank account.2 fees apply for some transactions and services offered. 
additional important information about the reliacard is available here. 
you can request treasury to have your payments made by check. payment by check, however, is a slow and resource-intensive method of distributing benefits, and is also subject to the delivery schedules of the u.s. postal service. 
if you request payment by check, your benefits will be sent via regular first class mail, and generally will take from four to six business days to arrive following the day of filing. please also be aware that the enormous volume of benefits payments resulting from the coronavirus pandemic has placed extraordinary demands on both l&i and treasury. there have been recent instances where these challenges resulted in unpredictable delays and interruptions, frequently in the production and mailing of benefits checks. delivery of checks in the future is subject to similar uncertainties. 
if you wish to do receive payment by check, please visit the treasury website at https://www.patreasury.gov/ucpuachoice and provide the information requested there. 
1.the reliacard is issued by u.s. bank national association pursuant to a license from visa u.s.a. inc. â© 2020 u.s. bank. member fdic.
2.fees and transaction limits apply. see fee schedule and card carrier for details.
3.for text messages, standard messaging charges apply through your mobile carrier and message frequency depends on account settings.
