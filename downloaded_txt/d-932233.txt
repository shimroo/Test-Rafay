an immense world


new york times bestseller • a “thrilling” (the new york times), “dazzling” (the wall street journal) tour of the radically different ways that animals perceive the world that will fill you with wonder and forever alter your perspective, by pulitzer prize–winning science journalist ed yong
 
“one of this year’s finest works of narrative nonfiction.”—oprah daily

one of the ten best books of the year: the wall street journal, the new york times, time, people, the philadelphia inquirer, slate, reader’s digest, chicago public library, outside, publishers weekly, bookpage

one of the best books of the year: oprah daily, the new yorker, the washington post, the guardian, the economist, smithsonian magazine, prospect (uk), globe & mail, esquire, mental floss, marginalian, she reads, kirkus reviews, library journal

the earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. but every kind of animal, including humans, is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of our immense world.

in an immense world, ed yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. we encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the earth’s magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and even humans who wield sonar like bats. we discover that a crocodile’s scaly face is as sensitive as a lover’s fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. we learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. we listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries that remain unsolved.

funny, rigorous, and suffused with the joy of discovery, an immense world takes us on what marcel proust called “the only true voyage . . . not to visit strange lands, but to possess other eyes.”

winner of the andrew carnegie medal • finalist for the kirkus prize • finalist for the national book critics circle award • longlisted for the pen/e.o. wilson award









the only one left


the instant new york times bestseller

named a summer book to watch by the washington post, boston globe, usa today, oprah, paste, country living, good housekeeping, and nerd daily

"propulsive ... a dizzying gothic whodunit."
—new york times book review

bestselling author riley sager returns with a gothic chiller about a young caregiver assigned to work for a woman accused of a lizzie borden-like massacre decades earlier.

at seventeen, lenora hope
hung her sister with a rope

now reduced to a schoolyard chant, the hope family murders shocked the maine coast one bloody night in 1929. while most people assume seventeen-year-old lenora was responsible, the police were never able to prove it. other than her denial after the killings, she has never spoken publicly about that night, nor has she set foot outside hope’s end, the cliffside mansion where the massacre occurred.

stabbed her father with a knife
took her mother’s happy life

it’s now 1983, and home-health aide kit mcdeere arrives at a decaying hope’s end to care for lenora after her previous nurse fled in the middle of the night. in her seventies and confined to a wheelchair, lenora was rendered mute by a series of strokes and can only communicate with kit by tapping out sentences on an old typewriter. one night, lenora uses it to make a tantalizing offer—i want to tell you everything.

“it wasn’t me,” lenora said
but she’s the only one not dead
 
as kit helps lenora write about the events leading to the hope family massacre, it becomes clear there’s more to the tale than people know. but when new details about her predecessor’s departure come to light, kit starts to suspect lenora might not be telling the complete truth—and that the seemingly harmless woman in her care could be far more dangerous than she first thought.









bookshops & bonedust


when an injury throws a young, battle-hungry orc off her chosen path, she may find that what we need isn't always what we seek.
in bookshops & bonedust, a prequel to legends & lattes, new york times bestselling author travis baldree takes us on a journey of high fantasy, first loves, and second-hand books.
viv's career with the notorious mercenary company rackam's ravens isn't going as planned.
wounded during the hunt for a powerful necromancer, she's packed off against her will to recuperate in the sleepy beach town of murk—so far from the action that she worries she'll never be able to return to it.
what's a thwarted soldier of fortune to do?
spending her hours at a beleaguered bookshop in the company of its foul-mouthed proprietor is the last thing viv would have predicted, but it may be both exactly what she needs and the seed of changes she couldn't possibly imagine.

for fans of good omens—a queer immigrant fairytale about individual purpose, the fluid nature of identity, and the power of love to change and endure.

uriel the angel and little ash (short for ashmedai) are the only two supernatural creatures in their shtetl (which is so tiny, it doesn't have a name other than shtetl). the angel and the demon have been studying together for centuries, but pogroms and the search for a new life have drawn all the young people from their village to america. when one of those young emigrants goes missing, uriel and little ash set off to find her.

along the way the angel and demon encounter humans in need of their help, including rose cohen, whose best friend (and the love of her life) has abandoned her to marry a man, and malke shulman, whose father died mysteriously on his way to america. but there are obstacles ahead of them as difficult as what they've left behind. medical exams (and demons) at ellis island. corrupt officials, cruel mob bosses, murderers, poverty. the streets are far from paved with gold.

simon sort of says


longlisted for the national book award for young people's literature 
"funny, poignant and--most important--hopeful." --new york times 
for fans of kate dicamillo and jack gantos, a hilarious, wrenching, hopeful novel about finding your friends, healing your heart, and speaking your truth.
simon o'keeffe's biggest claim to fame should be the time his dad accidentally gave a squirrel a holy sacrament. or maybe the alpaca disaster that went viral on youtube. but the story the whole world wants to tell about simon is the one he'd do anything to forget: the one starring simon as a famous survivor of gun violence at school.
two years after the infamous event, twelve-year-old simon and his family move to the national quiet zone--the only place in america where the internet is banned. instead of talking about simon, the astronomers who flock to the area are busy listening for signs of life in space. and when simon makes a friend who's determined to give the scientists what they're looking for, he'll finally have the chance to spin a new story for the world to tell.
from award-winning author erin bow, simon sort of says is a breathtaking testament to the lasting echoes of trauma, the redemptive power of humor, and the courage it takes to move forward without forgetting the past.

when saint sebastian's school becomes the target of a shocking arson spree, the sisters of the sublime blood and their surrounding new orleans community are thrust into chaos.

an exciting start to a bold series that breathes new life into the hard-boiled genre, scorched grace is a fast-paced and punchy whodunnit that will keep readers guessing until the very end.









the facemaker


a new york times bestseller
finalist for the 2022 kirkus prize | named a best book of the year by the guardian

"enthralling. harrowing. heartbreaking. and utterly redemptive. lindsey fitzharris hit this one out of the park." —erik larson, author of the splendid and the vile

lindsey fitzharris, the award-winning author of the butchering art, presents the compelling, true story of a visionary surgeon who rebuilt the faces of the first world war’s injured heroes, and in the process ushered in the modern era of plastic surgery.

from the moment the first machine gun rang out over the western front, one thing was clear: humankind’s military technology had wildly surpassed its medical capabilities. bodies were battered, gouged, hacked, and gassed. the first world war claimed millions of lives and left millions more wounded and disfigured. in the midst of this brutality, however, there were also those who strove to alleviate suffering. the facemaker tells the extraordinary story of such an individual: the pioneering plastic surgeon harold gillies, who dedicated himself to reconstructing the burned and broken faces of the injured soldiers under his care.

gillies, a cambridge-educated new zealander, became interested in the nascent field of plastic surgery after encountering the human wreckage on the front. returning to britain, he established one of the world’s first hospitals dedicated entirely to facial reconstruction. there, gillies assembled a unique group of practitioners whose task was to rebuild what had been torn apart, to re-create what had been destroyed. at a time when losing a limb made a soldier a hero, but losing a face made him a monster to a society largely intolerant of disfigurement, gillies restored not just the faces of the wounded but also their spirits.

the facemaker places gillies’s ingenious surgical innovations alongside the dramatic stories of soldiers whose lives were wrecked and repaired. the result is a vivid account of how medicine can be an art, and of what courage and imagination can accomplish in the presence of relentless horror.









the wager


from the #1 new york times bestselling author of killers of the flower moon, a page-turning story of shipwreck, survival, and savagery, culminating in a court martial that reveals a shocking truth. with the twists and turns of a thriller grann unearths the deeper meaning of the events on the wager, showing that it was not only the captain and crew who ended up on trial, but the very idea of empire.

on january 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and cloth washed up on the coast of brazil. inside were thirty emaciated men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. they were survivors of his majesty’s ship the wager, a british vessel that had left england in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war with spain. while the wager had been chasing a spanish treasure-filled galleon known as “the prize of all the oceans,” it had wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of patagonia. the men, after being marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing 2500 miles of storm-wracked seas. they were greeted as heroes.

but then ... six months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of chile. this boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very different story. the thirty sailors who landed in brazil were not heroes – they were mutineers. the first group responded with countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior officer and his henchmen. it became clear that while stranded on the island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. as accusations of treachery and murder flew, the admiralty convened a court martial to determine who was telling the truth. the stakes were life-and-death—for whomever the court found guilty could hang.

the wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of our greatest nonfiction writers. grann’s recreation of the hidden world on a british warship rivals the work of patrick o’brian, his portrayal of the castaways’ desperate straits stands up to the classics of survival writing such as the endurance, and his account of the court martial has the savvy of a scott turow thriller. as always with grann’s work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the reader spellbound.

my name is jason. mine too.


a stunning visual autobiography of two crazy-talented besties, bestselling and award-winning author jason reynolds and painter jason griffin, who could never be who they are singularly if they weren’t who they were together.

once upon a time in america, there were two jasons. jason reynolds and jason griffin. one a poet. one an artist. one black. one white. two voices. one journey in mind: to move to new york, the city of dreams, to make their own dreams come true. willing to have a life not un-hard, so long as it wasn’t unhappy. willing to let the city swallow them whole, so long as it gives them their chance. they had each other. “what if painting was a sin, and the poetry became taboo. and no one ever clapped for me again. my question is, would you?”

they clapped. oh, they clapped. and aren’t we glad?

the eagerly anticipated second essay collection from jessi klein, author of the acclaimed new york times bestselling debut you’ll grow out of it.
“sometimes i think about how much bad news there is to tell my kid, the endlessly long, looping cvs receipt scroll of truly terrible things that have happened, and i want to get under the bed and never come out. how do we tell them about all this? can we just play billy joel’s we didn’t start the fire and then brace for questions? the first of which should be, how is this a song that played on the radio?”

written with klein’s signature candor and humanity, i'll show myself out is an incisive, moving, and often uproarious collection.
