improving birth one birth center at a time














reliably investing in community birth + meaningful partnerships 




    our vision
  



birth partners, inc is committed to increasing access to quality midwifery led health care through freestanding birth centers. midwifery led care has been proven to deliver outstanding outcomes in birth centers, and more people deserve access to that care. birth centers are an investment in community health. 






































































shared learning, mentoring + support



offering structure, experiences, and mentoring allows birth centers to focus on offering great care, while having a team behind them to help each center be organizationally sound.  we know the best midwives have a combination of passion, tenacity, and support.  we seek to bolster the folks who are already doing this important work with space and support to offer it in a way that is sustainable.

experienced + caring leadership



while each community is unique, we know there are certain aspects to birth center operations that do not need to be reinvented.  we offer kind guidance and ongoing connection so each new chapter of a birth center’s operation can be aligned with offering quality care with clients as the focus.

the birth center is a phenomenal place - both the staff and the facilities.  you receive personalized care, extremely knowledgeable staff and great outcomes.  when you walk in, the staff at the desk know your name, which sounds so simple but you feel seen and not like a number.  the facilities are so clean and calm, you’re never stressed or feeling overly sterile like a hospital.  […] i wish more pregnant people knew how special this place is! - l. kaplanbirth center of chicago client


























 i’ve delivered two children now at the birth center and i can't speak highly enough of all the staff here.  everyone is fantastic—very friendly and welcoming.  i felt very safe and cared for with both of my deliveries and also at my pre/postnatal appointments.  i was able to have a water birth in a quiet environment with supportive staff nearby.  this helped immensely with comfort and my ability to relax and enjoy the birthing process. - b. dugan  birth center of bloomington normal client


























i felt so supported by each and every midwife there, the facilities are beautiful, and we were able to have the dream birth of my second baby here.  staff was very knowledgeable, warm and open-minded. […] the great trust the midwives have in the natural birth process and women’s ability to birth instilled a deep sense of peace and trust in me for this long labour of mine and subsequent fast birth.  very professional skill levels and experience combined with the warmth and caring of a real friend.  highly recommend this facility to anyone looking around for a natural birth option. - a.komendaandaluz waterbirth center client
