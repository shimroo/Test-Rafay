james monroe iglehart brings a wonderful world to broadway


the story of jazz legend louis armstrong gets the musical treatment in a wonderful world, a biomusical co-directed by christopher renshaw, christina sajous and the show’s tony award-winning star, james monroe iglehart.
the show delves into the life of the man behind popular tunes like “what a wonderful world” and “when you’re smiling,” but the story is told by the wives that shaped his life: darlesia cearcy as lucille wilson, dionne figgins as daisy parker, kim exum as alpha smith and jennie harney-fleming as lil hardin. co-conceived by renshaw and andrew delaplaine, the musical features a book by aurin squire.
