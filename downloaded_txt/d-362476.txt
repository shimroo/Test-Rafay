“stepping into dirk’s is like taking a sunrise walk on a sandy beach.”

“best fish shop in chicago!”

cooking classes are back!view calendar herewe are soooo excited to offer cooking classes again. -terry & dirkhere is a recent review of our classes, in case you don’t know what you are missing:




“the wife and i went to our now, 3rd cooking class at dirk’s, and much like the first two, it was simply amazing. we both walked away saying the exact same thing, that at $50 a person, it felt like an absolute steal. dirk and terry within minutes are so friendly and comfortable that you truly feel like family. not only do you get to enjoy the best seafood in the city, you get a detailed demo, the delicious recipes, any and all questions answered, and the best part they fill you up with so much flavorful food that you will be talking about it for a long time. they are totally cool with bringing in any booze you might want, and the classes fit just the perfect amount of people where it’s interactive and fun as well. i highly recommend this to not only experienced foodies/chefs all the way to even just a couple looking for a great dinner. great experience all around and looking forward to our next class.”
