accounting power
your challenge

we saw that the dominance of accounting software created for small businesses caused numerous challenges for accountants, introduced tremendous inefficiencies in client accounting, and marginalized accounting firms.

payroll relief

it bothered us that while payroll service bureaus were turning payroll into a multi-billion dollar high-profit margin service, most accountants could not offer payroll services profitably.

our solution
we created the first-ever powerful processing center exclusively for accountants in the cloud that leveled the playing field for accountants. thanks to our payroll relief, today of thousands of accountants are offering highly profitable payroll services.
