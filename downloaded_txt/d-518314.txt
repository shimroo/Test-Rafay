femo seagoing expeditionsloihi seamount is an active volcano in the mid-pacific ocean where hydrothermal waters with high concentrations of reduced iron exit the oceanic crust. here iron-oxidizing bacteria carpet the rock surfaces and form massive rust coatings. the focus of the fe-oxidizing microbial observatory (femo) is to understand what the iron-oxidizing bacteria in this environment are, how fast they form these deposits, how they do it biochemically, and how they affect ocean chemistry and ecosystem function.nsf-sponsored gk12 projectscripps classroom connection (scc)the scripps classroom connection (scc) aims to systematically and simultaneously improve communication skills of earth science graduate students and k-12 education in the san diego unified school district (sdusd). these goals are relevant because earth science literacy is fundamental to the success of our society that must practice much more effective stewardship of our very fragile planet and that needs to understand how planet earth works as an integrated chemical, physical and biological system.

hands-on seminars for uploading data. see the meeting's website for more information ...iodp expedition 330 to the louisville seamount trail will drill four underwater volcanoes off the ne coast of new zealand. one hypothesis states that these volcanoes formed above a narrow plume of hot mantle rising from a position deep in the earth's mantle. for decades scientists assumed these mantle plumes remain anchored there for tens of millions years, but there is mounting evidence that mantle plumes wander in a large-scale mantle wind. this expedition aims to establish how much mantle plumes may have moved over the last 80 million years and whether the louisville hotspot moved coherently with the hawaii hotspot. visit the expedition website ... five golf-439 scientists from oregon, maine and california (and their team mascot "da microbe") are traveling to antarctica to study the "rock bottom" of the food chain in the extreme environments of mcmurdo sound. they will be based at mcmurdo station of the us antarctic program (usap) on ross island from where they will embark on trips to remote locations and field camps in the antarctic dry valleys, at cape evans, on mount erebus and in the royal society range. targets of their investigations will include moorings below the ice of lake fryxell (taylor valley), experiments below the sea-ice using scuba diving, hydrothermal vents and ice caves in the glaciers of mt. erebus, as well as seasonal creeks running through volcanic terrain that are fed by glacial melting in the short antarctic summer. visit expedition website ...new
