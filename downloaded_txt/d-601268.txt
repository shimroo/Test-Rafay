						will michelle kwan still compete?					



by jill manty








michelle kwan says she’s not completely ready to close the door on competitive skating.  i don’t know what the means exactly.  would she try for another olympics?  next year’s world championships?  i’d love to see her continue to compete, but i hope she continues to show the restraint she showed in turin and not compete unless she can be competitive.

						kimmie meissner wins worlds					



by jill manty








16 year old kimmie meissner may have finished 6th at the olympics, but she did considerably better than that at worlds, outskating fumie suguri and sasha cohen to win the gold and $45,000.  meissner was the only skater in the contest to land two triple-triple jump combos.
sasha cohen was considered the favorite but had to settle for a third place finish.
in other skating news, tanith belbin and ben agosto captured gold, and evan lysacek captured bronze.

						an apology–  paralympics					



by jill manty








i don’t know why i didn’t think of this earlier, but i just didn’t.  i should have covered the 2006 turin paralympics after the olympics.  i’m sure many of you would have been interested.  to make up for my negligence, here’s a bit of a recap.
the russian federation won the overall medal count with 33.  germany, ukraine and france finished second, third and fourth.  america finished fifth with 15 medals, including 7 golds.  the u.s. paralympic alpine team contributed eight medals.
notable medals include:
american stephani victor won gold in the downhill slalom sitting.  stephani is relatively new to paralympics.  after a double amputation in 1995, she became aware of the paralympics in 1999 and made it her goal to participate in the 2002 paralympic games.  she has been featured on many national television programs, including 20/20, the view, espn and more.
kevin bramble won gold in the downhill sitting.  kevin was paralyzed from the waist down at the age of 21 in a snowboarding accident.  in turin, he was defending the gold he won at the salt lake city paralympics in 2002.
steven cook brought home several medals, two gold and one bronze, in cross country skiing.  steven has been competing in the paralympics since 1998.  he lost his right leg below the knee in a 1988 farm accident.
here’s to all the athletes, from america and the rest of the world who participated in the 2006 paralympic games.

						evgeny plushenko to go pro					



by jill manty








russians are disappointed that their golden boy, evgeny plushenko, is leaving amateur skating at the tender age of 23.  they had hoped he would continue to compete through at least the 2012 vancouver olympics.  plushenko was very upfront about why he is going pro, saying, “iâ€™m tired of skating for the benefit of the state… i have a family to support.”

						shaun white finally gets to meet sasha cohen					



by jill manty








shaun white met the olympian he most wanted to meet–  sasha cohen–  at a victory party for him last week.  they hung out again at a post-oscar party.  but they’re just friends, so no one get any funny ideas.
