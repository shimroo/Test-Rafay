west virginia land trust - we protect special places...
a special place is more than land and water. a special place takes you to a time and to a memory, it brings you peace, and feels like “home.” a farmer’s special place may be his field, a wildlife watcher’s place is in the forest, a sportsman’s may be a remote stretch of woods, a hiker’s an entire expanse of mountains, and a child’s a field of green where he can run and play or a creek to explore.

land conservation takes experience, passion, creativity, dedication... and you!
protecting land is something that everyone can do. whether you’re interested in placing a conservation easement on your family’s land to protect it for future generations, saving a historic landscape, protecting land bordering our drinking water, turning an abandoned city parking lot into a park or garden, or just wanting to get outside and do some trail work, the west virginia land trust has the resources to make things happen. there’s more than one way to protect west virginia’s landscapes—share your ideas with us today!
