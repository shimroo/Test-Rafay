 abraham lincoln once said
(ca. 1838) “from whence shall we expect the approach of danger? shall
some trans-atlantic military giant step the earth and crush us at a
blow? never. all the armies of europe and asia...could not by force
take a drink from the ohio river or make a track on the blue ridge in
the trial of a thousand years. no, if destruction be our lot we must
ourselves be its author and finisher. as a nation of free men we will
live forever or die by suicide.” historical articles & indices

bryant
family appears in
berrien county, michigan









 
harry bryant
ca. 1905


  the bryant
family appears in berrien
county, michigan about the year 1850. born in vermont about 1799,
george h. w. bryant lived for quite some
time in st.
lawrence county, in the northern part of new york state near the
canadian border. george
served in
the war of 1812 when he was 14 years old. conklin
and campbell families are covered here as
well. the meredith
/ griffin and harrison / ball
lines have
recently been extended...

  my paternal grandfather
was harry f. bryant. private wooster c. bryant
was harry's grandfather and served in the civil war in an outfit known
as birges western
sharpshooters.
you may view a family group sheet of wooster's
family. to see a visual representation of
harry bryant's
ancestry, see my
father's pedigree.
my grandfather, harry's
ahnentafel
gives the most detail. here is a great picture
of harry as a boy.
now available: van buren county

1837-1919
mystery photo
solved?


  my paternal grandmother was e. marie townsend.
she has a very significant new england ancestry in both her parents'
lines. her father was eugene martin townsend.
his
immigrant ancestor, martin townsend,
arrived in
massachusetts bay colony about 1664. martin's mother was susan chapman.
her ancestry traces to some of the original settlers (1635/36) of
connecticut. for an overview, look first at susan chapman's
pedigree.
the ahnentafel
starts with eugene townsend.



"timothy townsen" gravestone in flatbrook cemetery, columbia county,
ny. the cemetery is located on the east side of highway 22, two miles
north of i-90, exit 83, near canaan in columbia county, new york. the
gravesite is in the front area of flat brook cemetery.

howard taft is a fifth
cousin of carrie holbrook. 
he was the

marie townsend's
mother was carrie holbrook.
these new england lines, mostly from massachusetts and rhode island,
are covered in the bryant pedigree
(follow holbrook link) and the holbrook
ahnentafel
chart.   both townsends and holbrooks made their
appearance in ionia and montcalm counties before 1860.


some of the families of
massachusetts are: morse, pond, cook, trask, hill
and others.
some of the rhode island lines include: scott, jenckes,
aldrich.
many of these families lived near the "corner border" between ri
&
ma in the blackstone river valley.

invade west michigan

   my mother
is a  swede through and through. all
four of her grandparents were born in sweden and immigrated to west
michigan in the late 1800's. her pedigree
gives five generations. view the ahnentafel
for more detail and more generations. prepare for a lot of "dotters"
and "sons." some of the main surnames are carlson,
ahlberg,
alin (allen), and olson.
