	 rip tom....
	 
    




tom was the gatekeeper to the skyboxes for many seasons at dodd.  i always chatted up a couple of times during a game. a warm and friendly man with a great smile and laugh; he will be missed by many.
picture was taken on august 21, 2009. my prayers and thoughts are with his family.

	 tigers beat cyclones 1-0 tonight...
	 
    


at dodd.  connecticut starter hua-wei lo (pictured) made his new york penn league debut an impressive one for the tigers going 6 ip and allowing just 3 hits and striking out 6.  relievers hunter scantling, efrain nieves and matt davenport (sv1) each threw an inning to complete the 4 hit shutout.
connecticut scored the only run of the game with 2 outs in the third inning.  a brett harrison single was followed by a booming rbi double by jake stewart (2 for 4).

misc fan notes:  danry vasquez made an outstanding running catch in deep left center to preverse ct's 1-0 lead.




get well andy baylock!  the retired former uconn baseball coach of 24 years , who still throws bp at dodd, is on the dl but expected to make a swift recovery.  should be seeing him before the end of the season!

misc fan notes from last nights 10-5 loss:  

good crowd on hand--announced attendance of 3700+

burger shack on the right field concourse has an interesting looking menu; going to have sample the wares down there.

red sox fans of a certain age will recall catcher rich gedman--his son matt plays for the spinners.

great minor league baseball name--mookie betts--plays for the spinners

hate to get this last name on the back of a jersey--"schwindenhammer" as in seth who hit a three run bomb for lowell last night.

ct tiger player to watch--of danry vasquez

great to be back!  tigers take it on the chin tonight losing 10-2 when i left in the 7th inning. great to see tom, bob, ground keeping wizard bryan barkley and vp eric knighton.

the field looks great especially given the 44 college and high school games already played on it and in addition to the recent relay for life event. tigers front office doing a great job extending to the community!

	 great stuff from 1995!!!
	 
    


a sunday afternoon game as evidenced by the navs wearing their sunday only caps and uniform vests. i actually own a couple of things worn in this game: rf troy hughes cap and catcher tom wilson's vest. a great look at dodd brand new! check out how high the walls used to be!

	 despite rumors, tigers are staying at dodd stadium
	 



despite rumors, tigers are staying at dodd stadiumnice reporting by joe...in another round of minor league musical chairs it seems the  fishercats will become a twins farm team, the new ottawa franchise a blue jays farm team, the rockcats a mets team and welcome to the new-york penn league to the good folks in binghamton.  got all that?...there is a quiz later.  also someone on wfan doesn't know the difference betweeen norwich and new britain...in other news the connecticut tigers will be playing their sunday home games at 4:00 this coming season instead of the 1:00 starts they've had their first two seasons.  there is some sort of nypl "tradition" that seems to govern that late afternoon sunday starting time.  navs tried that for a season back in the day and it didn't work.....pitchers and catchers as mlbb camps are starting to open!!!

	 good luck andrew!
	 
    


from the new london day:"norwich – the connecticut tigers announced today that general manager andrew weber will step down at the end of this month, and vice president of operations c.j. knudsen will replace weber as vice president and general manager.weber has been with the team for four years, and led the effort to move to norwich at the start of the 2010 baseball season. the late move that spring hurt the ability to sell tickets and sponsorships, but this summer, the tigers ranked fourth in the nation in all levels of minor league baseball in improved attendance.weber called it a "tough and bittersweet decision," but felt it was time to move on and seek a new position in baseball."i do want to stay in baseball," weber said. "we'll see what opportunities come my way. it has been an absolute pleasure here. the last two years have been great here. i know that with our staff, it's going to be awesome and will continue to grow."knudsen joined the tigers with the team's move to norwich after having spent 10 years as general manager of the vermont lake monsters in the new york-penn league. he has worked for 17 years in the league in which the tigers play.eric knighton has been promoted to vice president and assistant general manager."

	 this week's topic:  is johnny damon a hofer?
	 
    


this discussion came up a couple of times on yes yankee telecasts with no clear consensus. his regular season stats are:17 seasons with six teams. 231 hrs, 1120 rbis, 404 sbs, ba .286 and 2723 hits.assuming he get 3000 hits, which seems to be a threshold for induction, is his ticket punched for cooperstown?my guess is yes but i don't "think" of him as a hofer but rather a "good" player who compiled goods stats over a long career. does the same then apply to jim thome or do we view someone with over 600 hrs differently? oddly with thome and the absence of any steroids use in his past the answer for me is yes and his ticket is punched.
