wisconsin county forests association
in 1968, the wisconsin county forests association, inc. (wcfa) was established to provide support to the growing county forest program and acts as a collaborative platform for members to discuss issues, programs, and policies of the county forests. instead of each individual county dealing with issues on their own, wcfa acts as the single point of contact for its members. wcfa is a not-for-profit, quasi-government organization whose membership is made up of the 30 counties in wisconsin with lands enrolled in §28.11.
