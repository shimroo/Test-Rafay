historic
      columbus indiana  has been online since march, 2002. the mission of this
      site is to
 
provide
          a comprehensive look at columbus indiana history for educational
          and entertainment purposes via the internet
 
ensure
          that the history of columbus indiana is available to the general
          public through this online library and museum
historic columbus indiana strives to provide the best, all-encompassing
      look at life in columbus indiana through its online resources. columbus
      high school yearbooks and logs, dating back to 1916, can be found here,
      complete with graduating seniors and faculty photos. how we dressed, what
      sports we participated in, and where we hung out, are only a few of the
      images that capture life in columbus indiana throughout the generations.
      the yearbooks also provide a wonderful means to help those interested in
      genealogical research.  postcards as early as 1901 depict what
      columbus indiana once looked like, and provides a pictorial history of the
      changes the city has undergone.
 a look at columbus indiana businesses from 1962 is highlighted, thanks to
      the 1962 columbus indiana phone book. columbus indiana businesses in
      1914-1915 also looks at the columbus indiana business community. the schwartzkopf opera hall, a history of the crump theatre, the columbus
      drive in, and cummins bookstore history will possibly rekindle memories of
      what columbus indiana used to be.
 
columbus indiana has witnessed its greatest changes in the last 33 years.
      the commons, mill race park, the post office, fair oaks mall, railroad
      tracks which once ran through the city now rerouted, and a myriad of new
      shopping centers and movie complexes, have changed the way we live, work,
      and do business in the city. the downtown face has changed dramatically,
      and many of the photos on this site stand as a historical record of those
      changes.
 
the people of columbus indiana. that's really what this website is all
      about. whether you went to school here, built a building, sat around
      wondering what to do, mowed your lawn, built a mighty railroad, or wrote
      out a lovely song*: this is your life...
 
historic columbus indiana is not associated or affiliated with the
      bartholomew county historical society. i rely solely upon your financial
      support to keep this site growing.
  if
      you would like to write a historical piece for this website, you are
      encouraged to submit your ideas.
 
thanks for stopping by, and be sure to bookmark this site...
