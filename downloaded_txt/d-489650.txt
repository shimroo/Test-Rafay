about us


 




    a welcoming and affirming congregation
 
as followers of christ, we strive to be an inclusive and affirming congregation. everyone is welcome to participate fully in our community life, regardless of race or ethnicity, national origin, citizenship, age, political views, education, physical ability, economic or employment situation, relationship status, gender expression, sexual orientation, or any other markers of identity people sometimes use to create division. all are invited to receive holy communion. as st. paul wrote in the letter to the romans, “nothing can separate us from the love of god.”we are delighted to welcome you for worship!
