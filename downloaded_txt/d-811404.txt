our purpose













mercyfirst is a not-for-profit human and social service agency that has been serving children and families in need since we were founded by the sisters of mercy/hermanas de la misericordia in 1894 . today, as a ministry of the sisters of mercy, our agency continues to address the emotional and physical needs of children and families in new york city (brooklyn, queens and staten island) and across long island through innovative treatments and life-changing interventions. we provide community-based prevention and family foster care services, group homes in the community for struggling children and families within the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, and short-term residential services for unaccompanied migrant children.  every day mercyfirst helps at-risk individuals overcome enormous obstacles and re-imagine their futures.
