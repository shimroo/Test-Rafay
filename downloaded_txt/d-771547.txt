   client testimonials 



   



       
  “myc’s team work, efficiency, reliability and competency for these projects made each project a success.”
rick fanning, supervisor, king soopers, city market building
  





 
  “mark young construction has been excellent to work with from project inception to the final punch list. their varied project experience has allowed them to be very helpful in formulating early project cost estimates working only from preliminary schematic drawings lacking detailed information. their attention to architectural details and concern for producing a quality product makes mark young construction a capable asset to any project.”
mick mitchell, aia, principal, mitchell plus associates
  





 
  “it has been one of the most organized projects i have ever worked on… myc managed to work around the weather difficulties and arrange schedules to be able to work through the worst of it…it was a pleasure to work with such an excellent team.”
sandy fischer, director of business services, south dakota school of mines and technology, paleontology 
  





 
  "our experience with myc has been very positive. they have a complete understanding and appreciation of the design intent, excellent workmanship, and take a collaborative approach to the construction administration process.”
kevin campbell, north studio director, hc klover architect, the shops at walnut creek
  





 
  "the on-site staff was exceptional – when faced with the challenge of a non-contractor caused flood, filling the subbasement with over 18” of water, myc staff jumped in to help, diagnose, mitigate, and address the unforeseen challenge as a team. all dps incident responders gave compliments to the on-site myc staff for taking swift action and assisting the clean-up efforts. the delay to the project delivery due to this flood, causing loss of elevator use, was minimal. the ability to recover and adapt to unforeseeable challenges with a positive attitude was invaluable. in the end, there was no impact to student return; myc staff understood the importance of meeting the district’s educational needs and worked diligently to ensure success."
renee verspoor, project manager, denver public schools project 2202 a lincoln hs and schmitt es

  “the durrell center is a magnificent transformation from what was recently perceived as timeworn to innovative. students and visitors enjoy restaurant-quality dining experiences and have an engaged sense of being connected on our academic campus while enjoying views of the rocky mountains. the soul and energy, ‘spirit felt’ of durrell center is infused with new life for decades to come.”
richard pott, facility planner, csu

  “i wanted to express my personal thanks for the extra effort of your personnel at the king soopers greeley re-model…it took not only your superintendent’s pride and commitment, but the commitment of the entire crew. i am sure it is part of your company standard to satisfy the customer, but we all know you can’t make our employees do it with such good nature and enthusiasm.”
bonnie hammond, deli director

  every week, myc was prepared for meetings, the job site was clean and safety was a top priority for all employees working on the project. the project was finished two months ahead of schedule. despite weather, myc consistently worked hard to drive the schedule without sacrificing quality. it was a pleasure working with myc and i would recommend their services.
brian peterson, project manager, town of castle rock
  





 
  the project teams we worked with had excellent communication skills, keeping regency centers aware of key issues and out tenants informed of project schedules and impacts. mark young personnel always responded in a timely manner. issues and challenges were met with recommendations of innovative yet practical solutions that were responsive to budget, quality, safety, and schedule parameters. i found myc personnel in all cases to be easy to work with, passionate about quality, safety, and customer service.
thomas metzger, senior manager, development & construction, regency centers
