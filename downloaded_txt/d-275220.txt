presenting sponsor
the global down syndrome foundation is a public non-profit 501(c)(3) dedicated to significantly improving the lives of people with down syndrome through research, medical care, education and advocacy. formally established in 2009, global’s primary focus is to support the linda crnic institute for down syndrome, the first academic home in the united states committed solely to research and medical care for people with down syndrome. since down syndrome is the least-funded genetic condition in the united states, fundraising and government advocacy to correct the alarming disparity of national funding for people with down syndrome is a major goal.
the global down syndrome foundation created and organizes the be beautiful be yourself fashion show – the single-largest annual fundraiser benefiting people with down syndrome. global organizes and funds many programs, conferences and grants, including dare to play football camp with ed mccaffrey, denver broncos cheerleaders dare to cheer camp, and the global down syndrome foundation educational grants.
global is an inclusive organization without political or religious affiliation or intention.

kids camp sponsor

nobody knows babies and children better than mom and dad, so we asked parents what’s most important when choosing diapers, training pants, and youth pants. we learned that parents want absorbent products that prevent leaks, materials that are soft and gentle on skin, a snug fit at every stage of growth, and a natural fit to increase comfort. comfees was developed to address these important needs.


we offer traditional diapers, pull-on style training pants in boys and girls designs, and discreet pull-on youth pants for extra protection. our diapers go as small as size newborn and our largest pull-on youth pant covers kids up to 125+ lbs. we’ve developed our different product types to focus on what’s most important to kids at each stage in life. our diapers have extra-strength fasteners and are free from harsh chemicals. our training pants have a wetness indicator and tear-away sides to help with potty training. our youth pants are extra soft and designed to be worn either at night or discreetly under clothing.
