nabob  equity & equality 



the representation of black-owned stations falls far short of an acceptable standard. despite african americans constituting 13% of the american population, we possess fewer than 180 of the over 11,000 commercial radio stations in the u.s., accounting for only 1.6%.additionally, we own a mere 25 out of 1,374 full-power television stations, which is merely 1.8%. this alarming disparity in ownership means that we lack the necessary platform to effectively voice our concerns or have them addressed by our leaders.
