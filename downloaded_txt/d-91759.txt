hear what our parents are saying...
increased academic independence and improved academic successthe craig school’s dynamic educational program, small class size and comprehensive support systems give students the specific learning strategies and program accommodations that allows for greater self-understanding, increased academic independence and improved academic success.
our sixth grader couldn’t be more happy, confident or secure…we are half way through our first year at craig school and our sixth grader couldn’t be more happy, confident or secure. she has expressed that she feels understood and that craig school was made for her. there is no greater joy as a parent than to see your child thrive rather than see them shrink in the shadows of their teachers and peers. we are excited to see her greatness continue to unfold.
the craig school has changed evan’s life, we cannot thank you enough…the craig school has changed evan’s life, we cannot thank you enough…each one of your teachers are fabulous! i think you know who our favorites are!!
