child exploitation with the children’s society

            in our second webinar focused on the topic of child exploitation, rosie plummer from the children’s society’s prevention programme will provide a brief recap of what child exploitation is, then delve into some interactive case studies. these true-to-life scenarios will examine what exploitation may look like for children of different ages, genders and backgrounds.

rosie will be joined by christopher goard jp. christopher has been a magistrate for 17 years and has completed a doctorate about how to identify child and adult victims of all forms of modern slavery. christopher will use his research and experiences as a magistrate to outline the factors that influence modern slavery and share some common defendant characteristics to help magistrates identify victims in the courtroom. this partnership will give magistrates an insight into the experiences of both child and adult victims of exploitation.

pregnancy in prison

            janey and sam from level up will join us to talk about their campaigning work with pregnant women and mothers with infants in prison.
after the deaths of two babies inside women’s prisons in recent years, the nhs and prison ombudsman have ruled all pregnancies in prison as “high-risk” and the royal college of midwives have said prison is no place for a pregnant woman. 

this webinar will cover the first-hand experience of a woman who was in custody during her pregnancy and early part of her child’s life and offer guidance to magistrates about how to approach sentencing pregnant women.

what our community says

i didn't hesitate to join the ma because i wanted to be part of a group of like-minded individuals who strive for equality and justice every day. being a member has not only enhanced my skills as a magistrate, but has also given me the confidence to promote the magistracy to a wide range of individuals in my community—and to encourage people like me to apply. i'm very proud to be an active member of the ma.
