    our favorite reviews



     


“we have used key sailing 3 times this summer. the entire family highly recommends key sailing. the staff are all very knowledgeable and explain everything in detail.  so much fun, and worth every penny!!!”﻿  - michael

   


“we rented a pontoon with our family. we were a few minutes late showing up but the staff was easygoing, friendly and helpful. the boat was very well kept and we were given a thorough walkthrough before leaving.”﻿  - elisabeth

   


“nice family-owned business with a cajun restaurant on top, i had a great time on the jet skis and no problem renting one like i did at big lagoon water sports. i’d definitely recommend this place if you want to have the best time even saw dolphins out on the water !!!”   - maddison



    don't forget your
boater's license!

planning to operate a jet ski or boat yourself? each operator behind the wheel will be required to show a valid government id and has to be 16 to drive and 18 to rent. anyone born after 01/01/1988 will need to show proof of a boaters license. don’t have one? no problem! you can obtain a temporary boater’s license online by clicking the button below. quick, easy & hassle free! or take a test at one of our locations when you there!
