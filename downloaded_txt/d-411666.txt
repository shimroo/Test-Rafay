our storyour christian faith inspires us to work toward liberation in the world. recently, we have focused this work on addressing the abuse of power from a former co-founding pastor of our church. reports of his sexual abuse came to light during recent churchwide conversations about our identity and history. we believe the stories of our survivors and we requested that our local presbyterian governing body investigate further. the results of those findings were received on monday, may 20, 2024, and we are satisfied by the recommendations that were made and approved. with the truth more fully revealed, we must clearly proclaim that this person’s behavior constituted pastoral, sexual, and spiritual abuse and caused immense harm to us individually and collectively.it is our continued commitment to centering the experience and needs of the survivors that compels us to remain fully open to hearing and stating their truth, even when it is difficult. we believe that this is the only way to heal as a congregation. our mission and core values include providing a safe and inclusive space, especially to those who have traditionally been excluded from full participation and celebration in christian communities, clearly understanding that core components of safety must include strong pastoral boundaries and accountability. we continue to invite individuals to come as they are, show up with authenticity, and bring their questions, quirks, and gifts. we look forward to others joining us as we creatively worship, work to dismantle oppression, and create a space where everyone can be their authentic selves. you (and your tears, your smile lines, your worries, and your dreams) are welcome at ccc.our response to mid-kentucky presbytery’s administrative commission report:accountability: we take pastoral sexual abuse seriously and are devastated by the harm caused. our congregation stands firmly against any abuse of power. we requested and have fully cooperated with the investigation, and the report issued provides clarity on the situation.leadership transition: over the past decade, we have been blessed with outstanding pastoral leadership. our current leadership team is committed to maintaining appropriate boundaries, fostering trust, ensuring transparency, and learning from the experiences of those harmed.healing and reconciliation: we recognize that wounds run deep. we have contracted with into account, a survivor-led organization providing support for survivors & allies seeking justice, accountability, & recovery in christian contexts. they are available to offer support and advocacy to any survivors of this former pastor's spiritual, sexual, and emotional abuse, and will hold your experiences in confidence. you can contact them at skrehbiel@intoaccount.org. our pastor is also available for support.transparency: moving forward, we commit to transparency. we keep our congregation informed about any developments related to this situation. our leaders are and will continue to be trained to prevent future abuses of power.renewed vision: our vision remains unwavering: to be a beacon of love, acceptance, and justice. we will continue to advocate for lgbtqia+ rights, social justice, and equality within our congregation and beyond.if there are further questions about this investigation and report, and/or you would like to share your story of abuse, we encourage you to reach out to the stated clerk of the presbytery of mid-kentucky, rev. jerry vanmarter. (jerry@midkentuckypresbytery.org).
