                            welcome to st albans school
                                                    

                            st albans school is no one-dimensional academic hothouse, but rather a multi-dimensional institution where academic excellence, intellectual development and strong pastoral care lie at the core of an exceptional holistic education, enabling us to identify and nurture each pupil’s potential. 
                        


                                headmaster's welcome
