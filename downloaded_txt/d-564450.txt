♦ first i want to start by saying i am not a big reviewer. after my experience with montgomery appraisal i felt the need to tell anyone wanting someone to come to your and appraise your house in a professional manner, these are the guys. i live in saratoga and heard from a friend of a friend about these two well-known brothers in the business. their office is in willow glen but they appraise the entire bay area. initially met them through a refinance. i think his name was ted montgomery. this was about one year ago. i kept his card, which i am glad i did. i had to have 3 homes appraised for our family estate. i met the other brother john and he was just as professional as the first brother ted. the value of the homes were right where we expected. they were very interested in what we had to say about our home ie; improvements, update etc.anne d. august 2014
  





 
  
♦ saved me!montgomery appraisal was so helpful i now use them for every appraisal and refer everyone who asks to them! they have a full office staff who was friendly and so accommodating. i needed a super quick appraisal on a very complex property and they met the challenge without batting an eye...or raising their price! i was so happy with their service i have become a regular and faithful client!real estate agent august 2007
