after almost three decades of marriage, spent in the harrowing embrace of barrenness, and with three husbands, 52-year-old alhaja owolabi kareem against all odds and human expectations not only got pregnant but also gave birth to a bouncing baby girl.

for the couple, alhaji and alhaja owolabi kareem of ajah in the eti osa local government area lagos state, november 26, 2010, will forever be remembered as a day of celebration of miracles.

it was the day on which the 52-year-old alhaja owolabi kareem put to bed a bouncing baby girl. it was the first in her life.

like most women of her age, alhaja ajah as she is fondly called by her fellow members at the saints gospel church of christ hand of fire, ago along igando-ikotun road, lagos had entered menopause. some derisively call it meno-stop!

after being married for about 30 years and with no fruit to show for her conjugal labor, she had lost all hopes of ever having a baby but for her newfound faith.

five years earlier, the 52-year-old businesswoman had been introduced to a new faith by a friend who had watched as she struggled desperately and in despair but in vain for a child.

prior to this, it had been one long struggle filled with anguish, fears, tears, humiliation and even desperation.

according to alhaja, she had visited all known hospitals and medical practitioners both orthodox and unconventional, local and foreign all to no avail.

it was after she had reached menopause and lost hope, she decided to heed her friend's advice of seeking further spiritual help at a particular worship center where she worships currently.

the infertility cure

the infertility cure: the ancient chinese wellness program for getting pregnant and having healthy babies
by randine lewis

-- infertility affects one out of six couples today.

dr. lewis presents a groundbreaking alternative approach to infertility, explaining how she used traditional chinese medicine to treat her own infertility, successfully conceiving and giving birth to two children.

in lewis's experience, women who have undergone three to six months of the dietary changes, herbs and acupuncture treatments become pregnant with no further effort.

lewis intersperses her somewhat technical examination of the program with anecdotes about her patients, weaving in discussions on diet, herbal supplements, acupuncture, older women and problems related to infertility.

i was still in my 20s (29 years old), when i duly brought forth my son charlie, now 23 years old.

two years and three months after my first baby - and by now in my early 30s - i gave birth to alice, who will be 21 years old this month.

soon after this, my marriage broke down, and i settled into almost a decade of raising my small family as a single parent.

and then, shortly before my 44th birthday, my second husband and i celebrated the arrival of isabel, who has just turned nine years old.

i am, in spite of my mother's misgivings, the proud mother of three children, each born in a different decade of my life.

is your body baby-friendly?

is your body baby-friendly?
 how unexplained infertility, miscarriage and ivf failure can be explained and treated with immunotherapy
by alan e. beer, julia kantecki, jane reed

-- a unique bookâ€”the first of its kind. no longer do patients have to accept their infertility is just bad luck and they just have to keep on trying.

no longer should women with recurrent miscarriages have to listen to their doctor telling them that their loss was god's will or that they ought to be thankful because their baby was probably chromosomal-ly abnormal.

the statistics simply do not support such claims â€” in fact, they show repeated reproductive failure can be a symptom of wider health problems in the mother.

furthermore, the root cause can be treated â€” not only to promote the chances of a successful pregnancy but to improve the mother's health long-term.

april 2, 2012 - you may know rachel dratch as debbie downer from her stint on saturday night live or for her cameos on 30 rock... 

but the 46-year-old comedian has more stories to tell than the standard ex-snl-er's behind-the-scenes yarns.

there was this crazy twist that happened in my life, and i thought maybe i should start writing about this, she says.

dratch, at 43 years old, after having given up on the idea of being married with kids someday, unexpectedly got pregnant and decided to make that midlife miracle, as she calls it, the centerpiece of her book.

girl walks into a bar

girl walks into a bar...: comedy calamities, dating disasters, and a midlife miracle
by rachel dratch

-- her career at a low point, rachel dratch suddenly had time for yoga, dog-sitting, learning spanish - and dating. after all, what did a forty-something single woman living in new york have to lose?

resigned to childlessness but still hoping for romance, dratch was out for drinks with a friend when she met john.

handsome and funny, after only six months of dating long-distance, he became the inadvertent father of her wholly unplanned, undreamed-of child, and moved to new york to be a dad.

with riotous humor, dratch recounts breaking the news to her bewildered parents, the awe of her single friends, and the awkwardness of a baby-care class where the instructor kept tossing out the f-word.

filled with great behind-the-scenes anecdotes from dratch's time on snl, girl walks into a bar is a refreshing version of the happily ever after story that proves female comics - like bestsellers tina fey and chelsea handler - are truly having their moment.

the sparta woman gave birth friday to a boy and became the oldest woman to deliver at franciscan skemp medical center - without the aid of fertility treatment.

at the age of 53, debbie hughes imagined the only babies she would be looking after would be her granddaughters.

the intense debate surrounding a very touchy subject.

in a fascinating article that recently appeared in new york magazine, writer lisa miller outlines and ultimately defends the current boom of men and women becoming parents at age 50 and beyond.

the article begins with an anecdote - a couple meets and falls in love when she's 47 years old, and he's 54 years old. 

through a donor egg and her husband's sperm, the woman gives birth to her first daughter at age 50.

two years later, she attempts to get pregnant again. 

this time, she has to be brought out of menopause with hormones before she is able to become pregnant. 

shortly thereafter, she gives birth to her second daughter.

this anecdote is only one of many, and they're on the rise. birth rates among women ages 45 to 49 have risen 17% in just the past three years alone. reproductive technology, of course, accounts for this sharp increase.

i was quite a determined person, i'd met my husband and thought 'i really want to have a family with this man', juliet said.
