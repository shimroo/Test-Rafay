this man was a highly trained military doctor. if you want to complain and have your hand held, you might want to see a different doctor. if you want a skilled, efficient, professional doctor, this is your man. most efficient x-ray and office visits i have ever experienced. he answers your questions and gets his job done. his job is your health. i was extremely fortunate to have him treat me in an emergency and beyond.

went in early was nicely greeted. the large facility was easy to maneuver through and very nice and clean. they were prompt on getting me into the office at appointment time. dr krause was very friendly and efficient. all the lady’s from the staff were friendly and socialized so that made my visit even more pleasant. i will have no problem going back if needed and would go there or take my active children there if i resided in the area. thanks for the great service.

oh my dr gornet is awesome!! he took the time to address all my pain. everyone was really helpful and knowledgeable. got me in, answer all questions.  if i had a question.  i called most of the time the person answering the phone  could answer my questions! when not sometimes had to call back again. but with how busy and smooth their offices run. if they have problems they don’t show it. all i can say is thank you

there are not enough words in the dictionary or google to describe the joy in my heart, and to explain how my life has changed. dr. gornet saved my life.
i followed his instructions on what i needed to do to be relieved from chronic pain. when dr. gornet told me that he could fix me, he did.
team gornet goes beyond bedside manner, the genuine care and comfort that you receive is beyond what i expected.
prior to being under his care i was overweight, depressed, and in chronic pain. one year later and 53lbs lighter lifeisgood. i am now pain free and i am running around playing with my grandsons.
when god puts you in the care of one of his soldiers, the battle won’t be easy, but it is already won.
the most graceful experience that i had with dr. gornet was when he took my hands and we had prayer right before going to surgery, i had no worries.
team gornet thank you
dr. allyson, dr. nate and heather

dr pinn was amazing! i had a slap tear repair in my left shoulder and recovery could not have gone better! no pain as i left the doctors office and while i know that may not be everyone’s experience, mine was fantastic. i really feel like dr. pinn and his team gave me the best possible surgery, and now, just shy of three months post-op, i’m fully back to my normal day to day activities!
