every day, families facing unimaginable loss struggle to find hope in the midst of darkness. we are grateful to announce the treasures in darkness outreach, where we offer comfort and encouragement by providing grieving families with a gift of hope — thoughtful care packages filled with items to uplift, support, and show them they’re not alone. click to learn more…















how will you respond when suffering invades your life?  are you prepared?



markinc (making abundant riches known in the name of christ) desires to come alongside others, who are hurting, to offer help and hope. while the roots of this ministry were started in a painful, broken place, there has been tremendous beauty that has resulted in the help and hope that has been shared with millions of people around the world.beauty from brokeness: chuck and sharon betters’ world was turned upside down when they received the dreaded phone call that their 16 year old son, mark and his friend kelly were killed in a tragic car accident. they didn’t know if their hearts would keep beating, but god held them tightly in his grip. often their encouragement came from others who were willing to help by stepping into the darkness and reminding them that god is sovereign and you can trust him.that was the beginning of markinc, an acronym for “making abundant riches known in the name of christ” in honor of their son. the desire of this non-profit is to come alongside others who are hurting just as people further down the road in their grief journey had done for them. while the roots of this ministry were started in a painful, broken place, there has been tremendous beauty that has resulted in the help and hope that has been shared with millions of people around the world.
