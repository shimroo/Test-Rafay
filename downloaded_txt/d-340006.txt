confederate veterans are u.s. veterans!







confederate veterans are u.s. veterans!

according to an act of congress, 1958, all confederate veterans are united states veterans. 



since 1929, the united states government has been erecting headstones for confederate soldiers and officially recognizes confederate grave sites as united states war dead grave sites.



for the record: confederate soldiers, sailors, and marines who fought in the american civil war were made u.s. veterans by an act of congress in in 1957, u.s. public law 85-425, sec 410, approved 23 may, 1958. this made all confederate army/ navy/ marine veterans equal to u.s. veterans. additionally, under u.s. public law 810, approved by the 17th congress on 26 february 1929 the war department was directed to erect headstones and recognize confederate grave sites as u.s. war dead grave sites. just for the record the last confederate veteran died in 1958. so, in essence, when a person, organization, or government agency removes a confederate statue, monument or headstone, they are in fact, removing a statue, monument or headstone of a united states military veteran.





public law 85-425



the fathers and grandfathers of confederate soldiers had fought and died in both the american revolution and the war of 1812, helping to preserve the united states of america. since the end of the civil war and the defeat of the confederacy, descendants of confederate soldiers have supported and volunteered to fight in all the wars of the united states since that time, many with great distinction and many more paid the ultimate price for their sacrifice to their country.

confederate war horse memorials dishonored








in the dead of an august night this past summer, baltimore officials unceremoniously removed from wyman park, near johns hopkins university, a magnificent equestrian statue of thomas jonathan "stonewall" jackson, and robert e. lee. the monument was a gift from a local citizen and its 1948 installation had been delayed for twenty years due to the great depression and world war ii. maryland was a border state during the civil war; maryland was a slave state that did not secede from the union. 


however ... there is an untold story here. that story is when the statue was ripped from its mountings, two magnificent war horses, traveller and little sorrel, were also dumped as dishonored rubbish. equestrian statues standing in american parks were meant to honor all war horses that served faithfully--and suffered mightily--during the american civil war. indeed, civilized people should remember these noble animals, especially as ignorant voices of today clamor to destroy them because they carry a warrior rider of the losing side. once destroyed, these war horse monuments will be forever banished from our view, as never again will americans ever erect equestrian statues.

status of mlk's dream, 2017?





senator kamala harris celebrated for being the first woman, first non-white woman, first hindu american, first jamaican american, first asian american, first indian american, first african american, first biracial woman!
"i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." - martin luther king, jr., 28 august 1963, at the lincoln memorial, washington d.c.

fast forward from 1963, to over half a century later, when we read the wikipedia biography of a multi-ethnic, multi-racial, female united states senator from california, kamala harris:

"harris was elected california's attorney general in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. harris was the first woman, the first jamaican american, the first asian american, the first indian american, and the first african american attorney general in california.

on november 8, 2016, she defeated loretta sanchez in the 2016 u.s. senate election ... becoming the first indian american, and one of the first biracial women (alongside tammy duckworth and catherine cortez masto) elected to serve in the united states senate."

a multitude of "biracial" persons have been born on american soil since the 1615 birth of thomas rolfe, son of american indian princess pocahontas and her english husband john rolfe. the "biracial" thomas rolfe became an officer of the colony of virginia in the early 1600s, causing one to ponder, over 400 years later, why being born "biracial" is heralded and celebrated amongst elected candidates to public office in a democratic republic in the year 2017. we still await the dream of martin luther king jr. to come to fruition in america where someday, sometime, people will be judged by the "content of their character" rather than the color of their skin.

make dancing monkeys great again






donald trump uses a template for his speeches. we label the speech:

"make dancing monkeys great again"

"donald, have you ever made monkeys dance?"

"indeed i have and let me tell you i've made so many monkeys dance. i'm the greatest monkey dancer ever known."

"in fact, i've got politicians in washington who are my own dancing monkeys. and you know what? when i become president, i am going to throw out all the other monkeys, the dumbest monkeys, the low-energy monkeys, the lying monkeys, the bad and terrible ones, the ugly, the chokers, the little monkeys, the big-eared monkeys. the only monkeys left in washington dc will be trump's dancing monkeys."

"and everyone will love my dancing monkeys. everyone will say that trump's dancing monkeys are the most beautiful monkeys of all."

"and you know what else? mexico is gonna pay for all my dancing monkeys. mexico will pay to capture them, to train them, to feed them, to clothe them, to house them. and it will be a beautiful thing - the dancing monkeys. the people will say 'omg this trump man is making dancing monkeys great again, and mexico is footing the bill.'"


"not everything you see is what it appears to be."

make donald drumph again by john oliver





this is unbelievable insight into the man donald trump by a comedian john oliver. did you know that $3 billion of trump's net worth comes from his name "trump?" that is the valuation that trump has put upon his trademark name. when he says he is "self-funding" his campaign, what he means is that he is making a loan to his campaign, which he expects to collect later.

‘natural born citizen’






obama a ‘natural born citizen?’

this post was first published on 7 december 2008.


discrimination bordering upon bigotry! only ‘natural born’ citizens need apply!

it is right there in the united states constitution in article ii, section 1, clause 5, which states: “no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the united states, at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the united states.”

discrimination upon the basis of national origin, discrimination upon the basis of age, and discrimination upon the basis of residency status! how about that?

in this past presidential election we had two candidates running for the office described above who admittedly were born on foreign soil, one in panama and one in nicaragua. the candidate who won, barack obama, describes himself as born in the state of hawaii, however he has released no proof of his birthplace other than a generated certificate of live birth, and there are reports that his own family members, and kenyan government officials are conflicted over where exactly he was born.

some constitutional scholars spout off the legal definition of “natural born citizen” is one who was born within the jurisdiction of a national government, i.e. in its territorial limits, or born of citizens temporarily residing abroad. however, i found no legal definition of “natural born citizen.” the phrase is not defined anywhere in the constitution. in 1790, the congress, attempted to make clarification with the naturalization act of 1790 that stated “and the children of citizens of the united states that may be born beyond the sea, or out of the limits of the united states, shall be considered as natural born citizens.”seemingly this definition would have covered john mccain as a “natural born citizen,” except that in 1795, the congress made another clarification, the naturalization act of 1795, which removed the words “natural born” and stated that children born to citizens beyond the seas are citizens of the u.s., but are not legally considered “natural born citizens” of the u.s. this confusion over the meaning of the constitution’s “natural born citizen” is why the united states congress passed a bill endowing senator john mccain with “natural born citizen” status, so that, if elected president, he would be legal under the constitution.

this murkiness over the constitutional definition of “natural born citizen” has caused considerable scenarios to be proffered as to why barack obama is not constitutionally qualified to be president, even if born in hawaii. some of them even have to do with the young age of his mother at his birth, who would not have had enough years of standing as a united states citizen to automatically confer american citizenship upon him, if he had been born in kenya. it sounds far-fetched to you and me, but someone, somewhere has found some quirk in the law that seems to state that.

other deniers claim that because barack obama was born a british citizen, as a son of a british father, regardless of where obama himself was born, he cannot be considered a “natural born citizen.” that came as a shocker to me, as i had always considered myself a “natural born citizen,” even though i was born in maryland of a british father. but, apparently, i am not only not a “natural born citizen,” according to some, i am not even a citizen of the usa, an interesting fact to discover at my age. at least i am in good company. it’s me, president-elect barack obama, and president chester a. arthur. it must be true as i read it at a blog.

if the constitution were truly the law of the land, certainly a definition of “natural born citizen” would have been offered by the supreme court or the congress by now. or there would have been a law passed by the congress that no candidates could run for president unless first vetted for eligibility according to article ii, section 1, clause 5. of course, any american with a brain knows that we no longer live under rule of the constitution, hence all of this kerfuffle over where barack obama was “really” born matters not one wit. he will be inaugurated president of the united states and will remain so, regardless of where in the world he was born.

here is a long, involved treatise written by constitutional scholar jonathan turley to try and convince us that, oh yes, we are a nation of constitutional laws, and as such it would have been “unconstitutional” for john mccain to serve as united states president as he is not a “natural born citizen.” turley describes how he and his cohorts, while wrapped in the mantle of the u.s. constitution, were all ready and willing to go to court to stop mccain’s “unconstitutional” inauguration. of course, the election happened a bit differently, and jonathan turley’s erudite but laughable opinion on “natural born citizen” suddenly turns 180 degrees as applied to turley’s favored candidate, barack obama.

if we were truly living under the constitution, hillary clinton would be unqualified to be appointed from the united states senate to secretary of state. yet, no one, not barack obama, nor the american media, is offering any explanation of how her appointment can be constitutional. other american presidents who disregarded the “emoluments clause” of the constitution were richard nixon and bill clinton, who both got away with it, as will barack obama. president george w. bush who wanted to nominate senator orin hatch for the supreme court was told that would be unconstitutional and he accepted that ruling and did not nominate hatch. all of the above support my view that the united states constitution is just a quaint and moldering document under glass at the national archives, existing only to hammer heads, when needed, of those with unpopular ideas. it is now generally disregarded as little more than a venerated historic document.

according to what i have read of the birth certificate conspiracy, i believe barack obama was born in the united states. deniers - think about this. is it possible that barack obama, himself, created this smokescreen over his birth certificate to drive you to distraction as a way to divert attention from the more serious and controversial plans he has for his new nation?

update: the supremes sock it to the deniers, according to michelle malkin.

woodrow wilson memorial bridge








the woodrow wilson memorial bridge must go now!
as soon as the black lives matter movement succeeds in removing all memorials to president woodrow wilson at princeton university in new jersey, we expect the anarchists will head south to the greatest memorial of all to their despised democrat president - the woodrow wilson memorial bridge.

here the protestors can spread themselves from the maryland shore, crossing a bit of washington dc, to the bustling metropolis of virginia's northern counties. their disruptive presence will be duly noticed by the 250,000 daily crossing motorists for however many days they can endure the elements of life above the potomac river.

the wilson bridge is the only bridge in the united states crossing the borders of three jurisdictions, i.e. maryland, washington dc,  and virginia.


why is the woodrow wilson memorial bridge named after woodrow wilson?

descendants of president jefferson davis





it is quite easy to know if you are a descendant of jefferson davis, as there are few of them; his descendants are rare. if you are an adult in 2015, you must have one parent or grandparent with the surname webb, young, hayes, or hayes-davis, born in colorado, as all of jefferson davis' grandchildren or great grandchildren were born, raised and died in colorado. no descendants have been found in south carolina in the 1970s as sc representative jenny horne has claimed.

a name to protect 

at a reunion in mississippi 35 years ago, the descendants of jefferson davis formed a family association and elected a president: a bearded, longhaired geology graduate student born and raised in colorado.

bertram hayes-davis had at least one qualification others lacked: his hyphenated surname, created by an act of the mississippi legislature on feb 21, 1890, to preserve the name of the president of the confederacy. jefferson davis had six children, but only his daughter margaret married (to a man named hayes) and had children.

in his ancestor, hayes-davis found his calling: to show that davis' life was about more than slavery. because davis led the confederacy, he says, "everything else about him was obliterated" — west point graduate, successful planter, member of the u.s. houseand senate, wounded mexican war veteran, early advocate of the transcontinental railroad and secretary of war (1853-1857). 

hayes-davis says it's not just davis who is misunderstood; confederates in general are tarred by slavery. "what about everything else they did?" he asks. "we want to tell the world we still have that integrity and those values today."

those values include states' rights. hayes-davis is a member of the sons of confederate veterans, which calls the south's secession in 1860-61 "the second american revolution," motivated not by slavery but "the preservation of liberty and freedom."

over the past three decades, hayes-davis has made more than 1,000 speeches and appearances, many at the kind of functions where dixie is sung, the confederate flag is flown and the confederate "lost cause" is mourned.

he says that if americans knew davis better, they'd respect him more: "ignorance is our barrier. it's what we get up for every day. this is something i believe in."

when he sought support for observations of davis' 200th birthday in 2008, he was rebuffed by dozens of museums and organizations. even mississippi, where davis lived, declined to establish a bicentennial commission. 

hayes-davis, who lives in dallas, has a son and a daughter. he hopes the family name will continue, because even though davis has hundreds of great-great-great-grandchildren, "it means more when one of the descendants has the name."

the above comes from "usa today" 5/9/2011
