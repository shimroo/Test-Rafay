what others are saying
during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, daigger worked feverishly with our institution to provide a majority of the ppe we needed. no request was too big or too little, and each and every one of our aggressive timelines was met. daigger scientific literally allowed our institution to remain open and operational and to serve the community.

what others are saying
without any recruitment on his part, [our sales representative] has persuaded me to use daigger products over our more familiar suppliers in the past and has made daigger our number one preferred supplier. i can't thank daigger enough for their dedication.
