the place

 

located just off union square, swig is known as the downtown san francisco drinking institution for everyone. it is spacious, with the main bar featuring a glowing fireplace and a giant wall of spirits. the second floor offers another bar with two private party rooms overlooking the main bar. 

 























 

the intent

 

as a contemporary gathering place for visitors and locals, swig is intent on providing an enjoyable hospitality experience in an inviting, unpretentious bar environment. 

 























 

the drink

 

our freshly pressed juices and garnishes ensure that the cocktails are outstanding, accompanied by such an extensive collection of fine spirits that a ladder is needed to reach the upper shelves. the beer selection is well balanced on craft, local and quality brews from further afield. california farmers make our wine. 

 























 

the vibe

 

late afternoons and early evenings at swig tend to be relaxing and laid back, before the energy picks up later on. great music is central to the swig experience. the events calendar presents a variety of musical escapades ranging from the sunday night blues jam which has been running for over 30 years, to dj’s on weekends, and the surprise of live bands on certain school nights. we look forward to welcoming you for a few good drinks, some live music and a wonderful evening!
