online counseling services by video therapy, phone therapy,

		counseling

welcome! 
		i'm carl benedict, lcpc. if you've found my 
		website, then you're probably searching for help in finding a more 
		fulfilling life. you may not know what is missing or wrong. you may 
		simply feel empty, dissatisfied, angry, fearful, confused, guilty, or any 
		mix of uncomfortable feelings. or you may have been struggling for 
		months or years with depression, anxiety, addiction, panic attacks,  grief and loss, childhood abuse, 
		codependency, anger, or other problems of life. the 
		good news is that you are not alone and you do not have to deal with 
		these feelings in isolation. 
my philosophy of 
		counseling is quite simple: i believe in the inherent 
		wisdom in each of us. thus, i will help you discover, or re-discover, 
		the wisdom that already resides within you. 
		i facilitate this process through active listening as i strive to 
		understand your life from the inside out. then i offer insights and 
		teach skills designed to help you understand and manage your feelings 
		more effectively so you can make better decisions about your life. 
		in short, i help you 
		develop emotional intelligence - the ability to 
		skillfully manage and utilize your feelings to create a  more 
		fulfilling life. for a more detailed explanation of my counseling 
		philosophy and style, go to my counseling 
		philosophy. if you would like to review my counseling credentials,
