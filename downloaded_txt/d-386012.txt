police call in italy comic over parmalat comments 









milan - january 16, 2004 - italian police called in one of italy's top comedians on friday to explain comments he made in his shows about the risk of bankruptcy at the food group long before its crisis erupted. 
 
beppe grillo, famous for his political satire, met financial police officers in the northern city of piacenza. later he explained about a 2001 dinner with an unnamed official from the now-insolvent food group which provided the inspiration for performances since then. 
 
"we talked about lots of companies and he told me: 'mention them all but don't talk about us because our debts are only 13 trillion (lire) which is the same as revenues but compared with others we are princes," grillo said in a telephone interview. 
 
italian television stunned viewers last week by playing footage of grillo talking about the risk of bankruptcy at parmalat during a september 2003 performance. parmalat filed for bankruptcy protection in december after suddenly revealing a four billion euro hole in its accounts. prosecutors believe the shortfall could surpass 10 billion euros, making it one of the world's biggest financial scandals. 
 

it must be a real comfort to all the hard working people in the world that invested in parmalat that an italian comic had to be brought in to testify about the biggest corporate scandal in the history of the universe.

 

thanks to his testimony, the italian police came close to cracking the case after they tried to decode his last comments:

 

"okay, two jews walked into a bar and there was this chicken..."
