village motorsports
a powersports dealer with history
established in 1963, village motorsports started out in grand rapids, mi as a honda dealer, known as honda village.  as honda village grew and established more brands, the name changed to village motorsports grand rapids and moved into a bigger facility across the street. soon after that, we purchased our holland location and now serve west michigan from two different locations. since then we’ve established ourselves as one of the leading powersports dealers in the area providing premium customer service, 16 machine brands, countless aftermarket brands and the hottest trends in clothing and
riding gear.
