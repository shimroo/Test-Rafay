midway school project
we on poised to move the last livermore valley one-room schoolhouse, midway school, from the altamont hills to hagemann park next to the 150-year-old historic hagemann ranch. this creates a destination for immersive elementary school field trips and a public museum. the ranch and school are almost the same age, making joint events historically consistent. 
click bricks to pave (literal) path to schoolhouse

these bricks help pay for architectural drawings (delivered to city in january), city permits, preparing the property, undergrounding electrical, and construction of a concrete foundation.
click candy to refurbish student desks


of course, the schoolhouse itself needs major donors to move the building before christmas, a new front porch, frame repairs, waterproof roofing, fresh window frames, ada ramp, and interior furnishings.
