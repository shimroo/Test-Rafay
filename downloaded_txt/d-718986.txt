very pleasant staff
took my son for a minor, but not insignificant procedure with dr. baiback. had a good experience overall, and was very well taken care of. very pleasant staff and billing was accurate too!

very helpful!
i had dr. d repair the function of my finger. couldn’t have asked for a better experience (considering the circumstances)! the occupational therapist in house named polly was also very helpful!

amazing
dr dalagiannis and all of his staff are wonderful. there really aren’t any words to describe how grateful i am to have made the choice to have surgery with him. very thorough, kind, reassuring, funny, informative, and overall just a wonderful team. i felt secure, even with health complications the entire process. i felt heard when i had questions and i never felt like a bother when i needed clarification on anything. my incisions are amazing. after a 300 pound weight loss, this whole experience has blown me away. i will never go anywhere else. i can’t thank them enough!

stepdaughter car accident recovery
my stepdaughter was in a terrible car accident. dr. kesler got a photo of her, he canceled his day to fix her injuries. without him i don’t know that she would have turned out this good. he personally checked in on her multiple times in the hospital. she looks amazing. i am so grateful for his work. it has only been a couple of weeks, and her face has minimal traces of the accident. amazing work!!!!! thank you so much, for all you do!
theresa perry
