interactive mathematics miscellany  and puzzles





back in 1996, alexander bogomolny started making the internet math-friendly by creating thousands of images, pages, and programs for this website, right up to his last update on july 6, 2018. hours later on july 7th he passed away. his friend nassim taleb announced the devastating news. "he was of the few saints you meet in life: he gave more, much more than he took." alex's family and friends have asked the wolfram foundation to serve as a steward for continuing maintenance and updates to the site, more details to come.
