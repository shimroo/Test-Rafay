what our guests are saying






























































our history















originally constructed in 1892 by teodoro perez, key west’s premier cigar manufacturer, 1125 duval street was once home to a thriving cigar factory and residences for workers. perez was renowned for his advocacy of cuba libre (free cuba) and played a crucial role in supporting jose marti's revolution. in may 1892, the residence hosted “the patriot” jose marti, who delivered speeches from the second-floor balcony. la te da derviced from la terraza de marti” or “the balcony of marti,” now stands as a beloved local hangout and historical hotel.
