greetings bay area council members,
the bay area council staff have received many inquiries related to the status of events throughout 2025 in the council. we want to reassure you the bay area council has budgeted and intends to follow through with all events.
there is nothing more important to us than to provide continuous programming throughout the year.
providing continuous scout programs means ensuring a consistent and ongoing stream of activities, events, and learning opportunities for families and scouts. if you have not done so already, i encourage you take advantage of the quality programs provided by the council volunteer leaders. bay area council calendar link: bay area council calendar
thank you for being a member of the bay area council – scouting america.
 
yours in scouting,
rené monarez
