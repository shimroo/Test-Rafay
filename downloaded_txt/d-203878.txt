they had sold out of the donation blesser before i had a chance to donate.
well... imagine how shocked and surprised i was when one arrived!!!
of course, matt had donated and gotten me one!
what's amazing is that perfect effect went through all the effort to create a custom card with the person who ordered as the "human partner". 
that's pretty damn cool.

i love that takara, for the most part, always tries to come up with a logical explanation of their repaints.
while yes, they may be thin explanations, they at least aren't usually obscene repaints like hasbro often does.
doing a redeco of hot rod in the energy in-between state after he grabbed the matrix of leadership and before he became rodimus prime is great.

the detail of the mold itself really shines through, especially inside the car itself.

not much to say about another repaint of classics starscream.
at least all those people bitching about not having one and not willing to spent the money on the botcon or henkei exclusive ones can finally get him.

great figure.
love the fact that his missiles become the exhaust pipes and his gun gets stowed away in alt mode.
