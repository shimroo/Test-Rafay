frequently asked questions


do i have to buy my espresso machine from you guys? 
no, we are not an espresso machine¬†supplier.you should have the freedom to pick a machine that works best for your business and let us focus on delivering you the best beans we have!


what is the delivery fee? 
the delivery fee per location is $25 and will be waived if orders hit 30kg for any delivery location.


are you a coffee roaster or just a middleman? 
we roast our own beans, we are a home grown coffee roaster/supplier and our coffee profiles are unique only to us.we supply our coffee directly to businesses.


can you train my baristas? 
we do not provide barista training, there are many sca approved institutions in singapore that provide high quality training.


what are these flavour notes on your coffee? 
we use existing ingredients to represent the unique flavours from each origin. this means that any unique flavours present in the coffee are the result of the coffee growing process and not artificial flavourings.


can i visit your roasting facility? 
in order to maintain our competitive pricing, we adopt a satellite model for roasting, we do not own our own roastery and we co-roast our coffee at different sfa approved satellite coffee roasteries.


do you sell blends? 
yes, we are also a coffee blend supplier for cafes and businesses, ask us for more.


i am just looking for a coffee supplier for my office, not starting a business, is that okay? 
of course, our coffee bags are 5kg ( the size of a cabin size luggage ) which makes it convenient for storage in any office environment.5kg makes about 250~300 cups which is suitable for daily consumption in an office of 5-10 people for a month.we are an ideal coffee supplier for small offices and cafes/businesses that are starting out!


how long can your coffee keep? 
when stored in a cool and dry place, we recommend keeping our coffee can for only up to 2 months.that is not to say that the coffee is spoilt or inedible - coffee will stay safe enough to drink pretty much indefinitely unless there is mold damage due to improper storage conditions.but we always recommend finishing the coffee as early as you can as flavors will be lost over time.


can you grind my beans for me? 
we do not provide grinding services because preground coffee can oxidise very quickly, resulting in poor coffee flavors.if you are serious about the flavour, we recommend getting a good grinder and grinding your coffee just before brewing.


can you recommend me the right coffee? 
yes, our coffees are best expressed with different brewing methods.generally for cafes doing espresso coffee, we recommend our dark roasted series. they are all classic bold coffee profiles that you will find in good cafes.for businesses with an automatic espresso machine, go for the dark roast too.for pour overs in specialty cafes, our light roasts have interesting acidities and flavour that will delight people who love filter coffee.for home brewers making cold brew, all roast profiles will work with immersion brewing.yasumicoffeeyasumi coffee is for everyone. there is no perfect way on how to drink our coffee, brew it just the way you like.please enjoy this freshly roasted coffee in a restful state of mind.let go of your worries and have a coffee yasumi with anyone, anywhere.stay up to date with our promotions.don't miss our on newsletter exclusive discounts and coffee tips from coffee roasters
