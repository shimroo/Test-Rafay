this month's reason to eat breakfast:the holiday season can be a challenging time to maintain healthy eating habits, but skipping breakfast can have particularly negative consequences. research has shown that eating breakfast can help regulate appetite and metabolism, reducing the likelihood of overindulging in festive treats. a study published in the journal of the academy of nutrition and dietetics found that adults who ate breakfast consumed fewer calories throughout the day and had lower body mass indexes (bmis) compared to those who skipped breakfast. by starting your day with a nutritious breakfast, you'll be better equipped to navigate the holiday season's culinary temptations and maintain a healthy balance. see more reasons why you should eat breakfast.
