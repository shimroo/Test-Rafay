the government purchasing project (gpp) is
dedicated to protecting the environment and human health through
market-based strategies. gpp works to encourage the government to use
its immense purchasing power to promote safe, cost-effective,
energy-efficient, and environmentally-sound products.
the government is the largest consumer in the
united states, representing 20 percent of the gross national product.
this purchasing leverage can be an enormously effective tool which can
save taxpayers money, set the standard for private industries, expand
the marketplace for "green" technologies, and consequently make these
technologies and environmentally preferable products more available to
consumers as a whole. for an overview of government purchasing, please
read our factsheet (pdf file).
gpp currently focuses on promoting wood
reduction procurement policies and practices in all levels of
government, such as buy-recycled policies, tree-free products and green
building design.
