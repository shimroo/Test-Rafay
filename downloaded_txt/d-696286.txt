at bankrate we strive to help you make smarter financial decisions. though our partners compensate us from links on this page, we maintain editorial integrity, and partners don't influence our product evaluations.
here's
how we make money
and here is our
advertiser disclosure.










opening a certificate of deposit (cd) allows you to lock in an attractive fixed rate and earn higher returns compared to traditional savings accounts, while providing guaranteed growth for a set period of time. currently, the best cd rates still earn above 4 percent apy. the top rate tracked by bankrate is offered by bask bank for a 3-month term, and is higher than the national average of 1.85 percent on a one-year cd.

before opening a certificate of deposit, be sure to read expert advice and tips below to ensure a financially safe decision.

    recent news on cd rates
    


the federal reserve held rates steady during its january meeting. before that, the fed cut rates by 25 basis points — or a quarter of a percentage point — during its december meeting. the federal funds rate continues to rest at a range of 4.25-4.50 percent.
even when factoring in recent rate decreases, competitive cd rates are still higher than the national average cd rates. what’s more, high-yielding cd rates continue to outpace the rate of inflation.
when looking for a cd, seek a competitive interest rate, a term length that works for you and fdic or ncua insurance coverage. also familiarize yourself with early withdrawal penalties to avoid potentially losing money.

how bankrate calculates the national average


caret down icon 




bankrate calculates and reports the national average apys for various cd terms. factored into national average rates are the competitive apys commonly offered by online banks, along with the very low rates often found at large brick-and-mortar banks.
in june 2023, bankrate updated its methodology that determines the national average cd rates. for the process, more than 500 banks and credit unions are now surveyed each week to generate the national averages. among these institutions are those that are broadly available and offer high yields, as well as some of the nation’s largest banks.

cd rates in 2025 are going to depend on what the fed does next. they just decided to keep rates steady for now, but there’s still talk about possible cuts down the road. that means we might not see cd rates drop right away, but banks could still shake things up with competitive offers. if you’re thinking about locking in a cd, now might be a good time—waiting too long could mean missing out on better rates if they start to slide later this year.








mark hamrick
bankrate senior economic analyst




the difference between the average yield and the highest yields on cds is considerable. that’s a factor now of about two times or more. so, why settle for an average yield when you can do better than that? you couldn’t leave money on the table if it were sitting in front of you, right? opting for saving in the first place, along with higher yields, is key.








christopher stroup
cfp, founder and president of silicon beach financial




after three consecutive rate cuts since september, the fed is now in a "wait and see" mode. it's important to know that any potential decrease in yields won't affect your existing cd until it matures. if your rate is currently locked in, you're protected from any future rate cuts for the term of your current cd. for those looking to secure a new cd, now might be a good opportunity to lock in a higher yield before the fed’s stance potentially pushes rates lower should economic and inflation data support that move.









    current promotional cd rates
    


some banks have promotional cd rates, even some of the largest banks. there might be certain restrictions on these cds. for instance, you might have to bring money from outside the bank to be eligible for this apy. promotional cds may renew at a different term and at a different apy. (that apy is likely to not be known when you purchase a promotional cd.)

    compare top cd rates today by term
    


when you open a cd, selecting a term is an important step. the term is the length of time that the money stays stashed in the account. for example, opening a cd with a one-year term means you’re making a commitment to the bank that you’ll keep your money in the account for one year.
here’s where you’ll find some of the top yielding cds by term.

    how to choose the best cd for you
    


the top three things to look for when choosing a cd are:





find a bank or credit union that offers a competitive yield


caret down icon 




you can find cds that are outpacing current inflation in this rate environment. a competitive yield helps your balance grow over time through interest earned compounding.

what is a cd?



types of cds
banks and credit unions offer a wide range of cds to fit different financial needs. take some time to consider which type of cd is best for you.






traditional cds

no-penalty cds

bump-up cds

caret down icon



traditional cds



no-penalty cds



bump-up cds












traditional cds are the most common type of cd, and they earn a fixed apy for the entire term. these cds usually don’t allow you to add more funds after your opening deposit, and they also tend to have strict early withdrawal penalties.
if you withdraw from a cd before it matures, the penalty is usually equal to the amount of interest earned during a certain period of time. for instance, a bank may impose a penalty of 90 days of simple interest on a one-year cd if you withdraw from that cd before the year is up. 
when this cd makes sense: traditional cds are a good choice if you know exactly when you’ll need the money, and there’s no chance of needing it before the term is up. they’re often good for cd ladders or other cd investing strategies in which timing is important.




most cds charge you a penalty for accessing the funds before the term is up. however, some banks offer no-penalty cds — also known as liquid cds — which allow you to withdraw the money early without being charged a penalty. 
a bank may require that you wait at least some time after opening a no-penalty cd — generally around six or seven days — before you’re able to withdraw from the cd, and some banks don’t allow for partial withdrawals. no-penalty cd rates tend to be lower than regular cd rates, but they can be better than some high-yield savings account or money market account rates.
when this cd makes sense: consider a no-penalty cd if you don’t plan to withdraw the money before the cd matures, but you want to keep some flexibility in case you need access to the funds. as a result, you’re willing to give up a little return for added liquidity.




bump-up cds enable you to request an increase in your rate during the cd term under certain conditions. banks that offer this cd usually allow just one bump-up per term. for example, you may open a three-year cd at a given rate, and the bank offers an additional half-point rate increase when you’re one year into the term. with a bump-up cd, you can request a rate increase for the remainder of the term. like no-penalty cds, bump-up cds often pay lower rates than traditional cds.
when this cd makes sense: a bump-up cd could be a good option if rates are expected to rise significantly during the term of the cd. otherwise, you’re likely accepting a lower rate for limited potential upside.









    who should get a cd?
    


a cd is useful when you want to earn a consistent, fixed yield on your lump sum of cash over the term of your savings account, especially if interest rates are declining. it also encourages you to be disciplined in leaving your money untouched as it earns interest because a cd is a time deposit account and imposes an early withdrawal penalty if you withdraw your funds before the cd matures.
a good time to open a cd is when you have a lump sum of money that you want to sock away for a specific period of time in the hopes of consistently growing interest. also, it’s worth opening a cd when you know you have a specific timeframe in mind when you think you’ll need this money. a six-month cd, for example, could be a good place to put your money aside for an insurance premium that’s due in eight months.

pros and cons of cds
before you choose a cd, weigh the pros and cons to ensure you're making the right investment choice for your financial situation.





    pros
    





checkmark icon
some cds earn a higher apy than money market accounts or savings accounts.





checkmark icon
cds are a good place to store funds that you don’t want to be able to dip into too easily.





checkmark icon
cds can help you separate money for financial goals or future expenses.





checkmark icon
deposit insurance covers accounts at fdic banks and ncua credit unions up to at least $250,000.





checkmark icon
a cd can diversify your savings plan with a guaranteed rate.





checkmark icon
your principal remains intact if you keep your money in a cd for the full term.







    cons
    









cds tie up your money for a potentially long period of time.









many cds have early withdrawal penalties.









money committed to a cd could end up earning a lackluster yield if rates rise substantially. the early withdrawal penalty may negate any benefit of switching to a higher-yielding cd, however.









you could potentially earn better rates of return in the stock market or by investing in other securities.










    alternatives to cds
    





traditional savings account
this account typically earns a low yield that’s usually at or below the national average.




caret right icon





high-yield savings account
this account tends to earn a yield currently of about seven times higher than the national average. at online-only banks, these accounts often won’t have monthly service fees or minimum balance requirements.




caret right icon





money market account
this is an interest-bearing account available at both banks and credit unions which is similar to a savings account but also offers some checking account features.




caret right icon





short-term bond funds
these funds, be they exchange-traded funds (etfs) or mutual funds, typically invest in government and corporate bonds. short-term bond funds typically have durations of one to three and a half years, according to fidelity.

how are cds taxed?


caret down icon 




generally, you’ll receive a form 1099-int each year if you earn more than $10 interest, if there is withholding or if there is a penalty. this will generally be taxed as ordinary income, according to the irs.
for instance, a cd customer with a multi-year cd should receive a 1099-int from their bank after each year interest is earned if at least $10 of interest was earned during a calendar year.

are cds safe?

your cd is safe at either an fdic-insured bank or an ncusif-insured credit union, as long as the amount of money in the account is within the established limits and guidelines. federally insured deposit accounts are safe whether they’re at online banks, brick-and-mortar banks or credit unions since they’re backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s. government. just make sure you’re not exceeding the insurance limits.
for federally-insured banks and credit unions, the standard insurance limit is $250,000 per depositor or share owner, per insured bank or credit union, for each account ownership category.

are there fees associated with cds?

cds generally have an early withdrawal penalty for taking your money out before the cd matures. no-penalty cds are the exception, though they may also impose a penalty if the funds are withdrawn during the first six or seven days after the account is opened.

what is considered a good cd rate?


caret down icon 




a good cd rate depends on a few factors, but the true answer depends on your personal financial situation. if you need to access your money in a year, for example, your best cd options will be those with a one-year term or less.
knowing for sure that you won’t need your cash for a specific amount of time also typically allows you to earn a higher rate. the bank is willing to pay you more for the certainty that your money will remain in its hands for the designated length of time.
compare cd rates to the national average to make sure you’re getting a competitive return.  for example, the national average apy for 1-year cds is 1.85 percent as of february 15, 2025, while some top-yielding banks are currently offering one-year cds with apys of up to 4.52 percent.

is an online bank the best choice for a cd?


caret down icon 




online banks tend to offer higher apys than brick-and-mortar banks. these online-only institutions typically have lower overhead costs and are able to pass the savings along to their customers in the form of higher rates. in addition, unlike your bank located on the corner of main street, online banks may need a higher apy to get your attention and earn your business.

how long can you leave money in a cd?


caret down icon 




you can keep your money in a cd and let it renew over and over. cds generally automatically renew. however, unclaimed cds can be escheated — or transferred from an estate to the government — subject to each state’s laws. to avoid your cd being escheated due to being considered abandoned property, be sure to keep in touch with your bank and keep a valid mailing address on file.

do cds have beneficiaries?

banks give account holders with cds the opportunity to name a beneficiary, which is a person who will inherit your savings in the event that you die. while naming a beneficiary for your cd may be the last thing on your mind, experts say it’s an important step to take.
if you don’t have a beneficiary designated to receive the funds in your cd, your savings will go through probate, which is the court process for deciding what happens to the property of an individual after their death.
