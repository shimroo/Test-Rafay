upcoming exhibitions

 











“out of the woodwork!” invites you to immerse yourself in the vibrant and whimsical world of baltimore’s beloved artist, thomas patton miller (1945–2000). known for pioneering the distinctive “afro-deco” style, miller’s art fused the elegance of art deco with the vibrancy of african american cultural motifs, creating a dynamic dialogue between heritage and modernity. tom miller’s genius is best known for transforming discarded furniture—often made of wood—into stunning works of art inspired by loved ones, his beloved city, and black history.
