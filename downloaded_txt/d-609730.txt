recent updates to the brooklyn board:

after a very long hiatus, we have resumed adding to the brooklyn diary with yet another amusing recollection from long-time contributor, ken thompson. be sure to take a look.
thanks to tom r. of lexington, kentucky for a terrific pair of class pictures from p.s. 235 for our class pictures gallery. that school had not been previously represented in our collection and we're happy to see it memorialized.
several new topics for our nostalgia message board
23 entries in our alumni database
2 entries on our wall of fame's west wall
we have fixed our missing persons list so you may now enter names of people you want to find.
we have updated our reunion announcements facility so you may now add your notices.
