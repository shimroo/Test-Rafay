my husband and i have loved in redbud for nearly 25 years. the redbud community always looks nice and gives you plenty of time to take care of your lawn. the streets are always cleared in a timely manner in the winter and we have no complaints about anything! the redbud community has treated us fairly and we have enjoyed living here!

we first moved to boardwalk in 2010, we love it and are happy. we had found a happy, comfortable place to spend our retirement. people here are like family. it got even better when sandy chambers was hired. we were blessed by the number of activities she brought us, and we loved it! activities were always full.
