the modular advantage








faster occupancy
grandeur’s modular construction process offers an advantage for each project to come together faster than traditional construction affords, and allows new facilities to open sooner.








build consistency
a comfortable and controlled facility offers our team the best environment to produce high quality workmanship with efficiency and expertise.








green footprint
reducing waste from 30% on a typical construction site to just 2-3% in our facilities make our on-site footprint significantly less. reduce noise, dust and traffic time on site.
