download fox movies on myspace



twentieth century fox will start to sell movies including "x-men the last stand" and "the omen;" and tv shows, such as episodes from "24" and "prison break for downloading from websites owned by parent news corp, like myspace.com. some analysts said it could be the first step toward creating a broader online video strategy. though the content will be available in an untraditional format, the price is anything but original. with a price tag of $1.99 dangling from a single tv episode, and $19.99 stamped on each movie, the difference other than convenience over a regular store purchase is negligible. the films and video can be played on devices supporting the microsoft windows media platform and employ microsoft's copy protection system.users can download them and play them on microsoft windows media-compatible devices- so no ipod. rosen said fox hopes to be able to expand the service to the ipod and other platforms in the future.enjoy!!

enjoy myspace without adware



a malicious banner ad on myspace.com has been downloading a trojan horse on to unsuspecting site visitors, says internet security company idefense.they used a windows security flaw to infect more than a million users with spyware when people merely browsed the sites with unpatched versions of windows. adware can be very difficult to remove, even for technically savvy users.the advertisement, for a site called deckoutyourdeck.com, appeared in user profiles on myspace, an online community with at least 70 million users, said ken dunham, director of the rapid response team at idefense, which is owned by verisign.users who haven't been vigilant in downloading microsoft's security updates would not have received a warning that the virus was downloading itself. the trojan downloads malware, tracks internet usage and causes the infected computer to be flooded with pop-up ads.as long as this nastiness is loose on the net, there's not a good reason not to stay patched. nothing microsoft's buggy code is going to do to your machine would be worse than having your passwords or your identity stolen.turn on windows update, dang it, and leave it on!

myspace adult restrictions to protect teen user



starting next week, myspace, will make it harder for strangers to send messages to younger teenagers. myspace.com is planning new restrictions on how adults may contact its younger users in response to growing concerns about the safety of teenagers who frequent the popular online social networking site. in the shadow of a string of recent high-profile incidents involving teens and older users, the popular social networking site is planning to roll out a series of new rules that will restrict how some of those friends can interact. the new plan is “myspace users who are 18 or over could no longer request to be on a 14- or 15-year-old’s friends’ list unless they already know either the youth’s e-mail address or full name.”bascially, i can’t request my friend who is 15 years old age unless i know her email address or her real name. older users sending a message asking to become friends with younger users will have to enter the recipients’ actual first and last names or their e-mail addresses, rather than simply their user names.any user will still be able to get a partial myspace profile of younger users by searching for other attributes, such as display name. the difference is that currently, adults can then request to be added to a youth’s list to view the full profile; that option will disappear for adults registered as 18 and over.

replacing my name with a picture on myspace profile



when you're editing your myspace profile, on the name section, there's a little box called "display name", like this:try to add any sort of html like <b>dave</b> and it's stripped away and won't work at all. but... and here's the secret... if you realize that the myspace system is going to convert what you type into what would be displayed to a user as part of saving your changes, you can indeed get just that effect by using &lt; instead of < and &gt; instead of > in your display name.this means that if i wanted to have my name in bold, i'd need to type in exactly:&lt;b&gt;dave&lt;/b&gt; it's ugly, yeah, but it works. this also means that you can change the color of your name by using the font tag, like this:&lt;font color=red&gt;dave&lt;/font&gt;instead of "red" you could use "blue", "yellow", "green", about twenty different color names. cool, eh?unfortunately, the myspace folk don't give you very much space in that box, only 50 characters. this is where it's tricky to use a graphic, because the basic code for the graphic inclusion is going to look like this:&lt;img src=url&gt;do the counting and you'll see that there are only 34 characters left, and seven of them are going to have to be "http://", so there are really only 27 characters left for the full url of your image. subtract four more for the ".gif" or ".jpg" and, well, it's not much space for a url. i couldn't use, for example, "www.askdavetaylor.com/imagearchive/my-myspace-name.jpg" as it's far, far too long.fortunately, there are free image hosting services like tinypic.com which will let you create and host a small graphic on their site without charge.so i'll test it out. here's a rudimentary graphic i've created:reasonably fun and visually interesting, yet pretty darn tiny. i'll go ahead and upload it to tinypic.com, where it's quickly included in their database and i find out that i have three different ways i can reference it:it's the third one, the "link" that i care about, not the other two. now i can simply replace url in the above example with the tinypic url in my "display name" field:&lt;img src=http://i1.tinypic.com/zu1hjd.gif&gt;now with any luck, i can paste that into the "display name" field, save it, and have a graphic replace my name on my myspace profile...looks good. notice how if i had entered the < and > directly it would have removed them, but by using the awkward &lt; and &gt; sequences instead, myspace has converted it for me. nice!one important tip: because myspace converts the &lt; into <, this means that each time you tweak your display name you'll have to manually convert the < back to &lt; and > back to &gt;. tedious, but you probably won't modify that too often anyway... nice myspace tips from dave

how myspace beats google



myspace has surpassed google as they currently ranked as the number three web site of the world, in terms of page views and user time online, just behind yahoo and msn (source: comscore media metrix). now myspace has 45,579,475 registered users (as of 12.28.2005), and increasing at 160,000 people per day, receives 12.5 billion page views per month and known as website that transforming today's popular culture and digital lifestyle. myspace achieve it just in two years of operations in tom anderson hand as the president and chris dewolfe, the ceo.table taken from comscore media metrix with object all persons at u.s. home/work/college-university locations.with statistics numbers like that, myspace can launch a multi-billion dollar ipo, and intermix media as the owner of myspace in early 2005 were positioning myspace to be the cinderella ipo of 2006.by september 30, 2005, however, in one of the most nimble, noncompetitive acquisitions ever, fox interactive media, inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of news corporation, bagged myspace (and its parent company, intermix media) for just $629 million (including the buy out of preferred shareholders and unvested stock options).although myspace is mixing it up with the giants on the internet, intermix, the myspace parent's company was slogging through a series of scandals in the summer of 2005. when news corporation came calling in may 2005, intermix media had just been slapped with a lawsuit for adware and spyware by eliot spitzer's office and the intermix market capitalization had sunk to $137 million. in light of the lawsuit, lack of investor confidence and reduced cash position of intermix, the news corporation offer of $629 million was considered by many financial professionals at the time to be generous. according to jim moglia, executive managing director, harris nesbitt, "having a stable bidder at a price that was high for the time was a good deal."and since myspace acquisitioned by fox interactive, inc., which was never named in the adware/spyware lawsuit, has continued to be on a tear, expanding its services, adding new users in the core advertising demographic of 16-34 year olds, and attracting those users to spend more time online. will myspace be the mother lode rupert murdoch has been searching for to attract more investors to news corp.? will answering to the "man" kill the independent spirit that attracted teens and bands to myspace in the first place? can the co-founders of myspace, who have taken the company from zero to 160 employees and from zero to 45 million registered users in just two years, hope to compete with experienced executives like terry semel (ceo, yahoo!) and eric schmidt (ceo, google)?

background music for myspace html codes



by adding music as background on myspace html website, it could be slower the web page loading and large bandwtih needed for the web. but there are many different ways to add background music to mayspace webpage, and with the right format, you don't have to worry about slow loading web pages.midi music filesactually midi files are actually use your sound card's built-in instruments to create the sounds, and that's why the file size is very small. but the problem for this midi files is most sound cards don't come with any decent sounds and no two sound cards sound alike. just for your web performance suggestion, using midi files for music background of your myspace website will make your site seem amateurish. anyway if you need to add it, here is the myspace html codes to input midi files :<embed src=midifiles.mid autostart=true>add it to your html line and replace the "midifiles" with the name of your midi file name.there is an autostart command that will play the midi file automatically when the page is loaded.wav music fileswav file format have many quality sounds level and easy to implemented to for your myspace website. but the problem is even if you use a low quality setting like 11k/8bit, the file sizes are still very large and it will take a long time for your website to load the music.to implement a wav music file to myspace html codes, put this line :<embed src=wavfiles.wav autostart=true>replace "wavfiles" with your wav file name. there's an additional command to loop the wav file but wav files do not loop cleanly with the embed command.mp3 music filesmp3 files have great flexibility because the files are highly compressed and don't take very long to load. the problem for this mp3 files is they need an external player program, and don't loop cleanly.flash music filesby having flash as the music files type for your myspace website, you will have lots of flexibility in adding sound to your site. flash can import wav as well as mp3 files and then creates quite small files from these sounds. this small flash files will load automatically on your myspace website.by setting the quality sounds level of the flash, will let you choose the size of the music flash files. flash also have ability to to loop short pieces of sound to create very small files for 'continuous' background music. please note that mp3 files do not loop cleanly as your myspace background music, only imported wav files are looped in flash.pre-made music flash loopsthis pre-built flash music loops are professionally recorded, loop almost indefinitely with most of these flash music loops are only about 20k in size so they instantly loaded.to use pre-built flash music loops is quite easy, just by upload your flash music files to your webserver and add a few lines from the corresponding myspace web html codes file to your web page.

pimp my myspace codes



 you can change the appearance of your web page in several ways. you can alter the size, position (margins and padding), borders, background graphics, or even the color of the text. there are many tricks but the more detailed are beyond the scope of this article. if you are interested in learning more advanced techniques, follow this link.   we find it easiest to alter the appearance or presentation using "styles". styles can be pre defined or inline or both. inline styles will be used for this article.html uses codes like table to lay out a table (things that should be laid out using rows and columns), hr for a horizontal rule (a visual divider), span to apply formatting to a segment of text, and p to define a paragraph. these are but a few of the html codes. you can browse the internet should you wish to learn more than are mentioned in this article.   each code may have certain attributes that control it's appearance. a table may or may not have borders, text may be one size or another, or the horizontal rule may be a certain width or length. for a list of all attributes, a good resource can be found here [link]. use this reference once you become comfortable and really want to pimp my myspace! 








 




















myspace html codes part 2



ok let's continue again the myspace html codes on css commands for background edit.background-attachment - to determine whether a background image is fixed to a certain place on the page, or whether it will scroll with the page.fixed - makes background image fixed within the window and the text will scroll over the image, but image will keep not moving.scroll - it's the default value - if there's no value is supplied, browsers will default to a property of scroll - it will makes the background image scrolling with the page.background-image - will assigns an image to the background of an element.note: url("http://....") - it was required for the url to the image being used as a background.background-color - it used to apply a color to the background of an item.rgb(red, green, blue) - it's the easiest way to get an exact color for myspace html codes. color ranges are between 0 and 255 based oon it's rgb value. there will be over 16 millions different combinations choices of colour when combine between the three this results.#rrggbb - it's the hexadecimal color code that similar to the rgb() property, but uses a base16 number system. the valid color ranges are from 00 up to ff which gives in a total of 255 different combinations per color, thus giving you over 16 million combinations.named colors - this can be used too, but are not usually used. they can include such colors as gold or lightblue but it don't offer control that using one of the above to methods offer.background-position - to position the background image defined by background-image.bottom - the background image will be placed at the bottom of either the page, or the browser window, based on fixed or scroll background-attachment.top - the background image will be placed at the top of either the page, or the browser window, based on fixed or scroll background-attachment.left - the background image will be placed at the left of either the page, or the browser window, based on fixed or scroll background-attachmentright - the background image will be placed at the right of either the page, or the browser window, based on fixed or scroll background-attachmentcenter - the background image will be placed at the center of either the page, or the browser window, based on fixed or scroll background-attachmentproper syntax: background-position: horizontal vertical;background-repeat - to determine how a background image will repeat itself through a page.repeat - tiles background image across entire page.no-repeat - it only allows for one background image to display through out the entire page element.repeat-x - tiles the background image in a horizontal direction page only.repeat-y - tiles the background image in a vertical direction page only.background - to compress all above commands into one command for ease of entry.proper syntax: background: background-attachment background-color background-image background-repeat background-position;other important command is the colorbackground-color. the difference between the two is that color applies to the text of a page, and background-color only applies to the color of the backgrounds.for the last, let's examine the piece of myspace html codes we were putting of till the end. let's named the height : 10px; piece.in css, anything that is defined as a block-level element can be assigned a height.the easiest way to describe what a block level element is "block-level element's typically contain inline elements and other block level elements. when it visually rendered, the block level element's ussually begin with a new line.‘block-level element’?” one of the easiest ways to describe what a block level element is “block-level elements typically contain inline elements and other block-level elements. when rendered visually, block-level elements usually begin on a new line.” a list of block-level elements can be found here.i hope this myspace html codes could be helpfull and easy to follow.technorati profile 








 

















myspace: html codes, the basics on css



some basic needed for myspace html code is how to costumize the profile page by working on css. how to separate the visual display of a web site from the actual content of the site. and everybody that has a profile on myspace has the ability to  do this kind of designer job. you need access for the right tools and knowledge to do this, and for the rest of the article, i will assume that everybody has some basic knowledge on making a a good design.now here i provide the myspace html code that can be copied and pasted to your profile and costumize it, and visual what codes do on display.that code would create something along the lines of the box below, without the borderwithout the border, the above code would create something along the lines of the box below, that apply not just to a small area, but to the entire pageplease look at the 1st line above, that every embedded stylesheet respectively must begin and ended by . and please notice the type="text/css", that actually not required, but it's good practise to use when you want to define the stylesheet information.some browser might decide that they should default to something else on css, but most will automatically default to css.now to the 2nd and 6th lines, let's begin and end a standard html comment.why we comment out the stylesheet code? because if a browser can't understand the html tag, it'll be ignored and continue rendering the text between the tag. and with the comment there, if an older browser views it's profile, your style information won't be rendered as text on the page.that's some very basics for the myscpace html code , now we start to examining the actual code that we need to know to get css do what we want to.first and foremost is on 3th line, show that we can alter the way that any html tag by using css, any html tag can be redefined visually. it means that every single html tag can be rewritten to display the way we want to, as long as we got the right css knowledge to make it happen.ok the next line shows that elements can be selected on a page by using it's id attribute. and when using the id, it can only be one id at any given name per page.so if we work by using the id's, just make sure that what has an id is unique within the page. but myspace html codes doesn't allow #'s being posted into the profile so automatically means that id's are out as far as costumization goes.myspace html code  might decide to begin allowing users to target items by id's so long as it doesn't affect the functionality of the page. and we let's take a look to 5th line where we could see how the class be defined and applied to the tag.all classes must begin with decimal ( . ) so the browser could realize that it's a class and not a tag.unlike the id's, we can multiple portions of page here that reference the same class.now we've know some background on css, and the difference between tags, classes and id's, let's see the stylesheet now and what's going on between css to do something.all commands on css must end with semicolon ( ; ), at this example i only use 3 different style commands, and only two of them are very important.which are : “background: rgb();” and “color: rgb();“.most people will not really use the “height: 10px;” on their profile, so we won't talk about it.i think it's time for me for coffee time.. i'll continue later for this myspace html code, the basics :)
