ice cave and bandera volcano

 

located on the continental divide, new mexico’s land of fire & ice features two self guided trails: the bandera volcano and the perpetual ice cave.photos by jacob alfordice caves trading postthe ice caves trading post features local native american jewelry, pottery, rugs, and other art. in addition to contemporary native american arts, the historic ice cave trading post features a museum of ancient artifacts recovered from the ice cave and surrounding bandera lava beds dated 1,200 years old! we also have an extensive rock shop and lots of fun souvenirs available for sale. our cozy dining room features cold and hot drinks, snacks, ice cream and some groceries for your convenience.the two main trails start from the front of trading post, one leads out to the ice cave on the left, and the other up the bandera volcano on the right. there is also a connecting trail in between, the “scenic route,” which takes you through the ancient lava bed - this trail is a bit rougher than the others due to thick cinders so only hike the scenic route if you are wearing good shoes!self guided walking tours take one hour at a leisurely pace to see both landmarks, the bandera volcano and the perpetual ice cave.

you can download and print our official trail-guide by clicking here. bandera volcanobandera exploded in volcanic fury some 10,000 years ago - very recent in geologic time. it is one of the finest examples of an erupted cinder cone and lava field in north america as well as one of the most accessible. bandera spans 1,400 feet wide at the rim and 800 feet deep. the trail winds around and into the southern breach of the volcano to the very best vantage point to see the inside of the crater.the trail to bandera volcano is nearly half a mile long and takes roughly 40 minutes round trip to complete. the trail rises gradually from its base to the lookout point for an elevation gain of 150 feet. for guests not used to high elevation we recommend you take it slow, bring water, and take advantage of our many benches to rest along the trail. the lookout gives a spectacular vantage to imagine the earth’s raw, explosive fury spraying molten lava in a fiery mist to form the cinder cone as we know it today. the all out assault of magma tore out the southern breach draining into the valley below with a 23 mile river of fire and flood of molten lava, forming the collapsed lava tube that you can marvel at inside the ice cave.ice cavelocated in a section of bandera’s collapsed lava tube, the ice cave's temperature never rises above 31º f. year round. the natural layers of ice have been forming for over 3,400 years. the perpetual ice cave is a natural phenomenon made possible by a combination of physical factors forming a natural ice box; a 20 foot thick mass of ice accumulating in a well insulated cave of porous lava with an opening shaped just right to trap cold air, continually generating new ice as rain water and snow melt seep down to its floor and freeze.the trail to the ice cave is nearly a quarter mile long and takes 20 minutes round trip to complete. the viewing platform is located 70 steps from the landing at the upper surface of the lava tube. note the unusual transition in temperature throughout the descent. at the viewing platform, you are inside the cave but do not lose sight of daylight. the ice cave is a sacred place with a 1,200 year history of human interaction dating back to the ancestral puebloans and continuing to this day as a spiritual and refreshingly cool, peaceful space. gemstone miningthe ice cave features a gemstone mining sluice where you can pan for gemstones and arrowheads in an old time water tower and trough. match your gemstone treasures to an included identification key to learn what minerals you've discovered! the gemstone mining sluice is great fun for all ages, and provides an educational diversion for your stay.
