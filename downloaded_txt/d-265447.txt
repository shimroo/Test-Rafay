what are clients saying





we are so grateful for all the help and service. we came in not knowing even where to begin, but we ended up feeling like family. thank you.
jordan & nycki groot




my experience was great, the salesperson was very knowledgeable and answered all the questions i had. i will send anybody i know that is looking for a handicap van to go to clock mobility. at the lansing location, the people made us feel welcome.
roger and judy f.




we had a great first experience with clock mobility. we were in need of a new van for our son’s transportation needs rather quickly as our previous van sold sooner than we thought! we were able to find a new van through greg lavallee and are so thankful for and pleased with our purchase! it has served our family well so far!
alex a.




matt goodlock was very helpful. we have just begun taking care of our disabled mother and each step is a bit scary. matt explained everything, answered all our questions and made us very comfortable with the whole process. i don’t think it could have gone better. he has stayed in contact with us in case we have any concerns. we will definitely return if the need arises.
carol b.




we are very appreciative of saleswomen wendy cadena. she is outstanding as a salesperson and her knowledge of wheelchair accessible vans. we met wendy in 2006 when we bought our 1st van and knew we needed wendy when we decided we decided to get a new van. she is very patient and timely – explains everything and if need be, explains it again. there is for sure a cloud in heaven with wendy’s name on it! thank you wendy! thank you clock mobility!
susan and patrick v.




wendy helped us tremendously! she answered any questions we had. she was easy to get ahold of. we made several appointments to see things and she showed us everything we needed. to gave us several resources for grants. she kept us well informed on the process of completion of our van with all the covid set backs! she was amazing to work with!
douglas d.




everyone at clock makes every experience a positive one. so courteous and helpful. i cannot recommend you guys enough!! your service department is fabulous, the guys are always so nice and helpful. and wendy is just amazing! she goes above and beyond to get what i need and make it happen. thank you!!

i was in need of a used wheelchair accessible van. the need was urgent. i called and spoke to randy who was extremely knowledgeable, listened to my needs and was very empathetic. he told me about a van that had recently come in and i immediately drove to grand rapids from muskegon, looked at the van and purchased it. so far, it has worked out great and i am very pleased with the experience and the equipment.

our recent experience at clock mobility can be described as “the best”. we have been customers of clock for many years, and during this time, we have developed a relationship of trust and respect with all there. i guess one could say we consider the team at clock as family. our 2020 chrysler pacifica, with the braun conversion, is the 3rd. such van we purchased from wendy. wendy is our “go to” person and we couldn’t be more grateful for the help she continues to offer us. in this experience, we would also like to thank ron for his kindness with the appraisal, don and cameron with their guidance in service, and chuck who we believe to be the best when it comes to his caring and knowledge in the workings of these vans. mr. don clock, thank you, we couldn’t appreciate you and your business more.
matt, marcy, and jack m.




the team at clock mobility is always first rate! they worked through the issues that braun presented them with to get the vehicle in time for a trip the middle of april. wendy took care of everything with karen anderson before she retired from aaa and her and ron pushed braun to get the vehicle in time. dan mohr is always great to work with and is very personable and listens to my needs. we are looking into a power platform to help raise me up. i initially turned it down but after driving a few miles i think i would like to add it. i will evaluate the comfort level on the drive to texas and let wendy know what i want to do. thank you for all you do in making this happen for me. your team is awesome!
chuck p.




we were very satisfied with the service we received from clock. our salesman was knowledgable and always prompt with information requests. i appreciated that each person we had contact with was kind and friendly. being in a situation that requires one to purchase a handicap accessible vehicle is stressful enough. randy and everyone at clock made a difficult purchase a little easier.
mary & doug s.




it was great. took a long time for me to make a decision and get things finalized but you were patient with me and i appreciate that. you treated me with respect as if i was your number 1 priority. you sold me a car not just wheelchair accessible equipment like other dealers. you took me for a test drive and let me hear the radio and pointed out the different features of the vehicle. you stayed in contact with my whole support team to make sure this was finalized. you picked me out the prettiest van that you could find and placed it on hold for me for 8 months and when somebody tried to buy it under my nose you made sure i got it anyway. i thank you so much !
zamaria m.




nothing but amazing people. they all helped in one way or another and work together to make sure you get everything you need. i highly recommend them!!!!
maryanne h.




wendy has provided us with three vehicles. her expertise and experience makes our purchase easy. i cannot see us buying from anyone else. from the service manager to the highly skilled technicians the overall process is fantastic.
jeff s.




i am a returning customer because clock mobility provides excellent customer service. they are a trustworthy company with knowledgeable employees who strive to provide a superior service!
tracy a.
