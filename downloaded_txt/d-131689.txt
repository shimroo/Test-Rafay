the resource room
tools, strategies, and structured explorations for interesting learners
-- this is an old site (i put it up in 1999) ; my full-time job helping students has pulled me away. still, there may be resources you find useful. i'm in the process of transforming resources to editable open educational resources and sharing them at oer commons and other repositories.
july 2024  (i haven't put anything here???)   i'm once again atthe "no, you should actually finish something bigger like a course and share it" stage because adult math ed opportunities are being slashed ("just college level, the rest of you please find some certificate that doesn't need math!!!")   i *am* moodling  http://www.resourceroom.net/class and sticking stuff online like fractions videos.  
august 9, 2021 -- i've put so me new things in "reading comprehension." (click the tab above) i'm going to get back to making a moodle course, too.  
dec. 9, 2020 (okay, i haven't put other updates here!  they are legion!)   intro to number lines, captioned video 
july 11, 2018:   new projects ... a few fixed pictures... my blog is where i'm sharing while i figure this out.  however, yesterday i got, from the tossed books from the business department, an html5/css book. 
august 5 2017 attempt to edit! that's why those images are "broken." content's my priority... yes, i"m breaking rules by publishing "under construction" but i declare the rules to have changed.
my blog is current - drop by and say hello! the about" page explains projects like  my app .

what was new at resource room 


may 20, 2014 "teaching basic math concepts in college" presentation links
the mary ellen carter academy blog -- math for adults, conceptually grounded.
sue jones' blog! links and comments and who knows what else? updates on my teaching and learning and figuring out new ways to present math. (biking blog, too if you're feeling distractible)


why can't students get the concept of math? this article from spring 2011 perspectives (shared with permission) describes typical misunderstandings that middle school level students have, and explains that this is going to make it harder to keep moving forward. it's not limited to students with learning disabilities, either. i've uploaded a version with my comments, too.


camtasia explorations in math... exploring integers. check it out in the math section (if salman khan and his khan academy confuses you... )


joyce steeves' very good at everything: social & emotional ramifications of dyslexia and other atypical learning styles and patterns (thanks to the person who alerted me that it had been deleted - i love active surfers!)
