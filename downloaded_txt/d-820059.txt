          “i had the privilege of working directly under adam lotz for three years at citrix, and i can confidently say that he is one of the best individuals i’ve had the pleasure to work with. adam truly understands euc, vdi, and cloud computing. he is also never afraid to take on a new challenge, empowering both he and his team to drive results. 

what sets adam apart as a manager is his unwavering trust in his team. he continuously empowered us by giving us the autonomy to make decisions and grow in our roles, all while providing the guidance and support needed to succeed. adam’s non-judgmental and approachable nature creates an environment where ideas are freely shared and challenges are tackled collaboratively. 

any team would be fortunate to have adam as a manager or an individual contributor. his combination of industry expertise, leadership skills, and genuine care for his team members make him an exceptional asset. i’m grateful for the opportunity to have learned from him and highly recommend him to any organization.”

          “i was fortunate to work closely with adam while at citrix for many years. adam is one of the most professional, thoroughly knowledge people at citrix i worked with while i was leading the strategic alliance relationship with microsoft. he knew the products inside and out and had such a gift for telling the story to maximize the impact of our relationship with microsoft to drive new joint business. he is a strategic thinker, calm under pressure, and always overdelivered on commitments he made on behalf of product marketing to accelerate and grow our deals through and with microsoft.

any organization should count themselves lucky to have adam onboard, whether as a head of product marketing or even as an individual contributor. he's a tremendous asset to any organization looking for deep product marketing expertise, as well as someone with superb emotional intelligence who can speak to customers and executives of any level.”
