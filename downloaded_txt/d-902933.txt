 quick history

it all started in 1940 with a little idea sparked from the soul of some local threshermen over supper. the nelson boys fired up the old garr-scott engine to thresh with steam again for old time sake with family & friends. the event continued once a year until 1954, when western minnesota steam thresher’s reunion met formally for the first time and invited the public. today the show has grown to include hundreds of demonstrations and exhibits spread over 210 beautiful acres. the show attracts thousands of spectators and volunteers every labor day weekend.

all of our workers are volunteers and receive no compensation for working at wmstr.
