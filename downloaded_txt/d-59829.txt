lady: a lady is a woman who is the counterpart of a lord; or, the counterpart of a gentleman. the term lady can be used as a title. etymology and usage
the word comes from old english hlaifdige; the first part of the word is laif, loaf, bread, as in the corresponding hlaford, lord; the second part is usually taken to be from the root dig-, to knead, seen also in dough; the sense development from bread-kneader, bread-maker, to the ordinary meaning, though not clearly to be traced historically, may be illustrated by that of lord.the primary meaning of "mistress of a household" is now mostly obsolete, save for the occasional use of old-fashioned phrases such as "lady of the house." this meaning is retained, however, in the title first lady, used for the wife of an elected president or prime minister.today's tiip: when it comes to simple problems to ink replacement, you need a good printer. the printer cartrige is also a very important part to your injet printer since the costs associated with ink cartridges can well exceed the total cost of the printer. the special use of the word as a title of the virgin mary, usually our lady, represents the latin domina nostra. in lady day and lady chapel the word is properly a genitive, representing the hlaefdigan. 
euphemism: a euphemism is an expression intended by the speaker to be less offensive, disturbing, or troubling to the listener than the word or phrase it replaces, or in the case of doublespeak to make it less troublesome for the speaker. when a phrase is used as a euphemism, it often becomes a metaphor whose literal meaning is dropped. euphemisms are often used to hide unpleasant or disturbing ideas, even when the literal term for them is not necessarily offensive. this type of euphemism is used in public relations and politics, where it is sometimes disparagingly called doublespeak. there are also superstitious euphemisms, based (consciously or unconsciously) on the idea that words have the power to bring bad fortune (for example, not speaking the word "cancer"; see etymology and common examples below) and religious euphemisms, based on the idea that some words are sacred, or that some words are spiritually imperiling (taboo; see etymology and religious euphemisms below).
politeness: politeness is best expressed as the practical application of good manners or etiquette. it is a culturally defined phenomenon, and what is considered polite in one culture can often be quite rude or simply strange in another. while the goal of politeness is to make all of the parties relaxed and comfortable with one another, these culturally defined standards at times may be manipulated to inflict shame on a designated party.sociolinguists brown and levinson identified two kinds of politeness, deriving from erving goffman's concept of face:
negative politeness: making a request less infringing, such as "if you don't mind..." or "if it isn't too much trouble..."; respects a person's right to act freely. in other words, deference. there is a greater use of indirect speech acts. positive politeness: seeks to establish a positive relationship between parties; respects a person's need to be liked and understood. direct speech acts, swearing and flouting grice's maxims can be considered aspects of positive politeness because: 
they show an awareness that the relationship is strong enough to cope with what would normally be considered impolite (in the popular understanding of the term); they articulate an awareness of the other person's values, which fulfils the person's desire to be accepted.   
some cultures seem to prefer one of these kinds of politeness over the other.

                      example
                      when invited to a birthday party or wedding, guests are expected to bring a gift. common gifts include flowers, chocolates, alcohol, perfumes, gift certificates or "an envelope" - undisclosed amount of cash in a sealed envelope. often, wedding invitations have symbols on them indicating what kind(s) of gifts the couple would like to receive. 
                      
                      



   


manners 

in sociology, manners are the unenforced standards of conduct which show the actor to be cultured, polite, and refined. they are like laws in that they codify or set a standard for human behavior, but they are unlike laws in that there is no formal system for punishing transgressions. they are a kind of norm. 



 -   13 to ak  -   al to an  -   an to at   
what is considered "mannerly" is highly susceptible to change with time, geographical location, social stratum, occasion, and other factors. that manners matter is evinced by the fact that large books have been written on the subject, advice columns frequently deal with questions of mannerly behavior, and that schools have existed for the sole purpose of teaching manners. 



  -   au to ba  -   ba to bi  -   bi to bo   
a lady is a term frequently used for a woman who follows proper manners; the term gentleman is used as a male counterpart. 



  -   bo to bu  -   bu to ca  -   ca to cl   
the body of behaviors we call "manners" are evolution's solution to easing the stresses of communal living. in essence, mannerly behavior recognizes the right of another to share the communal space. many of our daily expressions of politeness reflect this function. saying "excuse me," for example, shows that you recognize that you have invaded another's space, and regret the necessity of doing so. it is a basic tenet in law that it is wrongful to cause damages to another (see norm). since there cannot be a law for every slight, daily causing of damage to another, manners serve to at least acknowledge, if not make recompense, for the damage. 



  -   cr to da  -   da to di  -   di to fe   
miss manners (see further reading below) regrets that in recent times the idea that one should be "assertive" has gained currency, holding that being assertive is simply another name for "the impulse rude," which is to be resisted at all times. she prefers "the withering look, the insistent and repeated request, the cold voice, the report up the chain of command, and the tilted nose." she also rejects the idea that manners is all about making people comfortable, "as if etiquette weren't magnificently capable of being used to make others feel uncomfortable," all in the name of preserving peace in the public arena.
