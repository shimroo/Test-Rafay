the central market hall in budapest, also known as the great market hall, has a rich history dating back to the late 19th century. designed by hungarian architect samu pecz, construction began in 1894 and the market officially opened in 1897. built in the neo-gothic style, the market features a grand iron framework and a roof adorned with colourful zsolnay tiles, which are a distinctive element of hungarian architectural design.…

in our modern, rushing world it is rather difficult to stop for a moment and reflect on who we are. but for many, this is what is needed to keep going. life is an everchanging ride where it is easy to get lost at a crossroads. however, finding your inner self can be a great way to keep yourself on track and realize what you want in life and what your strengths and weaknesses are. remember, there is only one you! there are billions of others, but there is only one you and you need to embrace this fact and make the most of it.
so step into your inner thimble and expand! the best way to express your inner self is by exercising congruency in your rational, emotional and spiritual selves. life is never easy and sometimes you have to walk the extra mile to achieve something. however, if you stay congruent, focused and in sync with your inner self, then taking risks with honor will be easy. it is who you are. your truth. many can’t find their inner balance because they think they are forever cursed with a flaw which can’t be eradicated. right now, somehow they believe they are a phony on some critical level. the most important thing to do in order to realize one’s potential is to get this misconception healed and the rest is just practice. step into your inner thimble and forget about what others tell you. it is important to believe in yourself and realize that although you are not perfect, you are not cursed and you are not a prisoner of your identities. you are much more than simply a set of ids!
trying to uncover your inner self can be a tricky process these days because through media the average person is influenced so regularly by a lot of people that it’s hard to keep track. for one, the average person holds multiple identities in their lives, each with their own set of socially defined values and expectations. however, they may not fully conform with who you are on the inside. it’s cruacial to realize that your inner self’s goals meet the goals of your identity in the world. let’s say that you work a certain job but deep down you’ve always wanted to do something else. you may be okay with your current job, as it pays well and it could be worse. however, truly living life is about stepping into your inner thimble and expanding itt o the universe!
say it out loud: i can do better! as a person you may have other dreams and goals which differ from your company’s or current employer’s expectations. perhaps you really love singing. your ideal vision is to be an accomplished artist and make something that affects other people’s lives in a positive way. that’s very different from what you’re expected as an accountant if that’s your current position of employment. you see, you have 2 conflicting identities here. the best thing to do in a situation like this is to go step into your inner thimble and go with what your heart tells you! don’t let others rule your life. find your true inner self and build on it to make your dreams come true!…
