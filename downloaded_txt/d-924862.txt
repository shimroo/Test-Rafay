lacda reboot statement



		it was twenty years ago today in.2004, los angeles center for digital art, through the formidable energies and initiative of director rex bruce, opened its doors with its first exhibit. what followed is an incredible success story of hundreds of exhibits, screenings, panels, and performances that included collaborations with major curators and institutions including centre pompidou, the broad, museums and the web, guggenheim gallery (chapman university), downtown los angeles art walk, california museum of photography (u.c. riverside), new media center santa ana, niche.la video art, silver lake film festival, downtown film festivallos angeles, photola, and photosf. curators from moca, lacma, riverside museum, hammer museum, and others have participated in selecting artists for lacda juried competitions. 
		  
			  march of 2020 brought the covid lockdown and the closure of the gallery. the last few years we have all journeyed through the global crises, and while rex bruces personal health journey has thus far prevented reopening the gallery, lacda is happy to report he has recovered to an amazing degree and is ready to restart the lacda legacy. since the early 90s rex bruce has dedicated himself to the propagation and growth of art and technology and it is his wish to plant deep roots for lacda as an arts organization that can last for generations to come. 
		   
				 now is your opportunity to support that effort and an invitation to join us as an active participant in the digital arts endeavor. art and technology has grown to be a cornerstone of the art world at large and will continue to be an endless source of conceptual rumination with the introduction of so many prescient technologies over the years. lacda has a brilliant future continuing its pioneering work in support of building the art community dedicated to exploring techno-cultural convergence and providing a focused venue and a discursive arena for presenting computer based projects.
