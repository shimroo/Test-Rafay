welcome to the american academy of medical acupuncture


the american academy of medical acupuncture is the professional organization of allopathic and osteopathic physicians (mds and dos) that advances the evidence-based integration of the practice of medicine and acupuncture to serve our patients. these physicians are trained in both modern medicine and acupuncture, giving them the ability to examine a problem, make a diagnosis, and offer treatment options from both modern medical and acupuncture perspectives. that means their patients get the best of both worlds: proven, ancient healing techniques and cutting-edge, modern medicine.
we invite fellow health care providers and prospective acupuncture patients to explore this website to learn more about the benefits of medical acupuncture and about membership in the aama.
