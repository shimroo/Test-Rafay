it 
          has been said a number of times over the years since his first appearance in 
          1950 that dan dare is the "british flash gordon", the "british buck rogers", 
          is like "biggles set in space" and more recently is the "james bond of outer-space". i don't 
          personally agree with those rather simplistic comparisons - enter 
          this website to see for yourself why dan dare is totally unique...
