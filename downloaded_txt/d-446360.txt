how many stitches to start





i have done the crochet provisional co to start my mermaid. the number of sts i need to start is 181. i am going to start after the collar area. if i subtract the 4 decreases and the 23 bo i need 154 sts. is that right?

provisional co





i am ready to start my mermaid jacket. i watched lucy neatby's provisional cast on with the crochet hook and will try that. i do have a question regarding removing the provisional cast on - i couldn't understand what lucy said about the 12th stitch (wear hearing aids). 

she had 12 sts on the end she was knitting and 11 on the provisional co when she removed the provisional co.

frogging mermaid





after consulting via email with fiberfantic i am frogging my first attempt at hanne falkenberg's mermaid jacket. checked you tube to find out how to do a provisional co (have never done one).
mshatbox and windycitygal have also given advice.

blogging is also new but i do use a computer for genealogy!

finally finished





in two weeks i will be going to quilting by the lake near syracuse, ny to take two classes from gail garber.  i decided to send two quilts for inclusion in the quilt show that accompanies the session.  the quilts are not judged, which is fine with me.  but it's fun to see quilts that the attendees have sent, as well as quilts from the instructors.  thus, i had an impetus to finish them.

the first one was made using lessons from the class i took at qbl last year from sue benner.  the class was fantastic and she's a wonderful teacher.  i love the brightness of this quilt.


the second is the result of a mini-workshop with a friend.  i mentioned this in an earlier post--we both worked on our own pieces.  

actually the photos are reversed and i have no idea how to switch them.  but there they are...

plisse is no more





my plisse was the wrong size for me out of my error - i should have shortened the waist when i was knitting it.   i decided to do something constructive about it, instead of not wearing it.  so, i tried to frog it to start again.  the yarn, which had pilled badly, despite very few wearings, clung together and broke in many places.  in disgust, i tossed the whole thing.

tutti-frutti #4





this sweater is the same colors as the other 3, just a different size. this one was knit in the smallest size hanne offers. i hope she can wear it later this winter!  knit mainly in dale of norway falk, but the black is almost the last of the black 3-ply kroy i have on hand.  i believe i had close to 3 pounds of it at one time!  dh had wanted black, over the calf dress-socks.  after 2 1/2 pairs, i called it quits, but still had all of that yarn on hand.  i've used it in all 4 tutti fruttis, and many other projects.mommy wants a hat to go with this, but not hanne's.  i'll see what i can come up with.  maybe make one of hanne's, just because, and then something else.just a bit big.  grin

mermaid - up and running





just wanted to publicly announce that, after 4 years of patiently waiting in my craft box, mermaid is on the needles!  i got the spreadsheet for the medium size from amy although after (too much) deliberation i have decided to knit the small with a few minor changes.  i needed spreadsheet initially to make sure i was on the right track but, having just finished the first arm gusset, i'm getting familiar with the pattern, even the short rows.i've benefited from the information provided by all of you who have knitted mermaid previously and am happy to share any info with you (apart from the spreadsheet, of course!) or answer any questions you might have about sizing, quantities of yarn and alterations.  hoping to keep my blog reasonably up to date (see the link to tessa on the right hand side of the page).

pagode finale





i thought i'd never see this post. 
pattern: pagode by hanne falkenberg yarn: hanne falkenberg no. 2 shetland
needles: size 3
colorway: khaki/straw/ivory/blue green/flax/rust
cost: $130 from knitswap email list
cast on: april 2007
cast off: april 28, 2010
progress posts: enabled, cast on, first rip, why oh why did i knit two identical fronts, ripped again, finale!

this was a spur of the moment purchase through an email list. it was half price and i was bored at work. but i truly love the yarn and the unique design. it's all done in garter stitch on size 3 needles. the fronts (plus half the sleeves till where the colors end in the picture) are done in two pieces, and back is one piece, sleeves are picked up from the edges after shoulders are seamed. 
the project took three years to finish, partially because it's all garter stitch and becomes quite boring after awhile. but because of the simple garter stitches, i mostly kept it in the car, as something i worked on during long car trips. because of the simple stitches and unique construction and pattern writing, one small slip in reading cost me quite a bit of trouble. there were three major rips, first i switched colors (ivory and wheat) in the first front, then i forgot the pocket on the second front; then once the second front was finished, it looked exactly the same as the first. i didn't have enough yarn to knit two more identical fronts (why would i want to do that anyway?), and couldn't just flip it over and use the back side. i had to rip out an entire finished front -- 386 stitches on the cast on edge.
but really, look at the finished product, it's all worth it.

tutti-frutti





 i am in the process of knitting the 3rd (and i hope final) tutti-frutti as adapted for my grandson. my dil liked the first one so much she asked for a second for this year -- she said it was sophisticated. (who needs sophisticated for a 2 year old?) i knit the second one, and the gauge was off -- it will fit him next year. so, i have just a bit to finish on the sleeves and then #3 will be done, and i need to sew in the ends on #s 2 and 3. sigh. here is a picture of him last year at 1 year of age.  no bobbles, and 3 colors instead of the 2 hf calls for.  but, it is really cute, and looked good on him.  black, white and red. can i say i'm tired of those 3 colors?  the same 3 colors?  but that is what she wanted, so that is what she got - in all 3 sweaters.  i tried for something slightly different, she preferred this.  she is a lovely dil, but if it doesn't match her specifications it won't be worn. i wish i'd finished the second one and the gauge had been correct.  my heart lost steam when the gauge was off.  then my dad died, and i lost impetus even more.  now i'm on track to finish and be done!  number 2 is sewn together, just need to sew in those blasted ends (and there are a lot of them.)  number 3 only needs about 2 more days of knitting on break and lunch then sewing in those ends. now, though, our dd is expecting a girl.  do i knit it again with 3 colors (but please, not the same ones!) or do i knit it as written with 2 colors?  i don't think i'll add the bobbles as she doesn't like bobbles.  but, it is a cute sweater for a child, easy over the head!  ideas?  thoughts?  what colors would you use for a little girl, but not so girly that her daddy will freak out?  (grin -- he was so sure she was going to be a boy that he is having issues.  big grin!) i recommend this pattern aaa+++!

lascala #1 tragedy





hello!  i am new to the knit along and hoped to post a picture and wonderful update of my current hanne project, lascala #1.  i have done a few hanne projects in the past and just love them.  but this morning i've had a terrible tragedy and need some help.  you see, i have this dog.  when i leave the house i have to make sure that anything and everything that could possibly be chewed is put away and all doors to bedrooms are closed.  i had a busy morning getting the kids out the door to daycare and forgot to close the sliding door to our bathroom that also closes off the bedroom.  when i got home i found hanne strewn all across the livingroom floor.  i want to cry.  what i already knit (almost half of the scarf) was unharmed but a whole ball of yarn is ripped to shreds.  gone.  can't get it back.  can i even get one ball of yarn from her? from anywhere?  i need the chestnut color.  i want to cry.  this is not an inexpensive undertaking and i can hear my husband now "you should have closed the door".  ya, i know.  duh.  any advice on where to find yarn would be appreciated.  i might just go sit in a corner and rock now.

studio long question





i knit a studio long a couple of years ago, and because i'm disorganized, don't recall how much of each color yarn was included.  can anyone let me know the answer? i'm thinking of knitting another one and need to know how much yarn to order.

jazz





has anyone tried knitting jazz using just a single color? the stitch is sort of a herringbone. i wonder how it would come out in a single color just relying on texture. i saw someone wearing a lovely woven  jacket (not jazz) that was a very subtle single color herringbone and that's what made me think of it.

i'm glad to have discovered this group and to be invited in.  i have only recently discovered hanne falkenberg and am smitten!  i just received my dacapo kit and can't wait to begin.  just as soon as i get the store in copenhagen to send me the pattern in english.  somehow i think this is going to be challenging enough without having to cope with danish (or swedish, or whatever they are) instructions!

finished





complete, but not exactly like the original pattern. i swapped out colours since the m*ths had eaten enough of what i had that i pitched the whole mess.not liking to sew things together, this became an exercise in ez origami. that first row was almost 1000 stitches long, but it got easier every row. knitting back and forth across the upper back turned out to be a non-issue. i shorted the sleeves since i was both going out of my mind with boredom and i never fold up sleeves anyway.

progress report - pyramide and pagode





thank you so much for letting me join the group.i've knit both mermaid (color #7) and solo (#1) in the past year. i started blues last winter, but lost interest after proceeding 2/3 the way through both fronts. now if i could figure out where i put the rest of the yarn....i am seriously drooling over donna (just released). hoping that one of the merchants has the kits at ally-pally (national knitting and stitching exhibition at alexandra palace, oct 8-11) so that i can get a better idea of the color choices.currently on the needles is pyramidewhich now only needs the 7 neck rows and sewing together and -pagode, which is a long and sad tale. i purchased the kit in denmark, oh must have been early to mid 90s. instructions, of course were in danish. i started the kit, wrong as it turns out, but made some changes because i just was not going to knit all that garter stitch. obviously it became apparent that the drape was not right; plus the color combination did not thrill me. putting it aside to marinate, i moved on to other projects.hauling it out of storage this spring, i found extensive moth damage. so much for all that lovely yarn, the planned frogging and re-knitting. the pattern had not, alas, under gone a magic transformation into english.having now knit two other hfs, being able to read a graph and the starting stitch counts (plus all those wonderful pictures of everyone's wonderful projects from ravelry) i decided to do it my own way. casting on a million stitches, i indulged in mindless knitting for weeks with replacement yarn in better colors (harrisville shetland and some leftover hf) as a one piece project before hand cramps and brain death set in.admitting that i had too many projects on the needles, i pulled it out of hibernation about 15 days ago to restart from the inner burgundy stripe and got this far a week ago before going back to pyramide and a couple of other projects -this is the view from the back of the sweater. knitting it in one piece has been an interesting challenge. i am now up to the sleeve shaping on the back and have only about 60 ridges to go.right. if i can find where the darker grey has decided to hide.if anyone wants the details on how to do this as a one piece, i would be happy to share.-holly

hf plissé





thanks for letting me join the kal!  is anyone still working on plissé?  i started a year ago and gave up, but now i'm game again and i'm working on the front.  i'm hoping to find a spreadsheet, because i'm working in the chocolate and can't see a thing!  if not, i guess i will have to graph it myself, but i sure hope not to have to reinvent the wheel.

blues instructions





well, i'm working along on blues and mostly it's going fine.  i solved my yarn problem from the previous post and to my great surprise, i have a second yarn which fits nicely into the pattern.  however, the line which says 'decrease alternately on the 7th & 8th stripe'  leaves me confused.  so i'm decreasing every 7th stripe by 2 stitches.  the rest doesn't make sense.  does anybody have other suggestions for me?

gauge on blues





i received blues a few weeks ago and was horrified at my colour choice.  i'm trying to solve it, but don't yet know how i will do it.  among other things i'm swatching the base colour with a strand of silk that goes very well.  but i certainly don't get gauge.  is 60 stitches to 10 cm really possible?  i'm even working on 2mm needles.  does anyone have a comment or suggestion? gillian

hi!  thanks for letting me join in your kal.  i have just recently freed mermaid from exile island and am ready to tackle the second half of the body.  i was discouraged by the instructions that read to just reverse the instructions for the second half.  and if that wasn't bad enough, i also just purchased the diva kit (forgetting how disillusioned i am by the instructions!).  it's a good thing that i love the designs.tina in houston

blues





i'm  looking for a copy of blues (in english or that you can translate into english) that you'd like to trade for a different hanne pattern that i have.  anyone get it for xmas and finish it already? trading patterns is perfectly legal, by the way before someone jumps on this and talks about stealing. early on someone from hanne's organization had a post confirming this, by the way.if anyone is interested, please contact me off-line at elweyu@hotmail.comthanks and everyone's projects look fabulous. i've just finished gloria and i love the way it came out. if i ever get a camera ...
