last cat clothes post, i promise ;)


ok, here are the final cat products.  i am not as unhappy with them as i thought i would when i first began the project, but i'm still not crazy about them.  i look at them and see a thousand little things that should be tweaked, changed, re-done, etc. there are so many reasons why i don't like commissions, but one of the biggest reasons is that there's a point at which i have to stop re-working things in order to deliver the item in a timely manner and avoid putting so much time into the piece that i end up getting only a few dollars an hour. when it's my own project, i can stay with things as long as i want.  i can rip it apart and start from scratch if i want to.  i can go back to square one and spend weeks and weeks making something perfect.  well, i plan to start on some rennaissance garments for rain next, and maybe throw together a hand bag or two from materials i cut out months ago.  i'll get to focus on details and perfect things to my heart's content.  ;)( clicky for the costumes in their final formcollapse )

third time's the charm


here we go with my third try at selling these handbags on ebay.  listing fees are waived this month, so it seemed like a good idea to give it another try.  share the links if you know anyone who's interested in such things.  ( read more...collapse )
