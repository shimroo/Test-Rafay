spun silk web design - internet marketing consultant












why spun 
silk...?well now, in reply to that, i could very easily 
paraphrase dorothy from the wizard of oz... 
"lions, and tigers, and bears...oh 
my...spiders, and webs and silks...oh my"**
i could do so and probably get away with it. after all, the 
internet is in many ways, not unlike the 
mythical land of oz, a 
strange and wondrous place filled with strange and wondrous sights...a place of 
beauty and adventure where good and evil abide. a place where chaos occasionally 
reigns supreme, and hopefully a place from which we all return safely and 
somewhat wiser for the experience. yes, i surely could paraphrase dorothy, but 
that was not what i had in mind when i decided upon spun silk as the name for my 
company. 
so, if not because spiders, webs and silks all seem to fit together, or 
because of any nebulous parallels between oz and the internet, then why spun 
silk? the answer is really quite simple. silk, (and spider silk in particular) 
despite it's beautiful, delicate, often artistic appearance is the strongest 
natural fiber known....and like silk, spun silk web design offers you a 
distinctive combination of functional beauty and strength. 
my name is teresa thomas bohannon and i am spun silk web design. my resume 
contains a successful work history of award winning sales, marketing and 
promotion, and features a substantial thread of professional presentations in a 
variety of media. in addition, i have ma and my phr, i am a published author of both fiction and nonfiction stories and articles, and a former contributing board member, and referee of an internationally distributed professional journal. 
as owner and chief designer for spun silk, i have developed an extensive 
library of borders, backgrounds, fonts, and images... many of which are my own 
original creations unavailable anywhere else on the web. furthermore, i offer an 
absolute delight in the custom creation and design of web sites, intensive daily 
study of internet marketing techniques, and the proud fact that spun silk has 
never had a dissatisfied customer. you can easily entrust your web design and 
marketing needs elsewhere, but you have my personal guarantee that you will not 
find anyone willing to work more joyfully, or more willing to treat your 
business interests with utmost importance. 
so there you have it, hiring spun silk gives you all the advantages of adding 
a professional writer, trained researcher, award winning salesperson, webmaster 
and internet marketing consultant to your staff...without adding the expense of 
a single employee to your weekly payroll. 
the decision is yours, and whatever you decide, i wish you the best of 
luck and sincerely welcome you to this wondrous place. i hope you learn to love 
it as much as i do; and, of course, that you find your way safely home again.**** 


** if imitation is the highest form of flattery, then i should be flattered indeed. i first wrote this little paraphrased ditty over 23 years ago and since that time it has been stolen by people all over the internet.****someone asked me why i keep this old fashioned web page up when i'm trying to sell my design services and the answer to that is probably quite unique.i'm very sentimental, and twenty-three years ago, this simple little web page allowed me to earn a living and support my two sons without benefit of child support or social services. it means more to me as it stands, than anything else in my life that i have ever done.  and besides, these days i work a full time job elsewhere and spend what time i have to spare...writing and working on my own websites, and so, unless it is a project that really sparks my interest, i very seldom ever take on a new client.now...before you ask...and believe me, people often do...this domain name is not for sale. as i stated in the beginning, i'm very sentimental :)i sincerely, thank you for your interest in spun silk web design.  the internet truly does hold a world of possibilities for personal growth and enrichment and i hope you will be as happy here as i have been over the years.
