“
it’s been approximately three years since we purchased a vactor ramjet from standard equipment company. our staff couldn’t be happier with the performance of the machine. the ease of operation and the functionality of the instrumentation is unparalleled. we have had virtually no problems with the machine. the customer service that standard equipment has provided the village through the years has been amazing.
jeff wolfgram, superintendent of utility division, village of wheeling


“
we have been a customer of standard equipment since we started pipeline televising 7 years ago.  the sales staff is very knowledgeable about both the equipment and software.  the equipment itself is of high quality and the reporting programs are very good and easy to use.  i can’t say enough about the service.  we are a small company and standard does whatever they can to get our equipment back in service as soon as possible with minimal expense. 
they have been great to work with in all aspects of the process.
cindy gustafson, pe, president, j.a.c.k. contractor services, inc.
