do you know someone with a personal 
        hygeine problem such as bad breath? 
 problems 
        such as bad breath and body odor are serious problems for 
        a lot of people. unfortunately, most people do not even know that they 
        have these problems. when told, people have the tendency to correct these 
        problems and change their lives for the better. our 
        job is to help you make someone's life better.
with our letter packages, you can politely 
        inform someone of their problem anonymously. this letter comes with 
        a gift to reinforce the message. for instance, we will send a letter informing 
        this person of their bad breath and we will enclose some mouthwash and 
        toothpaste for further reinforcement. here's what one of our customers 
        had to say about our service:

testimonial:  "this 
          website is the best. i was able to let my friend know about his bad 
          breath problem without compromising our relationship. his bad breath 
          has also gone away which makes him an easier person to be around, but 
          i'm just glad that this problem is no longer negatively affecting 
          his life"
