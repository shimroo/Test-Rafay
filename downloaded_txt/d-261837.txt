reclaimed redwood



sustainable alternatives for your building project



and other western soft woods 







































established in 1986we are suppliers of pacific coast softwood lumber, primarily reclaimed redwood, western red cedar and douglas-fir; wood that we carefully dismantle from structures whose useful life has ended. this includes sawmills, warehouses, industrial buildings, houses and barns. these buildings contain old growth timbers logged in the latter 1800's or early part of last century when big trees were plentiful and only the best were selected for harvest.

what is reclaimed wood?



reclaimed redwood timbers are materials grown in another age, some as far back as 2000 years ago. they are highly valued in traditional japanese joinery, timber framing, as well as in furniture, fireplace mantles, outdoor trellises, benches, walkways, arbors, fine jointery and exterior and foundation grade applications where redwood's unsurpassed qualities of rot and bug resistance will ensure that the wood will remain strong and stable for years and years.
