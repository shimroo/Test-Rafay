tnet mail email transition faq
can i use my spam filtered account during the transition?
yes, keep using your account as you normally would everyday until we notify you.
will i lose my email address?
no!  your email address will not change.
how do i access my account after the switchover?
if you login via webmail nothing will change at all in how you access your account.
if you access your email via a mail client like microsoft outlook or mozilla thunderbird, these clients will automatically grab the correct settings to make it as painless as possible to set up.
smartphones will require some settings changes, but we’ll have detailed guides on our website to help you out.
what in my account will be migrated?
your email and contacts will be migrated to the new platform.
can i access my new account now?
no, we will notify you when your new account becomes available.
how much time is required to set up my account?
you’ll be able to master the basics — sending and receiving email and viewing and scheduling meetings — very quickly. if you are using an email client such as outlook or thunderbird, you will need to remove and add the account again fresh.  it will automatically pull the correct settings for you and synchronize your mail again.  you may reference our configuration guide to walk you through the configuration settings if you run into any problems.  and you can always just give us a call at 573-443-3983, and we’ll walk you through it over the phone.
