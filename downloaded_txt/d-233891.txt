the d-house. the d stands for distinction. this house designed by atelier design group is a blend of clean contemporary home design and elegant casual living that also appeals to those looking for a modern house design. open flowing spaces lend this home plan to its uncanny ability to entertain large or small groups yet create intimacy for its owners. the great room opens to the rear via a wall of pocketing glass sliding doors, to the pool deck. the kitchen incorporates a center island for prep and serving while the adjacent dining area features a glass bay window and built-in bench for seating.  the rich, limited exterior palette of materials makes this home striking yet warm. #architect #whatanarchitectdoes #architecture #house #home #design #luxury #homesweethome #luxuryhomes #dreamhome #homedesign #housedesign #luxurylifestyle #building #dwell #arquitectura #aia #construction #casas #architect #beautiful #housegoals #landscape #love #architecturelovers #villa #buildings #newhome #lifestyle #palmcoast #flagler #florida #modern #contemporary #contemporaryhoemdesign #distinction #newamericanhome #atelierdesigngroup

 coastal life























coastal architecture: a guide to designing your dream beach housethere's nothing quite like the feeling of living in a beach house. the sound of the waves crashing on the shore, the smell of the salty air, and the endless views of the ocean can be so relaxing and rejuvenating. if you're you're dreaming of owning one someday, you'll want to make sure that it's designed to be as comfortable as possible.one of the most important elements of coastal architecture is the use of light. beach houses are often located in areas with plenty of natural light, so it's important to take advantage of that by designing windows that let in plenty of sunshine.of course, no beach house would be complete without a porch or deck. this is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the views and unwind.designed by: atelier design group#architect #whatanarchitectdoes #architecture #classycoastal #palmcoast #residentialdesign #flaglerbeach #flagler #floridaliving #customhomes #classycoastal #residence #coastalhome #floridalife #customhouse #coustomehome #coastalliving #beach #beachlife #saltlife #luxurylifestyle #luxuryhomes #luxuryhome #ocean #oceanfront #oceanliving #beachliving #beachstyles #atelierdesigngroup
