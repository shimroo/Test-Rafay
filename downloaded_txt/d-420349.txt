making it official


					as has become obvious, my time documenting the redevelopment of {insert preferred neighborhood name here} has come to an end.at some point i will rebuild the site with more of an eye toward looking-back-at-change compared to watching-change-happen. but the lightbulb on how to do that hasn't turned on yet.it was an amazing run, and thank you to everyone who read the site, commented on the site (i already miss you guys!), sent tips, and helped me learn the ropes of commercial real estate and zoning and whatnot.i took my first pictures of the neighborhood in the fall of 1999, so 1999-2020 was a pretty good run.i still tweet out little tidbits of neighborhood news if they strike my fancy, and am always available on twitter for questions and general merriment.not a bad little hobby, as it turned out.

meet the new year, same as the old year


hi. you may remember me from such blog posts as "neighborhood to get baseball stadium" and "oooh, shake shack!" i am still here, reading all of your comments, but alas, i remain very deep in tracking the ongoing global catastrophe while now adding in trying and failing to harness my incoherent rage at wednesday's national catastrophe. i can however steal a few moments at least to open up a new thread for the jdland commentariat to keep passing along news and tidbits while i toil away at retrieving and database-ing cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and now vaccinations, while bracing myself for what the coming weeks will bring, both in covidland and in insurrectionistland.stay safe, everybody.

roundup of some recent retail and public space items


for those who haven't visited the neighborhood since, oh, let's say march, progress has not fully ground to a halt. (even if blogging about it has.) the jdland auxiliary backup camera (better known as a pixel 3) took a long-delayed stroll on friday evening to capture some changes, and to also see that, with a dining landscape built from the beginning to take advantage of outdoor space, most restaurants were pretty hopping with a young crowd. (not a lot of masks seen on others wandering the neighborhood, i will say.)two of the new offerings along half street just north of nats park are now open--atlas brew works (with andy's pizza) and cold stone creamery--even while half street itself is still very much not finished with its streetscape remodel. i also scoped out toastique, which has moved into the old juice laundry space on 4th street se between tingey and water. (i completely forgot to get a photo of bammy's, the "caribbean-inspired" restaurant that replaced whaley's in the lumber shed at yards park.)  
 the rest of the new-storefront news is pretty much in the personal care category (how apropos!), with the cvs at half and i se looking like it is seconds away from opening, in its spot next door to the new(ish) medstar primary care office. meanwhile, over at 4th and m, pivot physical therapy has now opened. (and there are those of us who would say that the new hill spirits liquor store at half and k next to bonchon also qualifies as personal care.)  and while there's no storefront to take a photo of yet, the news came out this week that scissors and scotch, the barbershop-slash-cocktail-bar "grooming experience every man deserves" is coming to the ground floor of the national broadcasters association headquarters at one m street, se. meanwhile, there's also a few public space updates worth including, even if the photos from late in the evening aren't really so fab. as mentioned above, the streetscape work continues on half street north of the ballpark, and there are indeed stringed lights being installed across it (old zoning restrictions be damned, i guess). and look, trees! over at the yards, tingey square is finished (and you can also see the latest progress on the chemonics hq in the background). and the new walkway connecting the tingey square area to the yards park is now open as well, with rough/uneven stones clearly placed to discourage high-speed biking or scootering (watch your ankles, old folks). it also leads to a new plaza on the northwest corner of the yards park.  it should also be mentioned that the recent unpleasantness has not been without casualties, with the aforementioned juice laundry and also peet's coffee at new jersey and m and the clothing store willow at 4th and water closing for good. at some point i'll pull together a holes-and-skeletons-and-completions construction update, but not until i can do some daytime wandering with collapsing from heat stroke.

inching from quarantining to reopening, open thread


i continue to shirk my duties here, as i am still spending vast amounts of time on the covid-19 numbers beat for the post. but i wanted to post some links if you haven't yet found them on where to keep up with the current status of things, including what's open, what might be open, what could be opening, etc.the capitol riverfront bid has a listing all of the open restaurants and how you can patronize them, and has a similar one for neighborhood retail outlets.charles allen's twitter feed provides ward 6 news and guidance (and is also reminding you to return your census questionnaire and also to request your dc vote by mail ballot by may 26).you can read the daily coronavirus updates from the dc government and look at all of their data viz on case demographics, etc.you can also read the latest news and dig into current case and death numbers for the dmv with the post's local tracker, (shameless plug since it's my work that gets the numbers into it)plus, you can read the jdland comments threads, as readers continue on-the-ground reports while i remain deeply involved in my numbers racket.and you can wear masks and avoid indoor gatherings so that we can get a smidge further down the road to whatever the next phase will be.with that, i return you to your holiday weekend, and i will return to the numbers. stay safe, everyone.

checking in from my bunker, and an open thread


when last i put a tidbit up on the site, on march 9, i mentioned a few new retail announcements, then added this: "[b]ut with the current news of the world, i think any forward-looking items now need to be viewed through the edges of an n95 respirator and a collapsing stock market." i'm sure a few people thought that was a little over the top, but now, nearly seven weeks later, i think the scope of not only the health impact of covid-19 but the societal and economic impact is becoming clearer, even to those who don't own prophet of doom t-shirts like i do.this site is not only a site that looks backwards, with tens of thousands of photos, but it also spends a whole lot of time looking forward, at not only renderings of new buildings but also rumors and announcements of new restaurants, new bars, and new retail. and new baseball seasons.i think it's safe to say that anyone trying to predict what this little corner of the city is going to look like in three, six, nine, 12, or 60 months is on an ultimate fool's errand.we've already seen willow close at 4th and water, and the xfl (which looked on its way to being a healthy draw to audi field across the way) fold up its tent. how can any of us know how many of the restaurants and bars we have watched arrive over the past 15 years will make it through not only the current #stayathome world, but also a world that, until there is a vaccine and until that vaccine can be widely deployed, people will be weighing heavily any decision to go anywhere that might be remotely crowded? will every restaurant or bar that announced its plans to come to the neighborhood actually end up opening? do we really know when mlb will return, and under what strictures? how many people are going to decide that maybe having a little more personal space back out the 'burbs is a safer environment?if you think i am too doom-filled, i might pass along this article in the atlantic that does a very depressingly good job of imaging the sort of scenarios that are coming for american retail.construction still continues (essential workers?), and of course i have always been the queen of "we shall see" when it comes to projects and plans, but i think 'the hood, and dc, and the u.s., and the world are all one big "we shall see" right now. this is of course a big reason why i haven't been posting, and have been scarce around here and social media in general, but i'm also now the keeper of the numbers at the post for us cases and deaths, the numbers that power the big tracking map, plus i've had to build all manner of administration tools and other stuff as part of the cause. plus i'm old and so am pretty well bunkered in. anyway, the jdland commentariat continues with its perpetual discussions of tower cranes and movie theaters, and are also some good eyes and ears on the streets (where you'd better be wearing masks), so check in on the comment threads while you wonder whether the prophet of doom will again return. the answer is yes, of course, but only when there starts to be some concrete sense of where this is all heading. and even then, we shall see.stay safe and well, everybody.
