we saved a seat for you.sundays at 9:00am and 10:30amjoin us for a service





our latest sermon



the mysteries of the crossfebruary 9, 2025join us as pastor scott uncovers the mysteries of the cross: why it was hidden from the wise and powerful, how it is revealed to those who are spiritually discerning, and how it is key to our salvation. how does the wisdom of god revealed through the mystery of the cross contrast with the wisdom of this world, as explained in 1 corinthians 2:6-16?
