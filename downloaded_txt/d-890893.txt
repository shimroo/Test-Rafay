in march 2005, i moved from durham
(and durham university)
to
work for
computing services
at the university of oxford.
for the first 16 months,
i spent half of my time working for
oss watch,
but i then switched to working full time for computing services.
i retired in september 2010.

in 2001, i got obsessed with
running
doing 149 races in 3.5 years.
i then obtained a problem with my knee.
in december 2007,
i started running again,
gradually
increasing my training from 1.4m to 6.3m.
i'm now racing again, but my times are 10% slower!

even though i now live in oxfordshire,
i maintain a
list of future races in north east england at
www.northeastraces.com.
this is frequently accessed by people in that area.

my main obsession at the moment is to run/walk all the 
footpaths of oxfordshire.
there is more about this project at
www.oxonpaths.com.

some information about earlier projects

whilst at durham,
i wrote several 
papers
about java, php, xml, c#, .net and web services.
i also wrote a
book about programming in java:
it's called
understanding java.

in 2005, i did a walk i've called
the
d'arcy dalton circular;
in 2006, i walked the oxfordshire way;
in 2007, i invented and walked 
the south oxfordshire way;
and in 2008 i walked the 
kennet and avon canal.

i still have my scrapbook from 1958 which contains
210 pressed wildflowers.
in 2007, i created
a digital wildflower scrapbook.

on red nose day in 2009,
a few of us from computing services
at oxford university did a 8.8 mile run
visiting all 44 colleges of
the university.
use this link to see
where we went.
dominic hargreaves recorded our run by taking 
photos of us at each of the 44 colleges.
here's a link to
some other photos.
thanks to people's generosity in sponsoring me, 
205 pounds has been given to comic relief.


i enjoy my holidays.
my latest
photos
are from a trip
walking the length of lanzarote
and
a recent trip to the
kruger national park in south africa.
