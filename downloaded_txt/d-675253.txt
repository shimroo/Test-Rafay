howdy, partner!
here at sundance riding stables, we offer horseback riding for riders of all skill levels. if you’ve ever dreamed of being a cowboy or cowgirl, wondered what it’s like to have a horse, or just feel like riding, stop on by for an hour guided trail ride on our 200 acres of scenic countryside. you may even see some deer or turkeys while you’re on the trail!
want to polish up your riding skills? we also provide riding lessons at sundance stables for individuals or groups. also, if you have a horse and it needs a nice place to stay, we offer stall and pasture boarding. as a boarder here, you will have access to our groomed trails, one of the largest indoor arenas in the midwest, and two large outdoor arenas. our facilities are also available for horse shows, rodeos, and other special events.
we have several picnic sites equipped with fire pits that are great for birthdays, family reunions, company parties, or just a bonfire with your friends. we are a fun and affordable place to be for some great family fun!
