“how 
                the heck do you grow that inside?”
my neighbors, 
                bill and linda, stood at the door amazed by my lush house plants. 
                “wow, you really have a green thumb!” they exclaimed 
                in admiration. 
then linda sighed, 
                “i sure wish i could grow house plants like this – 
                but it’s just so…hard.”
i smiled. “are

                a little secret resource…”
