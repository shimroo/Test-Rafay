patient testimonials


i have had some horrible experiences in the past years at this hospital. this recent experience was so much better. the nurses and dr‚Äôs went above and beyond. i hope and pray they keep getting rid of the people that make the experience not so pleasant and replace them with more people that does go above and beyond.  all the nurses were lovely and amazing. they made my stay at the hospital easier.the whole stay was outstanding, from the moment i was admitted to the time i was discharged. i have no complaints. nurse eva and other overnight nurses i had were both were very good. lab technician that drew my blood in emergency room was phenomenal. the emergency room staff was wonderful, the nursing staff on nights was wonderful. doctors and the staff helping with angiogram were phenomenal, and the ultrasound technician was wonderful.  was on vacation in vegas with my adult daughter when she got sick. having lupus i‚Äôve been to a lot of hospitals and north vista was by far one of the best. as a retired rn i know how hectic and overwhelming covid has been to all hospitals. the staff is welcoming, and the nurses are friendly and great at their jobs. they even had this lady michelle check in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. it was scary being away from home but they made the hospital stay the best it could be and took great care of my daughter. i‚Äôm grateful for north vista!  is very hard to find a reliable caring hospital when we are out of town and our comfort zone and then we fall ill. i was scared and in pain.but the nurses and staff here made me feel at ease from the very first time they saw me. they listened to my issue and swiftly took care of me. üòç i got nothing but great things to say about north vista hospital. excellent patient care. !! thank you !  my sister had a surgery on north vista hospital. was an outstanding experience! i dare say that 95% of the medical team was extraordinarily friendly, kind, empathetic. it is felt that they are committed and interested in your well-being. it felt like family. from the moment i entered the hospital with my sister and the young bernice from admissions received her by name, my surprise began. while waiting for my sister‚Äôs surgery i walked around a bit and i meet cathy m in the hallway, walking and waving to her colleagues. i loved the energy of her and had to greet her and tell her about the positive vibe in the hospital and i still hadn‚Äôt experienced how amazing the rest of the stay would be.
