                  potto populations in the wild, in rescue facilities,
                  to pure breeding of correctly identified stock and
                  adequate care in captivity, and as a general support
                  for researchers and other interested users. it
                  includes information about taxonomy, distribution,
                  differences between described populations, threat,
                  survey methods, captive care, handrearing, diseases
                  and behaviour. the population database includes
                  illustrated information about measuring standards for
                  mammals.
