about the owner
my grandfather first travelled to orcas island on a fishing trip in the 70's and purchased a lot near rosario resort in 1979. he purchased another lot in the 1980's and built his retirement home in 1992. i spent my childhood visiting my grandparents and spending summer vacations on the island. my parents have since inherited that home, and my wife and i were eventually married at rosario resort on rosario point.
