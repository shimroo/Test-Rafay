the issue americans are close to defenseless against the hidden toxics that have infiltrated our everyday lives. there are toxic ingredients in consumer goods, lead from paint and pipes in our homes, and toxic facilities emitting harmful chemicals into our air and water. we know that these chemicals have profound lifelong impacts. they contribute to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, infertility, birth defects and other health problems. they poison aquatic life and warm the planet’s atmosphere. the challengeclean+healthy’s challenge is to stop the flow of these toxic chemicals at the start, especially to those populations most impacted, such as black, indigenous, and other communities of color. many people are unaware of the complicated chemical policies and laws that critically affect their families and communities. along with a network of collaborators, clean+healthy is advocating tirelessly on both federal and state levels to bring enduring policy and market reform, chemical regulation, and transparency. our goalour ultimate goal is to create a just and sustainable society, in which every community and neighborhood is free of toxic chemicals. please join clean+healthy in this urgent challenge, by supporting us and adding your voice to our movement to clean.

the landscapein the 1970s, the federal government enacted major legislation to address the consequences of harmful chemicals in our economy. the clean air act, the clean water act, toxic substances control act and programs to clean up hazardous waste sites and other environmental protection laws, had lofty goals. some were realized; many were not. the past administration rolled back nearly 100 environmental protections of air, water, and land. federal laws and regulations on chemicals in food, drugs, and cosmetics are also outdated and inadequate. systemic racism and loopholes in these laws has resulted in the weight of policy failures to fall disproportionately on black, indigenous, and other people of color.the leadership of new york statenew york state is a large, influential state whose chemical policy decisions have significant national impact. new york has enacted laws that go beyond federal laws in addressing environmental and public health concerns. it has invested in broad toxic waste cleanup efforts. it has enacted restrictions on chemicals of concern. it has created and resourced the environmental protection fund and expanded funding for environmental health and justice. but there is opportunity and need to do so much more. as a national advocacy leader based in new york state, clean+healthy believes that progress in our state benefits its residents while playing a leading role in fostering healthy futures that are just, nontoxic, and regenerative.
