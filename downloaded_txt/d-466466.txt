products

























coaxial switches
dow-key coaxial rf switches are employed in rf testing equipment and large rf communication systems and networks to efficiently route microwave signals or rf energy within a transmission line. our coaxial rf switches route rf signals over a broad bandwidth from dc to 40 ghz, and are now offered with a low pim option to improve passive intermodulation levels from -110dbc (standard switch) to -160dbc.

waveguide
waveguide switches are designed to route extremely high power signals over a narrow bandwidth at low to high frequencies, making them highly applicable to space applications. to meet this market demand, mpg's dow-key expanded its product line and engineering capabilities in 1993, with the acquisition of the transco space qualified products, augmenting our own industry heritage in hi-rel space programs with an extended line of waveguide switching solutions.

high repeatability switches
high repeatability switches are designed to stand up to rigorous requirements over an extended lifecycle. dow-key microwave’s reliant line of high repeatability switches meets these basic requirements with a dependable and economical switching solution, backed by decades of design and manufacturing innovation.

high power switches
mpg switch line of high power rf & microwave switches fit applications where electromechanical switches fail to meet the size, cost and speed of project specifications. at microwave frequencies, a high power switch acts as a current-controlled resistor, allowing current to flow in a single direction. when forward biased, the switch relay behaves as a closed circuit, but when the current is reverse biased, the rf switch becomes an open circuit.
