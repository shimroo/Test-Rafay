security planning for organizations without it departments
greg hill, june 15, 2014


                                    within businesses, security issues, and their consequences for the general public, saturate the news. with large organizations,
                                    even those with substantial budgets, well financed it/is departments and resources dedicated
                                    to system security, often do not do an appreciably better job than smaller enterprises with fewer
                                    resources and either no plan or a largely ineffective one. most recently ebay and target are
                                    alarming examples, and although those garner the most attention, as destructive both financially
                                    and to public peace of mind, the area of greatest concern is largely overlooked. these are the
                                    entities homeland security defines as critical infrastructure, ?the backbone of our nation?s
                                    economy, security and health.? this paper will examine the threats to which these types of organizations
                                    are vulnerable, as well as the common mistakes being made that increase their susceptibility
                                    to the risks. poorly planned and ineffectively implemented security measures may result in unintended
                                    consequences such as the loss of productivity and business confidentiality will also be examined.
                                    finally, a template for developing an effective security plan will be included.
