whoops! i accidentally wrote a short story!





i'm not yet happy with the two novels i've been working on, so last month i started writing my first-ever short story in an attempt to recharge my creativity. it was a great writing exercise, and the story came out so well that i have published it at amazon's kindle store. here's the product description for "living it up in fiddly falls":
she might be as old as the hills, but she's not dead. so what is maryann flemming's obituary doing on page 4 of the fiddly falls citizens gazette?


folksy and fun, this 7,000-word short story is a quick read featuring christian themes and a touch of romance. download it now to enjoy during your next coffee break or at bedtime. (goes great with cookies!)

the blogger is (mostly) off-duty





i'm now updating this blog only sporadically, but as there are 1,004 posts (going way back to december of 2004), these pages still get a great deal of traffic from google and other search engines. i know that some of you riding in on those links will check to see if i'm still blogging, so i just want to say: no, not really. but thanks for asking.

if you want to connect with me, here's how to do that:

if you're not a spammer, shoot a message to mail@brendacoulter.com. i'll usually reply within 24 hours.

for daily chatter and tons of photos of my cottage-style flower gardens, check out my facebook profile and my twitter feed.

...and of course you're welcome to leave a comment on this blog post.
if you'd like to view information about my books, please visit my website.

when i have news about new book releases and so on, i'll be sure to post here. if you don't want to miss those updates, it might be a good idea to subscribe to this rss feed or sign up for e-mail notifications of new posts. (you'll find the little sign-up box thingies in the column at right.)

thanks so much for stopping by no rules. just write. if you'd like to check out some of the 1,004 other posts, knock yourself out. you can locate entries by specific months and years by using the handy drop-down box at the bottom of the right-hand column. there's also a search box down there.

one-minute video: my front garden at night





on balmy summer evenings, i enjoy sitting on the bench behind the fountain in my lighted front garden. the splashing and burbling of water against a background of cicada music is immensely soothing. but last night the pink four-o'clocks and the orange crocosmia were practically glowing in the dark, making the garden a delight for my eyes as well as my ears. in an attempt to share some of that magic with other garden lovers, i grabbed my camera and made this very short video.

crazy in love with japanese anemones






(this "golden oldie" nrjw post was originally published on august 20, 2009.)


i wonder why ogden nash never wrote a poem about japanese anemones? the words roll trippingly off the tongue and suggest all kinds of delicious rhymes:

japanese anemones.
see them dancing in the breeze.

they're my favorite late-summer flowers. their strong, graceful stems rise high over lovely mounds of foliage to offer up unscented, nearly translucent flowers featuring adorable green-ball centers surrounded by egg-yolk-yellow ruffs. i mean, just look at these beauties.

i must plant some more of these
japanese anemones.
the whites are charming, but i think
i should also have some pink.


[so far, i haven't planted any pink ones because i have so many pink roses in the front garden. but my white anemones have grown and spread and this year (2013) they're more delightful than ever.]
