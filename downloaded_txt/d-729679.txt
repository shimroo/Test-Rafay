 welcome to camelot (please bear with us during our web rebuild)  as you can tell, we are very passionate about the dogue de bordeaux. the dogue de bordeaux is a magnificent and ancient breed, but it's not a breed for everyone. our love affair with the dogue began in 2000, when we adopted our first dogue, monet, through rescue. we purchased our first show dog in 2003, then later imported what we feel are some of the best blood lines from around the world to lay the foundation of our program. we continue to be very active in rescue, showing and breed education.  all of our dogues are completely health tested and must pass our strict requirements in addition to preferably having championship titles on them before we even consider breeding. potential mates for our dogues must also pass the same requirements we have set for our own dogues. our goal in our program is to produce the highest quality and healthiest dogues available in the united states. the dogue de bordeaux is a guardian breed dog and are not for everyone. they can be dominant, stubborn and dog aggressive (usually same sex aggressive) and there are a lot of health issues with in the breed. they must be part of your family. they are not dogs that should live outside. they must have obedience training. anyone considering a dogue must be prepared for what they may get. again, the dogue is not a breed for just anyone. please research both the breed and the breeder if you are considering adding a dogue to your home. if you are looking to add a companion to your family, please consider one of the many rescues that are available across the country.
