home page



we have retired from the nursery business.  we have stopped exporting from the u.s.a. and the mail order sales even within the u.s.a. have halted.  this past summer's were the last walk-in sales here at the garden.  our credit card account and toll-free number have been discontinued.  we really are hanging up the harness.  it may take some time for us to get the web site completely converted to strictly informational materials, but that is the eventual goal.

visit our garden and greenhouse
during the clivia bloom season in march
and during daylily season in july

the garden is located in westfield, indiana, about 25 miles north of downtown indianapolis [click
here for regional map].  to visit us, follow state road 32 east from the intersection with us 31 at westfield for 1.5 miles to grassy branch road.  there is a traffic signal at the intersection. follow grassy branch north for about 1/4 mile. the gardens are on the west side of the road, at 17808 (house number is on the mailbox at the roadside).  [click
here for local map.]


visits by appointment only:  p.o. box 92, westfield in 46074.  our peak clivia bloom season is usually in march.  our iris collection blooms mostly in may.  our peak daylily bloom season is usually late june and early and mid july.  since we are looking for extra-early and very late blooming varieties of daylilies, you can expect to see some daylilies in bloom from mid-may through mid-september.
