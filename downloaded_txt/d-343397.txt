 welcome to

have you met natasha?

what's
new
after our loss of niko in april, 2017 we knew we needed another german shepherd dog!  we began a search and found german shepherd rescue & adoptions,
a german shepherd rescue organization adopting in north carolina, south
carolina and virginia.  thru them we found trigger, a one year old
bundle of energy.  after a background check that would make a top
secret clearance proud we were approved to adopt him, and on june 5th
he became part of our household.  after a year we decided trigger
needed a friend and we went back to gsra 
and found kosma, a gsd/husky mix.  luckily, as former gsra adopters
we had a little quicker background process and kosma came to us in
april 2018.

niko & natasha - together forever





it's time to change our tax system!

 what is the fairtax plan?
the fairtax plan is a
comprehensive proposal that replaces all federal income and payroll
based taxes with an integrated approach including a progressive
national retail sales tax, a prebate to ensure no american pays federal
taxes on spending up to the poverty level, dollar-for-dollar federal
revenue replacement, and, through companion legislation, the repeal of
the 16th amendment. this nonpartisan legislation (hr 25/s 296)
abolishes all federal personal and corporate income taxes, gift,
estate, capital gains, alternative minimum, social security, medicare,
self-employment taxes and replaces them with one simple, visible,
federal retail sales tax administered primarily by existing state sales
tax authorities. the irs is disbanded and defunded. the fairtax taxes
us only on what we choose to spend on new goods or services, not on
what we earn. the fairtax is a fair, efficient, transparent, and
intelligent solution to the frustration and inequity of our current tax
system.
