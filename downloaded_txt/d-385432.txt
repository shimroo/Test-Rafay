vci smp technology



vci smp (speedy moisture passivation) technology passivates the metal’s surface as well as deactivates the humidity surrounding the metal components. they have sufficient vapour pressure to evaporate and travel to mix with the humidity and essentially reach the surface of the metal. 20% of the vci chemical reacts within 6 hours and balance in 5-15 years.
