 thank you for making the effort to learn how to take better care of your horse.  a lot of us that were previously overwhelmed when our horse got laminitis now know that some fairly simple steps can make a huge difference to manage this case and prevent it from happening to other horses. 

  

articles about sugar in grass and hay, laminitis, equine metabolic syndrome, ppid, and pssmgo to articles 

 

safergrass.org has been a highly regarded source of information about managing horses with laminitis for 20 years. if you value this information, please consider donating to maintain this website.  yes, i’d like to help 

 

join my blog to stay current on new science as it becomes available and read in-depth discussion on topics related to managing horses with metabolic diseases.  go to the  blog
