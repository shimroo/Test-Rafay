let’s rondy!
since 1935, fur rendezvous – known locally as fur rondy – has proudly represented the pioneering spirit of alaskans. in addition to more than 20 official cultural and sporting activities, the anchorage community hosts nearly 50 rondy round town events, offering wacky winter fun for all ages.







choose your pinthe first rondy pins were created in 1939. each year, artists compete to design the official pin and local students do the same in a booster button contest. these pins and buttons become collector’s items; some are worth thousands of dollars.pins/buttons
