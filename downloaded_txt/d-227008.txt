"kress foundation grant to support collaborative research on pigment trade"
sarah k. rich, associate professor of art history, and the center for virtual/material studies (cvms) at penn state have been awarded a kress history of art grant of $20,000, along with supplemental funding from penn state university libraries, to facilitate research into the transatlantic trade in pigments from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century.
the grant will support a collaborative research project titled “the political economy of colorants in the atlantic world, 1750-1850.” the project aims to uncover the economic and political contexts of the colorant trade in the americas, europe and africa, highlighting the relationships among artists and different trades while also situating colorants in the context of indigenous-settler relationships and the slave trade. colorants are dyes and pigments used for coloring materials.

art history, b.a.
2016



brisa smith flores earned three degrees, art history, history, and global and international studies, along with three minors in african american studies, latin american studies, and latino/a studies. brisa received a masters of liberal arts degree from the university of pennsylvania. her thesis, "the art of ethnic lynching: the erasure of the afro-mexican from the national identity of mexico" analyzes how art and visual culture can be weaponized to maintain white supremacy. during her time in philadelphia, she worked for the association for public art and the philadelphia museum of art. now, she is a graduate student at the university of california, los angeles in the world arts and culture/dance department, pursuing a phd in culture and performance. her dissertation topic explores the ways museums are part of the legacy of colonialism and how communities of the african diaspora across the global south are challenging or reimaging how museums represent culture and identity. she has presented her research at major conferences such as the association of black women historians symposium, the association for the study of the worldwide african diaspora, and the international conference on the inclusive museum. brisa also serves as the graduate fellow for the ucla prison education program, a program that provides interdisciplinary for-credit courses in correctional facilities across los angeles.
