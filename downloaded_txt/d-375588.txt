“




well this is my final visit with the doctor. i must say he is exactly the way that other people depicted him to be.  he's warm, kind even empathetic.  he's can really see and understand what i was going through.  he has no problem waiting and repeating instructions as you write them down (which i encourage that you do). being in pain and having ur life turned upside down from someone else's mistake is hard. so i say all this to say....you ate in good hands. another satisfied patient.

my husband has been going to dr. gross for years.
dr. gross is  quirky and has  a funny sense of humor, just like my husband and they have a great patient doctor relationship.

we moved to another state and dr. gross is such a gifted doctor my husband actually flies back to his appointments. he refuses to see any other doctor.

dr. gross is an amazing doctor, well informed with tons of medical knowledge. he has healed my husband from a major back injury years ago.

the office staff is amazing.

i would highly recommend dr. gross.

dr. gross has been my workers compensation dr. for some 3 years now.  he is wonderfully easy to talk to.  he did an amazing job on my left knee replacement.  he dose not push drugs and really cares about his patients.
