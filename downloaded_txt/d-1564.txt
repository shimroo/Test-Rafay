the high quality and effectiveness of our courses is because we focus only on italian, we are dedicated to a single language only. our learning resources are produced by teachers of italian with years of experience and before being used online are tested in the classes of our partner schools.



 


iluss offers the possibility to combine the online iluss self-studying variety of learning resources with one to one online italian lessons. with iluss you can learn by yourself and using the same iluss learning material you can practice online with your personal teacher. iluss italian language update school service is a non-profit organisation which promotes the italian language and culture abroad. membership fees enable us to cover our administrative costs and to continue providing new learning materials.
