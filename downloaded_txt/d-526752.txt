organic by nature
nhgold is a new hampshire company that produces pure maple products for everyone to enjoy. our products are produced with experience and knowledge passed down through the generations. sap is gathered from the maple trees on ancestral acres, the family owned farm of a family and boiled down to the perfect consistency at the sugarhouse in a traditional method. by following these traditions, we assure that you will enjoy the taste you would expect from quality maple products that are minimally processed and organic by nature!
in addition to maple syrup, we also produce maple cream, maple candy and granulated maple sugar.
