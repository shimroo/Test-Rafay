our mission














































so our children grow up... healthy, safe & strong.




























































children are born healthy




when children are born healthy, their opportunities soar. they are more likely to reach their developmental milestones, succeed in school and become thriving adults. that’s why we aim to ensure pregnant women have access to early, consistent care – and continued support if they need it, like prenatal services and home visits from a nurse. because a healthy mother is more likely to have a healthy baby.

children are safe from abuse and neglect




an abused child, a neglected child, cannot trust the adults around them. they cannot take normal, developmental risks. they cannot focus in school if they are always on alert for the next threat. they cannot develop healthy relationships. that’s why we offer behavioral health counseling, neighborhood support, legal guidance and other vital services to families at risk. because, as the saying goes: “it is easier to build strong children than repair broken men.”

children are ready for kindergarten




being ready for kindergarten means more than knowing your abcs and 123s. it means being able to sit patiently and listen. it means knowing how to take turns, express yourself and make friends. it means being eager and ready to learn. that’s why we support an array of early childhood education programs, from quality child care scholarships to home-visiting programs. because children who are ready for kindergarten are more likely to be reading on grade level by the end of third grade, and more likely to graduate.

children are able to access afterschool and summer programs




when children are safe, happy and engaged after school and during their summer, the adults in their lives can breathe a sigh of relief. they know they can work, or go to school, while their children gain confidence and discover new strengths – like robotics, fishing or dance. that’s why we fund quality afterschool and summer opportunities for school-age children, and support educational enhancements like stem/steam. because between school and home, there’s a whole world to explore.

children & families helped




our programs, services and initiatives serve all families across palm beach county – from boca raton to belle glade, from those expecting a baby to those raising a teen.

early care, afterschool & summer camp scholarships awarded




working families receive scholarships to help cover the cost of child care and afterschool for their children – freeing up dollars for other vital needs like food, housing and medicine.














mothers & young children served




our healthy beginnings programs are specifically designed to prepare families for a new baby, and help young children reach their developmental milestones so they are ready for school.
