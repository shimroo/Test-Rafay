    reggio-inspired
 the reggio emilia approach is an educational philosophy based on the premise that in the early years of development children are forming who they are as an individual. thus the program is based on the principles of respect, responsibility, and community through exploration and discovery in a supportive and enriching environment based on the interests of the children through a self-guided curriculum.

  "hilltop parent testimonial”
"our family has been with hilltop for three years and we absolutely love the experience and the community building with other like-minded families. this is a school unlike any other. the teachers use play-based learning to instill a love for learning among the children. with a nurturing approach, they prioritize the social and emotional development and problem solving among kids that builds their self-esteem and gives them the tools to become leaders. we highly recommend this school to any parent who is interested in learning about childhood development during their child's early years."- sandy

  "sending our children to hilltop is the best decision my husband and i have made as parents! the teachers are all unbelievably patient, intuitive and kind. hilltop understands the importance of unstructured play. it is a magical place where kids run barefoot, build forts, bake mud pies, create with loose parts, get soaked head to toe from water play and eat fennel straight from the vegetable garden. their philosophy is play based, child-led and encourages students to be self motivated learners.  if you value critical thinking skills and creativity over memorizing facts and tracing letters, this is the preschool for you! we are so grateful to have found this community”- thi
