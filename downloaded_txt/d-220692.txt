$81,400 in grants handed out
published june 12, 2010

the bakersfield californian foundation recently distributed grants totaling more than $81,400 to local nonprofit organizations in support of its mission to promote arts and educational programs throughout the city.
the family foundation, which operates independently of the newspaper, received about 40 grant applications throughout march and notified the recipients after a may 25 meeting of its board members, foundation administrator kaarin simpson said.
foundation president ginger moorhouse, who also serves as the publisher and chairman of the californian, said the privately funded nonprofit entity was established to build on the legacy of her great-grandfather, alfred harrell, who championed community philanthropy during his tenure as owner of the newspaper in the early 1900s.
the foundation has supported local groups for more than 25 years.
"it strengthens our community and promotes our quality of life," moorhouse said."the goal is to make our corner of the world a better place for everyone."

kids and critters day camp


the grant money awarded to the bakersfield spca allowed some 8 - 11 year old kids to get camperships to attend the first years' kids and critters day camp at the bakersfield spca. many of the kids would not have been able to attend otherwise. a week long day camp offered a basic introduction to responsible pet ownership for kids, 8 - 11 years of age. they enjoyed many daily activities including feeding the spca shelter animals, socializing shelter dogs, tips on grooming, first aid for pets and veterinary services. attached are 3 photos showing the kids getting the food bowls ready to do a daily feeding, picking out their companion dog for the week and wearing their spca day camp t-shirt along with their hand crafted marionette dog puppets. four weekly sessions were offered this inaugural year with high hopes for more next year.
