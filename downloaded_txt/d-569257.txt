approval for a consumer use loan is primarily based on two factors:
1. you have sufficient equity in your property to adequately secure the loan.
2. you can prove that you have enough income to repay the loan.

no credit check
we will never pull your credit report, and we will not know your credit score.

proof of income
federal and state laws require that we verify your ability to repay the loan. therefore, we will ask you to prove
								your income, generally with your most recent pay stub and your w2 from last year. work for yourself? you will most
								likely need to provide us with your tax returns. every situation is different. call us to find out more!

evidence of debts
because we do not pull your credit report, we will ask you to provide us with a written listing of all of your debts.
								the federal government requires that we verify those debts. therefore, we will ask you to provide us with the most
								recent billing statement for each of the listed debts. a note of caution, it is a federal crime, punishable by up
								to a $1,000,000 fine and 20 years in prison, to commit mortgage fraud. when we ask you to list your debts, we rely
								on you not to leave anything out.
							

underwriting
once we have proof of your income and your debts, we will look at the numbers and make sure that there is a reasonable
								likelihood that you can afford to repay the loan. because fairway is a private, "small-entity" lender,
								federal law gives us more leeway with our underwriting guidelines. generally speaking, if your debt-to-income ratio
								is less than 50%, then we can help. but sometimes we can go higher, so please call to find out more!

property inspection
we will make a full inspection of the property being offered as the security for the loan. there is never a cost to
								you for this inspection. but please be advised that this is not an appraisal or a valuation.

title insurance
once the inspection is done and the loan is approved, we will send you a loan commitment letter, wherein fairway commits
								to making you the loan. you will take this letter to a title company of your choosing. the title company will search
								your deed to make sure you have good title to your property. fairway can help you find a title company in your area.
								fairway will coordinate with your title company to setup the closing date and get you the money you need.
