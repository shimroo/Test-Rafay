              happy family holiday            


              we experienced awesome three--day beijing tour with colin. he was very knowledgeable about the history of the sites and also added witty humor to keep us entertained as we saw the tiananmena suare, the forbidden city, the great wall, the summer palace and other sites. the trip was memorable and the service was great. highly recommend.

              5d4n to beijing            


              was a well planned trip by china highlights with both yuni and may being very responsive and attentive to our online requests.
the local guide (mark) and driver are both experiemce and helpful too. help to avoid congested traffic and long q at attractions with well planned timing of setting off daily.
mark is knowledgeable in china history and brief us a lot on their history. he also helps to take many of our memorable pictures for our 25th anniversary. not to mention also their caring thought of giving us a bouquet of flowers on our anniversary too!
overall, is a good experience in beijing !
