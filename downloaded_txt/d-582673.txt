	 up to no good
    


my ability to manipulate documents has been tasked in many different ways in my life.  in high school i made a few fake id´s, though i never wound up using them.  my freshman year at biola i took student id´s of drew, brian weakly and i then pasted the photos on the cast of a night at the roxberry.  back at missouri state i make fake parking tickets to put on friends cars (probably just out of anger since i had accumulated 15 real parking tickets of my own).  then of course i had to manufacture some parking permits for our lovely apartment in santa ana which were never used as my car was stolen upon completion of the project.well now i´ve got a new sin to add to my document altering list.  it seems that the country of brazil requires a round trip ticket before you can apply for a visa.  the requirement is for you to bring in a round trip ticket or itinerary from your travel agent.  having neither i decided to hit up the nearest internet cafe and devise an itinerary for myself.  20 minutes later i had an itinerary in hard to present to the consulate.  it seems my skills were sufficient for the consulate to give me the go ahead and i will be picking up my visa on monday.  if i disappear into a brazilian jail then you probably know why now.just one request.  if i do disappear into a jail will someone please order a subscription of the socialist review for me.  it is free for inmates.

an explaination
you might find the name of this blog a bit strange, however it makes perfect sense to a small and tight-knit group of friends who often find now that college is over and they have all moved on with “life”, the only time that all their paths cross again is at weddings.  the title of this blog is not only a tribute to a wild, intoxicated night spent being pursued by a butchy park ranger in the backwoods of the wa (aka the "f'ing unknown) during a certain bachelor party, but also a tribute to life in general.  it may be an “f’ing uknown” but if we all make a point to grab a couple beers and meet up every now and again, we will get through it ok.
