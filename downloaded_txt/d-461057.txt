save water! at only $179.95, the eco-friendly hot water lobster instant hot water valve provides faster hot water which saves water, saves energy and saves time. how long does it take for hot water to get to your faucet or shower? a lot of precious water is wasted down the drain while waiting for hot water. even worse is the cost to heat the cold replacement water, which enters your house at the cold ground temperature.how it works! when the water in your pipes and the hot water lobster control valve cools below the user adjustable temperature (77-140 f. degrees), the thermal materials within the hot water lobster control valve contract and silently open the valve. thermal convection within your hot water tank (differential of pressure between the top of the tank and the bottom of the tank) naturally circulates the cooled water through your existing water pipes and back to your hot water tank for reheating. your hot water tank now uses less energy by reheating the warm water instead of cold ground temperature water. when hot water reaches the hot water lobster control valve, the valve automatically closes. this maintains hot water at the control valve without wasting water or wasting energy. turn on your faucet or shower and you get instant hot water instead of wasting water down the drain! installing the hot water lobster instant hot water control valve at the fixture furthest from your hot water tank (as shown in the installation diagram) will provide faster hot water to all of the fixtures in your house.no electricity necessary! the hot water lobster is all mechanical and designed to provide an electricity free solution to maintain hot water at the tap. this makes installation a snap (less than 10 minutes). other hot water solutions require the use of electricity and pumps that make installation difficult and the pumps are often noisy and wear out in 2-4 years.more hot water! adds as much as 10% more capacity to your current hot water system (by keeping the water stored in your hot water pipes hot!).keep pipes from freezing! the hot water lobster instant hot water valve automatically allows water in your pipes to circulate when the control valve cools below the set temperature (even if your electricity goes out). circulating water is less likely to freeze (especially when the water is warm).reduces condensation! the hot water lobster instant hot water valve reduces condensation on pipes and toilets basins.maintenance free! the hot water lobster has a solid brass valve body with an adjustable thermal controlled stainless steel valve stem enclosed in a mounting box.easy installation! the hot water lobster comes complete with the mounting box, 4 sets of 12" flexible water lines with standard brass fittings. all pre-assembled and tested for an easy 10-minute installation.statistics! *a typical family wastes approximately 12,000-17,000 gallons of water annually waiting for warm water to reach the tap. *as determined by gama (gas appliance manufactures association).note: circulation of water by thermal convection must not be restricted (no check-valves) between the water heater tank and the hot water lobster instant hot water valve.

american company introduces new patented device to save hot waterâ




























































in an effort to improve water conservation for homeowners and helping to save water, this new innovative-patented device is designed to save hot water by providing faster hot water to all the fixtures in your home (without the need of electricity or a water pump). now you will no longer have to waste water while waiting for the water to get hot. the hot water lobster instant hot water valve is an eco-friendly solution for saving water. which not only provides faster hot water to all your customerâs fixtures, it also saves hot water, saves energy and prevents pipe freezing. the hot water lobster instant hot water valve is a new patented design, which incorporates the flexibility of an adjustable temperature control with quality materials and workmanship for a long maintenance-free life and easy installation (not requiring electrical wiring, timers or perishable and noisy water pumps). the hot water lobster instant hot water valve is intended to create an open loop within the hot water system. although the hot water lobster instant hot water valve can be installed anywhere in the plumbing system, for best results we recommend installing the unit at the end or close to the end of the plumbing run (at the fixture furthest from the hot water heater). this allows other facets or showers along the hot waterlines (between the heater and the hwl valve) to also have faster hot water (by keeping the main hot-water-run hot). most water fixtures are plumbed in series and only one hot water lobster instant hot water valve is normally required. heating water expands the water molecules and thermal convection (warm water rising and cool water sinking, which takes place within the existing hot water tank) creates a higher pressure in the hot water plumbing. in addition the normal use of cold water lowers the pressure in the cold-water plumbing. this pressure differential circulates the water through the hot water lobster instant hot water valve and the plumbing system. when the hot water cools at the hot water lobster valve, the valve slowly opens allowing the cooler water to cross through the hot water lobster valve to the cold-water plumbing. the pressure differential and thermal convection (within the hot water tank) draws the cooler water (through the cold water pipes) to the bottom of the hot water tank, while it forces the hottest water (from the top of the hot water tank) into the hot water pipes. when the hot water reaches the hot water lobster valve, the valve slowly closes and stops the crossover flow of water. the cycle repeats when the valve cools below the adjustable temperature setting. therefore hot water is always available when you need it. this circulation of water through the pipes also aids in preventing the pipes from freezing. the hot water lobster instant hot water valve also saves energy. instead of replacing the water in the hot water tank with cold (ground temperature) water, which has to be heated from a low temperature, the hot water lobster instant hot water valve allows the cooled warm water to circulate back to the hot water tank for reheating-which not only saves the cost of the water, water treatment charges (sewer charges), it also takes less energy to heat the pre-warmed water (being re-circulated) up to temperature. the hot water lobster instant hot water valve is shipped assembled and tested with everything you need for a simple "do it yourself" 10-minute installation. it has a 30-day unconditional money back guarantee, which should provide you with adequate evaluation time (as well as a 10-year parts and labor warranty).  â
