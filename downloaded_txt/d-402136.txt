marin waldorf parents






“when all three of my children were there it was such a great feeling as a parent to know they’re all safe in this school and thriving.”

— mws parent




“waldorf school students are confident, they’re strong, they know how to relate to people...they look you in the eye.”

— mws parent













age appropriate learning





the waldorf curriculum is based on the philosophy that education should gradually draw out all of the child's innate capacities: physical, social, emotional, artistic, and intellectual. the lessons and activities are developmentally tailored to meet the child's emergent and maturing sense of self and their relationship to the world. our early childhood program focuses on creative play, imagination and wonder, while grades 1-8 expand into a full liberal arts curriculum. 




“in linking their curriculum and schooling toward children’s developmental stages, waldorf schools seem to have a unique sense of what children are ready for. they promote creativity and critical thinking in an interdisciplinary fashion...exactly the direction public education needs to move towards.”

— jack miller, professor, ontario institute for studies in education, university of toronto




“being personally acquainted with a number of waldorf students, i can say that they come closer to realizing their own potential than practically anyone i know.”

— joseph weizenbaum, professor, massachusetts institute of technology
