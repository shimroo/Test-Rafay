the
     legal infrastructure of business, fall, 2005, gsb 42201
almost every business decision has legal consequences or takes place
     in an extensive legal framework. entrepreneurs and managers can no more
     ignore the laws of the state than they can the laws of physics. this
     course will provide a general introduction to law and business. it will do
     so using traditional legal analysis, supplemented by a substantial use of
     law and economics. topics to be covered include: choice of corporate form;
     capital markets laws; the role of monitors; antitrust; intellectual
     property; standard setting; and telecommunications and the regulation of
     natural monopoly, as set forth in more detail in the syllabus.

this course covers security interests in personal property. with the
     new article 9 of the uniform commercial code going effective in most
     states as of july 1, 2001, we are at a point of transition. the good news
     is that most of the fundamentals from the prior law continue in the new
     law, plus many unresolved issues are covered by the new statute. for
     details, see the syllabus.

     on antitrust and intellectual property policy, spring, 2006

network
     industries, fall, 2004
this is a course in the regulation of natural monopoly, both physical
     and virtual. the course examines basic issues in the public and private
     creation of network industries, such as the railroad, the telegraph, the
     electricity transmission grid and the telecommunications grid, before
     turning to modern virtual networks. we also consider the transition to
     digital television in the united states, as well as rules regulating
     national tv station ownership and satellite broadcasting. we consider the
     constitutional dimensions of rate of return regulation, practical issues
     in rate design, such as incentive-based regulation, two-part pricing, and
     ramsey pricing. we also examine in detail the modern approach to
     unbundling networks, as seen under the telecommunications act of 1996 and
     the energy policy act of 1992, all as set forth in more detail in the syllabus. 
enron,
     spring, 2002
