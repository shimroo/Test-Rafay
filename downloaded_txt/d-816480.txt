peer solutions





peer solutions was founded in 1996 with the mission of peers working with peers to make the world a better place. our vision is safety, fairness and respect normalized in our families, schools, workplaces, and communities.











































 at peer solutions, we're committed to ending and preventing the pre-birth to prison pipeline by addressing the root causes of harm before they begin. through our youth-led, trauma-informed primary prevention (tipp) programs, we empower youth and partner with families, schools, and local organizations to build strong, supportive communities.  











our goals 








to direct resources toward the health and well-being of our families, schools, communities, and governments.








to cultivate social norms, practices, and policies to ensure safety, fairness, and respect.








to address and prevent the causes of trauma with honesty, empathy, compassion, and kindness. 








to normalize self-advocacy, self-care, and sharing and using community resources.








to ensure strategies are evidence-informed, youth-led and developed with the communities we serve, and strive to be inclusive of all identities and abilities. 








to build resiliency and protective factors supporting the social determinants of health across the social ecological model (sem).








thanks to our youth, family, school, community, government and funding partners!


we would like to extend our gratitude and recognize the partners who contribute their time, efforts, and resources to peer solutions. we are all peers, and together, we are all the solution!








by and for the community.
