"powergo 15/7 is de editors pick of the week"
"now, the xi powergo 15/7 was already engineered as a scalable notebook workstation for 3d cad modeling and graphics work. but this new version brings a lot more spunk that should keep you ahead of whatever advancements that, say, ptc creo or solidworks have up their sleeve for quite some time."
