when we married and moved to our wilderness farm back in 1999, we had no idea of the business we would build over the next 25 years. we took our favorite hobbies and made them our livelihood. our 134-acre property on the edge of algonquin park features plenty of wildlife, great hiking trails, gorgeous rental cabins, and, best of all, peace and quiet! we are three hours from toronto and ottawa and close to all amenities. we are now open for cabin rentals year-round and will always offer guided wilderness snowmobile tours. count on it!

unique! private! affordable! our four cabins are nestled in their own private clearing in the woods on our wilderness farm. maynooth is a small town with a big heart, and is located at an historic crossroads. there’s easy access to algonquin park, bancroft, and barry’s bay attractions. each cabin is private and lends that ‘elbow room’ feel. guests love the wilderness feel and the nearby amenities.

our groomed trails wind through balsam and pine forests on our enormous wilderness property. there are three hills, but most of the property is flat and gently rolling, providing a wonderful option to get outside and enjoy the fluffy stuff. if you’d like to bring a dog and go for a hike, contact penny for a time slot. ski trails are not groomed with a track set, but they are well-maintained and 20′ wide in most places.
