our happy clients 



see what they're saying 


















						the bravo seats were instrumental in the success of the conference at marlins park. guests who pay a premium to sit on the floor of an event deserve to sit in a premium seat - the bravo chairs are just that. from a level of comfort, aesthetics and functionality, there is no better product on the market.					





anthony favatamiami marlins 






						the players love the chairs, and the service was unbelievable. the chairs were promised on a certain day and they arrived on time. besides the aesthetic appearance it provided the clubhouse with our team logo on it, the durability of the chairs was phenomenal. i cannot say enough how happy with all aspects of my experience with dreamseat was.					





tony amatocleveland guardians 






						our furniture is clean, contemporary, and durable and has been the main focus of every tour we give to recruits. dreamseat understands our business and their experience certianly proved that. from my first phone call to installation i was contually impressed with their entire organization.					





mark morrisuniversity of illinois 






						we could not be happier with our overall experience with them. everyone we work with strives to meet our needs quickly and efficiently. in closing, let me say i am pleased to highly recommend dreamseat, as i believe they would be a great asset.					





colin “chip” conwaydenver broncos 






						with over thirty years’ experience in the sports & entertainment business, it is my pleasure to recommend dreamseat/xzipit products, and their outstanding salesperson, adam beyda. we were looking to enhance our brand recognition in one of our arena’s private clubs, and xzipit products offered the perfect opportunity to show our teams logos, have durable comfortable seating options, while at the same time giving us the ability to change the logos with ease.					





kerry l. greggverizon center 






						it is my pleasure to recommend dreamseat for any renovation projects on your campus. recently we purchased several custom chairs, loveseats and desk chairs for our men’s basketball longue. adam beyda is very knowledgeable on the helping make decisions based on our needs, look and feel we are trying to create.					





michael turneruniversity of miami athletics 






						it has been an absolute pleasure to work with dreamseat for the past several years. there have
been multiple instances where they have gone above and beyond to ensure our customers are
satisfied with their product. for example, during the pandemic shipping crisis dreamseat was
able to work with us and our customer to start a bulk ordering system to ensure the custom
product we purchase is always stocked and available.					





sarah siesenerivx health 






						what is easily forgotten in this amazon culture of faceless transaction and customer service is the structure built at dreamseat to always have a connection with the staff. this interpersonal cultivation is welcomed in this digital world. as allied esports and entertainment expands, dreamseat is the first call made to discuss all concept needs best suiting the esport athlete and fan. the hyperx esport arena thanks dreamseat for this amazing partnership and look forward to continually grow within the esport industry.satisfied with their product.
