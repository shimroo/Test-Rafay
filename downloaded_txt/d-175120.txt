blowing your mind, touching your heart, inspiring your soul.

first comes knowledge, then the doing of the job. and much later, perhaps after you’re dead, something grows from what you’ve done. – mevlana jalal al-din rumi (1207-1273), mathnawi, v, 1053
welcome to my home on the web. i hope it captures the spirit of rumi and provides information about both my professional and personal interests. i’m sure you’ll find something of interest – there’s plenty to explore. please do enjoy your visit!

the master key system

								in 1912 the american businessman, charles f. haanel, published "the master key" system, the most concise and practical teaching on becoming an outstanding and successful personality, combining christian values and ancient masonic knowledge.

in 2007 i translated it to german, and have been doing my utmost to make it known both among german and english-speaking people.

over and above the translation, i have published several of my own products and services, which have received accolades from all quarters.									read more at mrmasterkey.com»


relationship management

"the new einstein of marketing". "relationship marketing guru". "genius". "true artist". "leonardo da vinci of the internet". these are some of the titles people have bestowed on me. flattering as they are, they show that you're not dealing with your average management & crm consultant. involved in this field since 1993, my skill-set combines extensive management, marketing and it experience - both at strategic and front-end level. i've travelled the world to present my 'diamond crm' business transformation model. companies all over utilize it as a guideline in their quest to become more customer-oriented. my articles have been widely published online and in print.									learn more»


photography

								photography is but my feeble attempt to capture the transient, the fleeting moments. it has always been a passion of mine. i took my first pictures in grade 2 at the tender age of 6. in 1980 i got my first slr, a yashica fr-1. in 1992 an upgrade to a contax rts iii threw me into a different photographic orbit. i left it in 2003 when i went digital. now i own a samsung nx1 with its appropriate lenses. despite it being only a hobby, my photos have made it into books, onto cd covers, youth hostel id cards, hotel and golf course brochures and many other places - even turned into paintings! obviously, all pictures on this site are mine, so... enjoy!									view portfolio»
