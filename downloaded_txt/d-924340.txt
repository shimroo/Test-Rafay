	 hair evidence in manitoba murder trials under scrutiny again
	 



cbc newswinnipeg - new dna tests have revealed that hair strands used to convict two manitoba men in separate murders didn't belong to them. in light of the new evidence, lawyers for kyle unger and robert sanderson will ask the federal justice department to reopen the cases.  kyle unger (file photo)  manitoba justice officials said they will support unger's request, but are still reviewing sanderson's case. james lockyer, who is with the association in defense of the wrongfully convicted, said they will apply to the court of queen's bench to have unger released while his request to have the case reopened is pending. he said manitoba justice has indicated it will "look favourably" on the bail application. see comments to read full article...

	 the internet thought police are coming...
	 



law lets police monitor internetcourt approval may not be needed for police to obtain informationtim naumetz, canwest news service, friday, august 19, 2005ottawa -- the federal cabinet will review new legislation this fall that would give police and security agencies vast powers to begin surveillance of the internet without court authority.the new measures would allow law-enforcement agents to intercept personal e-mails, text messages and possibly password- secure websites used for purchasing and financial transactions.a law professor and privacy expert involved in consultations over the bill said a draft version of the legislation circulated earlier this year did not require court authority for police to intercept communications or demand information from internet servers."i think it's the kind of legislation that is literally going to shock millions of canadians," said university of ottawa prof. michael geist.(continued in comments)

	 accessing your federal files... privacy act
	 



~ privacy act ~  the privacy act gives canadian citizens and people present in canada the right to have access to information that is held about them by the federal government.  most information is available when you ask~ how to apply ~ 1 - look up the appropriate federal institution that has the files you want to see (for instance, correctional services canada):  http://www.infosource.gc.ca/fed/fed01_e.asp2 - look up the privacy coordinator of that institution:  http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/gos-sog/atip-aiprp/apps/coords/index_e.asp3 - obtain a personal information request form : www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/tbsf-fsct_e.htmlfill out the form and send it to the privacy coordinator  of the appropriate department or agency.   for instance, you can ask the csc coordinator for "all records in all information banks held within correctional services canada systems".  there is no charge to apply for information under the privacy act.   there is a 30 day time limit for them to respond.to change the informationif you believe the information that a federal institution has on file about you is untrue or misleading, you can ask to have it corrected.   even if the department or agency does not agree to change this information,  it must make a note that you have asked for the change and attach it to the file.  (check website for more info...)we have just applied for copies of all darren's prison files from ottawa, in order to dispute some incorrect information. i tried the telephone # listed on the site for the csc coordinator, and they called me back right away with generous detailed assistance in how to fill out the form most effectively... !

	 the royal prerogative of mercy
	 



the royal prerogative of mercy originates in the ancient power vested in the british monarch who had the absolute right to exercise mercy on any subject.in canada, similar powers of executive clemency have been given to the governor general who, as the queen's representative, may exercise the royal prerogative of mercy.  it is largely an unfettered discretionary power to apply exceptional remedies, under exceptional circumstances, to deserving cases. the power to exercise the royal prerogative of mercy for federal offenses is vested in the governor general of canada by virtue of the letters patent, constituting that office. in practice, the governor general will grant an act of clemency only after receiving the advice of the solicitor general of canada, or that of at least one other minister. the governor general may grant two types of pardons, free pardons and conditional pardons, and may also grant respites from the execution of a sentence.in addition, sentences, as well as fines, penalties or forfeitures "due and payable to the queen in right of canada", may be remitted by the governor general. see comments to read more...
