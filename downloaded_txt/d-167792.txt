coastal gsr turned 15 in 2019!




for over 15 years, coastal german shepherd rescue, a non-profit 501(c)3 public charity based in orange county, has been dedicated to caring for and finding loving homes for abandoned dogs. we are an all volunteer run organization, with no paid employees, and our rescue exists solely because of your tax deductible donations, which support our efforts to save these very deserving animals. we save the unwanted seniors, the discarded dogs who need medical care, and so many more. 
	


	2022 has been like nothing we've ever seen before. the amount of dogs in shelters, dogs being surrendered by their owners, and dogs being abandoned on the streets is overwhelming. everyone wanted a dog once the pandemic started and most purchased puppies. tens of thousands of those people did no training and no socializing with their dog, ran into problems, and called it quits. a lot of other people have run into financial hardships and, even though they never thought they'd be giving up their dog(s), finances and living situations forced them to make a very difficult decision.

355,000 dogs and cats were killed in america's shelters last year simply because they don't have safe places to call home. that number should be zero. that‚Äôs why we do what we do, but we need your help, too. please join us in our mission to help give dogs a second chance by adopting, fostering, or donating. your donation is tax deductible and coastal german shepherd rescue is comprised of all volunteers, with no paid board members.

thank you for your support, we couldn't do what we do without you!

gps collars for dogs


have you ever experienced the panic of your dog getting loose? getting a call from your neighbor, pet sitter, dog walker or watching them bolt out of an open door and feeling your heart drop to your toes?

                         we‚Äôve teamed up with fi and have been using their gps collar on our rescue dogs. the app shows you where your dog is at all times, allows you to create a safe zone (your home), notifies you if your dog is outside of that area, and even has an activity tracker. of course, we microchip all of our rescues, but that only helps the finder identify the dog once they are found. the fi collar allows us to track them in real time, within feet of their physical location, is waterproof, and has a light (you select the color) for night walking that you control through their app. the battery life of the collar is fantastic and can hold a charge for months!

                       hopefully you never have to experience the stress and pain of a lost dog. we know accidents happen, so we want to make sure our dogs are as safe as possible and we can‚Äôt say enough about these collars. use the code cgsr2 and receive $25 off!¬†

our wish lists


chewy.com supports rescues! they have created a seamless way to donate to shelters and rescues while doing your online shopping. we also have an amazon wish, which allows you to support rescue dogs by giving them a second chance with the help of flea and tick meds, shampoos, food, training treats, toys, and more. you get to decide exactly how you'd like to help! 

                       

  
foster homes needed!
by joining our foster family program, you can offer the safety and healing environment of your home to a dog either waiting in a shelter for euthanasia or for rescue. the more volunteer foster families we have, the more dogs we can save from death in noisy, cold and uncaring shelters.



as a southern california-based rescue, we make every effort to find local foster homes for the dogs we rescue. unfortunately, though we appreciate the offers, we cannot send dogs out of state to foster.



please fill out our online foster application if you would like to join our team of foster families and save a life by giving a dog in need a place to go!





             
special funds needed!
often, the decision to save a dog's life is determined by our ability to pay their medical bills!   we have not been able to assist as many medical cases as our hearts have wanted to over the past couple of months due to a depleted medical fund.  all too often, shelters in southern california label a dog to be rescue only due to illness.  this means the dog is not available for adoption by the public and their only hope for getting out of the shelter is a rescue.





 even more often, the dogs are released with a waiver of spay or neuter.  this means that our rescue is taking on a dog that may likely be ill, is not altered and may not have its vaccines, all of which we are committed to taking care of. as an all-volunteer group that depends solely on donations, we now work even harder to raise the dollars to help these homeless pets!





how your dollars help!

while we have several high cost surgeries recently, just $25 can fully vaccinate one dog!  $14 will cover one night of boarding.  your donation, combined with others, can help us put together the funds.  here's how your dollars can help:





	$100 - will fully vaccinate four dogs
$400 - will pay a month's boarding for one dog
$500 - will spay or neuter two dogs
