      really, really good mexican food! the chips & the salsas are outstanding, as were the chicken enchiladas. the salsa verde was so tasty i requested the server bring more. fabulous! everything was so enjoyable at iron cactus that in the 11 days of my stay in austin, i ate there on 3 occasions.

      great appetizer menu & strong drinks! we stumbled upon this place & were pleasantly surprised! we ordered the tableside guacamole, crab stuffed jalapeños, & the smoked chicken quesadilla. the guac is literally made in front of you using fresh ingredients & tailored to your preference!

      great place to people watch on 6th street in austin!
we came here late at night to grab drinks and wound up on the outside terrace - highly recommend - overlooking 6th street. great vantage point to people watch and the drinks were top notch and the food was great!

      we were served by joe and he made our night! not only did he give us the best margarita recommendations for our tastes, but he then made the best table side guacamole we’ve ever had. he made a show of it and the presentation was beautiful. great meal, highly recommended!
