making a major decision can be stressful. sometimes, people think that just picking an                     option will provide clarity. but what if you change your mind? is it possible to go back?                                                                          not all decisions are final.                                                                         medical abortion, also known as the abortion pill, seems like one of those final decisions                               that cannot be undone. however, if you took the first pill of the abortion pill and are                               having second thoughts, it’s still your choice, and we will stand by your decision.                                                              depending on when you took the first pill, you may still have time to change your mind                               and get in contact with a doctor who specializes in abortion pill reversal.                                                                          questions? we’re here to help!                                                                         if i took the first dose, can i still decide to continue my pregnancy?                               yes, if only the first dose of the abortion pill has been taken, it may be possible to stop                               the abortion and continue your pregnancy.                                                              if you regret taking the abortion pill, contact the abortion pill reversal hotline at                               1-877-558-0333 immediately. if it's during regular business hours, you can also contact                               us first so we can get you in as soon as possible.                                                              we believe that it’s still a woman’s decision, and women deserve a second chance at                               their choice. no one should feel forced to continue an abortion they do not want.                               how does the abortion pill reversal work?                                                              the first pill of a chemical abortion, mifepristone, blocks the effects of progesterone, a                               hormone necessary for a pregnancy to thrive. the second pill causes contractions and                               expels the fetus.                                                              the abortion pill reversal process involves a prescription for progesterone to counteract                               the mifepristone.                                                              women typically need to start the protocol within 24 hours of taking mifepristone for the                               abortion pill reversal to be successful. according to the abortion pill rescue network,                               there have also been successful reversals when treatment was started within 72 hours                               of taking the first abortion pill.                                                                          is it safe to stop or reverse the abortion pill?                                                                         yes. progesterone has been used to safely support healthy pregnancies since the                               1950s, and it received fda approval in 1998.                                                              today, progesterone treatment is commonly used to reduce the risk of premature birth                               and miscarriages. in addition, progesterone supplementation is an expected part of                               managing ivf pregnancies after embryo transfer and has an extensive safety record.                               how much does it cost?                                                              costs can depend on the progesterone used. insurance plans may cover treatment.                               however, if insurance does not cover it, we will ensure you get the treatment you need                               regardless of the cost.                                                                          what is the success rate of abortion pill reversal?                                                                         initial studies of abortion pill reversal have shown it has a 64-68% success rate.                                                              according to the abortion pill rescue network, “without the apr treatment, the first                               abortion pill may fail to abort the pregnancy on its own. in other words, your pregnancy                               may continue even without apr if you decide not to take the second abortion drug likely                               prescribed or provided to you. apr has been shown to increase the chances of allowing                               the pregnancy to continue. however, the outcome of your particular reversal attempt                               cannot be guaranteed.”                                                                          your next steps                                                                         if you are looking for options after taking the first dose of the abortion pill, contact us or                               the abortion pill reversal network to learn about what steps to take next.                                                              the bottom line is if you decide to continue your pregnancy, it’s still your choice.                               contact us to learn more.                                                                          references:                                                                         ● charlotte lozier institute.

the center for disease control (cdc) shares that mental health includes “our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. it affects how we think, feel, and act. it also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.”                                                    while a woman’s experience with abortion varies, many women struggle with mental health effects like depression, anxiety, and more. the mental impact of abortion can affect how you do everyday life.                               mental health effects of abortion                               along with the physical side effects of abortion come mental side effects. the task force on mental health and abortion shares, “it is clear that some women do experience sadness, grief, and feelings of loss following termination of a pregnancy, and some experience clinically significant disorders, including depression and anxiety.”                                                              is someone pressuring you into abortion? the journal of american physicians and surgeons found that almost 75% of women who had an abortion felt at least subtly pressured into making the decision. of these women who felt pressured, many suffered psychological effects afterward, including:                                                              shame                               guilt                               regret                               self-hatred                               worthlessness                               feeling unworthy of love                               low self-esteem                               anxiety                                                              abortion could affect a woman even more if she already struggled with mental health before abortion. the national institute of health reveals that women with a history of abortion have “elevated rates of mental illness” compared to women who haven’t had an abortion.                               pre-abortion screening                               confirming where your pregnancy stands is vital to understanding if you qualify for abortion and safeguards your health. at agape women’s clinic, we provide free and confidential pre-abortion screening if you’re considering abortion.                                                              our pre-abortion screening includes medical quality, urine pregnancy tests, and ultrasound services to confirm and date your pregnancy. we also offer education about the different types of abortion procedures.                                                              to better understand your pregnancy options, schedule an appointment to meet with our team and learn fact-based, detailed information about abortion.                                                              all abortion information sourced in this blog is based on accurate information at the time of writing.
