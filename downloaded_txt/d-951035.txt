housing for adults with intellectual disabilitiesa safe space for residents to call their own
welcome to good neighbor village, a home away from home for those you love most.
since 1987, we’ve been on a mission to provide a residential opportunity in a community setting for adults with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities.
good neighbor village was born out of a need to provide adults who have intellectual disabilities with a place to live while maintaining their comfort and dignity and giving their families peace of mind. we provide the necessary steppingstones, such as housing, 24-hour staff, fellowship, and society, to guarantee that residents have the resources and opportunities to become the most productive and self-sufficient members of the community that they are able to be.
