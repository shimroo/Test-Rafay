carleton house bed &
                  breakfast
located in the heart of
                    historic downtown bonham, in north texas, just one hour from
                    dallas, twenty minutes from whitewright, is the historic
                    carleton house bed & breakfast. the house was built in
                    1888 by a.j. clendenen, who operated a grocery and produce
                    store on the square. in 1914 , dr. j. c. carleton purchased
                    the home for his family and electricity was introduced at
                    this time. this newly renovated three story victorian,
                    listed on the national register of historic homes, features
                    a large entrance hall, a parlor, dining room with ceiling
                    mural, music room, breakfast area and a large staircase
                    leading to the bedrooms. we are also fortunate enough to
                    have one of the two remaining carriage stones left in fannin
                    county. the home sits on a beautifully landscaped half acre
                    including remnants of its original gardens, perfect for
                    weddings and parties. it is also suited for romantic evening
                    strolls to put you in a vacation frame of mind or a great
                    getaway to reunite with friends or scrapbooking
                        retreats.
