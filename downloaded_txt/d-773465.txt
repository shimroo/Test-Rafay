we believe that the success of our projects and our satisfaction with quandel is due to the skills, abilities, and knowledge of the project engineers, managers, and on-site supervisors they employ. quandel is a well-managed company that goes above and beyond what is contractually expected of them to provide a finished product that exceeds our expectations. james devers. r.a.university of scranton, scranton, pennsylvania 





during our expansion project in hazleton, quandel’s site superintendents displayed a sense of ownership and dedication during some rather challenging times, in order to minimize the impact to the overall project schedule. they would work whenever and however long was necessary to accomplish the specific task. they are a valuable asset to your organization, and i would welcome their participation in future projects at pfn. mark jaros
chief investment and global operations director, pfnonwovens 





quandel is a professionally operated company. they have excellent processes that enable them to manage complex projects. they have done a very good job on our project. as with any project of this magnitude, issues arise. those issues were resolved to our satisfaction through excellent communication and a strong sense of fairness. robert brink
president, pennridge development enterprises, inc. 





this project was constructed amid the pandemic, and quandel did an excellent job coordinating this effort and ensuring everyone remained safe and healthy. quandel excelled at adapting to the issues that arose throughout the project. when a problem arose, quandel quickly assessed the situation, developed appropriate options, met with the team to make sure we understood the situation and their recommendation, and finally implemented the solution. we were pleased that the project was completed on time and slightly under the original cost budget, particularly with all the challenges that arose from covid related supply chain issues. i would highly recommend quandel for any construction project in the future. nathan eckart
chief financial officer, c.f. martin & co. 





quandel has been working with pinnacle since 2000 and i have come to rely on their expertise and quality of work. when challenged with price and schedule, they have met or exceeded my expectations each time. quandel’s construction processes and reputation in the subcontractor market were instrumental in completing this project early and under budget. their team has the knowledge and ability to respectfully leverage relationships to extract a positive outcome for all involved. paul toburn

quandel constructionvirtual design & constructionkeeping projects on tracksee digital models of your buildings and job sites before construction even starts. our virtual design and construction (vdc) team focuses on creating a collaborative environment with our clients to deliver customized and innovative construction solutions. we use the latest technology in our vdc process to streamline the delivery of our projects in an integrated and lean approach. this approach allows for enhanced communication, efficient collaboration with our trade partners, and the effective use of building information modeling (bim) expertise for overall project coordination.
bim is a digital representation of a structure’s physical and functional properties. this technology enables us to design a project virtually, track progress, optimize processes, minimize waste, and validate installations. this allows for improved quality as well as a decrease in risk as workflow becomes more efficient. by using bim during the design process, we can identify conflicts, address coordination issues, and create clear metrics against the program’s goals.
we work together with stakeholders to determine optimal outcomes. we sit down with your team and develop a bim execution plan for the project. we approach bim as a process to mitigate risks. during this process, we use digital tools to create virtual models of buildings. the model acts as a single source of information containing existing condition details, proposed designs, and coordinated work plans during construction. these digital models are then evaluated before ground is broken, allowing project teams to optimize building construction. through 3d digital modeling, stakeholders can see and address issues before they ever become a reality, preventing costly mistakes during construction. by integrating forward-thinking designers and contractors into the bim process, conflicts are detected and corrected quickly saving you money and time.

alternative delivery methods
a better way to build
choosing the best delivery method for your project does not have to be a difficult task. depending on your project needs, desire for involvement in decisions, and risk tolerance, there is a delivery system that is right for your project. some considerations when determining your project approach include:

is it a strictly cost-driven approach?
is it a schedule-driven approach?
who will hold the risk?
who will ultimately be accountable?

design-bid-build
a linear design-bid-build process where the owner selects an architect/engineer to fully document the project criteria and design prior to bidding. the lowest responsive and responsible general contractor (single prime) is awarded the contract. bids are based on the original plans; any changes to the plans and specifications are administered by change order above and beyond the bid.
construction manager at-risk
a contractor is hired through a best value selection process before or during the design phase. the owner, architect, and construction manager are a collaborative team from planning through construction with a primary emphasis on integrating design and construction. the construction manager provides a guaranteed maximum price (gmp). the construction manager solicits competitive bids from prequalified subcontractors holding the subcontracts for construction.
construction manager agency
a construction manager is hired as an owner’s agent through a qualifications-based selection process during the design phase. the construction manager provides estimates before or during design, assists with bidding, and coordinates prime contractors during construction. the owner bids and holds the construction contracts. the construction manager agent is paid based on hourly rates or a fee. this is in addition to the general contractor or prime contractor fee.
design-build
an owner contracts and collaborates with a single design-builder for the project. the design-build team includes the architect, engineer, and construction manager. the design-build team complete the design and a guaranteed maximum price (gmp) is provided. the design-build team solicits bids from prequalified subcontractors and holds the subcontracts for construction.
integrated project delivery
the integrated project delivery (ipd) process allows the owner, design, and construction team to use information, such as incorporating building information modeling, in an integrated environment, to increase efficiency and support new ways of working. based on lean construction principles, ipd is the reliance on knowledge integration that adds value through maximizing efficiency and collaboration of those involved. given that ipd encompasses collaborative processes that rely on the collective expertise of the extended project stakeholders (including designers, builders, subcontractors, and owners), the effects of design decisions can be easily understood, increasing the level of project success.

quandel constructionpreconstruction servicesfirst step in planningwe help our clients know what to expect and when by providing a step-by-step roadmap for getting the project done. early preconstruction services and project controls lay the foundation for a successful project. we facilitate the design and approval process throughout preconstruction, efficiently allocating resources, defining responsibilities, and facilitating collaboration to bring out the best work of the team members to focus on meeting the program, budget, and schedule objectives.
working as an extension of your team, we provide services during the project’s planning, design, and documentation phases that contribute directly to project success. we detail how each service interrelates to the roles and responsibilities of the owner and the project team. we work closely with our clients to align our goals to the goals of the owner’s building program.
the following are some of the essential preconstruction services we offer:

existing condition analysis
building information modeling
constructability analysis and review
cost estimating and control

quandel constructionproject planningplanning a construction project starts way before plans are drawn.we lead, manage, and execute a construction project from design to building completion. our impact on a project’s outcome is greatest at the planning stage. our ability to optimize results starts with a defined construction plan incorporating scope and costs for informed decision-making. led by our preconstruction manager, the team will work to understand the owner’s vision and objectives for their project. starting with initial project phasing, we collaborate with the design team and the owner using our experience to evaluate various phasing and sequencing options, including the people, resources, and budget for the project. leadership drives the process. after assessing project variables, we create a comprehensive project plan that clarifies programmatic and budgetary objectives.
our team strives to understand the final desired project outcome and define the steps required to achieve that outcome during project planning. in this step, we analyze and select the method and the order of work for a specific project. we identify construction activities, develop the construction schedule, and plan out the team structure. from working with a client on finding the property to develop to creating a visual sketch or building information model of the conceptual design to project close out, we are a trusted and valued partner to our clients. proper planning is a roadmap for success, reduces the potential for change orders, contains cost overruns, and limits liability.
benefits

leverages the experience of our team early in the design process
minimizes cost by the efficient deployment of available resources
alignment of the project design, budget, and schedule

j. vinton schaferproject planningplanning a construction project starts way before plans are drawn.we lead, manage, and execute a construction project from design to building completion. our impact on a project’s outcome is greatest at the planning stage. our ability to optimize results starts with a defined construction plan incorporating scope and costs for informed decision-making. led by our preconstruction manager, the team will work to understand the owner’s vision and objectives for their project. starting with initial project phasing, we collaborate with the design team and the owner using our experience to evaluate various phasing and sequencing options, including the people, resources, and budget for the project. leadership drives the process. after assessing project variables, we create a comprehensive project plan that clarifies programmatic and budgetary objectives.
our team strives to understand the final desired project outcome and define the steps required to achieve that outcome during project planning. in this step, we analyze and select the method and the order of work for a specific project. we identify construction activities, develop the construction schedule, and plan out the team structure. from working with a client on finding the property to develop to creating a visual sketch or building information model of the conceptual design to project close out, we are a trusted and valued partner to our clients. proper planning is a roadmap for success, reduces the potential for change orders, contains cost overruns, and limits liability.

pyramid constructionvirtual design & constructionkeeping projects on track
see digital models of your buildings and job sites before construction even starts. our virtual design and construction (vdc) team focuses on creating a collaborative environment with our clients to deliver customized and innovative construction solutions. we use the latest technology in our vdc process to streamline the delivery of our projects in an integrated and lean approach. this approach allows for enhanced communication, efficient collaboration with our trade partners, and the effective use of building information modeling (bim) expertise for overall project coordination.
bim is a digital representation of a structure’s physical and functional properties. this technology enables us to design a project virtually, track progress, optimize processes, minimize waste, and validate installations. this allows for improved quality as well as a decrease in risk as workflow becomes more efficient. by using bim during the design process, we can identify conflicts, address coordination issues, and create clear metrics against the program’s goals.
we work together with stakeholders to determine optimal outcomes. we sit down with your team and develop a bim execution plan for the project. we approach bim as a process to mitigate risks. during this process, we use digital tools to create virtual models of buildings. the model acts as a single source of information containing existing condition details, proposed designs, and coordinated work plans during construction. these digital models are then evaluated before ground is broken, allowing project teams to optimize building construction. through 3d digital modeling, stakeholders can see and address issues before they become a reality, preventing costly mistakes during construction. by integrating forward-thinking designers and contractors into the bim process, conflicts are detected and corrected quickly saving you money and time.
