welcome
the world can be a crazy place at times and it is tough to find balance, inside and outside of the home. it seems impossible to achieve peace of mind and an organized life in such an atmosphere of craziness, but actually, it is not impossible at all. you just have to start small, because at the end of the day, all you really have control over is what’s inside the home. more specifically, it starts in your closet.
a well-arranged and well-organized closet will help you find balance and open up other possibilities for your home and life. that is what we do at designer closets. we work closely with you to design, build, and install custom closet systems that will redefine your space and your needs, from the initial design plan until the final touches are made. you will work with one of our experienced design consultants so that your closet is arranged exactly to your specifications.here’s how it works: at the beginning of the process, we listen to our customer’s needs, then we draw out a plan in cad to show you our unique design before building and installing your custom-made closet. we treat your home the way it should be treated: with care, respect, and professionalism. remember, your closet is an extension of your home and life. designing, building and installing custom closets isn’t the only thing we do; we also make solid wood and laminate pantries, garages, homes, offices and cabinets. if you have any questions or if you would like to schedule a consultation, please contact us today. please note, that although we are located in massachusetts, we work throughout connecticut as well.
