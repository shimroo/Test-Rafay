introducing the geiger-lund model mh2026 selective asparagus harvester.

description:

height: 5 feet
width: 10 feet
length: 9 feet
weight: 3,000 lb.
mounting: 3-point hitch.
estimated harvesting speed: 0 - 3.5 mph.
minimum row centers: 40 inches
estimated cost: $250,000
can be scaled up to a four-row machine

the cost to machine harvest asparagus is determined by a number of factors: here is a 
	small piece of the spreadsheet.

how it works

there are 8  
	photo-sensors spread across the bed dividing the bed into eight 3-inch-wide 
	channels. 

there are eight 3-inch wide blades on the ends of eight air 
	cylinders that align with the sensors. 

when a spear passes through the speedometer beams 
	it measures the speed of the machine.

when a spear passes through one 
	of the spear sensor locater beams the machine knows it's location and speed.

after the proper time delay the 
	cylinder is fired and the blade severs the spear at ground level. 

the spear is then lifted up through a series of 
	counter rotating rollers onto the conveyor.  

the conveyor 
	receives the spears butt-first, keeping them oriented in the same direction 
	as they fill the lug box. 

as the lug box 
	fills, it is incrementally pushed to the rear.  when full, a new 
	empty lug takes it's position.
