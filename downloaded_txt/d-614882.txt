  process




    learn our process

since 1993, our clients have put their trust in us and we’ve delivered a phenomenal experience. it all begins with listening, and us taking the time to find out what homeowners really want in their new dream space.



      

  meet & discuss

scott goes to each job himself. during this free consultation, he sits down with the client and listens to their goals for a renovation. he takes measurements and photos of the space to be transformed.﻿



   

  choose

while at our store, the client looks through our showrooms to view samples and make their material selections.




    

  design

scott puts together different price points and options for the renovation and emails the estimate to the client.



   

  order

scott converts the proposal with final pricing into a contract and the client puts a payment down. financing options are available as well, so people don’t have to wait for their renovation.  once finalized scott will order all the materials for the job.




    

  visit

the client will them come into the showroom to take a look at countertops, cabinetry and hardware.




   

  build

working together, client and scott come up with a realistic timeline of work. he does his homework, researching the industry to find providers who can deliver cabinetry on a faster lead time than most home renovation companies. every step is taken to make sure the job runs smoothly, on-time and on-budget. after the job, he follows up with each client to make sure they are happy with the renovation.﻿

  faqs




    frequently
asked
questions




        once you start a job, do you stay with it without work stoppages?

   




  yes, we are in constant contact with the homeowner about our workflow. our field supervisor is on the jobsite every day, and owner scott herceg is always just a call or text away. clients take comfort in knowing we are always available.



   do you have a motto or tagline?

   




  yes, we often say, “fix it now, don’t worry about it later.” in our business, things can often go wrong, so we make it a policy to do things right the first time and address things right away. we take things personally.



   how far out will you go for jobs?

   




  we go anywhere in the cleveland-akron area.



   do you use subcontractors as installers?

   




  we pay our crews as hourly subcontractors because that’s the fairest way to get the work done. everyone on our crews works exclusively for kitchen design center. we are proud to have put together a group of highly skilled, seasoned and experienced craftsmen who we would trust in our own homes.



   do you offer cabinets made in america?

   




  many companies have moved their headquarters from china to the united states and we are proud to offer those brands. some companies claim to be made in the u.s., but their product is actually only assembled here and made somewhere else. none of our lines are coming on a slow boat from china.
