every once in a while people rediscover dengeki bunko fighting climax







genuinely one of my favorite crossover fighter rosters, you can have akira yuki and holo from spice and wolf beat up taiga from toradora and celty from durarara on green hill zone and bellbridge from nights. i just wish the assists were playable.
