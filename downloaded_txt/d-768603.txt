author and quilter














to me, the most important thing in life is that you find your joy. the photo on the left is a wonderful statue created by a dear friend and joyful person, angela mia de la vega. i absolutely love the girl’s joyous expression. the photo on the left is of my dog, gracie, in one of her happy places — running through the woods. my happy place is in my library where i write (middle photo), in my quilting studio, or in my gardens. click on a link above to read more about them and my work. all the header photos are views from our house or our beach.
