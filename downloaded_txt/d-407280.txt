crockett superstars create frosty the clay-man

crockett superstars spent their first week back working with clay in mrs. hall's art class! not only was it super fun, but it also improved and reinforced their fine motor skills as they squished, molded, and shaped their creations. plus, the tactile experience of working with the clay—feeling, pressing, and rolling—adds an extra layer of sensory excitement! be on the lookout for these frosty creations to soon be completed and taken home to be displayed each holiday season to come!
