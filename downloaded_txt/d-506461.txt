     historical
store tidbits

native hawaiians that lived in the surrounding area would share and trade their harvest from the uplands and fresh catch from the surrounding oceans near hanamaulu bay. in the early part of the last century the lihue plantation company was mainly responsible for the existence of the building at the current location. in the early 1950‚Äôs, construction of the wood mill and wood shop were built ‚Äì thus a legacy was born.

feedback

   we stopped by at the pineapple store around 630pm.  we found out it was closed at 4pm.  an employee named tim was there.  he said if we want we can come inside and view the store.  we were very appreciative.  he said if we wanted to buy anything we could.  he recommended the white pineapple and the banana bread that were were eyeing.  he also said if we wanted a smoothie he would make one for us.  we had the papaya pina colada. he went out of his way almost 3hrs after closing and we were very appreciative.   he is an excellent employee. we will definitely going back. we highly recommend this store.

 locally-owned shop for all things pineapple. we all had smoothies. they were all great, but the funnest ones were served inside a hollowed pineapple. quick service, healthy options, and locally-owned. try it out!

 support local business!!! we were greet by the kindest staff here. she offered gelato samples. i loooove the pineapple gelato. we were headed to the beach so we ordered pineapples chunks to go. she cut the pineapples for us so we could enjoy the fruit at the beach. highly recommend this quick stop if you're heading to the poipu beach!

 fantastic ulu waffle! super friendly and helpful staff; helped me with selection of fresh pineapples to carry home on plane to ensure freshness and longer shelf life based on travel schedule.

 if you need to try fresh pineapple in hawaii, this is a good place to stop. they had the standard gold pineapple available cut up, whole, and ready to be shipped or packed up to be carried on the plane. we tried the sugarloaf pineapple, which is  the less acidic and sweeter version. it is unique to kauai, and it was absolutely delicious!

 the pineapples here were some of the best on the island. the owners showed us how to pick out a good pineapple (it was delicious!) they had different varieties including sugar loaf (native to kauai). we also ordered a smoothie with macadamia milk which was also a 10/10. they have an extremely friendly and adorable cat named dorito. love this place and would recommend!

client review

 i probably shouldn't post this, but the fruit here was half the cost of a fruit stand in kapaa, and the quality was out of this world. being so close to the airport i bought a huge bag of papaya, 12 in all, 1 pineapple, and a small container of watermelon for only $35. i felt that was a steal so i rounded up to $40. still a total bargain. i am definitely going back!

 i send pineapples to clients on the mainland for holidays and events. the ordering is easy; people love getting fresh pineapples from hawaii; and i can order over the phone and have everything handled. staff is warm with aloha and very helpful.
