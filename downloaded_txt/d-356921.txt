surprising and important ways new york was unprepared for disaster









the skyscraper safety campaign (ssc) was created by the regenhard family
     in memory of christian michael otto regenhard, a 28 year old probationary firefighter who
     remains missing at the wtc, along with his entire engine company 279, to this date. originally
     conceived as "parents of probies", to represent the 17 probationary firefighters lost at the
     wtc, the organization quickly expanded to include the families of all firefighters, emergency
     workers, and civilian victims of 9/11.  co-chairperson monica gabrielle lost her husband
     richard, who was an employee of aon corp., wtc2/103 floor.  he was last seen alive, waiting to
     be rescued, on the 78th floor of tower 2.  he has not been recovered.
the goals of the skyscraper safety campaign are:

to have a federal comprehensive investigation, with subpoena power, into the
     collapse of the wtc, including design, construction, evacuation procedures and fire
     fighting techniques.
     
to encourage better compliance with building and fire codes in nyc and 
     nationwide, thereby safeguarding firefighters, as well as persons who must live and work in
     skyscrapers.
     
to educate "codes groups" to allow the fire service to have more input
     into writing building codes. we call for at least 50% of all codes groups to be composed of
     representatives of the fire service and the academic field of fire science engineering. 
     (existing groups are composed of builders, developers, financiers and bureaucrats who know
     little about fire and life safety.)
     
to ensure that all future wtc development by the port authority of new york
     & new jersey be characterized by quality, safety, security and new york city codes
     compliance.
     
we are gratified to report that our first goal has
     been accomplished. the investigation of the collapse of the wtc has commenced. the
     first meeting of the national institute of standards and technology (nist) investigation of
     the collapse of the wtc was held in nyc on june 24, 2002.  for ongoing information about
     the wtc investigation, visit wtc.nist.gov. much work remains to be done.  it is
     imperative that all members of the public support the principles of the skyscraper safety campaign.
our  second goal is being realized as we
     applaud the work of nyc mayor mike bloomberg and the nyc buildings department commissioner
     patricia lancaster,  in focusing on ensuring the safety and security of buildings in nyc. 
we continue to work on accomplishing 
     all the goals of the skyscraper safety campaign.





in two congressional hearings in march and may of 2002 
      regarding the collapse of the wtc, congress  determined that the aftermath of the 9/11
      collapse was characterized by the absence of a comprehensive investigation, a lack of
      cooperation and no clear lines of authority among the federal, state and nyc governments. this
      hampered any possible investigation and led to the destruction of the steel evidence of the
      wtc in addition to other serious problems. 

in memory of our beloved lost firefighters and other wtc victims, 
        congressman sherwood boehlert (ny) and the house of representatives science committee have
        created "the national construction safety team act," which is modeled on the national
        transportation safety board (ntsb). this will provide an immediate response and
        investigation of catastrophic building collapse and other such emergencies throughout the
        usa.  the skyscraper safety campaign applauds congressman boehlert, who is truly one of the
        greatest friends of the fire service in congress today. he deserves the profound gratitude
        of all americans for his proactive response to the catastrophe of 9/11. 
in the aftermath of 9/11/01,  the 
        ssc has engaged in a local and national outreach effort to educate the public and to promote
        the principles of skyscraper safety. we have embarked upon national speaking tours,
        addressing fire departments from new york, to indiana, and california. in addition, we work
        with a  variety of community and public interest groups concerned with fire safety and fire
        prevention in skyscrapers and other buildings. the purpose of our work is  to promote the
        principles of the ssc, and to encourage firefighters to become proactive for their own
        welfare in calling for public education and building safety throughout the usa.
we could never have
        gotten this far without the support of the families of the victims, both fdny and
        civilian, and the assistance of dedicated professionals in the fields of fire science, fire
        protection engineering, structural engineering and professional members of the fire service.
        glenn corbett, professor of fire science at john jay college (nyc) provided the professional
        support, technical and academic guidance, and moral integrity which helped to make the ssc
        possible. we are honored to say that he was the only nyc professional selected to testify at
        the 2002 congressional hearings on the collapse of the wtc. in march, 2003, professor
        corbett was appointed to the federal advisory committee of the national construction safety
        team, which will oversee the federal investigation of the collapse of the wtc. this is a
        three year, $16m investigation conducted by the national institute of standards and
        technology (nist). we are extremely proud of professor corbett and all the members of the
        professional advisory panel of the skyscraper safety campaign.
