potato pancakes





ingredients4 potatoes (peeled & shredded)1/2 onion,1/2 apple2 eggs (lightly beaten)1/4 cup flour1 lemon (juice of 1 lemon)2 teaspoons salt1/2 teaspoon peppertwo tablespoons butter1/2 cup vegetable oil preparation1) grate the potatoes into a medium size bowl filled with water with a box grater using the side with the largest holes.  2)dice the apple and onion into small pieces and place in a second bowl and reserve.  3) remove the grated potatoes from the water and squeeze the water out. use a thin mesh strainer to remove any excess water over the bowl of water. (keep the bowl of water it has the potato starch)  4) place the grated potatoes, diced onion, diced apple, salt, pepper and the juice from one lemon into a bowl and mix together with a fork. 5)drain the potato water over a fine mesh strainer and pour it out over the strainer obtaining the potato starch. add this goodness to the potato mixture. then add 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and mix with fork. if the mixture is too wet add a little more flour. refrigerate covered with plastic wrap until the pan is ready.6) prepare a large frying pan and heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil and two tablespoons butter until it sizzles. drop a tablespoon at a time of the potato mixture into hot oil. flatten with a pancake turner. when bottoms are brown turn them over. when done remove and drain on a paper towel lined plate. serve with applesauce, sour cream or just plain. serve immediately.note: peanut oil can be used instead of vegetable oil. once the potatoes are shredded they will start to brown so make sure to keep them covered in water. the potato pancakes can be made large if desired. fresh or dried herbs are also nice if you have on hand.

sweet potato pone





i checked out the cookbook sweets soul food and memories by patty pinner at the library recently.  i highly recommend it if you like old fashioned southern desserts. i wanted to pass on the recipe for old fashioned sweet potato pone a family recipe from patty pinner. it is interesting, because unlike sweet potato pie filling it is firmer and can be sliced. ingredients2 1/2 cups milk4 sweet potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated3 eggs2 1/2 cups granulated sugar1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/4 teaspoon ground cloves1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg1 teaspoon grated orange zest1/2 cup chopped pecans1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softnedprocedurepreheat the oven to 350 degrees f. grease a 2-quart casserole dish. pour the milk into the prepared casserole dish. stir the grated sweet potatoes into the milk; this will prevent the potatoes from turning dark. in a mixing bowl, beat the egss well. gradually add the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves, mixing well after each addition. add the nutmeg, orange zest, and pecans. mix until all of the ingredients are evenly distributed. pour the mixture into the potato mixture and mix well. dot the top with butter. bake for 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until the pudding is set. remove the dish from the oven. let the pudding stand for 30 minutes before serving.serves 6 to 8recipe courtesy patty pinner the author of sweets soul food desserts and memories

fondue





went to the melting pot in downtown seattle and had a lovely fondue meal. we started with the swiss cheese fondue with bread, granny smith apples and veggies. next we had the pacific rim special with shrimp, chicken, teriyaki beef, pork and potstickers dipped in hot oil. the food is mouthwatering and the atmosphere is unique. i recommend it for anyone who loves fondue. they have quite a few locations and are in several states.

pf changs china bistro





the dinner out started with crab wontons with a spicy plum sauce. next the wild alaskan sockeye salmon salad with mixed greens. than the crispy honey shrimp and mongolian beef arrived at the same time, perfection! the crispy honey shrimp is lightly battered and quick fried in a flavorful sweet honey sauce. the mongolian beef is quickly cooked steak with scallions and garlic. not just a dash of garlic, but lots of garlic. the ingredients used to make all of their sauces is top secret. if someone has dietary concerns they will give them more specific information regarding their sauces. let me tell you their sauces are addictive, leading me to believe they put sugar in them.

maggiano's little italy!





maggiano's little italy opened up in bellevue, wa late last year. we decided to go out for meatballs and this hit the spot. while we were there anyway, why not order the fried mozzarella. dad of course wanted the stuffed mushrooms.a white tablecloth and expensive restaurant might be left for special occasions rather than a hankering for meatballs.

zephyr bar & grill





zephyr bar & grilla new restaurant opened in kent, wa at kent station a new outdoor lifestyle mall. it is called the zephyr bar & grill, i was intrigued and decided to take my dad and give it a try. the zephyr also my dog's name has been open only three weeks and the service showed that. very slow. it took an hour and 45 minutes to eat there and we did not have dessert. i ordered the filet mignon and liked it quite well, it was nicely done with a demi glace and a bearnaise sauce. it was cooked as i ordered it, but my red potatoes merely sliced in half were raw. apparently they need to work on the little things. for example, my dad wanted macaroni and cheese as a side dish and they brought it as his appetizer. it's all about the timing. he really enjoyed the macaroni & cheese, but i prefer the baked type over the pour on cheese afterthought. the dish my dad ordered was the southern spicy fried chicken and mashed potatoes was not what he had expected. it was over cooked and way past crispy. the mashed potatoes were overcooked and lacked flavor. the fried chicken had such an overkill of spices that it was difficult to even taste the chicken. the caesar salad was excellent, the greens were really fresh, and this is often overlooked at some restaurants.  i liked the olive bread and three butters, i think it is creative to give a choice of butters. if you have enough time one night i would recommend going, but stay away from the southern fried chicken. by the way there is another location in livermore, california.

sunday brunch!





lovely day for sunday brunch. dad and i went to the hunt club in seattle and enjoyed a nice sunday brunch. my dad loves brunch and has passed this love onto me and my brother jonathan. this was unique, because you order from a menu. when i was little i remember loving going to sunday brunch, because i could run around the tables and pick and choose what i wanted. i am a picky eater and sometimes there is something i really like and i will just eat that. growing up in southern california we went to a sunday brunch where they had a woman play the violin and the best blueberry blintzes ever.

keg steakhouse





my dad and i always enjoy going to the keg steakhouse. the food is consistently good. i just have the baked shrimp appetizer, because it is my favorite item they have on the menu. baked with garlic, cheddar and mozzarella cheese with shrimp it is to die for. my dad loves their peppercorn steak and french onion soup. i recommend it if there is one near you.
