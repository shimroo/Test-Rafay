our priorities










racial equity

black workers in the louisville region experience higher unemployment rates and are more likely to be crowded into low-quality, low-wage work. we’re committed to changing this.











career pathways

there is no one-size-fits-all definition of a good job. we’re focused on connecting people to employment that offers stability and a road to middle-class wages.











preparing for the future

as our regional workforce ages, it’s crucial that we invest in the next generation of talent and prepare them with the skills employers need.
