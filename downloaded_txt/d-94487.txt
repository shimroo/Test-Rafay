hi, i'm paul, and i often get called paj. i live in manchester, england, work as an it security consultant, and recently travelled round the world.
i think the internet is fantastic for sharing information. i learned huge amounts of what i know about computers by reading websites, and continue to use the web daily in my work. i'm keen not to be just a consumer, and this site is my contribution to the pool of knowledge. it mostly covers computer programming and security, and there's a little bit about me too.
if you're just passing through, read the security introduction as everyone who ever uses a computer needs to know this.
