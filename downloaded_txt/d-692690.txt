the cord between an officer's portable radio and the speaker microphone is a danger and a hazard; it is also the most common failure point in the mission critical communications chain. bluetooth has not been embraced as a solution because it's unreliable and unsecure. freelinc technologies' near field magnetic induction communication has already solved that problem for the most demanding customers - law enforcement officers. 

 

freelinc products have been deployed in over 2500 u.s. public safety agencies, including the fbi and the secret service.
