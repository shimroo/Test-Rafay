public notice









liberty wildlife cannot take ducks, geese or lovebirds at this time


liberty wildlife is following proper protocols and taking precautions to prevent the spread of the avian flu in our facility and the community. currently, we have been advised to not take any waterfowl (ducks or geese) to help minimize exposure to other animals. east valley wildlife and fallen feathers are unable to take them as well. all waterfowl that are sick/injured should be transported to our partner veterinary emergency group (veg).
