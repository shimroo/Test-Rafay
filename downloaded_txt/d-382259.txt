international shipping options return for single handed controllers

january 28, 2025 benheck 


ok so i’m only doing xbox core controllers right now (works on xbox one, series s and x) ps4 is discontinued and ps5 still hasn’t happened because sony keeps changing the internals.
but i have added back international shipping options! yahoo!
single handed xbox one controllers

paused them for a while because shipping got really slow during covid but now non-us buyers can easily order once again. enjoy!
i’ve also started streaming the controllers builds (when i have orders) every monday on my youtube channel, usually around 8-10pm central us time. enjoy!

single board computer workshop at midwest gaming classic 2020

february 20, 2020 benheck 



i’m doing a “build your own single board computer” workshop at the midwest gaming classic 2020 in downtown milwaukee this april.
the design is based on the classic z80 (which they still manufacture believe it or not) and is quite small, only 3 x 3″. it has an expansion port, build-in oled screen, atmel mcu as screen driver/usb serial port converter and an sd card adapter for loading bin, hex and saving files or doing ram dumps.
this workshop is meant to teach how memory addressing works and you also get to take home the sweet computer you build! basic soldering skills will be helpful and there’s also a decent amount of surface mount (fairly large parts to make it do-able) so tips and tricks on how to work with that are also part of the experience.
sign up using the links below! (limited to 25 spots)
workshops

here are the youtube videos i’ve made discussing the design process. once the design has been verified it will be posted to my github if you can’t make it to the workshop but want to order your own copy of the pcb.

project started in 2000 finally finished – atari 2600 junior single chip portable!

december 7, 2019 benheck 



when i first starting buying atari 2600 consoles for modding purposes back in 2000 (right after my website became famous) i was lucky enough that my first atari 2600 junior had the ultra-rare “single chip” variant inside.
of course this was “portablization catnip” for me so i desoldered it and tried to make a custom pcb.  my skills at the time weren’t up to task and i feared the chip dead. had i know then how rare it was (i’ve never found another since) i probably wouldn’t have tried but can’t change that now.
flash forward to fall of 2018 and i come across the project in a junk box while moving out of the ben heck show shop. decided to give it another go and i have help this time – my friend parker dillmann has an intact single-chip 2600 junior so we can cross reference to it.
i documented this near-year-long process in the video below. you can also click here for the full photo gallery with notes.
