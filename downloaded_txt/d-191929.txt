in addition, the packaging has been restored to the ’95 artwork with original cover, inside gatefold, back photo, and center labels. we’ve included a new 20-page 12x12 booklet embossed with the same illustration as album cover with new liner notes from mccready and martin, additional photos, and song lyrics.

brandon discusses "i am no guide" on wchl in chapel hill





 brandon took a few minutes to sit down with aaron keck at 97.9 the hill wchl to discuss our book, i am no guide: pearl jam song-by-song.  he discusses discovering the band and following them through a lifetime as their music changes to reach all generations of fans.check out the interview here.this week, aaron welcomes chapel hill’s brandon rector, who’s just co-authored a book that takes a deep dive into pearl jam. “i am no guide – pearl jam: song by song” discusses and analyzes every song in pearl jam’s legendary oeuvre, from their iconic debut “ten” to their latest album, 2024’s “dark matter.”



along the way, the book explores the band’s politics, running threads, humanistic themes, and personal journeys – and spotlights some of their best live performances as well, many of which rector has been present for.

top ten pearl jam moments of 2024, #1





 #1, dark matteri was going to start this post with a "duh," but oddly enough, we've only featured one pearl jam album as a top ten moment on the year it released.  it was fun to remember a time when pearl jam shows were so amazing that they outshined the actual album they were touring to support.moving on!  dark matter.  pearl jam won the promotion game in 2023.  announced in february and released in april, pearl jam used dark matter as a vehicle to keep us absolutely amped for the band.  starting with a midnight release of the first single which had us all up past our bedtimes listening to one hell of a first single.then pearl jam rolled out more snippets of the album via social media, gave us another midnight release for running, played the album in record stores, released it with visualization videos in movie theaters, mixed an hd and dolby atmos version the album, and then in april, released the album on thirteen different colored vinyl variations (14 if you count black, 15 if you count a later, lenticular release).and then, the music.  "best album since yield" was a phrase so commonly used that some of our phones suggested the phrase as soon as we typed the b and the e.  for their twelfth album, pearl jam tapped earthling producer, andrew watt. watt has been a long time fan of the band and he also marks the first time pearl jam has shared this much space on an album with their producer.  watt even has writing credits on most songs.fans have been absolutely giddy about how good this album sounds and the message of hope that is weaved throughout.  almost a year out, and most fans can't articulate their favorite song.  waiting for stevie, which sonically harkens back to ten?  wreckage which is the easy sing-a-long favorite in shows?  setting sun, whose mournful tone brough a close to most of the early shows on this tour?  it can't be done.we'll keep listening. thumbing through a gatefold and lyric book full of gorgeous light photography by alexandr gnezdilov which found its way onto a gigantic screen at every pearl jam show care of rob sheridan. or, we'll be at the shows, since we've got one more shot at an american tour this summer, we'll keep trying to nail down our favorites.  and who knows, maybe we'll see you on the road for one of the top ten pearl jam moments of 2025!credit: rob sheridan

top ten pearl jam moments of 2024, #2





 #2, i am no guidereally, this should be #1, but stip is making me exert some modesty.  there might have been one thing in the pearl jam world more important than the book we wrote together, which takes you on a wild ride through the lives of pearl jam via the music and lyrics that they've put out over the course of 34 years.i am no guide: pearl jam song-by-song breaks down each song on each studio album and follows the evolution of pearl jam from angsty newcomers who can barely hold their shit together to the surviving elder statesmen of grunge rock.  all along the way, we provide performances of each song for you to seek out and grow your fandom.our friends in england have been reading this book for a couple of months now, and the current date for our american fans is january 21st, so if you haven't pre-ordered it yet, there is still time!  if you super can't wait, check out our guided tour series, which although incomplete and unedited, was the impetus for our book.in our heart, this is a volume one, and if two comes soon, it might make another year's list!

top ten pearl jam moments of 2024, #3





 #3, save it for later and room at the toppearl jam albums are obviously the gold standard, but it is always exciting to get little snippets of new music unexpectedly dropped in our lap, save it for later, originally by the english beat, and room at the top, originally by tom petty.over the summer, eddie released a couple of covers for television that we can't get enough of.  despite the art for save it for later being an 45, both are only available via the shows they were recorded for or spotify.save it for later made a great resurgence as a betterman tag this tour based on this amazing single which also features a uncredited saxophone solo.  first sax on a pearl jam song?  maybe!room at the top didn't make a pearl jam debut, but it is the sort of thing we can probably expect the next time ed hits the road solo or with the earthlings.  2026?

 top ten pearl jam moments of 2024, #4





#4, the tourcredit: geoff whitmanthe tour, could be said to be multiple moments, all the moments really ... and of course, others have made that argument.having sat out 2019, pearl jam made the pain of covid so much worse, as the lock down resulted in a paultry 4 shows over the course of 3 years.  they've since tried to make up for that in 2022 with their gigaton tour and a little road trip in 2023, but this is the year they really spread their wings again.pearl jam played all over the us across two legs with a european leg in the middle and an australian leg at the end, and when all was said and done, they announced more shows in the american south for 2025.with shorter shows than the 2010s, fans may not be getting the same volume of pearl jam, but the band is making sure we get the quality.  starting off with a lot of dark matter really roped fans into the new album, but by the end of the tour, pearl jam was feeding in all sorts of rarities like out of my mind, inside job, and long road, even debuting gremmie out of control and whale song (with jack irons) at ohana.moment #4 is moment after moment, and different moments for every fan, but before the year is up, we needed to recognize how amazing a year of live pearl jam shows can be.
