oh the weather is kind of frightful...





it's in the teens this week. colder than it's been all winter. they are calling for snow tonight 3-6 inches but when was the last time that the weather man got it right? i'm staying up late to see if it starts snowing - so far nadda.weather like this makes using public transportation almost unbearable. everyone crams into the train cars the second the train arrives to just get out of the cold. everyone is bundled up more causing for less space to stand/sit. my train drops me off about 400 yards (give or take) from the front door to my office - the tears in my eyes were frozen before i even arrived this morning. i waited for my ride about 10 minutes tonight and i thought i would never thaw out.i haven't posted in a month... not much going on in these parts. its cold, it was january and now its february. i'm boring myself with this post - so i won't make you suffer though it any longer.have a great night. hopefully, i'll post again before march.

celebs in a five minutes





this week highlight is five minutes or less:* britney crotch watch 2006 continues - if you missed it, britney was caught pantyless three times in one week. what did kfed take all your panties? someone for goodness sake buy this girl some undies. * tomkat held another reception in la this past weekend for all her friends that weren't invited to the italy affair. would you go if you were one of her dawson creek friends and you only got an invitation to this party and not the $6 million dollar private jet party with jlo? * denise richards and charlie sheen's divorce is final now. hopefully, they will stop bad mouthing each other now. the kicker is that his new girlfriend can't wait to get married and have a child of their own. sister, did you hear what he did to denise? come on and smell the coffee.* speaking of divorces - pam and kid rock. were you really surprised? i guess the three wedding receptions were one for every month they were married.* lalohan is reportedly going to aa meetings but was photographed drinking with her mom. dina your daughter is 20 - as in not legal to drink yet. you want to take some parenting responsibility and do something about that?* and biggest news yet - angelina and brad came out for her movie premiere where she gushed about their love and commitment. she said that they didn't expect to fall in love and that neither of them was looking for a relationship when they got together. nothing about their relationship will be okay with me. every time i see them together all i can think of is "home wrecker" and "cheater".that's all i got. night internet.

shit happens!





i was in a car accident last week. it sucked and it was my fault. it sucks because it was my fault. i didn't mean to do it, i didn't want to do it. it just happened. actually, it happened in like 2 seconds. one second i was driving the next i wasn't. i'm fine but my car is not so fine. that sucks too.i don't want to go into details, mostly because i'll probably have to go to court regarding this and i don't want to say anything because what if they read my blog. realistically, what would be the changes of that? i mean really folks.but i'm paranoid like that. and apparently a bad driver too.have you seen the recent vw commercials? the one that sticks out in my mind - its the two guys driving along in a jetta talking about a girl. the first guy is talking about how he doesn't think the girl really likes him and the second guy says "its probably because you always say "like" like some valley girl." when all of a sudden a truck starts pulling out of a driveway right in front of them and by the time the first guy has enough time to react, its too late and they plow right into the back of the truck. do you know the commercial?well, i saw it right after i got home from the car accident. it made me cry and i'm not sure why. i'm thinking that my next car should be a vw because the commercial says they are safe. i'm also thinking that i don't really want to ever drive again and i haven't had to since the accident. do you think that i can get away with not driving for the rest of my life? maybe if i lived in settle with isabel?isabel - do you have any room at your apartment?

yes, they really went through with it.





i don't want to talk about the one thing that everyone is talking about today. i mean everyone. even my mom called me on sunday to ask if i had seen the photos from the wedding. today at lunch the guys all wanted to know if i knew about all the celebrities that were in attendance. or that david beckham had to miss the wedding to fly back to spain for his game but then got side lined for missing practice. or did i see what jlo wore or for that matter what they wore.yes, i know all about it. i saw what they wore, who was there, and the description of what their ceremony was like: "i will provide you pans and combs and you girl will ignore it if i ever decide to cheat on you." i know about it all. how could i not? would i really be ella if i didn't?so here is a picture in case you missed it - which you would have to be living under a rock to miss. enjoy.notice her slouching in her wedding dress to appear short than her new hubby. and whats up with her hair?
