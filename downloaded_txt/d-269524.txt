		what interns are saying
			






good for a first internship
the missions were not really interesting because it was on phone and it's to repetitive but the atmosphere at work was really good. the salary was very high for an internship and it helps to understand how to work in a company. the managers were well listening and nice. being in amsterdam is a chance because it's a cosmopolite city with a lot of things to do.

hostel one batllo | assistant managerhostel one batllo |...
uring my tenure as an assistant manager intern, i played a pivotal role in the launch and management of a dynamic new hostel under the hostel one brand (now known as one fam), starting in february. i was actively involved in the pre-opening phase, where i meticulously assembled my own team and developed operational processes from the ground up. my responsibilities included continuous leadership and oversight of the hostel, resulting in its achievement of a remarkable top 3 rating among all hostels in barcelona. at the time, it proudly held the esteemed position of being the #1 hostel on booking.com. my primary dedication has always been to create an exceptional environment conducive to the growth and success of my team members. i am honored to share that our collective efforts led to a nomination for the prestigious title of 'best new hostel in the world 2022' on hostelworld.

		opinions from students
			




		kunxu - banking,  2024	

		international vibe	
impact and tight course schedule, great alumni and job resources

 

     202 reviews


		 escp business school		





		marcel - business studies,  2023	

		good for students that want to go global	
the campus itself is not the largest, but all students course business, law or politic-related studies. thus, you are guaranteed to come out of the school with an amazing network of like-minded peers. i had to remove one star for how clunky and slow their internal system is, there is much to be improved in that area.

high quality teaching with smaller seminar style teaching.

		maciej -  2021	

		great old university overshadowed by lack of coordination, planning, resources and a 50/50 chance of getting a powertripping staff member as a lecturer.	
have you ever wanted to know what your class schedule is at least 2 weeks before the start of the year because you actually have a part-time job/full-time job?  have you ever wanted to meet top of their class professors who teach with general respect for students?have you ever wanted to go to a college organized music event held on the giant campus grounds that would be well thought out and planned accordingly?have you ever wanted to get to know more about working on office package provided to you by the college so you can use it on your pc/laptop? well if you answered yes to any of those questions then by any means do not enlist in this college.   1. uam is incredibly well known for lack of any coordination, logistics or anything else you would connect with an idea of a good college.  i got lucky with one semester when the class schedule was delivered 3 days before the start of the year, my friend in another faculty wasn't so lucky. his schedule was delivered 1.5 weeks after the start of his year. 2. do not get me wrong, but there are a lot of good, well-spoken, kind, and cooperative staff members in this university, but it doesn't mean you won't have at least 1 or 2 powertripping, mean, egomaniacal people who somehow still stay in their positions despite the review system being opened at the end of every semester for every student to rate his/hers lecturers. i will never forget prof. jarosz telling a person after 68 min of the lecture that they are not allowed to leave the classroom for bathroom if they want to be let back in. same thing happened with this man's pet peeve of students getting late to the classroom by 2-5 minutes especially considering that the main campus itself is situated in the least reachable part of town unless you live directly near the tram stations that lead to it. good luck if you rent a room on the other side of the city, live outside of the city in the smaller towns or were just out of luck with the traffic. you will not get into this man's class if that happens. oh and don't worry he has a patience for first 2 people to ever get late during that year in that particular class, if the limit is reached you are not allowed to get into the class.stuff like that happens in different faculties on a daily basis. 3. not really a big issue as i didn't even attend knowing what a clustercluck this will be, but when a renowned university hosts an event where people are getting trampled over due to the sheer amount of them, while having only 1/2 entry gates, then yeah, it's a joke. 4. if you get lucky your it lecturer will be a sane human being, that lets you bring your own laptop to those classes instead of using the uam supplied macbooks. if you're not lucky, like me, you will run into lecturers with weird tastes. who cares if uam is supplying you and every other student/staff member with the whole office package for windows? this guy likes to use libre office because it works better on his 2006 macbook (this is not a joke) all in all, there is a reason why the most used adage used by the students is "if you studied at uam, you won't laugh in the circus" if it's your last choice or you are living in poznań then go for it, if you're out of another city just look for better choices. oh, and by the way, the tram system delivering students to the closest station for the campus? it's being renovated right now for at least 6 months to 1 year so good luck with your commuting.

		 uniwersytet adama mickiewicza		





		charlotte - business studies,  2023	

		very good school for a career in international business	
school with a strong international focus (very large number of foreign partner universities, courses given by foreign professors, possibility of long internship abroad). support in building your career (definition of your professional project, help in writing your cv, preparation for interviews, etc.)

		 università degli studi di roma - tor vergata		





		youssef - business studies,  2024	

		so far no luck	
in my opinion, the school provides good tools and workshops to increase your chances of finding an internship on your own. besides the giving workshops, the school has a few partnered companies which are open to internships.

		 hogeschool van arnhem en nijmegen		





		david - economics,  2022	

		economic's degree in upf	
majorly upf is focused on local internships, although ocasionally you can find some abroad offer. our job board is helpful and user friendly, allowing you to apply easily. in my case, i cannot take benefit from it because i find my internship via linkedin, which a is a tool i would use to complement the job board from upf in order to find a new one.

		 universitat pompeu fabra		





		francesco - management science,  2021	

		good opportunities	
there is a section of the website of the university with more than 1000 job advertisement of internships and works. there is a matching calculator that analyzes your cv and the requests. there are a lot of conferences about the finding of internships abroad and in italy.



     172 reviews


		 università degli studi di milano		





		ahmed - engineering, technology,  2024	

		encourage internships and new experiences	
the university offers a lot of help and programs, such as erasmus and bilateral, for internships abroad. they post links to sites where i can search for internships. there are zoom meetings from time to time to discuss the things students should do to apply for internships. it's also mandatory that i take internships after the second and third years.



     105 reviews


		 istanbul bilgi university		





		florian -  2021	

		great life and people but bad management	
i did my erasmus in faro. i enjoyed being in a nice place with great weather and a nearby beach. the portuguese culture is laid-back and the people living there are open minded.  the university is well equipped and the teachers are experts. i had a great experience but the organisation is more or less bad. timetables were not fixed and the intranet didnt work properly.



     22 reviews


		 universidade do algarve		





		evelin - business studies,  2022	

		good university but not much practical skills	
the university has a very good rating and is popular among european students. there are many international students with erasmus as well and the school has many partner universities around the globe. however, it did not give my the desired practical knowledge or skills i would have had wished.
