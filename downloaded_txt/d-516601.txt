shadi movahed of mina mokhtarzadeh fine art“we had a great experience exhibiting at art santa fe, and we will be looking forward to participating next year as well. we had a wide range of visitors: art collectors, art appraisers, artists, and art lovers. we enjoyed exhibiting and talking with a lot of people of different ages and backgrounds who were either local to new mexico or visitors from other states or countries. this was our second experience with redwood, and we really like working with them. their staff is very friendly and supportive, and if we had a problem, they tried their best to solve it to help us have a great experience. the staff, volunteers, and even security guards were nice, and the ambiance was filled with positive energy. we would like to extend our thanks to rmg for their expertise and support during our art show.”helene steene of helene steene collection“thank you all for being very professional about the whole expo from start to end. this was my first experience of having a solo booth anywhere. i got a museum invitation, an offer to make an art book of my work, three good european connections, and some possible future sales. on the whole, a very pleasant experience for me.”sonja metzler of sonja metzler fine art“we loved the show and had a great time. i received so many compliments and a lot of interest in my work—and i sold three pieces. the show is well managed and professional. i felt like i was with a group, well organized and competent. thank you for a good show.”paul parker, collector“i really enjoyed the show and i felt that it was the best ever art santa fe. it seems every year the quality goes up.”tata fernandez of contemporary art projects usa“once again, it was a pleasure to be part of your projects. your professionalism and friendly atmosphere during the shows is a plus for our artists and us. all four days brought with them new opportunities for my artists to expose and sell their work. i was very pleased with the attendance and expected nothing less from an internationally renowned show as is art santa fe, as well as the organizers’ expertise in promoting these types of events. we are thrilled to announce that we sold seven pieces and a patron commissioned one piece for a new house.”mary meredith, collector“i attended the art santa fe show this past weekend. it was fabulous! the best one yet, in my opinion.”
