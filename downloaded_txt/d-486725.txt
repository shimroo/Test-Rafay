building your own yard fountain

it’s not as hard as you might think to make a simple, yet workable, and beautiful yard water fountain. it takes a little time and only some minor hard work; the rest is easy and fun, because you get to be very creative, and your fountain is personally unique to you. so if you’re always wondering on how to build a water fountain, you’ve come to the right place.
first we’ll start out with a list of items that you will need for the project that can easily be found at local hardware stores and walmart. remember this is a basic list you can ad things, as you want to go on the fountain to suit you as well. such as stickers or pictures, the sky really is the limit.

a small plastic children’s-style swimming pool
a preferable color or more of exterior spray paint.
a 3′ length of ½ pvc pipe
a large, but not very heavy decorated bowl that you like is at least 12″ – 14″ in diameter (for me blue colored glass is what i used so it seems to emit a glow in the sun)
a water hose long enough to reach to where your fountain will be located.
a good quality, very large gallon per minute rating submersible water pump
4ft of tube that will fit the pump you buy
epoxy resin, which comes in the two tubes like a large syringe with two chemicals. or any quick applicator speed is key with this stuff.
an outdoor rated extension cord long enough to reach the pump from a electrical source.
a shovel
drill

once you are satisfied with all the items you have and have bought everything listed we are ready to begin the fun. first off you’ll need to paint the top rim of the pool. after it has had time to dry do another coat if possible. you can get creative a little more if you like after all it is your fountain. you could find nice colored glass, which comes by the bag at toy store, and glue them around the painted part. or even pain a complex pattern, design, or anything you can imagine here you could do before we move onto the next step make sure everything is perfect with the large reservoir (pool).
next we get into the less fun aspects of the job. for this part you will need to use your shovel to dig a hole only a little larger tan the bottom of the pool. it should be dug as until only the top lip of the pool is above ground, the part you painted and decorated earlier on. after this we will need a line opened up in the grass from the back of the reservoir to the house where the extension cord will plug. the easiest way to do this is simply by inserting the shovel into the ground then pushing it forward and pulling back a few times, next step beside that cut and do it again always overlapping. when you are done you can easily slide the extension cord in, be sure the right sides are at each end, then just step on the ground along the line, and there it is done, without tearing up any grass.
now for an easier task, take the 3 ” pvc pipe and the epoxy resin. hold the pvc pipe in the center of the pool and mark around it with a sharpie black marker. now when you are ready have someone hold it in place and you quickly go around it applying thee epoxy resin compound, don’t use too much just enough to hold. now hold it there for about 30 minutes then make it stationary by putting a couple of stacks of big books on each side, and give it 24 hours to harden, save any additional epoxy for a later step.
if you want to decorate the pvc pipe any way you desire match it up the the bottom colors or get creative. next we should put on your small reservoir, which will flow gloriously. make sure the pvc pipe has hardened and get the bowl. place the large bowl on top and use your remaining epoxy to glue it on from the bottom then fill it with water and it will stay level with the levelness of the pipe.
after 24 hours all should be done and ready to finalize. take a drill and the appropriate size drill for the water pump hose to fit into and drill a hole at the back and on the very bottom of the pvc pipe. then go up and drill one in the middle of the bowl on top. now take the water pump hose and insert it from the top into the bowl until it hits the bottom. fish it out of the hole, if you need to cur it larder and once you have it you may hook up the hose to the submersible water pump. at the top if make sure the hose sticks up about ½ inch higher than the top of the bowl. if it is not watertight around the hole in the bowl use epoxy or some silicon to seal it well.
now it’s time to have the real fun. we need to fill the pull up almost to the top and add the food coloring to make the water look nice. then switch on the pup and watch it work in minutes you should see a stream of water shooting forth from the top and gathering in the bowl, and when it fills it glitters as it falls back into the pool. experiment with the gpm rate (speed) on your pump to get the water spraying higher or lower to suit your personal fountain the best. now it’s all done just sit back and enjoy the beauty you’ve just added to your home. you can also now add things as you see what the fountain need like sitting things in the large pool. i used gargoyles in mine and recently added red coloring and a skull in the bottom pool. just have fun and remember you actually did it yourself and would have paid much more for something less personal had you bought one.continue reading






 

looking for the best roofing company? find roofers in alpharetta

roofing
may, 23, 2018

the reason for my introduction to a roofer in alpharetta, ga was not a pleasant one – my previous roofer turned out to be less than proper contractor. roof which was replaced less than 10 years ago needed to be replaced again.
i was explained later that during previous re-roofing 10 years ago the tool (something like pneumatic hammer – sorry for my non-specialist vocabulary) wasn’t adjusted properly in order to hammer the nails down to exact depth for them to be able to hold shingles in place. the holding surface of a nail should be flash with upper surface of the shingle. nails shouldn’t stick out but they also shouldn’t penetrate too deep as it would cause a crack around holding area of a nail.
that was exactly what happened to me. a couple of years go about 10 shingles were blown away one night. after painful arguing with the previous roofer i ended paying him for the repair he supposed to do as a part of the warranty. this winter the story repeated – one night more then 10 shingles were torn away. it could be repaired, but the problem would be still there, so it was decided that a new roof would be the solution.
i didn’t want to repeat my mistake and this spring i decided to make things proper way. i spend some time studying roofers’ reviews online and the roofing company named the roof clinic came to my attention. they have an office in duluth but most valuable information i gathered not from the roofer but from actual client testimonials after contacting them.
one of the aspects of good roofing job is cleanliness and property protection. what i’ve read was really encouraging: “we have used the roof clinic to replace our roof. arthur helped us pick the right shingles and he offered us a very competetive price. we had 5 quotes for the project and decided to go with the roof clinic and we are very glad we did so! they respected the scheduled date, protected our garden bushes, windows etc. they worked the whole day and finished on time. they cleaned perfectly around the house. i already recomended them to my collegues at work and they also used the roof clinic and they were happy they did. this is a great contractor.” -marius
almost all of testimonials mentioned clean job and fair estimate. but some also paid attention to unusual repairs i thought could be involved in my case. i read: “the project was well handled from the estimate (which was detailed) to completion and clean-up. the estimate was fair & competitive. the contractor repaired a small section of the roof-sheathing plywood (which was rotted due to a prior leak) at no extra cost. all my questions concerning shingle types and their projected durability were answered. the project was started and completed on time (as promised).”- john balatinecz in suwanee.
one of the aspect of good job was an ability to finish everything in one day as it could be necessary in late fall or early spring time. one of previous clients wrote: “arthur braguta explained before the start what and how his team is going to do on my roof. on company’s web site there is a video with all steps of work presented. on a day set for a start (early november 2010), they showed up at 8am and worked until 10pm, using reflector lights. they wanted to finish the job same day, despite very complicated roof construction. attention was paid to every detail. at the end, they did thorough cleaning around the property, using magnet sweeps to collect all loose nails. the whole process was exactly as shown on video presentation. the job was done very professionally and i can recommend these guys to everyone who needs re-roofing of the house.” – zivan in gwinnett.
so i decided to go for it and hired eric and his company the roof clinic. he really did the great job with my roof and everything was as promised. i just wondered why it’s so that they reach this level of customer satisfaction and after a little research i found the points that separate him form the rest of alpharetta roofers:
first: they do roofing and roofing only. there’s no point of asking to do any other work related to a property if it’s not roofing. they reach a level professionalism by specializing of one thing.
second: they don’t use any subcontractors, which are interested in making job done fast rather then properly as it was the case with my previous roofer.
third: all their foreman and installers factory-trained in best and most modern roofing techniques.
so, i found the alpharetta roofing company the roof clinic. more than fulfilling their promises. it’s a leading company in quality and all the related aspects of their work.

capability

the real service of building and construction is exceptionally fancy. lots and perhaps even numerous employees need to work together with each other to make sure that a job is done correctly. a home building and construction company that can be considered to be among fantastic quality is also one that uses only the most capable employees. since a building and construction job is generally very complex, employees who are not on the exact same page will have a hard time to assemble any structure effectively. typically these services don’t work alone. they often outsource work to contractors and are responsible for finding the best. for example, you may have a construction company building homes in atlanta and outsource finds local companies to partner with. they will find an atlanta-based flooring company, electrician, and every other trade that goes into building a home.
access to the best materials

apart from having quality employees, a home building company need to also have access to the best building products. even the most knowledgeable employees will be not able to develop something of quality if they are burdened inferior products. quality building is enabled only by the mix of excellent employees and excellent products. this also applies for projects that are made outside the company’s authority. having mentioned outsourcing with some local companies and expertise, plumbwise in cumming, ga has been known for providing the best mechanical and plumbing materials for home construction. the one big secret of sustaining and acquiring the best materials in the market is through research, connections and having the best suppliers in the field.

qualities to search for in a building and construction company
experience
the very first essential certification that you ought to try to find is comprehensive experience in the market, especially with tasks carefully associated to the structure you are preparing to finance. if you are intending on setting up a building for instance, it may not be a great idea to deal with a company that is primarily experienced in building houses. some business might can both (or more) kinds of jobs obviously, but in general, it would be best to choose a company that focuses mostly on the kind of structure that you are building.
recommendations

just like essentially each element of the market, recommendations are still the safest and most efficient techniques for discovering an ideal building and construction company. if you know somebody that has just had a house or building done, you might ask the about the company that did the work for them. even if it’s somebody you have no idea, proceed and ask anyhow. the majority of people will enjoy to give suggestions even to complete strangers, particularly if they more than happy about the job provided for them. we work with the highest quality contractors, from roofing companies to a full design and build job that requires a quality commercial construction in atlanta, ga.
portfolio

if you do not know anybody who has actually just recently had actually building and construction done or if there are no just recently finished jobs in your neighborhood, you can merely ask building business to offer you with examples of their work. most business will be thankful to offer with examples specifically if they are positive with their work.
in truth, it would most likely be best to stay away from business that can not supply you with a list of finished tasks. such business might not be positive in the quality of their work, or they might merely do not have a considerable performance history in business. in either case, these are most likely not business that you would wish to handle.
aside from the technical certifications, you will also want a company that you can deal with conveniently. set a meeting with the business that you are thinking about and aim to get a feel for how they carry out business. what you need to search for is a company that will be sincere and upcoming with you, and work carefully with you towards the effective conclusion of the task. if the company you are thinking about does not appear to be excited to deal with you, does not motivate communication, or has doubtful business practices, it may be best to keep looking.
