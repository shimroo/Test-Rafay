welcome to ics 



ics was opened in 1992, providing affordable, christian university preparatory education. the school found a niche with non-missionary families who fueled demand for the school's program. this draws into our vision as a school; ics aims to honor christ by modeling excellence and innovation in holistic christian education. ics has grown to 1200 students from p1 - 12 on our shek mun campus and 144 in our kindergarten campus in ma on shan from reception 1-2.ics seeks to be centered upon christ and is committed to building god's kingdom and integrating faith, learning, and action. we are an evangelical christian school that uses academic and extra-curricular programs to develop the whole student – intellectually, physically, socially, and spiritually.
