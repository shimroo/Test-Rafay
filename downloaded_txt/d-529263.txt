                        bmgs are top priority for gun control
                        advocates, and should be at the top of
                        our list to defend. variously, efforts
                        are underway to ban, register, or re-classify
                        these fine weapons as class iii (machineguns).
                        our response to these efforts is a
                        resounding no!
