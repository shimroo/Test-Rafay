i'm working on a new webmaster section to replace the abandoned webmaster section, and will expand it if there is some demand. it will include some tools people can use for their own websites, and tools i have created and use for other sites i build. i'll release a few projects and judge the feedback. i'm rethinking the download section as well to make it more about curated programs i use and recommend. this is compared to listing every program in a category like 17 web browsers.
