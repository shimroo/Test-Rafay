real-time monitoring of bit condition and trip timing

geolog’s bitlife real-time bit wear monitoring service applies a patent pending method to detect, compare and assess cuttings character, alkenes - the unsaturated hydrocarbons generated artificially by drilling fluid cracking, and drilling parameter responses such as torque and rate of penetration, to indicate the condition of the bit and its remaining drilling efficiency. software provides objective commercial guidance for optimal timing of bit trips.
