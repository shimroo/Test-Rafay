thanks for coming to bedford nissan near cleveland, oh
in 1970, phil greenberg first opened his cleveland-area dealership on broadway avenue down in bedford. his son, jeff, took over the business in 1986, and his own son, matt, would take over in 2006. today, three generations and nearly half a century later, bedford nissan is more successful than ever, with an inventory of hundreds of new nissan and used nissan vehicles and a caring staff that will make sure you leave the lot with exactly the car, truck, or suv you're looking for.
