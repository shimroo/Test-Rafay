reverse osmosis water treatment system
this wwe 57,000 gallon a day reverse osmosis system is designed for a customer that manufacturers commercial baking pans.  the high quality reverse osmosis permeate is utilized to rinse the new  and used pans prior to the application of a non stick coating to insure excellent bonding between the metal pan and the coating.  the superior bonding significantly increases the number of baking cycles the pans can be used before they require recoating. the complete system also includes carbon filtration and sodium softening pre-treatment prior to the reverse osmosis unit.
