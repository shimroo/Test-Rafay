rush (1991) (blu-ray review)

one of the best undercover cops 'n' drugs movies in decades, rush tells an all too-real story of a cop going undercover and while having good perception of drug use...overlooks their own addiction in the course of catching drug dealers. having a remarkable cast of actors, this is one movie you'll want to have in your collection.

john carpenter's vampires (blu-ray review)

john carpenter's vampires is finally available on blu-ray and it looks the best it ever has. of course, it will come with a large price tag, but if you're a fan of jc, then you shouldn't have much hesitation. jack crow is after a master vampire who retaliated and killed most of his vampire hunting team. imagine that. however, jack hasn't seen a powerful vamp like this before and with nefarious help from the shadows of the church, it's going to be a very challenging time!
