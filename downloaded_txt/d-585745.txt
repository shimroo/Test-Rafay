about us
adamâs apples is a nursery growing fruit trees with love and care in the heart of east devon. our fruit trees are available bare-rooted in the winter months, when they are dormant. we start taking orders from july for the upcoming bareroot season and trees are ready for planting from late-november until mid-march. 

most of our trees are sold as feathered maidens. these take us two years to produce; planting out rootstocks in the spring, bud grafting on to these rootstocks in the summer months and then training and caring for them for a second summer, before lifting them for customers in the early winter. 

we are a certified organic nursery with the soil association, licence number: ab31160.
