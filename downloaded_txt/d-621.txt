welcome to our site! we specialize in making e-books that integrate text, audio, still and animated images. we make use sophisticated scripting to enable interaction with all these features. because the design of our e-books requires careful attention to text formatting and image placement relative to text, we generally use use fixed, rather than flowing style. this approach provides an ideal framework for photographic books, poetry books, gallery and museum exhibition catalogs, children's books and similar material.
