welcome to jpjkd.com the home of  jerry poteet’s jeet kune do association™philosophy in motion®
walk through the door! 
many years ago, jerry poteet joined
ed parker and a few other kenpo students as they went to meet a young martial
artist from seattle. that man was bruce lee.
as jerry later recalled, “i wanted
to see what all the excitement was about”, so he joined his friends. the door
was opened by “a handsome young man” who smiled and invited him in.
little did jerry know that he was
stepping into his future when he walked through the door. that meeting changed
jerry’s life for the better in every way. and the impact of the young master
and his student, jerry poteet, lives on.
