explore, escape, relaxatthe rainforest inn bed & breakfastelegant, secluded, and enveloped by the jungle, our b&b offers a getaway for couples, be it on a honeymoon or a romantic reconnection; for travelers seeking an exotic escape; or those who just need a memorable break from the usual routine. perched on the northern edge of the el yunque national forest at the end of a gated, mile-long driveway, our rustic "boutique style" puerto rico bed and breakfast offers secure privacy and a touch of luxury just footsteps from one of the most impressive natural sites in the united states. 










jungle suite porch overlooks the el yunque rainforest of puerto rico. this isn’t “glamping;” you’re invited to a luxurious boutique bed and breakfast stay.





at the rainforest inn we offer our guests luxury in a terrestrial paradise. amidst the finest of linens and the antique furniture and cabinets, the spacious showers, bathrooms, and bedrooms, the rainforest inn is distinguished by the staff's personal service and islander's intimate knowledge, as well as a limited number of guests. 



without your u.s. passport, feel like you're a thousand miles from civilization, yet immerse yourself in the local puerto rican culture. in just ten minutes time you could find yourself wandering popular luquillo kioskos. or, in a little more time walking the streets of historic old san juan.

coquí laying eggs on our private trail, the el yunque “lost machete” hike.





after enjoying a day out, return to the inn and relax to the song of the coqui as it soothes your mind - the night sounds of the jungle are an aural cacophony with no air conditioning to disturb the nature sounds (only high ceiling fans and cool tropical breezes). awaken early to watch the sun rise over the caribbean sea. prepare a cup of coffee or tea in your villa, and lay back in your hammock as you wait for the delectable vegetarian breakfast being prepared. let nature enrapture you as you trek through the undergrowth on our private lost machete hike to the top of the espiritu santo waterfall. atop your private waterfall, sun and picnic among the centuries-old stones, or swim in the deep cool natural pool. return to the inn, and allow our private masseuse to take you to the peak of relaxation in our peaceful yoga room.

innkeeper renée and our little silky, gracie, relaxing after a long day.












enjoy a professional massage a dozen yards from the rainforest, serenaded by of our favorite rainforest amphibian, the song-singing coqui.





during your stay, be sure to catch the sweeping panoramas of both the caribbean, and the rainforest alike. spot the peerless variety of tropical birds around the property, and delight in the abundant leaping anoles. we’re extremely proud of what we’ve built here, (especially considering where we started), however, we really want your stay to be highlighted by the timeless natural beauty that encompasses our property. we are devoted to keeping el yunque exactly the way it is, that’s why we are passionate about making the rainforest inn as sustainable as it can be.










relax by our koi pond and enjoy the sunrise.





whatever you're looking for, be it plush pillows and a charming room, or maybe a place that cares as much about this planet as you do, or perhaps adventure's in your blood, and you'd like to escape into nature, ultimately, if you're just looking for a unique, relaxing, and beautiful place to spend your next vacation, let us be your hosts and we'll show a side of puerto rico that only a few people ever get to see.
