 what is nepa's summer in the city? 


                        "nepa's summer in the city" is an organization founded in 2022 meant to assist causes in the nepa region while offering youth leadership development opportunities that combine their outside interests with philanthropy. 
                    

                        throughout the summer, the sitc team will be working closely with the lands at hilside farms to fundraise for our care farming services program (formerly known as children's grief camp) to help disadvantaged youth have a fully-funded, week-long healing experience this summer.
