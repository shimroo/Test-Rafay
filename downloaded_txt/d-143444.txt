                                      over 40 years of legendary bar-b-q!
                                    

                                      the county line has been servin' up legendary award-winning, slow-smoked bar-b-q since 1975. we're famous for our big meaty ribs, extra lean brisket and spicy german sausage. but there's more than great food to enjoy at the county line. our spectacular views and roadhouse decor are as unique and legendary as the food we serve.

                                      in 1990, the county line began shipping its legendary barbeque to all parts of the united states by air ribs. the same quality products that you've come to enjoy in the restaurants can be shipped right to your door. what better gift could you give your family or friends than to have the county line cook for dinner?
