amygdala locator: this drawing shows where the 
        right amygdala is (follow the arrow). the left side of your brain also 
        has one (other side, hidden here). please note, the wrinkly cortex "gray 
        matter" and glial cells "white matter" of the brain is not shown. these 
        other structures are other parts of the brain's "limbic system" (the 
        "mammal brain").
in the 1970's, independent brain researcher and 
		behaviorist  
t.d.a. lingo introduced the idea that deliberate and conscious 
		control of the amygdala and it's accompanying positive or negative 
		responses in the brain was possible. his behavior modification facility, 
		which he affectionately named
		
the dormant brain research 
		and development laboratory (in existence, 1957-1993), tested this 
		hypothesis over several decades. lingo methodically observed via 
		longitudinal studies that such a thing was indeed possible. his methods 
		included visualization and meditation along with a variety of other 
		behavior modification techniques.  
the veracity of such methods to directly affect the amygdala and 
		resultant brain functions was corroborated by later research, such as 
		that carried on by sara w. lazar and herbert benson .  (sara 
		w. lazar, "stress reduction correlates with structural changes in the 
		amygdala",
		

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2840837/
sara w. lazar, g, gollub bush, g.l. 
		fricchione, g. khalsa g, herbert benson, functional brain mapping of 
		the relaxation response and meditation, neuroreport, 11: 1581-1585, 
		(2000).)
"clicking" the amygdala, is the "slang" 
		phrase first coined  by lingo that refers to either 
        automatic (reactive non-deliberate) or conscious deliberate activation 
        of amygdaloid body processes (by cortex influence).
these days, this is a preferred image  and 
		phrase...
"tickle your 
		amygdala"
 

why "tickle" instead of "click"?  "tickle" 
		is a generally positive image and thought, whereas "click" is more 
		neutral and may indicate a 
		click backwards into negativity as well as a forward positive click.     
		research with thousands of people over the past several decades shows 
		that "tickle your amygdala" is preferred.    but, just 
		use what works best for you.

		 

		 

when the amygdala's connections to 
        the r-complex (or "reptile brain", dr. paul mclean) are activated, fight 
        or flight and basic reactionary survival processes occur in brain/body. 
        the slang for this is "clicking backward". it is primary and basic, and 
        automatic.
when cortex and frontal lobes 
        processes overcome the limitations of the reactive reptile brain, the 
        slang is "clicking the amygdala forward". the brain rewards certain 
        enhanced survival behaviors with pleasure, and this patterning of 
        learned positive behavior involves the amygdala and its connections to 
        the forward pre-frontal cortex. this can be done consciously and 
        deliberately.


the brain's advanced electrochemical circuits can be and are controlled 
with thought. this is beyond any conjecture, and just a plain simple 
fact.  




to click your amygdala forward - to cause changes in amygdala function and in 
brain process- you don't need any machines, 
gadgets, pills, or signing up for expensive retreats or courses.






how to tickle your amygdala forward and eventually !pop! your frontal lobes? just 
start by reading through this site:  www.brainradar.com
1) first, read at  
the 
library . 
there is lots of free and useful information at these places and elsewhere 
throughout the entire amazing brain website.


2) brain book commercial:

when you are ready,  
the 
frontal lobes supercharge is a portable, non-electric book -very convenient, 
works anywhere. it will further clarify all aspects of clicking into your 
frontal lobes. the book systematically removes- one by one- all the obstacles 
that society puts in your way. it will quickly remove all the unconscious habits 
that keep you clicked backward.


commercial over.


 

        






tickle 

 your amygdala forward is like wiggling your finger. only it happens 
inside your brain instead of on the end of your arm. do this: wiggle 
your right index finger.....easy, isn't it? okay, wiggle your left big 
toe....easy too? now, locate your amygdala (see chart above)....you click it 
forward using your frontal lobes- image that your amygdala is like a click 
toggle switch- now click the switch forward towards your forehead. there! you 
did it.

you can control with quicktime play arrow and move to any part.

about 40% into it, you will see the limbic system--- and the amygdala is
shown as two golden nuggets in the second inside layer below the cortex--
they look like two little upturned boxing gloves perhaps

 not sure you're doing it right? read everything at the rest of this site for 
 clues and you won't have any problem. you will learn how to click your amygdala 
 forward and turn on genius levels of creativity, intelligence, pleasure, and 
 even esp in 1/10 the amount of time that students took to learn back in the 
 early days of our brain research. after 40 total years of research and 
 practical teaching to folks like you- we now know the shortcuts and what works 
 best.  

note the very obvious olfactory bulbs (looks like squid tentacles) reaching back 
into the posterior amygdaloid area. these make for an easy, if temporary, click 
forward- see  
the nose 
knows.

 

note: "click your amygdala" written and performed by eric vincent, and played on 
t.d. lingo's actual 1950's vega banjo. illustration from "the brain" by richard 
restak (excellent reference book).
