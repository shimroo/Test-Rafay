saratoga local barsthe bank14421 big basin way, saratoga, california; tel. 408.867.5155the bank is one of a kind in saratoga, a local dive bar amid some decidedly haughty surroundings and boy, are we thankful because even the toniest of neighborhoods needs to have a blue-collar drinking establishment for the regular folks.  the bank is actually saratoga's oldest bar and once you step inside you'll realize the validity of that statement because the interior looks as if it hasn't seen the light of day in all of its' thirty years of operation and there's these freaky old whiskey decanters placed everywhere that were probably part of some too hip for his time landed gentryman's estate.  but, once you get past that, the drinks are cheap and the bank gets saratoga rocking nearly every night. the basin14572 big basin way, saratoga, california; tel. 408.867.1906the basin is the neighborhood bar in saratoga complete with all of the amenities a neighborhood bar in saratoga should have: an outstanding wine and port selection, excellent drinks (especially the martinis), small cheese and fruit plates, and classic american fare.  the basin takes care of its' patrons in style and comfort without all of the pretensions you might expect from a saratoga bar and restaurant boasting a relaxed, friendly atmosphere where customers and staff chat easily. blue rock shoot14523 big basin way, saratoga, california; tel. 408.741.5180a great low-key alternative for a night out in saratoga, blue rock shoot offers its' patrons a casual, lodge-like woodsy atmosphere in which to enjoy some local live music in the folk, bluegrass or jazz veins.  the outdoor back patio at blue rock shoot is the perfect place in saratoga to catch up with old friends and, while the interior of the club is small, it totally provides fans with an intimate, memorable experience from any act that rolls through.  viaggio ristorante mediterraneo14550 big basin way, saratoga, california; tel. 408.741.5300viaggio ristorante mediterraneo's, in saratoga, bar and lounge area more than makes up for its' small size and quiet atmosphere by serving excellent drinks by downright friendly bartenders that make everyone feel welcome whether they're in for a quick drink or waiting for a table in the restaurant.   but, if there are no tables available, you can certainly dine at viaggio's bar and continue the conversation you already started with that friendly bartender. â€”saratoga bars and clubs reviews by ryan osterbeck

saratoga history  this gateway to the santa cruz mountains once           was home to the ohlone indians, but california's agricultural and timber           explosion came swiftly. after world war ii, saratoga blocked military           industrial development and incorporated as the city of saratoga. today           it retains that close-knit and quiet feel, and has settled comfortably           into a well-placed, well-heeled residential community.  saratoga began life as toll gate, named for           the toll gate erected by martin mccarty.  before it was known for its classy restaurants,           the city was first famous for its lumber mill. it later was noted for           its flour mill and, finally, for its healthful spring waters, which           recalled for some the hot springs at congress springs in saratoga, n.y.            the springs in the hills above the town became           popular with visitors, many from san francisco who came to restore themselves           in the waters.  on march 13, 1865, saratoga became the official           name of the city.
