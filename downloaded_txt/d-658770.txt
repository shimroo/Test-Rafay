sleeping children around the world provides bedkits to children in need, 50% girls and 50% boys, between the ages of 6 and 12, regardless of race, religion, national or ethnic origin, colour, gender, or physical or mental disability.bedkits are manufactured or purchased overseas by our overseas volunteer partners (ovps) - local organizations and individuals - who use their knowledge and expertise to pick the best bedkit items for the children living in that area. producing bedkits locally provides additional benefits such as employment for dozens of workers, virtually no transportation costs, and strengthened communities.sleeping children around the world has helped more than 1.8 million children in 36 countries experience healthy sleep through the gift of a bedkit."sleep is like magical fuel for children. it has the power to make them feel better, think better and play better. let's give the magic of sleep to every child every night." - dr. reut gruber, phd psychologist full  professor, department of psychiatry, faculty of medicine, mcgill university ; director, attention behavior and sleep lab, douglas research centre, psychologist at douglas mental health university institute

everything that is done at sleeping children around the world is done for the children. volunteerism is the foundation of sleeping children. the commitment of over 2000 volunteers worldwide enables sleeping children around the world to realize the vision of a world in which every child begins a day of hope after a good night’s sleep.volunteerism also allows sleeping children to keep its promise that 100% of every bedkit donation reaches a child in need.overseas volunteer partners



partners in the country of distribution are advocates for the children in their communities. they work to support children with the greatest needs, organize the manufacture of bedkits, select and package bedkit items, arrange the logistics of the distributions, and assemble detailed distribution evaluation and financial reports. our global community is strengthened through the collaboration between our overseas volunteer partners and our sleeping children team volunteers.the majority of overseas volunteer partners are service clubs such as rotary and other community-based organizations – locals who want to build a better future for children.overseas volunteer partners work for months to prepare for the bedkit distribution, devoting their time and personal resources. without their volunteer commitment, sleeping children’s vision could not be realized.
