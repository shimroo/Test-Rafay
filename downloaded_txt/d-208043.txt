pedigree host

                        pedigree host is our cloud data storage solution.
                        key features:
                    

works the same as having data on your pc but you can access your data from anywhere with an internet connection or share access with others.
works with pedigree publisher or pedigree cloud. currently we are not offerring this for use with pedigree point.

                            multiple users can connect to the same hosted database at the same time so when one user makes a change,
                            all the other users connected to that database will see that change.
                        
its easy to get started - just order this item separately from our order page. you will receive an immediate email confirming 
                        your purchase and giving you simple two step instructions to get started.
its flexible - you can download your entire database any time and just continue editing it on your pc so you are never locked in.



pedigree cloud

                        pedigree cloud (pedcloud) is a desktop pedigree program that runs on windows pcs with data stored in the cloud.
                        key features:
                    

perfect for groups such as breed clubs, registries, genetic researchers working on common data.
data is stored either on your own mysql database (typically these are provided by your web hosting company), on your pc or hosted by us.

                            multiple users can connect to the same mysql database at the same time so when one user makes a change,
                            all the other users connected to that database will see that change.
                        
if you use your own mysql database you have complete control, privacy and security.
use mysql remote access to limit what ip addresses can access for extra security.

                            works well with pedigree point since all updates are immediately visible to pedpoint users and there is no need to publish which is an advantage for large databases.

our clients

julie brown - btw i've been using this program for probably 10 years now...originally
                            it was purchased to save handwriting out those certificates but it has led to a real passion and interest in
                            breed health, history, etc. being able to run such thorough analysis, coi etc on dogs has put a whole new
                            dimension and perspective on breeding. i cannot thank you enough for this program. it's proven to be such a
                            valuable tool and the information i've acquired has helped a lot of people, and dogs.
                        

helen scott - yorkshire terriersi do love your program.  have tried them all including
                            [names deleted] etc.  breedmate is fast, intuitive, stable, flexible, awesome capabilities, enables detail and a
                            plethora of data.  merge database is supurb. have surprised myself in being successful in modifying forms and text
                            reports but my ability in that area is somewhat limited.
                        

gillian bartlett - www.teraustralis.com breedmate is most accurate, as the  program
                            makes  it  hard  to misspell the a dog's name by mistyping (it asks if  you want to add a new entry when it is spelt
                            differently, thus alerting you to a variation in the name). it can be used to plan litters by checking the inbreeding
                            co-efficients, duplicated ancestors,  colours of coats in the ancestors - so much information to be seen.

faq

here are our answers to some actual questions from users.


hello i found your products on line and they appear to be the most complete i have seen.
                        true
                    

is the program purchased outright or is there an additional monthly fee? the program is purchased out right â itâs yours forever. there are no monthly fees.
                        it comes with one year of free support including free upgrades. upgrades will always be cheap -
                        since 2002, users could upgrade for just us$20.
                    

 is all data and program stored on my computer or in the cloud? all the data and program is stored on your computer. nothing is stored in the cloud. in fact all data for each breed
                        is in one convenient file so you could have boxers.db, poodles.db, myhorses.db so they are easy to make
                        backups by just copying the files to a usb etc. btw there is no limit on the number of breed databases.
                    

my horses have multiple registration numbers and other ids can you modify the files for these added requirements? no problems adding any number of fields to any table in each database. all databases and forms are fully
                        customisable.
                    

can a picture(s) be added to each entry? a picture can be added to each entry. some forms are designed to show photos usually just for the first two generations
                        due to fitting them in but all forms can be modified to include photos.
                    
is there a limit to the number of animals? we use a popular open source database called sqlite which has huge limits, certainly greater than 4 billion records.

is the program downloaded after purchase? if so what if you change computers? after purchase we send you an email with download instructions. within your support period you can download the installer
                        an unlimited number of times. you can also save each installer and use it an unlimited number of times.you can install on up to three computers at the same time that you are the main user of. you can reinstall on replacement
                        computers an unlimited number of times.
                    

at this point on your production which program do you recommend for my use and what are the benefits of combining your programs? at this point we always recommend pedigree publisher rather than pedigree explorer.  it is our newest program and is where all development
                        will occur going forward. there is no advantage to having both programs.
                    
i will have many 100's of hours of data entry and want to make sure this will last the rest of my life! lol all of our programs allow exporting or importing from excel, access, csv and many other formats so you will never lose your data.
