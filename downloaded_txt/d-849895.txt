jiu-jitsu lifestyle



 














"i have devoted my entire life to jiu jitsu and recently had a revelation larger and more profound than the techniques and all of my accomplishments combined. the art’s most beneficial aspects cannot be seen or taught because they are mental, not physical. jiu jitsu changes an individual’s perception and the way one deals with life’s opponents. despair, low self esteem, and a lack of motivation can all be defeated by the invisible jiu jitsu.""jiu jitsu teaches you how to survive on the mat and thrive in the world." rickson gracie.
