‘neither hamas nor the palestinian authority’: netanyahu rejects reports of gaza power transfer                  







fdd | feb 17, 2025

hudson institute, cc by 2.0, via wikimedia commons

netanyahu rejects post-war pa governance in gaza: israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said on february 17 that “the day after the war in gaza, neither hamas nor the palestinian authority will be there.” netanyahu’s statements came following unconfirmed arabic media reports that the iran-backed hamas terrorist organization had agreed to a conditional transfer of power in gaza to the pa following pressure from egypt.

was/is gaza an open-air prison? yes and no                  



walter e. block | jan 19, 2025

why the “was/is” in the title of this essay. that is because there are two time periods for which this question can apply. first, before and up to the present date, 1/19/2025, when israel had some significant control over gaza thanks to the treaty between the only civilized country in the middle east and the barbarians. second, from this day hence, when the idf will leave this enclave, and hamas will take over complete control of it.

the shattering of foreign-policy delusions                  



peloni:  it is an intolerable situation for abu mazen to remain in power even as the head of the pa.  mazen is the head of the terror faction, fatah, and conducts his dominion over his current domain as only an unreformed terrorist might.  the artificial construct of the pa as being anything less threatening than a terror enclave has been both disingenuous and a force multiplier of victimizing innocent israelis.  this charade must be ended, abbas should be arrested and tried for his well funded campaign of terror against israel, and the pals should be allowed to choose to emigrate in a similar manner as has been recommended for the gazans.  those pals which remain should choose their path wisely, and if they make a similar choice to that made by the gazans in supporting yet another terror governing body, their fate should be no different from what has come to visit gaza, without waiting for an october 7 event to transpire.  terrorism is not a human right, it is a war crime which should be met with the greatest of rejections by the civilized world, which is total war.
while some consider the proposed measures for gaza as a non-starter, there are few other ideas on the table—certainly not for mahmoud abbas, whose palestinian authority lacks credibility.
sarah n. stern | feb 17, 2025
gobierno de chile, cc by 3.0 cl, via wikimedia commons
u.s. secretary of state marco rubio spoke during his visit on sunday with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in jerusalem, stating that the president also “has been very bold about his view of what the future for gaza should be—not the same tired ideas of the past, but something that is bold. and something that frankly took courage and vision in order to outline. and it might have shocked and surprised many. but what may not continue is the same cycle where we repeat over and over again, and wind up in the exact same place.”

anti-israel protests in america: soros-funded, hamas-approved                  



peloni:  this is an important analysis of the astroturf aspect of the pro-hamas, pro-terror rallies and riots which have plagued the world since october 7 took place.  there are laws on the books which should be invoked in prosecuting the support of terror groups, and it would be rewarding to hear that these will be employed by the current administration against those whose psyops transfigured the us into a modern day vision of the medieval past when jew hunts were permitted, popularized, and promoted.

israeli brigadier general warns: released jihadi prisoners will wage jihad and build militias in judea and samaria                  



peloni:  the release of these jihadis will have its own butcher’s bill to pay, which is only part of the unfortunate consequence of striking such a bargain which rewards terrorists for their war crimes.
by christine douglass-williams | feb 17, 2025

since the gaza ceasefire agreement on january 19, the idf has detained 380 palestinians in judea and samaria. two days after the agreement, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu “announced the start of a large-scale operation to defeat terrorism” in the city of jenin. days later, the operation was expanded into tulkarm and tubas. while the left-leaning mainstream media makes israel look like the aggressor, israel is protecting its citizens from the actual aggressors: islamic jihadis.

israel’s psychological warfare attack, excellent start!                  



it was a brilliant psychological attack that soiled each of those murderers in a way that no fire can ever cleanse. nothing can erase the fact that those words and that star were on their bodies. it is a burden that will grow heavier with time, and gnaw at their hearts forever

anjuli pandavar | 18 feb 2025
to turn their attacks against them, we must first recognise their attacks.
operation badr, the egyptian opening attack of the yom kippur war, was possibly more devastating than the attack on october 7, in that its effects were all devastating, leaving jew fighting jew, intensifying to this very day, with israelis coming close to tearing their own country apart.

arab voices: trampling on flags, trampling on civilisation                  



there are many ways to express one’s opinions in a civilised society—through debate, diplomacy, and dialogue. but then, there are those who resort to petty and vulgar theatrics, displaying their sheer intellectual and moral bankruptcy.

life, liberty & levin feb 15 & 16                  



peloni:  the govt within a govt is dependent upon an ever increasing level of fraud, waste & abuse which lies in excess of $250-$500 billion every single year.  this immense sinkhole of us taxpayer dollars acts as the tether by which the power is maintained by this govt within the govt, and as trump has been elected to eliminate this sinkhole, the govt within a govt is responding as if its very existence is dependent upon their defeating trump, because it does.  levin describes these facts as well as discussing doge and illegal immigration.

mk ariel kallner: i promised – and i kept my promise!                  



peloni:  this legislation provides a vital step towards establishing national sovereignty.  hopefully, this bill will pass easily with the nationalist majority govt, to which i suspect ben gvir will give his full support.  of course, one must question why this bill was pulled from consideration some two years ago when the nationalist majority was already in place?  interestingly, this has been timed to coincide with the hold on us foreign funding, which would include the very form of foreign influence peddling which this bill is designed to derail…
ariel kallner | x | feb 16, 2025
click on photo for original tweet

about two years ago, under heavy international pressure, the ministerial committee for legislation withdrew my bill against foreign political subversion. i said then that the fight was not over – and today i keep it: the ministerial committee for legislation approved my bill, which stipulates that any donation from a foreign country will be subject to an 80% tax, and that non-profit organizations supported by foreign political entities will no longer be able to petition the israeli legal system.
why is this important? why prevent foreign countries from funding non-profit organizations in israel and why block their path to the courts?

maha: hhs’s rfk, jr. gets off to an impressive start                  



peloni:  the reforms which were proposed by rfk during his campaign were important and long overdue, and it is very important that his maha agenda be pursued with a rigorous effort.  he has just been confirmed, but it will be important to hear him offer a response to the anticipated project stargate on which he has thus far been silent, as well as the continued use of the existing mrna shots, on which he has previously spoken extensively.
by monica showalter | am thinker | feb 16, 2025

how’d we get so lucky?
robert f. kennedy, jr. is on the job in president trump’s cabinet as health and human services secretary after getting confirmed a few days ago and and he’s gotten right to work, coming up with usable, practical solutions to america’s health crisis, all of which should have multi-partisan appeal.

ukraine-russia war debacle may spell end of american taxpayers’ funding of european-globalist warmongering cartels in london and paris                  



nato’s super-expensive proxy war against russia has finally run its course, ending in total failure. this may result in the obliteration of post-world war ii norms in which u.s. fights europe’s wars.

european leaders are screeching and hollering over being left out of president trump’s peace talks seeking an end to the bloody russia-ukraine border war.
despite all of the financial and military assistance from the west, ukraine has not been able to defeat russia. and let’s be frank, it never will.

king abdullah ii, take back your citizens                  



peloni:   this article provides an important accounting of both the history and the law regarding the topic of the palestinian arabs, and should be carefully considered while foreign nations seek to import their interests upon israel.  in fact, it is only thru the test of history and law from which legitimate solutions might be fashioned and on which equitable resolutions should be based.  with this in mind, there can be no contest to the fact that the palestinian arabs were made stateless following their abandonment by jordan, an act which should have earned the unified outcry by the international community at the time, an outcry which could only be deligitimized by denying the truth told by both history and law that the palestinian arabs have always been jordanian citizens.  as grunstein explains so well, the world should be speaking with one voice in stating, “king abdullah ii, take back your citizens“
whatever rights arab residents of judea, samaria and eastern jerusalem may have had to assert any claim to sovereignty over these areas were given over to jordan.
