privacy statement (updated nov. 16, 2016)
this privacy statement covers all web sites owned and/or operated by center for christian virtue(ccv. this disclosure covers the following subjects:

what personally identifiable information ccv collects.
how ccv uses the information.
what personally identifiable information third parties collect through the web site.
what organization collects the information.
with whom ccv may share user information.
what choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.
what types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under ccv’s control.
how users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

if users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, contact ccv at (513) 733.5775.
information collection and use
information collectionccv is the sole owner of the information collected on all our web sites owned and/or operated by ccv. ccv collects information from its users at several different points on its web site.
registrationin order to use portions of this web site, a user must first complete the registration form. during registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). ccv uses this information to contact the user about services on its site for which the user has expressed interest.
donationccv requests information from the user on our donation form. a user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). this information is used to process the donation. if ccv has trouble processing a donation, the information is used to contact the user.
profileccv stores information collected through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of its users. a profile is stored information kept on individual users that details their viewing preferences. consequently, collected information is tied to the user’s personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. this profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to ccv web site and to direct pertinent information to them.
cookiesa cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. ccv uses both session id cookies and persistent cookies. a persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. persistent cookies can be removed by following internet browser help file directions.
by setting a cookie on ccv’s site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. if users reject the cookie, they may still use ccv’s site. the only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of ccv’s site. persistent cookies enable ccv to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on ccv’s site. see the “profile” section.
log fileslike most standard web site servers ccv uses log files. this includes internet protocol (ip) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (isp), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
clear gifs (web beacons/web bugs)ccv employs (or our third party affiliated contractors employ) a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that helps ccv better manage content on its site by indicating what content is effective. clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. the main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
clear gifs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same web site or organization. that means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyx.com”, which uses an advertising company’s clear gif, the web site (or advertising company) would match the clear gif’s identifier and the advertising company’s cookie id number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. this collected information would then be given to the advertising company (or web site).
in addition, ccv uses clear gifs in our html-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. this allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. if you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the opt-out section.
communications
special offers and updatesccv may send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. established members will occasionally receive information on resources, services, urgent issues, and our newsletter. out of respect the user’s privacy, the user may opt-out of receiving these types of communications (see the choice and opt-out section).
newslettersif a user wishes to subscribe to ccv’s e-mail communications or other information sources, ccv asks for contact information such as name, email and address. out of respect for the user’s privacy, the user may opt-out of these communications (see the choice/opt-out section).
customer serviceccv communicates with users on a regular basis to provide requested resources and in regards to issues relating to their account ccv replies via email or phone, in accordance with the user’s wishes.
sharing of information
legal disclaimerccv may need to disclose personal information when ccv has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process.
aggregate information (non-personally identifiable)ccv may share aggregated demographic information with others.
third party intermediariesccv may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to process donations or bill users for goods and services. these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
service providersccv will not sell or rent its list. ccv may partner with other third parties to provide specific services, including data analysis and marketing assistance to expand awareness of ccv’s work and improve its communications. ccv may share data that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. these third parties may use this data for the purpose of providing similar services to participating member organizations.
the companies with which ccv shares data are contractually prohibited from using this information for any purpose other than that for which it was provided and are required to have appropriate safeguards in place to protect that data.
out of respect the user’s privacy, the user may opt-out of allowing their personal information shared with a third party for data analysis purposes (see the choice and opt-out section).
 
choice/opt-outin respect for users’ privacy ccv allows restrictions in how it uses their personal information by offering the following options:

do not contact me by telephone except when i have personally requested a reply.
do not send me communications by postal mail for anything i have not requested.
do not send me email communications for which i have not subscribed.
do not send me fundraising requests for ccv.
do not share my information with a third party for data analysis purposes.
do not contact me by text message.

users may inform ccv of their preferences at any time. all reasonable efforts will be taken to ensure the users’ requests are honored.
linksccv’s web site contains links to other sites. please be aware that ccv is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. ccv encourages users to be aware when they leave ccv’s site and to read the privacy statements of web sites that collects personal information.
surveysfrom time to time ccv’s site may request information from users via surveys. participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. the requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). survey information is generally used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of ccv’s web site and for improving our communications.
securityccv takes every precaution to protect its users’ information. when users submit sensitive information via the web site, ccv makes great effort to ensure their information is protected both online and off-line. when ccv’s registration or donor form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with ssl, the best encryption software we are aware of in the industry.
while ccv uses ssl encryption to protect sensitive information online, ccv also aggressively protects user information off-line. only ccv employees who need the information to perform a specific task are granted access to personal information. finally, the servers that store personal information are in a secure environment.
supplementation of informationin order for this web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for ccv to supplement the information it receives with information from third party sources.
id verificationccv may use software to verify a user’s address to avoid session hijacking hacking attempts or other attacks.
enhancement of marketing profileccv may obtain third party data and add it to our existing user database to better target our communications.
correcting/updating/deactivating personal informationif a user’s personal information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or deactivate the user’s personal information.
notification of changesccv reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. if ccv changes its privacy policy, ccv will post notification on the homepage and other places ccv deems appropriate that the privacy statement has been changed so its users are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed.
