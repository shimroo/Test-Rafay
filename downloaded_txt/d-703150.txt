the need is greater than ever beforemore than 300,000 individuals are turning to sacramento food bank & family services (sfbfs) and our network of 125 partner agencies for food assistance every month. sfbfs has been serving sacramento county for over 48 years, but the demand for food assistance has never been greater. after four straight years of increased demand, sfbfs’ resources are becoming increasingly stretched. but with your support, we’ll be able to keep pace with demand and continue distributing more food to more people than ever before. whether you choose to run or walk the 5k or 10k, donate to an individual or team or fundraise yourself, every dollar from run to feed the hungry will be used to feed the more than 1 in 4 sacramentans at risk of hunger.
