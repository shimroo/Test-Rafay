message from the president






the bristol chamber of commerce received its first 5-star accreditation in 2005 (the highest honor a chamber can earn). accreditation with the u.s. chamber of commerce is a prestigious honor that distinguishes the high quality, expertise, and strong leadership displayed by accredited state and local chambers of commerce. 
so, what does this mean?  the bristol chamber of commerce is in the top 1.8% of chambers in the country for strong business practices, leadership, outstanding contributions to the bristol community, supporting free enterprise and pro-growth policies, and establishing best practices to remain on the cutting edge.  while representing nearly 700 business investors, the bristol chamber of commerce has demonstrated its value as the leader of the business community. 
we can all be proud that the history of our chamber has been, and continues to be, that we are an organization which utilizes best practices and leads by example.  i am proud to work among a group of board members, staff, investors, and community partners who hold us to such high standards and expectations. 
beth rhinehart
