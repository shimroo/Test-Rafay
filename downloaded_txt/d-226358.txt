				jssa's 2023 annual report			

our 2023 annual report shares stories that illustrate the creative approaches jssa used to meet the gaps in access to critical care for our neighbors as the demand for mental health support remained at peak levels and many federal pandemic-era programs ended. jssa rose to meet the changing realities in ways big and small. we are proud of the solutions jssa delivered to nurture physical health, mental health, and quality of life.
