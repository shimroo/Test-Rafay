auto liability
 



auto liability insurance protects your company from damage or injuries to other people and property as a result of truck accidents. 












 








motor truck cargo
 



motor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight. the policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle and for fleets there will usually be catastrophe and or/terminal limits. 












 








physical damage 



this type of policy provides actual cash value protection (or stated value, whichever is less) to an insured’s equipment in the event of an accident (collision, fire, theft, and vandalism). 












 








captive programs (rental and member-owned) 



captive programs are owned and controlled by you or individual companies participating in a “co-op-like” arrangement. they are similar to your deal operations in that your insurance program can also become a profit center. 












 








contingent cargo liability 



this type of policy is designed to protect a transportation broker or freight forwarder against the liability assumed when making arrangements to move cargo for others. it provides coverage when a trucker’s primary motor truck cargo policy fails to assume the responsibility for cargo loss or damage. 












 








general liability 



general liability insurance covers common business risks including accidental third-party injuries and damage to third-party property. this type of coverage protects you from the high costs of lawsuits and helps you qualify for leases and contracts. 












 








non-trucking liability insurance (bobtail) 



for owner-operators who are permanently leased to an icc regulated carrier, this coverage provides limited liability protection when the owner-operator is not on dispatch or pulling a loaded trailer. 












 








workers’ compensation 



workers’ comp provides medical and wage benefits to your workers if they are injured or become ill at work. it also helps protect your business from civil suits that could result from workplace injuries. 












 








occupational accident (occ/acc) with contingent liability & true workers’ compensation 



while workers’ compensation provides coverage in case of accidents and injuries sustained by your employees, occupational accident insurance provides similar benefits to independent contractors driving for you. contingent liability insurance covers those instances when the independent contractor tries to file a workers’ comp claim as an employee.  












 








excess/umbrella liability 



this coverage kicks in when your other resources have been depleted and won’t completely cover the costs. we can offer coverage up to $100 million or only with specified shippers/units.
