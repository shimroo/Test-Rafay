your passion,
is our passion 
							 


welcome to the
ferrari owners' club
of great britain 
							
 


from track days
to championships 
							 


 











				we are a friendly, relaxed club with around 2,500 members who own a wide range of cars from early tipos to the latest in the ferrari range. 
			

				we are independent, but as the ferrari s.p.a recognised owners’ club for the uk, we are part of the ferrari ‘family’ and maintain a close relationship with ferrari north europe and the factory.
we pride ourselves on offering something for everyone from smaller local events with fellow members to larger social occasions at exclusive venues. you can do everything from a local drive out and picnic to racing your ferrari internationally, all under the care and organisation of the club.
