played there for the first last year with a group that was their 9th year going and will be back with them in sept for their 10 year. what a beautiful and well maintained course. staff was very hospitable and friendly. the food was delicious and the price for the weekend package that included 4 rounds of golf plus room and board were very very reasonable. looking forward to this years outing.






-donald b.
we've been visiting bright leaf as a group for the past sixteen years. it's always been a positive experience that we look forward to every year. the course has always been in great shape and beautiful, the staff have always been kind and helpful, the restaurant (and waitresses) has always been top-notch, the rooms are clean and comfortable. i would recommend the all-inclusive package to anyone.the only negative i can think of is that we can't reserve specific rooms, but that's a small issue compared to all the good times. #brightleaf






-tim b
this is the 40th year for our group trip started by my father-in-law and continued by me. our group has changed faces through the years but the great times, fun, laughter, and fellowship have remained. bright leaf always has great hospitality and the course is fun to play no matter what your skill level is. you never have to leave if you don't want to and if you do, harrodsburg and danville are just down the road.






-jimmy y.
can't say enough about this place. great atmosphere great course everyone there is fantastic!






michael j.
we gave held our annual golf trip here for the last nine years. the highlight is always the fantastic people at the 19th hole that always make us feel at home. people are the difference and they always go out of there way.
