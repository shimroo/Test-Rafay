                                tds authorization change
                            

                                as part of the irs’ effort to continue combatting identity theft and protecting taxpayers’ personal information, we’re making changes that will impact how tax professionals receive transcripts.

beginning april 8, 2024, tax professionals must call the practitioner priority service (pps) to request transcripts to be deposited into their secure object repository (sor). while pps has been the primary avenue for these requests, other irs toll-free lines will no longer offer the sor as a delivery method.

additionally, tax professionals need to pass the current required authentication and also verify their short identification (id). the short id is a unique 8-10 alphanumeric code that is systemically assigned when an irs account is established. this short id is visible when the tax professional logs in to their e-services sor. if the identity can’t be verified, transcripts will only be mailed to the address of record. pps assistors cannot resolve issues with id.me identity proofing or the status of an id.me account.
