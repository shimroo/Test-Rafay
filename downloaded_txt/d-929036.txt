who we are.          
ch.i.l.d. stands for children with intestinal and liver disorders, and they are who we fight for! over twenty-five years since starting our foundation in 1995; it has been a labor of love for many people. it has also been successful, accomplishing public awareness which had never before been  witnessed. no longer do children, families and adults with inflammatory  bowel disease (ibd)* shy away from talking about the disorders, and as a  result we have also been successful in raising $27 m for research and built a research lab, the first of its kind in bc, and established two  endowed chairs for research at ubc and at children’s hospital. we could  only accomplish this with your help and your support. thank you for this and for giving what you could in every way.
 *inflammatory bowel diseases or ibd: the umbrella term for crohn’s disease & ulcerative colitis.
