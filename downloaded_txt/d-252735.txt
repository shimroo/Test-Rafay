welcome to  the fellowship
welcome to the online community of ecclesia pistis sophia â the sophian gnostic tradition. this website is dedicated to the teachings and practices of a living tradition of gnostic christianity - a western path to enlightenment..






sophian lineage
the sophian tradition represents a lineage of spiritual masters who have taught the gnostic path and christian kabbalah to close friends âmouth to earâ from one generation to another; hence, teaching a path of self-realization for the west. today initiates of the fellowship are openly sharing these mystical teachings and devotions, believing that the extension of truth and light to all who might receive it is very important in these times.










we hope you enjoy the articles presented here and we welcome all who have a sincere interest in sophian gnosticsm to participate in our forum and our live, online discourses. blessings and shalom!
