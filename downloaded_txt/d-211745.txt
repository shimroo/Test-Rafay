what to expect from a ghostwriter 



ghostwriting is a well-entrenched practice in the literary and digital content world, embodying a blend of anonymity and creativity. it’s the silent whisper behind numerous bestselling books, thought leadership articles, and social media posts that captivate audiences. when authors lack the time or the writing finesse, a ghostwriter steps in to articulate thoughts eloquently on paper, all while remaining unseen. this veil of anonymity often shrouds the profession in a cloak of mystery, making the process of hiring a ghostwriter seem daunting for many. however, once demystified, employing a ghostwriter can become a seamless extension of your creative process. in this post, we will unravel the enigma surrounding ghostwriting, providing you with a clearer perspective on what to expect when you decide to hire one. from understanding their role to discussing the cost of a ghostwriter, we’ll delve into the various facets to consider ensuring a fruitful collaboration.
understanding the role of a ghostwriter
at the heart of ghostwriting is the ability to capture someone else’s voice and ideas, molding them into a compelling narrative. the ghostwriter’s primary responsibility is to articulate the author’s thoughts and stories in a manner that resonates with the intended audience. they are skilled craftsmen, adept at weaving words in a way that reflects the author’s style, tone, and message, all while remaining invisible behind the scenes.
a hallmark of a proficient ghostwriter is their discretion and adherence to confidentiality agreements. they operate in the shadows, ensuring that the spotlight remains firmly on the author. this anonymity allows the author to maintain a strong personal brand and a close connection with their audience, which is indispensable in today’s competitive landscape.
moreover, a ghostwriter is often flexible and adaptable, able to work on diverse projects, be it books, articles, or digital content. their versatility is a boon for authors, allowing for a consistent voice across various platforms and mediums. through a blend of empathy, adaptability, and writing prowess, a ghostwriter seamlessly melds into the author’s persona, delivering content that is authentic and engaging, making the collaboration a rewarding experience for the author.
the cost of a ghostwriter
embarking on a ghostwriting partnership is an investment, both in terms of time and finances. the cost of a ghostwriter can vary significantly based on several factors, making it crucial to understand what influences these costs before entering into an agreement.
how much a ghostwriter makes depends on their experience and reputation in the industry. seasoned ghostwriters with a track record of successful projects usually command higher fees compared to those just starting out. the complexity and length of the project also play a crucial role in determining the cost. a full-length novel or a technical book will naturally require a higher investment compared to a series of blog posts or short articles.
additionally, the time frame within which you need the project completed can affect the cost. a tighter deadline might incur a higher fee due to the intensive effort required to meet the schedule. it’s also worth considering the level of research and the number of revisions included in the price.
investing in a ghostwriter is essentially investing in the quality of the final product. a clear understanding of the cost structure and what it entails will not only ensure a smooth collaboration but also result in a well-crafted piece that meets your expectations.
evaluating a ghostwriter’s portfolio
before entrusting your project to a ghostwriter, it’s imperative to review their portfolio. a ghostwriter’s previous work serves as a window into their writing style, proficiency, and ability to adapt to various tones and genres. when sifting through a portfolio, pay attention to the range of topics covered, the different styles employed, and the quality of writing.
it’s advantageous to find a ghostwriter whose style resonates with yours or who can adeptly mimic your desired tone. assessing their portfolio should give you a sense of their capability to handle your project proficiently.
additionally, testimonials and references can provide insight into the ghostwriter’s reliability, professionalism, and ability to meet deadlines. your goal is to establish a collaborative rapport with a ghostwriter who not only understands your vision but can also translate it into engaging and authentic content. this initial evaluation is a stepping stone towards fostering a successful author-ghostwriter relationship.
the author-ghostwriter relationship
the collaboration between an author and a ghostwriter is much more than a mere transaction; it’s a creative partnership. this relationship thrives on clear communication, trust, and a shared understanding of the project’s goals. setting clear expectations from the outset regarding deadlines, revisions, and the overall direction of the project is paramount.
a conducive author-ghostwriter relationship facilitates a smooth flow of ideas, feedback, and revisions, ensuring the final product is polished and well-aligned with the author’s vision. the collaborative nature of this relationship often entails numerous discussions, constructive critiques, and sometimes, a melding of differing perspectives to craft a narrative that resonates with the intended audience.
moreover, a respectful and open communication channel can significantly enhance the quality of the work, making the collaboration rewarding and productive. investing time in building a good rapport with your ghostwriter will not only make the process enjoyable but also yield a piece of work that stands out in its authenticity and quality.




what you should know before hiring a copy editor 



you’re not alone if your manuscript or article needs more love than you can give it. the ugly truth is that most people can’t effectively self-edit their writing, and a fresh pair of professional eyes is the best way to take your work to the next level. 
have you decided you’re in dire need of an editor? that’s a good first step! keep reading to make sure you’re after a copy editor rather than a developmental editor, and to find out how to pick the right one.
the duties of a copy editor 
experienced copy editors are masters of their craft, but writers looking for “an editor” should know that multiple distinct types of editors exist, each with their own professional focus. 
copy editors zoom in on the small details. these professionals look at the flow of your sentences and paragraphs and suggest changes that make your work more effective or beautiful. copy editors also look out for spelling errors, typos, tense errors, style inconsistencies, and formatting problems. some offer fact-checking services as well.
these editors typically have a degree in english, communication, or related fields. they’re sticklers for grammar and passionate about beautiful language.
copy editors don’t change the substance of your writing by critiquing your plot, character development, setting, or structure. that job falls to developmental editors.
copy editors and line editors do much of the same work in practice, but line editors devote more time to grammar and syntax than to typos or consistency of style. 
proofreaders comb through the smallest details and make sure no comma or letter is out of place.
who should hire copy editors
writers hoping to publish a fiction or non-fiction manuscript should consider hiring a copy editor after a developmental editor has worked on it. 
hiring a copy editor earlier in the process would be a waste of hard work — a little like using fine-grit sandpaper to polish a freshly-chopped piece of wood. a copy editor’s efforts are nullified when you inevitably alter the work’s structure later on.
writers planning to publish a short text, like a personal essay, brochure, article, or op-ed, may not need developmental editing services and skip ahead to the copy editing process.
searching for the right copy editor can be tricky
you may be a debut author or small business owner producing articles for your website. you may, in short, need a copy editor but not have a clue where to find one. you’re in luck. thanks to the internet, you no longer need industry connections. you won’t have to take a gamble on a copy editor you found in the yellow pages, either. 
googling skilled copy editors in your niche or geographical area can get you set up with a skilled professional.
assessing your options 
some people need a copy editor on a one-off basis, while others need copy-editing services on an ongoing basis. the complexity and importance of your work determine how much effort you put into finding the right copy editor. if you’re writing a book, ask yourself these questions as you consider candidates:

does the copy editor have proven experience in your genre? how much?
what is the copy editor’s previous experience? copy editors who have worked with big five publishers may offer an edge, especially if you hope to be traditionally published.
if your work requires you to adhere to a particular style guide, is the copy editor proficient in it?
does the copy editor have excellent references?
do you like the copy editor you are interviewing? that’s important because you’ll have an intense working relationship, whether you need a copy editor for a full-length manuscript or for ongoing work on short texts.
what software is the copy editor comfortable using?
what services does the copy editor provide? asking for a scope is vital because some also offer developmental editing, allowing you to streamline the editing process.
ask about the copy editor’s rates in advance, and make sure you agree on a deadline.

yes, a professional really is necessary
not every piece of writing calls for a copy editor. personal blog posts, high-school history essays, and cover letters for job applications are all examples of texts that don’t need a copy editor’s touch. asking a friend, parent, or coworker to give your work a once-over is often good enough. 
aspiring authors (including those planning to self-publish), small business owners producing content for their websites, and newsletter writers may, on the other hand, benefit from engaging a copy editor. indeed, style, punctuation, and grammar matter even when you’re crafting social media posts, especially if your bottom line could depend on how credible and professional you look.
here’s a handy rule of thumb — hire a copy editor for any text your future success could depend on.
think of a copy editor as an impartial professional who is passionate about helping you communicate as effectively and beautifully as you can. no friend or coworker who happens to have a knack for language can replace a skilled copy editor. that’s exactly why former bbc staff are complaining about the trend to engage guest editors who actually aren’t professionals. 
copy editors don’t change the substance of your work. they do ensure it’s the best it can be by zooming in on your sentences and weeding out pesky errors. 
hiring a copy editor is the right choice if you need a short text edited or your full-length manuscript has already gone through developmental edits. consider copy editors’ experience and rates as you make your pick, and ensure you choose a copy editor with whom you can build a solid working relationship.




why you shouldn’t be afraid of amazon ads as an author 



as a self-published author, it’s on you to promote and sell your book. you don’t have an agent promoting your work, and you don’t benefit from a pr department at a publishing house pushing your books into the market.
in the past, self-published writers had a tough time marketing their work. they’d struggle with selling enough copies to make a living, leading to few people choosing this option as a career path and more aspiring authors chasing that elusive book deal.
the internet changed everything, making self-publishing a viable option. as social media grew and online buying started to overtake bookstore sales, platforms like amazon became indispensable to self-publishers, allowing them to leverage its marketing tools.
the result was a leveling of the playing field and thousands of new self-published authors entering the space. amazon advertising works, provided you take the time to study how to use the platform properly to market your work.
authors spend their days writing books, and many don’t have the foggiest idea of strategies for marketing their work; they’re writers, not marketers. that’s understandable, and it makes sense why many new self-publishers cringe at the thought of marketing their work themselves. in reality, using amazon ads to sell your books isn’t that challenging.
we all fear the unknown, but when we understand how amazon ads work, that fear dissipates, and suddenly, you’re selling hundreds or thousands of copies of your latest release. if that sounds comforting, you’re in for a treat.
we’ll discuss why you shouldn’t be afraid of amazon ads and why it’s such an effective tool for marketing your work.
creating an amazon ads campaign is easier than you think
comparing facebook ads and amazon ads, the amazons ads platform is much easier to use and monitor. you have three simple steps to setting up and executing your campaigns. choose the ad model you want to use, write your marketing copy, and select your cover, and that’s it; you’re ready to start selling.
amazon ad campaigns give your thousands of free impressions
unlike traditional marketing, amazon ads doesn’t charge you for impressions generated by your target market. your ads can accumulate thousands of impressions, and you won’t have to pay for them. this model assists with building author brand awareness and discovery without paying for the privilege.
amazon ads work on pay-per-click
if the prospective reader sees your ad presented to them by amazon, you don’t pay for that impression. you only pay when they click on it to view the listing. this pay-per-click model is cost-effective for authors, resulting in a lower cost of sales for your marketing campaign.
amazon ads help you stretch your budget
amazon ads are far more cost-effective than google ads and facebook ads campaigns. you get more bang for your marketing buck, and your advertising budget lasts longer than it does with google or fb ads campaigns.
amazon ads are affordable
if you have a conservative budget for marketing your self-published book, amazon lets you buy ads for your campaigns with a budget as low as $1 to $5 per day. research suggests that spending just $10 per day on your campaign produces decent results.
self-published authors underutilize amazon ads
amazon ads for authors is a rather new marketing tool available to self-published authors. it started around the second half of 2016, and many self-published authors still don’t bother implementing it in their marketing strategy. so, there’s room for you to use it and get ahead of the competition in your genre.
amazon ad campaigns are easy to monitor
amazon ads campaign management tools include advanced, user-friendly features that are simple to set up, such as choosing and setting low-competition keywords. narrow your focus within your target market, optimize your ad spend and reach qualified buyers searching for titles in your genre.
amazon sponsored product ad campaigns yield effective and profitable results for self-published authors. a 2016 study shows authors using this model experienced an average sales increase of close to 13% over those avoiding using this campaign tool in their marketing mix.
us authors implementing a strategy involving exact-match keywords in their sponsored products ad campaigns experienced nearly a 10% increase in sales over authors avoiding it. while it’s been a few years since this data was released, the results remain consistent, showing the importance of using the right campaign tools to market your work on the platform.
amazon ads don’t require much involvement
managing your amazon ads campaigns is less stressful and requires less involvement compared to other marketing methods. unlike fb ads, where you have to keep an eye on your campaign progress, amazon ads don’t require much management. you’ll set your campaign priorities and give it two to four weeks before making any adjustments based on the data you collect in the ad manager. 
review your campaign performance from your ads dashboard using the reports tab or the campaign manager interface. you’ll see campaign progress and what you need to optimize for better results with your ads. checking your ad campaign is easy, and you don’t need to do it often to get results. 
check on it once a week and create five ads simultaneously to test; you don’t need to spend much; just $0.30 per day is all you need for your campaign to become profitable. you’ll see results with the right keywords with low competition. keep your analysis consistent and turn off any ads that don’t generate sales in a month from launching them.
is there a catch with amazon ads?
amazon ads recently allowed published authors to start advertising using its ads model. so, you can expect more competition to steadily build on the platform in the coming years.
chances are publishing authorities have a larger budget to throw at their campaigns, so you’ll need to check up on your ad campaign performance and compare it with other leading publishers.
competition for keywords could increase, leading to higher costs for your ad campaigns. so, those opportunities for finding low-cost keywords might start to dimmish. however, they’ll still be plenty of opportunity in the space; get smart with running your campaigns, and you’ll see results.




everything you’ve ever wanted to know about ghostwriting

the publishing industry and other private customers, like a celebrity who wants to produce an autobiography, are common clients of professional ghostwriters.
what do ghostwriters do?
a ghostwriter creates a written work or script, which is intended to be published under the byline of another person. the ghostwriter foregoes their byline for the work, but in turn gets paid a contracted fee (and sometimes the addition of royalties) to create it.
ghostwriters do not just have a license to create. the concept is often discussed between the ghostwriter and client while it is being written, and the writing composed from interviews with the subject and other resources that might be provided.
the most important task of a ghostwriter is to produce a specific, discussed work from provided resources and interviews. it requires the skill of writing, but also the skill of interpretation: a ghostwriter must be able to write like their client for the relationship and the product to work.
who hires ghostwriters?
people who want to write, but don’t have the resources or the time to create the work they’d like to see published.
sometimes, this can refer to a corporate client, but might also refer to a private one.
there are many people out there, including celebrities and high-level businesspeople, who would like to tell their story though need the guidance to do so.
publishing houses might also be in the market for ghostwriters. there are many professional ghostwriters who produce fiction or nonfiction on behalf of publishers rather than private clients.
websites and companies also sometimes hire ghostwriters, and an increasing amount of scripts and podcasts also rely on ghostwriters. famous speeches, like ones made by politicians or actors, are also sometimes helped or prepared by ghostwriters.

what do ghostwriters write?
ghostwriters can produce fiction or nonfiction work, and might produce articles, short stories, or full-length books and novels on behalf of their clients.
as a ghostwriter, it depends on the clients you look for, and your individual level of experience as a writer. the topics that ghostwriters might approach will also depend on their clients and individual needs.

which famous books used ghostwriters? 
the mainstream publishing industry is no stranger to the use of ghostwriters.
while you might think that the term “ghostwriter” is reserved only for the ultra-famous people out there who want to put their autobiography or blog together, ghostwriters have been integral to many famous book series’ too.
anyone remember sweet valley high? 
if you don’t, then you might have heard of a little book series called animaniacs.
the two ya series have something big in common: both employed ghostwriters to produce some of the books in the series. 
while each book had a different topic, each had the same “feel” and style just like you can expect every copy of the new york times or washington post to have the same feel and style. 
this wasn’t solely because of the way these books were edited, but because they were written by ghostwriters who had to adhere to a specific format!
how can i be a ghostwriter?
if you are a writer with the right skills, then you can be a ghostwriter.
what are the right skills for a ghostwriter to have? 
writers who can adapt fast to a style or brief can make for good ghostwriters. writers who have plenty of experience in different industries can also make for good ghostwriters. a ghostwriter should be able to take advice and criticism, but also take the lead to produce the best end-product for their client.

how to apply for a car loan when you are self-employed or a contract worker 



the covid-19 pandemic affected economies in different ways. many people are now self-employed, with a good number earning through freelancing. yet another group depends on others to pay them and are generally termed as contract workers. the self-employed and contract workers face the same challenge; securing a car loan. 
while people on traditional employment may secure the loan smoothly, the self-employed and the contract workers may find it a bit rough. however, rest assured that you can get a car loan, provided you meet lenders’ requirements. 
here is all you need to know about applying for a loan when you are self-employed or a contract worker.
why do the self-employed and contract workers find it rough when applying for a car loan?
in reviewing your car loan application for possible approval, the bank and other potential lenders usually want to see proof of steady income to ensure that you can repay the loan. of course, that’s a non-problem for anyone on a paycheck, and sometimes, those on w-2 arrangement. however, having proof of steady income may be hard if you are self-employed, freelancing, or a contract worker. 
the good news, though, is that there are provisions that cater to self-employed people, and the lenders will bank on these to verify your creditworthiness. for instance, most lenders will request the borrower to present proof of self-employed tax returns for the last two years, and having it may help you stand a chance of getting the auto loan.
moreover, claiming too many deductions may lower your creditworthiness, which you will only realize when requesting a car loan. of course, as a self-employed fellow, you might want to claim deductions to lower your tax burden. however, the consequences will be crystal clear when you need a can and are asking for financing. 
while claiming deductions isn’t a problem, it leaves the lenders wondering whether you can really repay a loan if you already seek too many conclusions. therefore, if you are planning to seek car financing in the future, consider reducing your claimed deductions.
additionally, having a bad credit score lowers your chances of getting an auto loan, especially when you are self-employed or a contract worker. a poor score means that you have had issues repaying loans in the past. thus, making your potential lenders doubt whether you will be able to repay the dealership loan. the good news is that you can start boosting your credit score now if you want to get a car loan in the future.
getting a loan with subprime lenders
if you are self-employed and have a bad credit score, the only option left is seeking a car loan. trying subprime lenders specializing in financing below-average borrowers. typically, these lenders operate differently from traditional lenders. 
for example, instead of focusing on your credit score and history, they will prioritize your income to vet whether you qualify for the dealership loan. 
here are three requirements you must meet to get a car loan with subprime lenders;
minimum income amount. traditional lenders have varied income requirements for their borrowers. however, subprime lenders are strict and require you to have between $1,500 and $2,000 monthly income before taxes, which has to be from one source. payment to income amount. this is established by dividing the auto payment by the pre-tax income. generally, the ratio should not exceed 15% to 20%, and in case it does, you will not qualify for the loan.debt-to-income ratio. this is calculated by finding the quotient of your monthly bills and the pre-tax income. the balance should not exceed 45% to 50%, and if it does, you will not be eligible for the loan.
how can a contract worker or a self-employed person prove income?
calculating the ratios above is one thing, and proving your income is another. therefore, before starting the car purchasing process, have the proof(s) of income ready. 
here is what a self-employed person needs to prepare a proof of income;
play right with tax deductions. the unemployed and self-employed can benefit from tax deductions and leverage the burden. however, besides reducing your income, the deductions lower your debt-to-income ratio. therefore, go slow on the assumptions.have copies of filed tax returns ready. even if you don’t have a steady income, you can prove income by filing tax returns. the lenders will request copies of proof of filed returns, at least for the last two years.
general hacks for the self-employed and contract workers for getting a car loan
having discussed enough what matters when applying for an auto loan, here are the tricks for paving a smooth path the self-employed and contract workers can use to increase their chances of getting a car loan;
work longer. whatever you are doing, allow enough time to pass and accumulate some money before applying for a car loan. this verifies your dependability and security, and more lenders will be willing to stand a chance with you.play safe with a reasonable down payment. when you are self-employed and need a car, you will need to pay ok upfront. for instance, people with high credit scores and steady income might need to pay only 10% or 20% of the loan as a down payment. still, the self-employed will have to beat that margin to qualify for an auto loan.boost your credit score. if you have been defaulting and have not been regular in repaying your credits, start working things right. although it might take time before you are where you want, it is worth every effort.go slow on the deductions. don’t just look at deductions as a way to leverage tax burden, but remember that they affect your critical ratios and reduce them.
the bottom line
although the self-employed and contract workers can find it tough to qualify for a car loan, they are not a lost course and can be eligible for it. all one needs to do is put a few things in the proper perspective, eventually qualifying for the loan. this article is your informant, and by following its suggestions, you will be eligible for car financing despite being self-employed.

how to write a book (tips) 



there may come a time when a writer will want to write a book, but do not know where to begin. a writer may think that they can just write a book and send it to a literary agent, but it does not work that way. there are steps that you must take when it comes to writing a book. here are some tips for writers who want to write a book, so that they will be successful when it’s time to send out query letters to literary agents.
one tip is that you must have an idea on what you want to write about. sometimes writers already know what they want to write about, while others don’t. sit and think about what is important, such as asking yourself questions like, what kind of characters i want to talk about will the idea i’m thinking about make sense. this may take some time if you do not know the answers to these questions. you can get ideas from books that you have read in the past, such as romance novels. do you want your book to have a romantic or horror theme, for example?
a writer needs to know what genre he or she wants to write, such as a memoir or comedy, for example. some ways you can find if your idea will work is by researching. go to your public library and find out if what you want to write about is like what is already out there. another place is going to kindle books to find out what is selling. in both cases look for bestsellers. you may want to read books on the genre that is of interest in to get an idea on if your idea will make sense to put out there in the public.
another tip is to make an outline of what you want to write about. you cannot just start writing your book because you may miss important details. when you make an outline, your outline needs to have a beginning, middle, and end. you want it to make sense as well. you want to know what your scene will look like. picture in your mind what your scene looks like. this is easier for you. the middle will have all the important details of what you want the reader to know, including your characters. what kind of personality do you want your characters to have? who is the main character? what kind of story will it be, adventure, horror, or romance, just to name a few? what do you want to happen in the story? there are questions you have to ask yourself to make a good book.
begin writing your first chapter. you will want to make it where it will catch the reader’s attention. this will have the scene, theme, and characters. you can get some ideas from other books you have read. it has to have a strong beginning as well. this may take some time, but you want to make it strong. the best writers took their time to make that first chapter stand out. read books that are in the same genre as yours. you want your first chapter to make sense. for instance, you would not want to make your first chapter sound funny, if your genre is horror. talk about the characters. what makes them important? in fact, the first chapter has to have something exciting, such as the opening of what to expect from the next chapters.
another tip is to not worry about using big words. you want your reader to read without stopping. the reader shouldn’t stop to look in the dictionary for meaning of words. use words that you know the reader will understand, but at the same time make it interesting. for instance, most people know what apprehensive means. it means being nervous or afraid.




are you looking for great literary agents? 



authors can find it difficult to get their book out there in the book world without a literary agent, unless they choose to self-publish. authors don’t want to waste all of that time writing a book, which probably took months and maybe years to complete without anyone reading it. that’s where literary agents come into play. literary agents are writers’ best friends. they will get your book out there to the right people, such as publishing houses and even producers of a movie. when you are looking for literary agents, it is important to do your homework. for one, authors need to make sure that their book is up to par, meaning it is what the literary agent is looking for.
literary agents want to see books that are going to sell and are on the topic that they handle, such as if an author’s book is about zombies, he or she will want to look for a literary agent who is in the horror genre. an author wouldn’t want to pitch their book to a literary agent who handles romance novels. on the other hand if the book has romance theme to it, the author can pitch it to literary agent who handles romance themes.
finding the right literary agent is important because you do not want a literary agent who has had poor sales in the past. research each literary agent that you are interested in. it is important to see how many sales that literary agent has had in the past and if he or she is presently working with authors. it is a good idea to research literary agents who handle your genre and tone. authors need to find out if their book is similar to other books that literary agents have handled in the past. it will be more than likely that the author will have luck in finding a literary agent. authors need to make sure as well that their book is targeting the right audience.
after completing your research and you have a list of all the literary agents that fit the profile, you will need to do extra research and make sure that you are finding the right literary agents. this process takes a lot of time and patience is key, but if you want your book to sell, you have to make sure you have the perfect literary agent. authors need to find out if each literary agent that they are researching accepts queries. sometimes literary agents don’t accept them at a particular time. even if you have your eye on a particular literary agent and he or she is not accepting queries, you have the choice to wait until he or she does accept queries or cross him or her off the list.
begin writing your query letters to literary agents. authors want to make sure that their query letters are perfect. as an author, he or she wants to make sure that the literary agent will promote the book. there is no rush when it comes to writing your query letter. jot down things that you want to include in your query letter, such as why you think this book is better than the rest. the internet has a world of resources on how to write a query letter, but if it still confuses you, you can always seek help from a freelancer. now, you have to find a freelancer that has an a plus review of producing query letters. when authors begin sending out query letters, they have to make sure that each one has its own personal touch.




why ‘when in doubt, cut it out!’ should be the motto all creative writers embrace 



“it is easy,” michelangelo famously said about his creative process. “you just chip away the stone that doesn’t look like david.” 
creative writing is absolutely nothing like sculpting. you start with a blank slate. as you fill that void, fueled by hours of creative flow punctuated by periods of writer’s block, it’s only normal to begin to feel at home in the world you have just conjured. it’s only normal to ache to keep building it, and to feel like something of a butcher every time you even just consider taking something away. 
before you know it, your writing — now filled with complex sentences and scenes designed to bring your text to life — becomes cluttered and distracting. that’s why every creative writer can benefit from this sculptor’s advice. “when it doubt, cut it out”. chip away the words that don’t fit into the story, and then go back to kill the words that don’t add anything. learn from the minimalists; declutter your writing until every word has found a home and your whole project sparks joy.
whether you are writing an essay or a novel, you’ll at the very least have the opportunity to tidy your writing up a little. almost always, you’ll discover that, in the words of ernest hemingway, the “omitted part would strengthen the story”. naturally wordy creative writers should consider adding a separate “backspace edit” to their creative process, but even if you don’t go that far, you may be surprised at the results you get if you are a little more willing to cut things out. 
what should you consider as you decide what to cut out during your self-editing process as a creative writer?
could you effectively convey the same message in fewer words?
at the basic proofreading level, you can simply ask yourself if you can effectively say the same thing in fewer words by removing repetition and clunky wordy choices — in turn forcing you to think about your sentences more intently. as this is the least painful part of “when it doubt, cut it out”, it’s a good place to start. 
next, target your adjectives and adverbs
as a creative writer, you’ll use adjectives and adverbs to liven up your story, especially if you’ve taken the advice to show rather than tell to heart. sometimes, you’ll find that you’ve been overdoing that a bit — so see which flowery words can head for the chopping board. 
examine your side characters
if you are writing a novel, short story, or play, chances are that not all of the characters included in your work truly deserve a place there. side characters should serve a purpose — they might act as a foil, a learning opportunity for the protagonist, fill in a gap, or offer a way to provide crucial background information. if any of your characters aimlessly wander in and out of your story, without influencing the plot in any meaningful way, they may have to go.
finally, put your plot points under the knife
just as your characters should should seamlessly fit into the story you are telling, the journey your main characters take can get too cluttered if there are too many detours. if it doesn’t contribute to the plot, no matter how hard you worked on a particular section, you may just find that you gain, rather than lose, by simply taking it out. 
does that sound a little harsh to you? creative writers who just aren’t ready to start chipping away at their hard work yet, fearing that they’ll end up with a dry and sterile text, can take comfort in the fact that writing is a whole lot more flexible than sculpting. if you need to, copy/paste your work into an entirely new document. start experimenting with relentless deletions, cutting out everything you are not 100 percent sure about, and see what you end up with. 
you may discover that entirely new scenes now need to be added. you may hate the result and go back to your original. you may also end up with perfectly tidy writing in which every character, every scene, every word have a goal. no matter what, you’ll soon realize you’ve become a better writer after going through this process.




kdp select pros & cons: kdp select compared to  traditional publishing 




kdp
select is one of the big self publishing platforms out there. if you
are thinking about self publishing your novel or story, it’s likely
that you’ve already heard of kdp select and other platforms like
reedsy or lulu.  

but
why can they be better for your needs than choosing a contract with a
traditional publishing house? platforms like kdp select offers many
benefits for self published writers that traditional publishers
simply don’t.
while
traditional publishing contracts are fine for thousands of writers
and might still remain an aspect of your writing career now, here are
some of the benefits of kdp select compared to what traditional
publishers have to offer.
traditional
publishing is a lot of waiting 

the
process from manuscript to published book can take years when we’re
talking about traditional publishing. it can even take decades when
we account for all the times where an excellent manuscript might be
rejected by several publishing houses in a row.
some traditional publishers can even take as long as a year before they let you know whether or not they’re willing to publish your manuscript at all. and that’s not including all the time it takes to format, read through, proofread and finally print and promote.  
for
some writers, the cons of traditional publishing far outweigh what
they’re able to get from it.
more
writers choose self publishing through platforms like kdp select
because it’s easier, faster and gives them instant access to their
market of readers. 

traditional
publishing sometimes requires an agent
an
increasing number of publishers – especially larger ones – aren’t
willing to consider submissions that have been sent without an agent.
this presents a huge problem for many first-time and emerging authors
who don’t have an agent yet, and don’t have the background in the
industry to just hook up with one overnight. 

self
publishing your manuscript through platforms like kdp select doesn’t
require an agent – and you can do it when you’re ready as a writer.


traditional
publishing has set promotional schedules
traditional
publishers have set promotional schedules for new books. this means
that they will do a huge amount of promotion at the start of the
process to boost sales, and then gradually less the longer the book
has been on the shelves. 

as
a traditionally published writer, this means that the sales of your
book will decline – and once this happens, you’re usually not
getting any help from your publisher to release or promote this book
again. 

whoops.


self
publishing through platforms like kdp select won’t carry this
restriction – and won’t limit you as much in terms of how you can
promote your work. there’s no need to stick to a larger publisher
telling you which books are “good” for promotion right now: you
decide, and you showcase the work to your readers that they want to
see
traditional
publishing pays eventually… self publishing pays sooner 

traditional
publishers usually issue their royalty statements throughout the year
– quarterly being one of the most common. during this time, writers
are promised a fraction of the profits for the books that have sold
during this period – and once you’ve been paid an advance (assuming
you’re paid one at all), this fraction isn’t as much as you would
think.
books
that have been in publication for a while (or had a slow release)
will earn you a few cents every few months. that’s not ideal, is it? 

using platforms like kdp select to publish your writing gives you easier access to royalties you’ve earned from your work (and you’ll earn a larger percentage).
