			how fire barrier foam cement enhances fire resistance in structures




allied 
				developed the best fire rated foam composites per astm-e119 test 



				
				(highest fire barrier rating, vermiculite-free & non-hazardous) 
				  






  
    
	
	








  








mission statement





performance of currently available fire rated building materials, 
					tested under commonly used thicknesses and densities, are 
					really limited or inadequate in an actual fire.





allied powerful fire barrier foam technologies/composites could really have a chance to significantly 
					reduce financial losses, save lives and save the environment 
					during an actual fire.*




					 *  confirmed recently by a major thermal 
					testing lab. on a36 steel h beam 
					per astm-e-119 test

allied pervious 
			& non-pervious foamed cement are capable for waste 
			encapsulation,       immobilization, soil stabilization and leachate filtration. allied
			long lasting foam, applied as a surface cover on landfill sites and effluent ponds and lagoons, will effectively suppress 
			noxious odors, vapors, litter and vectors, avoiding serious environmental issues. 


 insulative 
			fire bricks, 
			panels
-with excellent strength and thermal shock resistance for fabrication of  durable firebricks
used as high performance insulative     materials for kilns and incinerators.



			geopolymer foam- flexible 
			and very light (< 1.5 pcf or 24 kg/m3). various geopolymer foam 
			composites can achieve insulative value r > 3.8 per inch       and fire 
			resistance.

fire barrier 
		  foam -specially formulated foam from allied can be used as long
  duration fire fighting barriers for  the containment of forest fires.



 
	

   
			
				 






our mission


at allied we are committed to the continuing
        development of versatile and highly stable aqueous foam and systems
        with a wide range of properties and applications that meet the specific
        needs of our customers in the various industrial sectors.


technology



allied foam tech has developed a universal foam technology for a wide range of
        industrial  and
        environmental applications. the excellent stability and dynamic nature
        of allied's 
		
 make them ideal for use in 
        reducing the weight of cement/concrete, ceramics, firebricks,
        adhesives, coatings, and binders. foam stability derived from allied's
        many foam systems usually outranks that of any other existing
        technologies available in today s marketplace.


the
        aft
        series of foam agents, using compressed air and allied foam
        generating equipment, generates very fine and stable foams. they are used
        for the manufacture of  lightweight
        (or foamed) concrete, lightweight ceramics, insulative
        firebricks, alternative landfill cover, foam coatings, foam adhesives,
        long-duration firefighting foams and other uses. substrates such as
        cement, concrete, coating formulations or others that incorporate
        allied's foam products usually exhibit reduced weight with improved
        workability, insulation value, sound proofness, and expanded
        applications.





allied 
        has also developed various models of compact and versatile foam
        generating equipment for production or field application 
        that can be manually or remotely controlled.
