                decks which lead to garden trails around the cottage.

the light and airy
                cottage with views of the river and forest from every side has
                geothermal floor heat and a woodstove to keep it toasty in the
                winter. the charming tiled bath and well appointed kitchen show
                artistic touches throughout. 










 


 the new hot
                tub is by the cottage just across the footbridge.


 
 


from here you can view the river as
                you soak in your own, private, outdoor hot tub, continuously fed
                with hot mineral water piped in from the main belknap spring
                across the river.
