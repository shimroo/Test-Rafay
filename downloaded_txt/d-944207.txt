what our customers say
“its nice to go back to a company for a second sauna after 14 years and be remembered when you walk in the door. that’s the kind of company baltic leisure is. there’s a reason that i came back up from dc to buy our new sauna. you can’t go wrong with these guys.”
henry emslie
“recently added a baltic leisure sauna in my home. tom (ceo)figured out the best location since i wasn’t sure where to put it. the finished sauna shows superb craftmanship. the installers were respectful of my home. one final note. tom installed the electrical work himself since many electricians weren’t available for weeks in order for us to use the sauna. great customer service !!!”
gerri kunkle
“my custom sauna came out perfect ! from start to finish tom and his company were a pleasure to work with. i would highly recommend .”
tyler sacchetta
“needed sauna stones for my harvia cilindro- put in order on monday and i come home from work today my order sits @ car port- great, friendly ,fast and professional service from baltic leisure-5 stars!!”
mika alakulppi“researched other companies but tom smithson was the best from baltic sauna. very helpful from entire project-design, options and assistance to our handyman during installation. delivery well package and labeled for installation. helped with connecting electrical, wi-fi apps to control unit on phone and surround sound music. thank you tom & baltic.”steven selznick“i’ve wanted a sauna for years. i researched other places but decided to order my sauna from baltic. i had it installed over a year ago now. i love it!!
i use it several times a week. it’s beautifully made of cedar. other spa/ sauna distributors do not have the quality, wood selection or customer satisfaction concerns that baltic has, i assure you
baltic is a wonderful company to work with that employs people who care and work together like family. highly recommend them!”cj tracker“we purchased a 4-person sauna from baltic leisure and from the day we purchased the unit i was happy with the customer service and friendliness of the company. tom smithson is very knowledgeable and always happy to speak directly with customers. we have had our sauna for probably 8 or 10 years now and in that time, we have had only 2 service calls which speaks volumes for the quality of the product considering we use it almost daily. the last service call i placed tom walked me through a step-by-step troubleshooting process to ensure my issue wasn’t something i could resolve myself. who does that these days? it turned out the heating unit just required a deep cleaning something that meant taking the heater apart. we clean the sauna and heater twice a month but after 8-10 years it needed something more thorough. sean smithson handled the entire process for us. he was an absolute pleasure to work with and also very knowledgeable. the cost of the service call was very than reasonable, and the work was done in less than a week. i would highly recommend purchasing a sauna from baltic leisure. i did a ton of research prior, and they seemed to be the gold standard and after our purchase that proved to correct. when we move south, i will definitely purchase another sauna from baltic leisure because the quality of the product is just outstanding.”jodi kerchner“excellent, top notch, professional service. super friendly and easy to work with. these guys installed a great product for me. ran into a simple problem the first day of operation and the knowledgeable staff was right on top of fixing the issue and had things resolved immediately. would highly recommend baltic leisure for your sauna!”jim schopf
“excellent people to work withgreat product… team was super helpful designing my sauna. overall i had great experience and i’m glad it’s not far.i’ll be definitely using you again for the next housethank you guys”
mike bela,  “baltic leisure repaired and replaced my sauna after water damage in the basement. tom quickly assessed the damage and provided an estimate. they completed the work on time and on budget. he even went over and above coaching my electrician after he completed the job. baltic leisure is honest, professional and fair. i gladly support this business and have been a happy customer for many years.”john bonner,  “we’ve purchased two saunas from baltic leisure over the years, both for our former house and for our current one. both times, the process was efficient and professional. this last time, baltic leisure designed a kit sauna for us that would fit in a limited space. the unit went together without a hitch and has worked well since its installation about a year ago.”nils jesperson,  “great quality of wood. the parts are easy to assemble. good support. highly recommended”victor dubinski,  “the service and customer experience was excellent. we love our new sauna!”jose imery,  “what a pleasure to work with both of you and your extended team at baltic leisure. from the first phone call with sean, who provided excellent guidance, to tom, who really went above and beyond to be sure my new harvia kip45b was the right unit and wired exactly to how its predecessor was wired. mike greeted me warmly before operating hours and engaged me while waiting for tom and sean to arrive by normal opening time. owner tom went out to the parking lot to look at my dead unit and made a valiant attempt to repair it instead of defaulting to selling me the new unit. while that effort was not successful, it says a lot about an owner that would try to replace parts in a unit he does not sell instead of just selling me what i came for. he then returned to the parking lot and wired up the harvia kip45b so i would not have to stress out doing that myself.
while i was looking around the showroom, the display models were impeccably designed and built right there in their carpentry shop. no china shipments, all of their units are born and raised in oxford pa before finding their forever homes somewhere in the country. i had the privilege of being there in person to experience this craftsmanship and customer centric service. i am known as someone that is not easily “satisfied” and tom and sean did not satisfy me, they delighted me. i ask anyone reading this to recall the last time you were delighted by any establishment or service provider. think hard, since it may take awhile, if ever, to come up with an example. if you deal with baltic leisure, that will be your go-to the next time someone asks you when you were delighted.
thank you sean and tom”ed becker, your content goes here“this company has been perfect to deal with.  i live 2000 miles away and would buy from them again in a heart beat.  toni was amazing to work with!!!”darren mansell,  gift cards
