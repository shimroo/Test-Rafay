	 an update on the podcast...
	 
    


well it has been a while since one has been out, with trouble on my mic.  well the trouble stands, and it isn't the mic itself (i think) but my computer.  i am working on it, but please don't go away while i get things together.  keep subscribed to the feed,  because one day soon episode 19 will end up being there downloading.  my feed subscription rate has substantially dropped, but still many are still here.  i will have this up within a few weeks or a quest for a new mic (maybe even a re-install of windows) might be in order, because i don't want to end this podcast.  a new episode will be out sometime soon, don't worry!  and it will be new....and maybe even improved!!!  don't worry, it will still have that same great...taste?adam

	 ...maybe not
	 
    


well, i just got ready to record after i posted a couple of hours ago.  as i was getting ready, i noticed the mouse ball on my mic (it helps a lot when recording) wasn't moving my mouse cursor.  so, i didn't think much on it, started audacity, and clicked record.  did the normal "this is adam carrico" intro thing, but all that recorded was on straight line...which either meant i was really quiet, or that it wasn't getting the signal.  tried the other ports on my computer, and still nothing.  i even tried the old nintendo cartrige blow in them, but still no signal.  so then i resarted, to get the mouse to move for a second, then let out.so, what does this mean to me and the podcast.  well, until i get the mic fixed, or get a new one, i can't record.  how long will it take?  i have no idea, but am working on it now.  i hope that it works just out of nowhere soon, but highly doubt it.  then again, it could do like the bad quality on a couple of episode's were, to be good the next time.  anyway, i wouldn't expect an episode tonight, or tommorow for that matter, but hopefully i will return this weekend.stay here and i will keep you updated!!!

	 a busy 2 weeks...and an update on that
	 
    


if you haven't noticed, i didn't put out an episode last week...or this week yet.  i have been really busy and most of the time i had was spent with other things beside podcasting.  so this week i am back up, and a new episode, although pretty late, will be up at least by wednesday morning.  i have a feeling tommorow sometime would be a better guess though.  i am recording it differently this time, so it speeds up the preperation process.  for example, i will be talking about the ds lite.  normally, i would write up some notes, saying something like this:-ds lite-unveiled on japanese nintendo site-white-smaller (2/3 of regular ds)-same screen size-4 levels of brightness-gba game plugand maybe a bit more, but you get the picture.  this time i am just going by memory, so it should trigger a more from the mind kind of episode.  i have no idea how it will work, but we shall see sometime this week.  anyway, be ready and have you pod-catchers open for at least a couple of days for it.

	 episode will be out tommorow...
	 
    


well, after a few complications (and me not recording until a later time that usual) this episode will be delayed just one day.  not by a whole lot, just around tommorow afternoon for the release, but it is worth it.  just wait for tommorow, not a huge delay at all, just me wanting to let everyone know what is up.p.s. ben drake has some awesome music in it...

	 60 frames per second 16 - game impressions
	 



episode 16 of 60 fps is done.  i have archive.org for uploading, so this is feed happy.  this one centers around games and what i think of them, and not news.  i talk about a plethora of games, like pdz, spartan total warrior, quake 4, fifa '06, condemned, mario kart, animal crossing, full auto, and even a hardware review of the xbox 360.  they are each pretty in depth, or just talked about with my experiences.  there are some stuff on nookway (at time of recording, nookbay, not my fault for the mistake, they changed it or something), crates and barrels in games, and more in the news section.  check the shownotes for the little news stuff, but games i talked about aren't linked.  this is pretty long, but if you don't care about my review of one game or another, than skip and go to another (pdz and mk:ds are most in depth.)   here is the meaty stuff, not clean cut (check the hyphen count!)downloads----------------high quality 128kbps (used in all feeds)streams------------streamed .m3u streamed in flashpodnovaodeoarchive.org info pagefeeds---------links--------crates and barrels nookway/nookbayrevolution under $299 under defeat - dreamcast game console size comparison

	 60 fps 15 - upload troubles, feed link coming soon!
	 



alright guys, episode 15's uploading is having a bit of difficulty.  archive.org won't work with it at all for some reason.  i then found two sites to upload it.  one worked perfectly well...except it didn't give me a direct link, which i need for the feeds.  i am now trying file factory, but i have no idea if it will work.  if you want it before it comes to the feeds, and don't want a direct download link, check out big upload's version.  i am still trying to get it working before the end of the day.  stay tuned and keep your feeds running.

episode 14 is done.  before you go listening, in the intro, where i talk about some of the news in this episode, the intro music starts playing.  yes, i know that is bad, but i will fix it tommorow, i have worked on this too much tonight (for around 8 hours straight).  this took a while to figure out how to upload, since archive.org adopted a new way for it just to confuse people.  i had to ftp through internet explorer for it to work right.  now i am sitting here, mad because i remember downloading 15 different ftp clients to get one to work, and now after getting ftp commander, i don't even need it.    this new way is good yet bad.  good because i don't have to wait for it to get approved, bad because it is confusing and i only have one download link!  oh well.  this episode has a lot of cool, and informative, news, along with some websites to check out, new releases, and my review of the ported half-life 2 for the xbox.  it is a cool episode i think, and my review of half life 2 was a good one i think.  appologies in advance for calling one one se7en stuntmutt, since stuntmutt is the author, not the title!  it is a little over 40 minutes, but before editing, i was 3 seconds less than an hour, which i thought was funny.  podcast intros are needed, hopefully i get a few cool ones in the coming weeks.  if i get an outstanding one, i might use it for every episode!  well, below are the links for everything that you would want!downloadification!

	 well, it just came to my attention...
	 
    


...that the episode of last week cuts off at around 11 minutes.  i got an e-mail that states when they were listening to episode 13, it stops at 11 minutes through.  this could very well be possible, since i don't re-download the file and check it out after it is uploaded, since i have the version already.  why did it do this?  i don't know.  no way i can tell, but i figure it just didn't get fully uploaded to archive.org right.  the episode is actually just under 42 minutes, so you are missing a lot.  as of now i am re-uploading the file to archive.org, maybe you all will have it by today or tommorow.  sorry about that, and next time if anyone notices it, send an e-mail immdeiatly, or leave a comment, it might not just be your copy.p.s. next episode, next week.  i will give more info on release dates for the versions next episode.

	 well, no episode today...or tommorow night....
	 
    


i was ready to finish it today, i really was.  the whole thing is prepared, and i have it all done!  even the shownotes are ready to deliver for you all.  i just need a microphone.  yes, i don't have one at the moment.  well, i guess this means i can't put out an episode today, unless you want me to write it and feed it to a text to speech thing and make it all robotisized!!  i guess you have to wait another day or two, on top of the two weeks of waiting from thanksgiving.  i assure you this will be a good episode...well if you like the 360.  by the way, a spoiler on episode 14, since i have recycled a lot of stuff to it from this one, it will have a lot of free games in it, so i would delete your...big files...for some games.  anyway, be prepared, probably uploaded by wednesday morning, and a good episode.sorry again...

	 60 fps 12 re-release
	 



ok, well i just got back from my thanksgiving trip, and checked on the podcast.  if you  are from odeo, itunes, or subscribe another way via the feedburner link, then you probably haven't listened to the podcast.  i am sorry about this, for some reason it wouldn't work!  if you are using podnova, you are fine, because for some reason it worked.  anyway, with this post it should make the podcast download automatically.  i am again sorry, and hope you enjoy the episode.  by the way, i am now listed on podcast pickle, you can find my podcast here.  seems like a cool site, not too much into it yet though.  be ready for next weeks episode, it might be a big one!

episode 12 is done.  this week i didn't get my mic until a little later than expected, and the 360 launch kind of made me more into that than doing this!  it hasn't been completed yet, but is in the "waiting for approval" stage again.  i will be able to have basic internet access yo keep up with whats happening.  i      that you all have to wait!  if anyone has a 360 survival or horror story, please send them in and i might feature it in the show.  i know i didnt get one, so that's horror in itself, but what about those who waited in line for 25 hours and came home empty handed?  microsoft really should have spaced them farther apart, because i wanted one now!  as of the episode, it's a bit shorter, and next week will be no episode, from thanksgiving plans.  maybe you will all have fun playing your 360's then!  well, here is the episode!direct download links-----------------------------------------------------high quality 128kbps (used in all feeds)lower quality 64kbpsogg vorbis64kbps streamed .m3u (you can also find streams on my podnova and odeo sites)archive.org info pagefeeds-----------------------------------------------------shownotes-----------------------------------------------------xbox live marketplace content at launchamandtech inside the xbox 360a look at the motherboard tons of info on innards of 360, and some outerzero hour photo's from major nelson translated xbox page for japan's backwards compatibility manula of fifa/condemned pgr3 manualdead of alive 4 hands-ona golden ds poor      gamer rsg-smb-tab (how to beat super mario) ddr mario mix site (intro music there as well)

update 3 (final):  finally, it is done today!  i am sorry for the wait.  i will be looking for the feeds to see if they work.  it's weird that episode 12 is already being worked on with this one just releasing.  i might consider changing my hosting from archive.org if this happens again.  it is free though...  be sure to get it, this is probably my favorite one yet!update 2:  the person who curates or whatever said in the forums his internet was down.  it got approved recently and they are copying files to location.  it should be done before lunch today.  if you subscribe with the feedburner feed, and it got this post, refresh the feed and see if it works.  i might just have to make a new post with it in it.update 1: ok, this is the longest i have ever waited for a podcast to be approved.  i uploaded it last night around 10:30 p.m., in central times, and it is now almost 5 p.m. of the next day.  i have no idea why the won't, but if your feed has updated, it takes the only remaining download link that works, and it happens to be the ogg from episode 10.  do not download that, unless you want last episodes again.  i will keep everyone informed on what's happening, but my internet is from a wireless tower, and there is a tornado watch and everyone is in shelters or at home.  keep looking for this one.  sorry about it.episode 11 of 60 frames per second is officially over.  this one might be even better than my personal favorite from last episode!  we do everything from reviewing 360 demo's, and battlefront 2, to talking about custimization and delays.  we also have some flash games, and a program that is small and useful for online gaming.  what about pictures and demo's of final fantasy 12?  got that too my friends.  so of course you are going to want to download this episode right now!  also, everyone who wanted the ogg vorbis of last episode, i apologize for the wrong link, here is the real one.  by the way, subsribe to my feeds, in odeo, podnova, itunes, or whatever, since i can get a good view of my listener amounts.  please send feedback people, leave comments, it just helps me out more.  thanks!direct download links-----------------------------------------------------high quality 128kbps (used in all feeds)lower quality 64kbpsogg vorbis64kbps streamed .m3u (you can also find streams on my podnova and odeo sites)archive.org info pagefeeds-----------------------------------------------------shownotes-----------------------------------------------------nes micro designstar wars 360 faceplatesmario kart decal makerbgb micro faceplatesmicro skinskotaku ds skinsdreamcast 2.0?elder scrolls...delayed...againkameo box/manual picswal-mart kiosk/card pics360 backwards compatiblezero hourrevolution remote controlsam and max returngamer 30 or over no'sfinal fantasy xii previewmark rein and revolutionchainsaw maniacwarcraft iii in flashwho's connected?
