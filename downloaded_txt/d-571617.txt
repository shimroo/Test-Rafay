welcome to the law offices of jimmie l. joe
there has never been a better time for american families to plan for a brighter future for themselves, their loved ones, their businesses and their charitable causes as well. today, changes in the federal estate tax law now makes it easier to focus on planning for what matters most to clients — turning today’s dreams for loved ones into tomorrow’s reality. good estate planning is much more than simply planning to give away things at death. it is an opportunity to explore the possibilities of protecting loved ones and providing for their future in the best way possible. we assist our clients in putting together unique plans – plans that will best take care of them during their lifetimes and their loved ones today, tomorrow and into the future just as they would do if they could always be there.
at the law offices of jimmie l. joe, our objective is to help our clients create estate plans that speak volumes of the client as a person and not simply as a source of inherited material wealth. we do this by helping clients develop plans to motivate and inspire their children, enhance their lives, and create a lasting legacy. in doing so, we aim to shift the focus of planning away from fortune and onto family. the end result is a plan that promotes family harmony, personal responsibility and inter-generational connection through shared beliefs and values.
we believe that a well-designed estate plan ought to begin with one’s core values, beliefs and long-term objectives. we then merge tax and financial strategies with these values and objectives to create a personalized plan. each client is different and motivated by different goals and objectives. we understand that there is no “one size fits all” solution. therefore, we assist clients in putting together unique plans that help address key concerns: be it minimization of income, estate, gift, and generational taxes; protection of wealth from the reach of divorce and creditors; maintaining and enhancing family relationships; or creating incentives that allow family members to grow personally and professionally. through this journey, our clients discover how a well-designed estate plan created with thought and purpose is really the ultimate expression of love.
