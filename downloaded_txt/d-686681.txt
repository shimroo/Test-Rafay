cheese days
back in 1914, the concept of cheese days originated from the notion that if some little town in illinois could have a festival commemorating sauerkraut, then a celebration based on cheese would be an even better idea.a group of local businessmen planned the festivities in just nine days, driving a roadster through the city of monroe to publicize the event. a hand-lettered sign attached to the vehicle proclaimed “first cheese day committee 1914 – we started something!”and did they ever.100 years later, we invite you to take part in our centennial cheese days 2014 – where old-world tradition has generated an out-of-this-world celebration.help us celebrate our swiss heritage with traditional music, dance, drinks, food, and extraordinary cheese!
