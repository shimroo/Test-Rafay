                        rising among the dunes that separate florida's panhandle 
                        from the shimmering waters of the gulf of mexico, long 
                        beach resort is a truly unique destination. its luxurious 
                        suites and private amenities create an unexpected relaxing 
                        retreat, while its location puts visitors moments away 
                        from the hustle and bustle of panama city beach, one of 
                        the state's most popular vacation spots.

                        sea 
                        level, both the ocean and long beach resort's tropical 
                        lagoon pool serve to cool guests 
                        off after a day 
                        of sunbathing on 
                        the 
                        pristine beach, while two all-weather tennis courts provide 
                        a more energetic form of recreation. those 
                        with an appetite will enjoy the poolside dining at the 
                        hangout, where a variety of sandwiches, 
                        snacks and beverages 
                        are available throughout the day. and, at the end of the 
                        day, guests are invited to spend the evening in the warm 
                        waters of the seasonally heated polynesian pools and whirlpool 
                        spas. it's a fitting end to such a relaxing vacation, 
                        and it's just what you can 
                        expect at long beach resort.
