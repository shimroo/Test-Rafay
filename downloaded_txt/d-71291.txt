ancestor info. collection of genealogy databases
 





we have built a collection of genealogy databases we hope you
will find useful. the "original items" listed in the box below are all
in our collection and waiting to be reunited with the descendants of those who
posed for the pictures, signed the documents or handed out the business cards.
the books listed further down the page are in our library, and if you find
someone you are researching we will copy the information and send it to you.
access to all of our databases is free, but we do charge for copies and for
original items.

a quote from 1929, summarizes what our site
    is trying to accomplish. "that these memories may not
        be lost but remain ever fresh...pictures, words and paper of themselves
        are of small value at their best, but the thought and associations back
        of these pages are the essence of life itself...the dust of time may
        accumulate on our copies as the years turn our hair gray but may the
        memories contained in this book remain bright and inspiring..." gaylord

remember, we might have your, "brick wall" ancestor listed in an
unusual book or magazine. also, if you are doing a one name study, many of our
references are useful.

ancestor info is a free access genealogy
  database, made up of dozens of smaller databases. we are different from
  many of the databases on the internet, because we own all of the materials we
  index. when you order information from us, we send you the original item or we
  copy the information directly from the original source.
we have hundreds of unique antiquarian
  sources with thousands of citations. many of these books, documents and
  historical records are one of a kind or are extremely rare, but we have
  indexed them to assist in your research. we index biographies, directories,
  yearbooks, alumni guides, obituaries (necrology), tax books, journals,
  magazines etc... we might have ads from the old family business or family
  farm, salary or school records, an obituary which ranges from one paragraph to
  several pages long or records of war service. when we send you copies of this
  type of information, we also send the title page, any lists of abbreviations
  or other relevant pages.
we have thousands of biographies ranging
from one paragraph to several pages long, and many of these include a photo,
portrait or engraving. during the late 1800's and during the 1920's, (before the
great depression came along) almost every area of the country did who's who type
books of locally prominent people, and many clubs and civic groups did a
directory featuring biographies and sometimes photos of their members. so even
if your ancestor was not rich and famous, we might have them listed.
if your ancestors are in one of our high school or college
yearbooks, we can send you copies of their photo or listing, but we also send
copies of the school calendar, general interest photos of the school and
classmates, and there is usually a section with jokes or corny stories. it is
almost like visiting the school 75 years ago, while your ancestors were young.
some yearbooks also include information on faculty and alumni.
our collection of several hundred
original, vintage photographs includes antique photos of all types;
cabinet cards, tintypes, carte-de-visite (cdv's), portraits and  real photo
postcards (rppc). we also have photo albums, group photos from family reunions,
the workplace and schools. most of these photos are over 75 years old.
our ephemera collection has over 1,000
  pieces includes vintage or antique documents, letters, billheads,
  invoices, postcards, wedding invitations, business cards, prescriptions,
  matchbook covers, victorian trade cards, school programs and school souvenirs.
  most of these items range from 50 to over 125 years old.
whether you are researching your family roots (or lineage), we
can help.  please check our database for all the branches and surnames
from your family tree. we have also been able to assist writers and collectors
in their background research on the history of people or companies in our
database. we cover everything from birth records to obituaries, military service
during the civil war and world war 1, and almost every aspect of daily life and
day to day business in the late 1800's and early 1900's.
while we charge a fee to send copies of information or original
items, it is a small price to pay to find potentially valuable information from
long ago (and it may even help with that brick wall you have been facing in your
research).
