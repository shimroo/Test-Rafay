our work




train youth leaders
gsa organizing is making schools safer, changing communities, and building power for the next generation of lgbtq+ youth.






support youth organizing
we support lgbtq+ youth organizers across the country to take action and create change at all levels, from school-based campaigns that impact individual school districts to national days of action that unite gsas for racial and gender justice.






build the gsa movement
through our regional organizing strategy, we infuse staff capacity and technical expertise in these regions in order to strengthen local organizations and increase trans and queer youth of color leadership development and engagement.
