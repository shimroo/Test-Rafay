“those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know.”1 corinthians 8:2











native soni lived most of my life in a demeaned mindset…believing my circumstances aligned with me being of lessor value than those around me.  aligning with that, i believed empathy, kindness and trust were weaknesses which would expose me to the exploits of the world around me.  therefore, i would limit myself, generating unnecessary stress in an attempt to be someone other than who i was meant to be. similar to the “bigger thomas” character in richard wright’s 1940’s novel, i felt displaced when interacting with anyone outside of my family and community.  as i learn to release the chains i keep within my own mind, i’m increasingly presenting my true self, accepting that of which god expected me to receive.  here’s to hoping you are not doing as i did…limiting yourself to that of a native son.
