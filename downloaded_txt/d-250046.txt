planet terror
november 18th, 2007 

rodriguez has shot a great movie, but it’s better not to take it seriously: just switch off your brain and enjoy the movie! team-work with tarantino has brought some fruits: dialogs in this film are just super! and in addition to it we have perfect scenario, great actors and soundtrack.

harry potter and the order of the phoenix
november 18th, 2007 

let’s start from the book. “harry potter and the order of the phoenix” is the longest and the most somber among all five ones, but it has already broken all possible records! the first edition of phoenix was issued in 13.5 million copies.  read the rest of this entry »

good luck chuck
november 18th, 2007 

nice and fresh jessica alba is the one the young actresses who looks great among other testosterone-soaked young moviegoers. she has such sweet appearance that she can bring a success to even bad movie like “into the blue”. she is starring in new film “good luck chuck” with dane cook who is one of the most popular comic-actors in america.  read the rest of this entry »

a civil action
november 17th, 2007 

i’ve been to court on several occasions (nothing illegal, just the usual: restraining orders, mob boss indictments, contract negotiations) and i have to tell you one thing: 99% of everything that goes on in court is boring. extremely boring. it’s not very interesting or very compelling. as someone who sat through the entire o.j. simpson murder trial could tell you, if they could bottle most of what happened in the courtroom during the trial it would make a great sleeping agent. oh sure, every now and then something interesting would happen, but for the most part, i feel sorry for juries.  read the rest of this entry »

men in black 2
july 12th, 2007 

you know a big-budget special-effects driven movie is in trouble when a talking canine steals the spotlight. that’s what happens in “men in black 2,” a noisy, bigger-isn’t-necessarily-better sequel to the 1997 blockbuster. despite all of the expensive window trapping and the return of will smith and tommy lee jones (in 1997 they were billed as jones and smith), “men in black 2” is a sequel that is much ado about nothing. sorry bill. read the rest of this entry »

adaptation dvd
july 1st, 2007 

charlie kaufman has a problem. the academy award-nominated screenwriter of “being john malkovich” and the current “confessions of a dangerous mind” has been asked to adapt susan orlean’s best-selling novel “the orchid thief” into a screenplay. kaufman soon learns that as written, “the orchid thief” is not really movie material. read the rest of this entry »

mighty joe young
june 12th, 2007 

there are some movies that audiences immediately dismiss until their video debut. what does it for me is the coming attraction. i have purposely skipped certain films until their home video premiere because of a dubious trailer. usually my instincts are right. occasionally i’m the victim of a bad trailer.  read the rest of this entry »
