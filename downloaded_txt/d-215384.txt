    why are we different?

as an authorized dealer for husqvarna-viking, brother, janome & singer, both of our locations offer quality machines that are not sold in department or chain stores. we back our machines with a 1-year "in-house" labor warranty, free cleaning within the first year, and free lessons on your machine when you purchase from us; so you are sure to get the most out of your investment. that is the service that sets us apart from the rest and we look forward to serving all of your creative needs!

i purchase a brother bq1350 about 2 years ago.  love this machine and have made about 10 quilts.  store personnel have been very helpful when i have had questions.  i would purchase a machine from a dealer because my experience is that i get better service from them.- phyllis k.

i was in the market for a new machine as mine had bit the dust. i had certain features i wanted as well as a budget. first i went to their sister store in tulsa, but they did not have any machines, due to covid, that met my criteria. we called sewing central and talked to kris who had received a machine, still in packing box as just arrived, so we went straight there to check it out. i have to say this was a great shopping experience. kris showed us several options, told us the pros and cons of each, and demonstrated each one. she took time to answer all our questions. she helped us select the perfect machine, viking opal 670, and the accessories we needed. walked out with new machine and stayed in budget. i am one very satisfied customer!!! i can highly recommend both of these stores.- deborah s.
