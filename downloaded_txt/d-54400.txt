racketeering in medicine

decriminalize black salves










what can you say when
 major governments act to assist counterfeiters and pirates,
 in violation of their own laws and policies?  in a previous
 ashwin,
 we address the case of jennifer wilson
 and professional fda-snitch, george s. ackerson, who have
 not only been using our registered trademark illegally
 (cansema®), but 
 now claim to be the real alpha omega laboratories
 of guayaquil, ecuador -- even though they are based in
 drake, nsw (australia).







 makers of 
 cansema® black topical salve: based
  on the century old escharotic formula
  for removing skin cancers.
 money back if not satisfied.

 and in streaming video.

the
 health challenges of our time are largely
 self-inflicted - but few examples of human
 folly compare to the story of iodine,
 chlorine, and a textbook
 phenomenon called "halogen displacement."
 fortunately, it is a problem that is
 cheaply and easily corrected.

alpha omega labs
in ecuador (2021)


we reopened
 alpha omega labs on june 2, 2008 and have been
 steadily working on adding our old formulas
 (and a few new ones) since.
many of our friends and customers
 have asked about the status of ao labs' founder, greg caton, since his
 illegal kidnapping in 2009. an brief summary has been published by 
 natural news;
 mike adams additionally reported
 on the specifics while hosting for the alex jones show in sept., 2011;
 and more recently, an extensive update has been posted to chapter 3,
 section 3 of meditopia®. lastly, a
 march, 2012 issue of the ashwin provides some of the
 basic details for those who are interested.
please note that orders can no longer
be accepted on this site (see links above to contact our labs' order centers).
 
inquiries can
 be made at our email support page.





alpha omega labs' products now has
 two different order
 centers (stores) from which to choose.

covid-19

ecuador (2021) -- closing comments
 concerning covid have been posted here.
 we maintain an advisory page that 
 tells you what supplements you should be taking to avoid
 the worst of a viral pandemic.  i myself came down with covid-19 on march 5 and used
 our own recommended products to get rid of it.  (the worst of it lasted two days, and then i had
 about two weeks of fatigue.  i discuss this on the update page.)
  





fake medicine

jan. 1, 2020 -- a call by the
 british medical journal to
 end the practice of relying on pharma-industry funded studies is a breathtaking
 departure from the medical journal party line.
  it seems that everyone's had enough
 of fake news, fake science, fake studies, fake education, and fake government. 
 these are among the censored themes covered in the
 rabbit hole's end blog.
 speaking of censorship, black salve (the 2019 book) has been banned on amazon
 and is now only available here.
  



why orthodoxy &
the main stream media
can not & will not
give escharotics a fair
& objective evaluation



friends were stunned a couple years back
 when i agreed to be interviewed by 
 dr. mehmet oz in 2017 for one of his shows.
 there is no associate of mine who didn't know that this was "ambush journalism" in the making.
 in a comprehensive rebuttal, i provide
 my justification, along with a refutation of orthodoxy's arguments
 against this ancient naturopathic practice.




author, scientist & former
nasa astronaut
endorses cansema®

cansema® is a single chapter
 subject in 
 tomorrow's 
 cancer cures today: 25 secret therapies from around the world, authored 
 by allen spreen, m.d. central to the chapter is an interview of dr. brian o'leary about his experience
 with cansema®.
see the cansema testimonial
 page for 2008 for details about dr. o'leary's case.  the
 testimonial section, which has many hundreds of pictorials
 and testimonials has been updated to 2020.
