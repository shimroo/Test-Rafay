        featured report
      



the culturally competent substance abuse treatment project began in november, 2007 and ended june, 2017. funded by the iowa department of public health (idph), the project aimed to address barriers to treatment for members of minority groups and to implement culturally competent treatment services. the evaluation involved assessing outcomes for minority clients receiving these services by collecting outcomes data via smart, analyzing substance use and demographic variables, and an analysis that compared outcomes for project participants to clients in other treatment programs in the state.
