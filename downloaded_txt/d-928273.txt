jochebed 
  “god’s glory” 
            no navy ever launched a  fleet as mighty or as majestic as the simple single vessel with such a precious  cargo as the one christened by jochebed in egypt.without sail or cannon, no  british “man o’ war” was as awesome sailing into the face of evil as when the  tiny baby basket floated in the marshes of the nile. given up to god by a  mother’s faith, moses was “saved by grace through faith” until the day he would  on his own volition choose god over all the riches of egypt. -id

 new birth

if any man be in christ he is a new creationâ¦
		      do not settle for carbon copy or cookie cutter christianity.  being conformed is no substitute for being transformed. one is from outside  pressure the other is the holy spirit working from the inside out. it’s christ  “in you” the hope of glory. the second generation cannot get a pass from the  first generation. as jesus said to nicodemus “you must be born again.”  christianity can not be asserted until a person is converted. saying, “i  believe what they believe” just will not cut it. the pilgrims struggled with  their “half-way covenant.” salvation is not nepotism or birthright; it is  nothing less than a new birth. your baptismal certificate is no substitute for  your name being written in the lamb’s book of life and once that candle is lit,  there is no way it can be hid under a bushel. -id
 
 


 
 





 
  
 

 






why i said "yes" to jesus


i closely examined and considered his claims, character, conduct. i pondered the paradox of the cross and responded to power of his call.â i found his influence on world history and upon my own heart to be indelible, his character impeccable, courage invincible, words imperishable, his love immeasurable and kindness incredible. he said he was the way, and i believe him. for the sinner, he is the way “out,” for the seeker, the way “in.” for the fallen, he is the way “up.” for those gone astray, he is the way “back.” for the lost he is the way “home.” he is the highway, the freeway, the narrow way, and the only way. he also said that he is the truth and i believe the truth. as truth, his words were unvarnished as well as untarnished. truth is untainted, untangled, and without shadow of turning. truth is “what is,” and jesus is the “i am.” truth is the plumb line, the straight edge, the fulcrum and the tip of the spear. he also said he is life. he offers to all who believe in him, new, abundant, and eternal life. he was, by his enemies vilified, by birth and life qualified, by prophecy crucified, resurrection justified, and by his ascension glorified. he is the center, the source and the force of my faith. he is my savior and lord. two thousand years ago he came, he became, he overcame, and he said he is coming again.â perhaps today.â -id

this author found peace fifty-five years ago when he knelt by an army bunk bed and surrendered to god, and this is a collection of lessons learned and shared along the way.

paul asked two questions when he was converted on the damascus road. "who are you lord?" the second question was, "what do you want me to do?" first there is the who, then there is the do.
