auricap and auricap xoaudiophile capacitors




auricap .... considered by many audiophiles as "the best capacitor money can buy". 
construction: auricaps are made in the united states with the very best precision wound metalized polypropylene film with extended foil (non-inductive) construction. special care is taken to insure industry leading esr values.
applications: high end audiophile uses include: signal coupling, loudspeaker crossover apps, power supply filtering & decoupling, filtering, bypassing and power factor correction.  if you are restoring antique tube radios ... you need not use these audiophile capacitors. our other lines of film capacitors are perfect for vintage tube radios and are much more economical than audiophile capacitors.
specs: auricap specifications
auricap prices & shopping cart 








 in addition to the traditional auricap audiophile capacitor (pictured at left) and its successor the auricap xo, we have in stock the unique r version which has solid tinned copper leads that exit from the "periphery" of the auricap body (see picture above). 
leads: auricap and auricap xo use "stranded" hook-up leads. auricap leads are made of polished, stranded high purity oxygen free copper with xlpe insulation. the auricap xo uses insulated ohno mono crystal leads. the r version has "solid" tinned copper leads. although some fellows refer to the r version as radial, they are actually tubular axial (body is same as auricap) but with solid leads and unique lead location which makes the r version ideal for circuit board and/or hand wired applications.






auricap xo have stranded hookup leads exiting from middle of capacitor. the auricap always has a single lead from each end. the xo version have double twisted leads from each end (if cap body large enough to permit this) see pics on our website. small size xo still use use single leads from each end.  we provide free red and black heat-shrink with the unique r version auricap capacitors.
