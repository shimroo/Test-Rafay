born at an early age, nat turned quickly to reading (the earliest book he can recall is a peanuts comic strip collection, which certainly portends and may be the root cause of much that is to come) and writing (his first story? âfat nat sat on a cat, and lassie saw a rat. boo!â) his earlier years were spent in cinnaminson, nj; simsbury, ct; and riverton, nj, where he stayed long enough to consider it his hometown. there with the help of supportive parents and teachers, he sped through school, skipping 4th grade, and was soon shuttling between the grade school and the high school for math and science classes. on his bar mitzvah, his first home computer arrived, a commodore pet for which he and his family had paid extra to get the full 8 kilobytes or ram. at age 14, he went off to attend simonâs rock of bard college, where he obtained his ba four years later.
while comic strips and humorous kiddie comics like little archie and richie rich had made up a portion of his regular reading in his early years, it was in college that he got exposed to - and fell in love with - the full array of what american comics had to offer, at a time when the field was going through a marked creative growth. a chance encounter with marvel two-in-one artist ron wilson on a bus made him realize that comics really could be a career.
following college, nat went to work for new jerseyâs avant-garde computing, writing in his spare time. he broke into comics with scripts for grimjack and speed racer. leaving avant-garde after several years and far too many lines of z-80 assembly language code, nat came across que publishing, a computer book publisher who was looking for comic book writers to create visually-oriented computer books. computers illustrated would be his first of many reader-friendly computer books.
moving to the greater los angeles area, nat continued to work in both comics and computer books. around this time, he also became a commercial sperm donor, primarily for female couples. his efforts helped in generating around twenty offspring.      
while being frequently published by a variety of publishers, nat desired to spend more of his effort on original creations rather than spending time pitching concepts for the power rangers and yogi bear. to this end, he founded the publishing line about comics; the first issue about published, the factor issue 0, would bring nat his first eisner award nomination. about would eventually publish not only natâs work, but both new and reprint work by over a hundred talented creators, and expand well beyond comics.
meanwhile, natâs lifelong affection for the peanuts comic strip had fed a collecting urge for the books, which in turn lead to nat creating collectorâs guides to peanuts books and distributing them online. this all came to nat launching aaugh.com, an information and catalogue site for peanuts book fans. the siteâs blog did much to launch what nat calls his "professional peanuts nerd" career, writing and conceiving books about peanuts for other publishers and writing new peanuts stories for the comic books, among other efforts. his book the snoopy treasures (thunder bay press, 2015) won the independent book publishers association benjamin franklin gold award for best coffee table book, and charles m. schulz: the art and life of the peanuts creator in 100 objects (the schulz museum, 2022), which he co-wrote with schulz museum curator benjamin l. clark, won the eisner award for best comics-related book in 2023.
nat lives in camarillo, california with his wife dr. lara gertler and their two kids.
