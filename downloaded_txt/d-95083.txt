update – 2/18/25
spring is on its way! currently, our daffodils are at 40% to peak bloom, hyacinths at 30%, and tulips at 15%. with this week’s extreme cold, there is potential for a slowdown in the bloom cycle. our horticulturists will assess next week and provide updated bloom projections as the garden begins to awaken for the season. stay tuned for more updates!
