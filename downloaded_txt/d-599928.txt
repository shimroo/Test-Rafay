past programs










the following academic programs were previously offered at the middlebury institute. 

master of business administration (mba)
the middlebury institute offered an mba from 1982 until the final cohort of students graduated in december 2019. we also offered a joint mba/ma in international policy and development and a joint mba/ma in international environmental policy during this time. the mba program was made an accredited member of aacsb (association to advance collegiate schools of business) international in april 2002 following a rigorous six-year self-study and application process. the program was an mba in international business until the fall of 2015 when it was renamed the mba in global impact management due to revisions and a broad curriculum redesign. the aacsb approved the accreditation of the institute’s mba program through the completion of its phaseout period.
for more information, please contact toni thomas at tmthomas@miis.edu.
master of arts in commercial diplomacy (cd)
visit our ma in global governance and policy for the current iteration of this past program.
master of arts in international trade
formerly, ma in international trade and economic diplomacy (ited). visit our ma in global governance and policy for the current iteration of this past program.
master of public administration
this program helped students launch careers managing development initiatives that address critical issues including poverty, disaster relief, education, and health. while we no longer enroll students in this program, we continue to offer our popular in-person ma in international policy and development. this is a great option for prospective students considering the mpa in social change as there are many overlapping courses and faculty members, and our graduates have similar career outcomes.
if you need more flexibility, we also offer an online mpa in sustainability, which allows you to study part-time on an asynchronous schedule and continue to work.
master of arts in international policy studies (ips)
specializations within this degree evolved into master’s programs in their own right:

ma in international policy and development (ipd)
ma in international trade
ma in nonproliferation and terrorism studies (npts)

master of arts in tesol and master of arts in teaching foreign language
these two programs helped students prepare to teach english to speakers of other languages, arabic, chinese, french, japanese, korean, russian, and spanish, train teachers, conduct research, develop curricula, manage programs, and lead. while we no longer enroll students in these programs, we continue to offer a language teaching graduate degree through our online ma in tesol. this option provides students more flexibility to continue working while they earn their master’s and a more affordable tuition rate.
for those interested in teaching a foreign language, the world-renowned middlebury language schools offer master’s programs in ten different languages to over 400 students annually. these programs can be completed over four summers in vermont, or in one summer and an academic year abroad or online, depending on the language.
online master of arts in translation and localization management
this advanced-entry online program was replaced by the online ma in localization project management.
