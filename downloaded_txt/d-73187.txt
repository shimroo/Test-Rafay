						marcie and her team are my trusted partners for recruiting. they take the time to understand my open roles, help position postings to maximize applicant pools, seek out potential candidates through modern channels, screen for a fit with the job requirements and organizational norms, and handle all of the backend administrative requirements of my organization. candidates and new hires also often cite how smooth their experiences have been with her team.
