facilities upgrades during the unplanned outage


chrns non-equilibrium initiative


chrns education and outreach


ncnr user group










notice to usersncnr is conducting an extensive repair, maintenance, and upgrade project.  return to scientific operations is planned for early 2026.  once that operating schedule has been finalized, ncnr will issue a new call for proposals.


 


maximizing access for the scientific community to transformative neutron scattering instrumentation 


a consortium for the advancement of neutron-based measurements for manufacturing of soft materials


news for ncnr users clean & run - the ncnr has established a detailed schedule for returning to scientific operations neutrons for the future - the report from the workshop "neutrons for the future" has been released.economic impact study - rti has undertaken an economic impact assessment of investments in u.s. neutron research facilities.chrns assistance with user experiments at other neutron facilities  - during the outage, chrns staff are available to assist users in person with experiments performed at other national and international neutron facilities.  this opportunity, which is supported by chrns, is especially beneficial for user experiments that require specialized equipment available only at the ncnr.  interested users should reach out to appropriate chrns staff or to ronald.jones [at] nist.gov (ron jones) (condensed matter science group leader).ncnr seminar schedule 31st chrns summer school on neutron spectroscopy- an in-person one-week school will be hosted at the ncnr from july 28 - aug. 1, 2025. applications are currently being accepted until march 3.  to learn more and apply, please visit the summer school webpage. chrns non-equilibrium structure of materials initiative - chrns is supplying advanced neutron capabilities to characterize materials out of equilibrium    new neutron spin echo for the nation - funded by nsf, nist and the center for neutron science at the university of delaware are building a new spin echo spectrometer          facility upgrades during the unplanned outagegetting great data with chrns - this 2½ minute video describes the center for high resolution neutron scattering, a key partnership with the national science foundationsee differently with neutrons at nist - watch a 2½ minute animated explanation for a general audience of what we do at the ncnrtraining from other labs - nist accepts basic radiation safety training from other u.s. neutron facilities in place of the nist offered on-line trainingthe ncnr users group has summarized the results of a recent user survey
