re-membering the body



the rev. paddy cavanaugh




friends, i can’t tell you how good it is to be back with you today, and if you are visiting or new, then welcome. in case you have forgotten, my name is paddy cavanaugh, the associate rector at st. george’s, and for the past three months i have been on paternity leave with my wife winnie, who gave birth to our first daughter, mary winston, in october. since then i have been wrapped in a blanket of wonder, love, and praise, at the miracle which new life promises.

the rev. shearon sykes williams





“for zion’s sake i will not keep silent, and for jerusalem’s sake i will not rest.”  isaiah 62: 1-5



the rev. shearon sykes williams




today we remember the legacy of the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr.  mlk was a prophet, very much in keeping with the old testament prophetic tradition.  in our reading from isaiah today, the prophet speaks to a people who had been in captivity in babylon for many years and are now experiencing a kind of ptsd.  they are divided, disillusioned, and lack a common vision.  some have stayed in babylon.  some have returned from exile to their homeland.  and a new generation has been born after their return that do no share that earlier experience of captivity with their parents and grandparents.

      “ the journey of the magi”



the rev. shearon sykes williams




in their book, “the christmas journey,” author sally fisher and illustrator douglas sardo, offer an imaginative retelling of the story of the three kings from today’s gospel.  fisher’s inspiration for the tale was her visits to see her grandmother in new york city at christmastime.  every year, as she was growing up, they would go the metropolitan museum of art to see the famous christmas tree and creche.  the 20 foot tree is magnificently lit and looms over a gorgeous nativity scene with a multitude of life-like figures and glorious angels hovering above on the tree.  the figures depict naples’ multi-cultural population in the 18th century.  after fisher and her grandmother shared this annual ritual, they would go back to her grandmother’s apartment and she would tell her granddaughter her own story of the journey of the tree, the angels, and all of the people and animals beneath the tree.  fisher’s book is her remembrance of the tale that enchanted her so much, a story that sparked her own curiosity and wonder about how to make meaning of today’s gospel.  what follows is my retelling of her story.  i shared it with you for the first time several years ago. wonderful stories are worthy of being told over and over again.  they invite us to come along and learn something new every time we hear them.

poetry, beauty and wonder



the rev. shearon sykes williams




poetry, beauty and wonder.  that is what this morning is about.  our souls long for the profound mystery at the heart of christmas, the gloriously impossible reality that god’s power and god’s love came to us as a little child.  god’s ways are clearly not our ways.  we come together today as people who walk in a land of deep darkness.  there is so much right now that threatens our sense of well-being.  but into that deep darkness, a light has shined, “for a child has been born for us, a son given to us.”

christmas sermon 



the rev. paddy cavanaugh




good evening st. george’s and merry christmas! it is a joy to be back with you on this night. for those of you who are new or visiting – welcome. i’ve been away for the past few weeks celebrating a small nativity of my own with my wife winnie. in october we welcomed the arrival of our first child, mary winston, who is right here in the pews with us tonight. there is nothing like a fresh new baby to bring the miracle of christmas to life, is there?

justice



our commitment to the pursuit of justice rests in a call to join god’s work in the world. from outreach opportunities like our food pantry to the communal exploration of racial injustice, we take seriously god’s call to help the hurting and to address the causes of that hurt.
