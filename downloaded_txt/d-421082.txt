the flex-display system comprises a range of adaptable components in combination with digitally printed textiles. it may be used to create small and elegant display banner stands right through to giant portable backdrops with one-piece fabric poster graphics.
flex-display’s combination of lightweight portable aluminium hardware and fabric print together produce a striking display solution which is truly portable and very lightweight – starting at just 1.5kgs for a complete display banner stand!
in addition to the flex-display range, we also supply printed fabrics with a selection of finishing and hanging options and a complementary range of products from a select group of suppliers with something different to say.
