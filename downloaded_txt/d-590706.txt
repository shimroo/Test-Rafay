the first firecoach models with aerial devices were produced in 1960 and 1961













(above) the very first crown with an aerial device was f-1221, a 50-foot pittman snorkel for elko, nv, in 1960. built on a international harvester vco-190 cab-over-engine chassis with a 2-door, enclosed tilt-cab, it was powered by a ih 549 c.i. v8 gasoline engine and had a 750 gpm waterous pump and 300 gallon tank.













the second crown/snorkel, and the first aerial device on a custom firecoach chassis, was f-1222, completed in 1961. it was built as a demo and later sold to snohomish co wa (the final fire service owner was crown point, in). it had a 65-foot snorkel and no pump or tank and was powered by a 935 c.i. (325 h.p.) hall scott gasoline engine. in this rare color factory image taken at the time of certification of the boom, the truck had yet to have the ladder racks and ladders added.
