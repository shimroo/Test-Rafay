important message.

if you keep bees in
        new zealand  check their varroa mite level regularly. 
        don't be complacent.
varroa is well established throughout nz.
        in the north is it is showing signs of 
        synthetic pyrethroid resistance. 
	be vigilant and monitor your hives for all
	existing and potential (exotic) diseases.
