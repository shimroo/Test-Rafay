radfae
serving radical faeries for over 25 years
radfae.org was created in 1998 as a way to connect radical faeries across different gatherings, regions, and online spaces. over the years, it has served as a central hub for sharing resources, event details, and community information.
today, a small circle of faeries is keeping the site going, ensuring it remains a useful and accessible resource for the wider faerie community. we’re here to help faeries stay connected, informed, and supported.
if you have information to share or want to help maintain the site, we’d love to hear from you!
