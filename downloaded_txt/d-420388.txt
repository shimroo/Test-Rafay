about me





rainbow demon


i'm a "left-over" from another space in time... a hippie, grateful deadhead, radical faerie... in other words: a 'commie-pinko-faggot' like the ones your mother warned you about... if we must put labels on people, why not just say that i believe we all should be equal under the law - period. if that's such a 'radical' notion, so be it. it seems rather simple to me...
