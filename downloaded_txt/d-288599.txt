andrea belag




new four-color lithograph availableandrea belag is a painter who looks to nature as inspiration for her colorful abstractions. in these three new prints, bold gestural colors capture the essence of the dynamic forces of the sea. in her approach to printmaking, the artist chose to work in lithography for its direct quality of drawing. her broad gestural strokes, drawn with a loaded brush onto the plate, evoke a sense of motion and weather.
