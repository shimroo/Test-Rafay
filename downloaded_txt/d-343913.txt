why we're here... 









empowering artists,  redefining music  sales











the problem








music distribution is broken


revenue  loss
streaming platforms and app stores get up to 30% of revenue, leaving the rest for artists and song rights holders to split. (includes free services/music.)


living wage  struggle
most musicians earn fractions of pennies per stream. touring is expensive. sustaining a music career is difficult, even for the most talented artists.


disconnected  relationships

                            fans are consumers, not supporters. they pay platforms, not the artists they love. fans want to be more connected and have access to exclusive content and merch.

industry market share
by proportion of subscribers (global).


how  much  does  spotify  pay?
artists/rights  holders receive  $0.003 - $0.005  per stream (avg)  if content  qualifies.















the numbers 



break it down
global recorded music revenues by segment 2023


 for a 3rd consecutive year, physical revenues increased. driven by strong gains in cd revenue and the continued expansion of interest of vinyl, physical formats were worth us$5.1b in 2023. asia is the leading region for physical music sales.













the gap 



artists need a modern  way to monetize  their music


today's musicians are creative entrepreneurs, navigating a world where innovation meets practicality. while vinyl and cds have seen a resurgence, they're expensive, cumbersome, and often inaccessible for fans. artists need a modern, scalable solution that empowers them to sell directly to fans with low risk, minimal upfront costs, and maximum impact. by offering a product that's portable, affordable, and designed for today's listeners, we're transforming how musicians monetize their craft and connect with their audience.
