where everything is so dog gone good!




















  

historydog n suds had a humble beginning back in 1953 in champaign, illinois when don hamacher and jim griggs, two music teachers from the university of illinois, opened a hot dog and root beer stand. rapidly, hamacher and griggs' success became known in central illinois, which led them to forego the teaching profession and get into the fast-food franchising business full time. dog n suds in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s became one of the most successful fast-food franchises in the country.the tradition continues71 years later, dog n suds is still alive and well with 20 restaurant locations around the country and retail sale of its “world famous” root beer through a network of distributors nationwide. our customers love the old-time look and feel of a classic drive-in and travel near and far for the opportunity to enjoy our world famous coney dogs and cool off with our hand-crafted world’s creamiest root beer!
