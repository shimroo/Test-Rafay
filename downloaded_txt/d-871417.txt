it’s time to talk about safe internet use, and you need to know what to watch out for as you connect online with others, whether you’re on a gay chat site or on facebook.
we’re talking about how to stay safe on gay chat sites, how to chat anonymously, how to chat with people who you don’t know, and how to avoid being targeted by a scammer or a sex pest.
if you’re looking to chat with people on gay chat sites, this is a short article on how to stay safe on gay hookup websites, how to chat anonymously, how to chat with people who you don’t know, and how to avoid being targeted by a scammer or a sex pest.
if you’re on a public network, there is nothing you can do to protect yourself when it comes to the internet. you can try to avoid the bots and scammers, but the only way to really do it is to use a virtual private network (vpn).
we’ll talk about how to stay safe on gay hookup websites, how to chat anonymously, how to chat with people who you don’t know, and how to avoid being targeted by a scammer or a sex pest.
porn & adult websites
pornography and sexual content are very prominent on the internet, especially for gay guys. it’s pretty obvious. adult sites have ads for products, porn, gay live cam, and so forth.
unfortunately, there is a lot of unsavory material online for adults as well. and you’ve seen it. you’ve seen the images pop up and you’ve felt your blood pressure rise.
and the bad guys know that. they will always have a sense of urgency to keep your attention. they will make things as unsavory as they can to gain your attention.
the thing to remember is that they can’t force you to watch. you are in full control. if you click on an image or video, you can always just hit the x and move on.
conclusion
with a virtual private network, you’ll be able to stay secure and anonymous online. they are free and can be used on mobile devices. they are also very easy to use. you should take advantage of them to stay safe on gay chat sites.
this doesn’t only apply to adults. you could be just as affected by a bad connection. whether it’s on a gay hookup site, or a dating site, you should make sure to use a vpn whenever you can.




how vpn software keeps you safe on hookup sites like uhitit

how a vpn works
a vpn acts as a kind of intermediary when you connect to the internet and hide your ip address when using a meetnfuck app, a sequence of numbers your internet service provider assigns to your device to protect your identity.
 a vpn works by routing the internet connection of your devices away from your internet provider via the private vpns server of your choice, so that your data is transferred over the internet as if it came from the vpn and not from your computer.  
a vpn (virtual private network) allows you to establish a secure connection to a network on the internet. a vpn service establishes an encrypted connection between your device and a vpn server via your internet connection so you can meetup for sex without giving up your privacy.
think of a vpn as a tunnel under the mountain – the internet service provider (isp) is located in the mountain and the tunnel is the exit from the vpn connection to the world wide web.   
why use a vpn?
many people nowadays use a vpn to torrent, bypass geographical restrictions and view content from different countries. commercial vpn services have become a popular way to secure the internet traffic by encrypting unencrypted internet ports. 
a vpn (virtual private network) is a service that allows you to bypass geo-blocking, government censorship and your real ip address on the internet. a vpn encrypts your internet data and traffic and keeps it secure from hackers. it creates a safe tunnel between your devices. 
vpns are also used to access regions with restricted websites, to protect your surfing activity from prying eyes on public wi-fi and much more. if you’re browsing websites that some may find objectionable,  such as hookup apps like uhitit.app, you may want to use a vpn to cover your tracks.
a vpn encrypts your data, disguises your location and disguises your browsing history and the data that you transmit over the internet. a virtual private network connection provides you the opportunity to access the internet via a remote server, hide your actual location, browse history and encrypt your data.  
if you do not want others to access your email, login, image files or credit card information, it is advisable to use a vpn connection. a vpn (virtual private network) is a secure connection between you and the internet.
are there any drawbacks?
unlike proxy networks like tor, vpns do not slow down internet traffic under normal circumstances. while some vpns are faster than others, one of the most important factors is that many vpn clients can use a vpn server at any time. pcs, smartphones, tablets, dedicated servers, iot devices and end points can all have a vpn connection.
how to configure a vpn?
there are several ways to setup a vpn connection, but most private users subscribe to a vpn service. 
on windows, press the windows key and enter “vpn” and click the option “setting up a virtual private network connection (vpn).”. use the wizard to enter the address and credentials for the vpn service you want to use.

our world-class autorun version

 arvizo mather
 2020-05-01
 software




about:     autorun (quick divx starter) is a free utility that scans its directory (or cd), and executes predefined commands when you press player(s) buttons.
this software is specifically designed for the lazy people. 🙂you just copy the autorun to the folder where the movie is placed and press button to watch the film.if the folder or cd contains any picture file (acceptable formats are jpg, gif or bmp), autorun uses it as film’s poster.if the folder or cd contains any text file (acceptable file extensions are txt, sub or srt) that has the same name with divx file, the autorun accept it as a subtitle file.simply, you can press the button and watch the film.
install:copy autorun.exe (and autorun.inf optionally) to the folder where the movie is placed.the best way to learn it is to try it out.
prepare:first, you must copy the file autorun.exe to the folder that contains your divx file. you can also copy vplayer and bsplayer files to this directory.these files are:
vplayer.exe (vplayer executable file)bplay.exe (bsplayer executable file)bsrendv.dll (bsplayer library file)
optional files:
vplayer.inibplay.ini
or you can use select player button to run your favorite player.
how it works:when autorun executed
it scans directory or cd where it is.it checks vplayer.exe or bplay.exe, if they exist, the play buttons are enabled.if the folder or cd contains any picture file (acceptable formats are jpg, gif or bmp), autorun uses it as a film poster.if the folder or cd contains any text file (acceptable file extensions are txt, sub, or srt) that has the same name with divx file, the autorun accepts it as a subtitle file.if the folder or cd contains the file any text file (the file extension must be “nfo”), autorun uses it as title release information and it enables show info button. otherwise, this button is not visible.if the folder or cd contains vplayer or bsplayer, it enables its play buttons.if the vplayer button is enabled, you can press the vplayer button and it runs vplayer with predefined parameters (full screen, auto-pan etc.). if you add a section in vplayer.ini as:[quickdivxstarter]param=/f /a /p55v player uses these values as a parameter.if bplayer button is enabled, you can press the bplayer button and it runs bplayer with predefined parameters (full screen, auto pan etc.). if the folder or cd contains the file bplay.ini, autorun uses it as parameter file.the configuration file (called autorun.ini) is read from where autorun.exe is located if it exists when autorun starts up.if you add a section in autorun.ini as:[options]language=frenchautorun uses these values as a language directive.or alternatively, you can set the language from the (called about box (the selection is written in the registry).if you add a section in autorun.ini as:[options]buttontitle=load codecsbuttonrun=codecs\divx511.exeautorun uses these values to change the select player button. the text of select player button changes to load codecs and then it executes divx511.exe in the folder codecs if pressed.another example:[options]buttontitle=all playerbuttonrun=allplayer.exebuttonparam=guru.avi fullscreenwhen autorun starts, the text of select player button is changed to all player and starts the movie file (for example guru.avi) as fullscreen mode if you press this button. if you add a section in autorun.ini as:[options]picture=data\movie_poster.jpgautorun uses these values to use (display) as a film poster. another example:[options]buttontitle=startbuttonrun=data\vplayer.exebuttonparam=guru.avi /fpicture=data\guru_poster.jpgwhen autorun starts, the text of select player button is changed to start and starts the movie file (for example guru.avi) as fullscreen mode if you press this button. also, it shows the file data\guru_poster.jpg as a film poster. if you add a section in autorun.ini as:[options]title=star trek vi – the undiscovered countryautorun uses these values to use (display) as the film title which will work with the right button menu commands. for example:[options]buttontitle=startbuttonrun=data\vplayer.exebuttonparam=guru.avi /fpicture=data\guru_poster.jpgtitle=guru
advantages:
easy! you just put the file onto cd or any folder where movie is placed.it is not necessary to describe the autorun and write a movie title there, autorun get the information from movie filename and it deletes crap words (like divxscr, dvl-verified etc.) and shows properly. for instance;if movie filename is:cradle.2.the.grave.dvdscr.xvid-dvl.aviin autorun screencradle 2 the.grave is displayed as movie title.it has not any dll or another file(s). it is just a single “exe” file: autorun.exeno installation necessary.size is acceptable to fit in free space in your movie cd.it handles picture, subtitle and info files automatically.if you have internet connection, you can simply press movie image (poster) or title and get the movie information from imdb.
an example of autorun.ini (optional)[options]language=english
