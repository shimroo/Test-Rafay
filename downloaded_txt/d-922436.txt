opening reception: the past beneath our feet
5-8 p.m., friday, november 15, 2024
the event is free and open to the public.
about the exhibition
history permeates every corner of our world, often concealed within the layers of
                  soil beneath our feet. as archaeological endeavors persistently excavate and scrutinize
                  these concealed depths, novel discoveries continuously reshape and refine our comprehension
                  of the past.
the pervasive nature of history asserts its presence in numerous forms, from minute
                  artifacts to expansive ruins, each bearing witness to bygone eras. through meticulous
                  excavation and rigorous analysis, archaeologists unearth artifacts that serve as portals
                  to the past, elucidating cultural practices, societal structures, and technological
                  advancements that otherwise would be lost.
"the past beneath our feet" presents the findings of thomas finan, ph.d.,'s two decades
                  of exploration in ireland. sluma invites you to discover these artifacts for yourself
                  and ignite your curiosity about the world that came before us.
about thomas finan, ph.d.
the research of thomas finan, ph.d., thoroughly explores the rich tapestry of medieval
                  ireland, focusing particularly on the history and archaeology of the later medieval
                  period. his primary area of interest is the borderlands of the shannon river in roscommon
                  during the 13th and 14th centuries. as the director of the north roscommon archaeological
                  projects, he leads extensive surveys and excavations within the medieval lordship
                  of moylurg. this project aims to uncover and understand the complex social, economic
                  and political dynamics of this historically significant region.
opening reception: renaissance man: paintings by the honorable nathan b. young jr.
5-8 p.m., friday, november 15, 2024
this event is free and open to the public.
about the exhibition
a man of diverse talents and ambitions, nathan b. young jr. served the city of st.
                  louis as a lawyer, judge, historian and journalist while pursuing his creative passions
                  as a novelist, musician and artist. after more than 30 years of practicing law in
                  st. louis, young served as the assistant city counselor until 1965, when he was appointed
                  judge of municipal court no. 2, the first african american to serve in the position
                  in st. louis.
before his death in 1993, the saint louis university archives began working with young
                  and his family to preserve his vast archive of personal effects. among his collections
                  were over 500 acrylic-on-canvas paintings executed over a 20-year period between the
                  mid-1960s and mid-1980s. a self-taught artist, young's paintings reveal that he was
                  well-versed in the history of art, particularly in the major european and american
                  works depicting people of african descent, as well as images related to the american
                  anti-slavery and civil rights movements. "renaissance man," curated by the participants
                  in the art history course, arth 4900: research methods, presents a selection of works
                  that demonstrate young's complex and multidimensional engagement with racial themes
                  through the lens of art history.
