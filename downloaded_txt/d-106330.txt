welcome! 






welcome to my site about biplane fighter aces, their aircraft and major aerial operations were biplane fighters took part.

the site also contains other aviation related subjects which i find interesting, including information about swedish voluntary aviators from the second world war.

if anyone could provide me with corrections/additions, feel free to email me!

visit my blogg about aviation (and other) matters slightly out of the scope of my site, to promote good books, interesting web-sites etc. at wwii biplane fighter aces.
