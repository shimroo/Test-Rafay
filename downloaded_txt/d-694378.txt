for deniart systems, it all started with a passion and admiration for ancient egyptian hieroglyphs, a writing system that mystified scholars for hundreds of years with its complexity and beauty. denise koehler, a font designer, was equally mesmerized by this ancient writing system and after significant research, developed and launched deniart's first product, egyptian hieroglyphics volume one in 1993. from there, deniart continued to expand and the library grew to include many ancient writing systems like those of the aztecs & mayans as well as other pictorial communication glyphs . deniart's fonts are used by many academic and advertising institutions and in publications such as the sacred tradition of ancient egypt and the sacred magic of ancient egypt by rosemary clark.homefont gallery 1font gallery 2font gallery 3moremore childcopyright â© 2025 deniart systems. all rights reservedcontact: deniartsystems@gmail.com
