your voice matters!
























across our union, thousands of uaw members participate in one or more local union standing committees. they are rewarded by a feeling of accomplishment, working with their co-workers on meaningful projects, and “being the change” they want to see for working people. but we need many more activists at the table to help.
























there’s a direct relationship between the ballot box and the bread box, and what the union fights for and wins at the bargaining table can be taken away in the legislative halls.–walter reuther, uaw constitutional convention 1970 

















we're fighting for you
