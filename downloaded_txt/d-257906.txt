journey to mongolia
golden eagle festival, gobi desert & hustai national park
										13 days southern and western of mongolia



september 15â27, 2024
mongolia



talk about a remote frontier - mongolia is nothing short of mesmerizing - raw, seemingly endless open spaces, crystal clear waters, and a culture dating back thousands of years that maintains a true stronghold today, with 30% of the population still living a nomadic lifestyle. itâs a land of jaw-dropping beauty just waiting to be explored by the adventurous traveler that wants to challenge themselves. high on the central asian plateau, landlocked between russia to the north and china to the south, mongolia is almost untouched by tourism, famed for its nomadic tribespeople and the legacy of genghis khan, emperor of the once-mighty mongol empire. a land once ruled by ruthless warriors and noble emperors, mongoliaâs wild landscapes and extraordinary history make it the perfect destination for stepping off the well-worn path to explore its unique beauty, nomadic culture, and rich history.
