the story of noble roman’s pizza is the story of dedication to quality taste.















noble roman’s began in the competitive restaurant environment on the campus at indiana university as a pizzeria back in 1972. over the past 50 plus years, we have spent literally thousands of hours in product research and development tweaking each and every ingredient and recipe to achieve our goals. our obsession today is the same as it was back then!















dedication & on-going excellence



today, noble roman’s is 100% dedicated to providing and servicing the best pizza and sub food service systems to clients of all types, from individual franchisees to operators in venues such as entertainment facilities, convenience stores, bowling centers, universities, military bases – virtually any venue desiring the many benefits of branded food service. we also partner with quality groceries where we provide a highly effective, delicious, deli-based take-n-bake pizza program. and our flagship full-service pizzeria concept, craft pizza & pub, is renowned for its scratch-made crusts, hand-crafted pizzas and craft beer and wine – old traditions deliciously reborn!

our food



the story of noble roman’s pizza is the story of dedication to quality you can taste! every ingredient we use, every mouthwatering product we bake, has been developed in such a way as to maximize the pleasure of your taste buds!



























delicious ingredients



take our pizza crusts, for example. they’re made from specially milled, high protein flour, flavorful cornmeal and lots of bakery yeast. our fresh-packed, un-condensed  sauce is made with secret spices and vine-ripened tomatoes straight from the fields of california. and our vegetables and mushrooms are always sliced and delivered fresh, never canned.















committed to our customers



it’s common these days to cut corners and save a nickel, but our commitment to good taste means we never use soy fillers in our meats or cheeses. our pizza cheese is 100% real mozzarella and muenster cheese blended together with a pinch of oregano. and our pepperoni, sausage, beef and bacon—again, 100% real meat with no extenders or fillers. seems like the way it ought to be done, right? we agree!
