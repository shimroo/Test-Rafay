axis of logic
is now in an archived state. (5/18/2003 - 7/27/2022) 

	 we launched axis of logic on may 18, 2003 to provide news, essays and analyses to readers on international relations, domestic social and political affairs that are commonly unavailable in the corporate âmainstreamâ media. we have remained true to the mission statement that we wrote over 19 years ago, stating in part:
				âour world view consists of ideals for world peace; democracy (self-governance by the people); self-determination of all nations; respect for national sovereignty; noninterference in the domestic affairs of any nation by foreign governments; fair and just economic systems; responsibility for the preservation and protection of nature and compassion for ourselves and our fellow human beings.â
      
this work has been extremely rewarding for us, an all-volunteer group of writers, editors and publishers. we have never used advertising to cover expenses. everyone has worked without remuneration including our dedicated web professional who created and has maintained an attractive, user-friendly website at her own expense through the years. iâm very grateful to each one who has participated in this mission, to the many excellent writers who have allowed us to publish their valuable work. i'm especially grateful to my co-editor, paul richard harris for his selfless commitment to the truth, reporting it daily for years with  excellence on axis. finally, we thank you the reader for taking your valuable time to visit axis of logic for news that you may have otherwise missed and to consider perspectives for an expanded awareness and personal growth as we continue our pursuit of the truth together.
