6:52 pm - pork buns stuffed with cardboard



beijing authorities yesterday shut down a dim-sum booth that was discovered stuffing its steamed buns with cardboard in an apparent attempt to offset the rising cost of pork.the booth's owner fled and is wanted for questioning.the raid came after an investigative tv reporter uncovered the dodgy buns in a kitchen a few days earlier. the kitchen was used to prepare the dumplings for later sale at the streetside booth in beijing's chaoyang district.a video broadcast on wednesday night on china central television station showed an undercover interview conducted with a hidden camera.the segment opened with a shot of cardboard piled in a heap between rows of shabby houses.the camera followed a man, whose face was not shown, into a ramshackle building where steamers were filled with many fluffy white buns, the type traditionally stuffed with minced pork.the shirtless, shorts-clad man, believed to be the owner, apparently thought the reporter was a wholesale customer for the buns.when the reporter asked why cardboard filler was being used, the interview subject said it was done to lower costs.the man and a woman in the house then showed the reporter how the process worked.cardboard was soaked in water, and an industrial-use caustic soda, a poisonous chemical, was added. the cardboard lost its normal color, became softer and started to look more like pork."can customers recognize the cardboard?" the reported asked.the man replied, "most of them can't, as pork fat is stirred into the concoction to make the stuffing taste more authentic."when asked the proportion of the raw materials, the man said the mix was 60 percent cardboard to 40 percent pork fat.about 10 minutes later, steaming servings of the buns appeared on screen. the reporter took a bite."this baozi filling is kind of tough. not much taste," the reporter said. "do you eat them?"the man answered, "no.""most of my customers are residents in nearby areas," the man said. "it may save me almost 1,000 yuan (us$132) a day."it was unclear how long the booth had been serving the cardboard-filled dumplings. the kitchen was in nearby taiyanggong village, far enough away that customers couldn't discover the true nature of the dumpling ingredients.officials with the zuojiazhuang industrial and commercial administration closed down the kitchen yesterday and began questioning its landlord, according to the beijing times report.chaoyang district's industrial and commercial administration said it will inspect the district's 58 dim-sum restaurants to make sure similar shortcuts aren't being taken.pork prices in 36 major cities across the nation continued to rise last month due to a continuing supply shortage. http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/13/content_5434250.htm

1:49 pm - man calls 911 after subway left sauce off sandwich



jacksonville, fla. (ap) - jacksonville police say reginald peterson needs to learn that 911 is not the appropriate place to complain that subway left the sauce off a spicy italian sandwich.police said the 42-year-old man dialed 911 twice last week so he could have his sub made correctly. the second call was to complain that officers weren't arriving fast enough.subway workers told police peterson became belligerent and yelled when they were fixing his order. they locked him out of the store after he left to call police.when officers arrived, they tried to calm peterson and explain the proper use of 911. those efforts failed, and he was arrested on a charge of making false 911 calls.peterson did not have a listed phone number. http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=d92bl5fo0&show_article=1

3:52 pm - house wrecked as man kills weeds with flame thrower



berlin (afp) - a german gardener's house was left a smouldering wreck on friday after he set it on fire while trying to get rid of the weeds with the help of a flame-thrower, police said.advertisementafter accidentally setting his hedge alight, the 54-year-old's garden shed was soon also engulfed in flames and despite efforts to extinguish the fire with a garden hose, the blaze spread to the roof of the house.seven firemen were needed to put out the blaze in tangstedt near hamburg in northern germany, which occurred on thursday. police said the house was now uninhabitable.flame-throwers are used widely in agriculture and also in gardening, but generally only for removing weeds from between cracks in paving in driveways and patios.http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/090703/oddities/germany_offbeat_fire

1:39 pm - secret canada nuclear papers left in tv studio



ottawa (reuters) - senior canadian officials left a binder full of confidential nuclear documents in a television studio and made no attempt to retrieve them, the tv network involved said on wednesday.advertisementthe incident is likely to increase pressure on the minority conservative government, already under fire for its handling of the economic crisis. the main opposition liberal party said on tuesday it would decide next week whether to try to bring down the conservatives in parliament.the binder was found in a ctv television studio after a visit by natural resources minister lisa raitt. ctv, which kept the binder for six days before breaking the news, said the documents showed the government would spend far more money on a troubled nuclear reactor than it had acknowledged.the aging chalk river reactor in eastern ontario was shut down in may and will not resume production of medical isotopes for at least three months. it is run by government-owned firm atomic energy of canada ltd, which ottawa wants to sell to foreign firms.chalk river produces most of the isotopes distributed by mds nordion, a subsidiary of canadian health sciences company mds inc, and about a third of the global medical isotope supply.ctv said the documents showed the government would spend c$72 million ($66 million) more on chalk river this year than it had revealed in the budget. they also listed another c$100 million in supplementary funding to keep aecl solvent.the revelation is doubly embarrassing for ottawa, given that former foreign minister maxime bernier was forced to resign in may 2008 after leaving secret documents in the apartment of a girlfriend who had ties to organized crime.the nuclear documents included a note listing total spending on aecl since 2006 at c$1.7 billion and a memo characterizing this as "cleaning up a liberal mess". the conservatives took over from the liberals in early 2006.geoff regan, natural resources spokesman for the liberals, questioned how anyone could have confidence in raitt."it's extremely disturbing to think that they would leave these documents behind and then no one would go looking for them for days on end," he told the canadian broadcasting corp.no one from the offices of raitt or prime minister stephen harper responded to requests for comment.the liberals need the support of both of the other two opposition parties in parliament to bring down harper and that is by no means guaranteed.http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/090603/canada/canada_us_nuclear_4

5:10 pm - laid-off russian stuns doctors with drinking bout



moscow (afp) - russians are no strangers to vodka, but a binge by one laid-off factory worker who consumed an estimated eight bottles in a session had even seasoned doctors gasping in astonishment.sergei kondratyev, from yekaterinburg city, told the komsomolskaya pravda newspaper he had just been laid off and, feeling "awfully disappointed," headed to a grocery store for a bottle of vodka and two lumps of cream cheese.a friend soon joined the 32-year-old -- whom the newspaper noted was of large stature and thus presumably able to take his drink -- and after that, his recollection of events became hazy."we did the analysis and gasped.... according to the most modest estimate, this man drank no less than eight bottles," said the chief neurosurgeon at yekaterinburg's hospital number 23, stanislav chursin, commenting as his patient recovered from a coma."his blood contained, as a minimum, twice the deadly dose."the patient, described by the newspaper as clutching his head while he was interviewed, has vowed not to touch another drop.vodka in russia is typically 80 proof, or 40 percent alcohol, and sold in half-litre bottles (about 35 imperial ounces, 33.8 us ounces).http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/090428/oddities/russia_drink_health_economy_offbeat_1

5:25 pm - woody harrelson claims he mistook photographer for zombie



(cnn) -- woody harrelson defended his clash with a photographer at a new york airport wednesday night as a case of mistaken identity -- he says he mistook the cameraman for a zombie. the tmz photographer filed a complaint with police claiming the actor damaged his camera and pushed him in the face at la guardia airport, according to an airport spokesman."we're looking into this allegation and if it's warranted, we'll turn it over to the proper authorities," said port authority of new york and new jersey spokesman ron marsico.the photographer, who was not identified, captured the encounter on a small camera after his larger one was broken.harrelson, who is being sued by another tmz photographer for an alleged assault in 2006, did not deny his involvement."i wrapped a movie called 'zombieland,' in which i was constantly under assault by zombies, then flew to new york, still very much in character," harrelson said in a statement issued friday by his publicist."with my daughter at the airport i was startled by a paparazzo, who i quite understandably mistook for a zombie," he said.tmz.com posted two videos of the incident, including one recorded by the larger camera before it was damaged.the first video shows the photographer following harrelson and his daughter down an escalator and out of the terminal. it ends with harrelson apparently reaching for the lens. the second video begins with the photographer accusing harrelson of breaking his camera.after harrelson returns the camera to him, a scuffle appears to ensue."woody, this is assault. woody, this is assault," the photographer is heard saying. "woody, chill out. would you please chill out?"the photographer continues to follow harrelson for another four minutes as the actor and his daughter walk to the airport parking lot. at one point, harrelson again turns toward the cameraman."i'm being chased by woody harrelson while i'm talking to you," the photographer says as he talks to an unidentified person on a cell phone."he hit me in my face, he broke my friggin' camera, he broke the camera in pieces," he said.harrelson, his daughter and a driver get inside an suv and the encounter ends.in the movie "zombieland," harrelson plays "the most frightened person on earth" looking for refuge from zombies, according to the internet movie databasefilming on the movie wrapped in atlanta, georgia, on wednesday, according to director ruben fleischer's web site.tmz photographer josh levine filed a lawsuit against harrelson last year for an alleged attack outside a hollywood nightclub in 2006.video of that incident, which is also posted on tmz.com, also appeared to show harrelson grabbing a camera and clashing with the photographer.los angeles prosecutors declined to press charges against the actor, but levine filed a suit last summer asking for $2.5 million in damages."woody harrelson has a history of anger management issues with people and we intend to put a stop to this," cyrus nownejad, levine's lawyer, said friday.i'm not making this shit up:http://www.cnn.com/2009/showbiz/movies/04/10/woody.harrelson.zombie/index.html

1:42 pm - the most corrupt countries



by jack gage, forbes.comtuesday, march 24, 2009, provided by forbes.corruption is on the march. in 2008, the number of countries sinking deeper into the clutches of influence peddling, bribery and scandalous business dealings outpaced improvements by a 2 to 1 margin. countries falling by more than 10 spots outnumbered risers 8.5 to 1.chad leads the way down in this year's report. with a heavy reliance on foreign assistance (mostly for oil exploration and development), the sudanese neighbour gets black marks for corruption in the ranks of government officials—not surprising given its military dictatorship has been in place for 19 years.no. 2? the central asian nation of kyrgyzstan, where president kurmanbek bakiyev faces mounting opposition brought to a fevered pitch by recent allegations that his administration organized the assassination of a former administration official. others in the top 10 include azerbaijan, venezuela, cambodia and ecuador.in terms of economic impact, the debilitating affect of corruption is tangible: more than 5 per cent of global gross domestic product, or us$2.6 trillion, was smuggled, used for bribes or stolen from taxpayers in the past year, says the world bank in a recent report. for honest companies, moving from a low corruption climate to one where corporate and government misdeeds are more prevalent can represent as much as a 20 per cent additional tax on top of the normal costs of doing business.socioeconomic risk experts at the eurasia group also warn of corruption's corrosive effect on foreign investment. especially in times of sluggish economic activity—and in many developed nations, recession—the added drag of distrust on the part of investors and business owners can take a mighty toll."corruption is the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development," says fluor corp. (nyse: flr) ceo alan l. boeckmann in the report.nations with the highest risk of corruption are often the desperately poor, where foreign aid and assistance can easily be transferred through back channels of oppressive regimes. as a result, the impact of corruption can extend well beyond any economic detraction to affect the quality of life for millions of citizens."corruption is a major cause of many human rights abuses," says irene khan, secretary general of amnesty international, in a december 2008 report by watchdog transparency international.one example khan cites is zimbabwe, the poorest nation in the world at just us$200 of gdp per capita. the african nation fell 13 places among the 127 countries in our ranking, according to ti's perceived levels of corruption. recent reports accused president robert mugabe of stealing over us$7 million in foreign aid meant for the distribution of medicine to combat, among other diseases, widespread malaria in the region. instead, mugabe allegedly used the payments to fund political activities.even in developed nations, corruption can often occur in the procurement of government projects—and within established corporations. italy fell 12 spots in the corruption category after its government passed legislation granting top officials immunity from prosecution while in office. perhaps not coincidentally, prime minister silvio berlusconi had been involved in an ongoing investigation regarding the payment of more than us$500,000 from undisclosed funds to the husband of an olympic minister in the u.k.japan and canada were also cited in a 2008 report by transparency international as having sub-par enforcement standards vis-à-vis accepted g7 guidelines for bribes from foreign businesses. ti could find only one case in each country pursued by local authorities, compared with more than 40 investigations in germany, 19 in france and 16 in switzerland.industries can also be particularly prone to corruption, with greater levels of bureaucracy often increasing the likelihood of misuse. ti contends that public construction projects, water sanitation, oil and gas development and defence contracting most often show a proclivity for abuse of public and investor funds.http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/article/forbes/1034/the-most-corrupt-countries

12:55 pm - 10 kids at ark. daycare drink windshield wiper fluid mistaken for kool-aid



by jon gambrell, the associated presslittle rock, ark. - ten children drank windshield wiper fluid after a staff member at an arkansas daycare mistakenly put the liquid in a refrigerator thinking it was kool-aid and it was later served, hospital officials said friday.doctors estimate the children, ages two to seven, each drank about 30 millilitres of the fluid late thursday afternoon before realizing it tasted wrong, said laura james, a pediatric pharmacologist and toxicologist at arkansas children's hospital in little rock.only one child remained hospitalized friday morning, after blood samples showed "measurable levels" of methanol, a highly toxic alcohol that can induce comas and cause blindness, officials said."all we know was that the individual at the daycare had recently shopped and had come back to the daycare with a lot of different products," james told the associated press. "this product was mistakenly grabbed and thought to be kool-aid and put in the refrigerator."neither james nor officials at the state department of human service could immediately name the daycare in the community of scott, about 25 kilometres east of little rock. dhs spokeswoman julie munsell said investigators planned to visit the daycare friday."it has not been reported to us yet," munsell said friday morning. "either it happened and they didn't report as they should have ... or it happened after business hours."the children all were examined by doctors at the hospital and the day care provided a sample of the windshield wiper fluid for laboratory testing, james said.the toxicologist warned that many antifreeze or windshield wiper solutions have bright colours, which children can mistake for fruit drinks."i think the take-home message is not to have these products in the kitchen or where you're doing any kind of food preparation," she said. http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/090313/world/windshield_fluid_kids

3:01 pm - man dressed as santa claus found dead, suspected of killing three



a man wearing a santa suit who had been suffering marital problems opened fire at a christmas party at a house that then caught fire, leaving more than three people dead, authorities said thursday.hours later, police found the body of the suspect, bruce jeffrey pardo, 45, at the home of his brother in the sylmar area of los angeles. police said he killed himself but would not say how."he was going through some type of marital problems, and we believe that this residence is a relative's residence," lt. pat buchanan said.police initially said three people were dead in the shootings and fire late wednesday. ed winter of the los angeles county coroner's office said thursday that investigators sifting through the ashes of the house found more bodies, but would not say how many.the bodies were too badly burned to immediately determine whether they died in the shootings or the fire, winter said."we have multiple bodies inside," winter said. "they're extremely charred and burned."the gunman arrived at the party in covina late wednesday and immediately opened fire with a handgun, buchanan said. witnesses told police that the man took off the santa suit and left the scene of the burning house in street clothes.winter said the search through the destroyed home would take at least until the end of the day.jan gregory, a neighbour, said about 25 people were at the party when the gunshots rang out and people started running by the house.she said she saw a teenage boy run from the house screaming, "they shot my family."buchanan says three other people were injured. a woman in her 20s and an eight-year-old girl had gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening, and a third person had a broken ankle.police received several 911 calls with reports of shots fired at 11:30pm wednesday night, and were still hearing gunshots after they arrived and found the house in flames, buchanan said.at first, firefighters were held back by police because shots were still being fired, though it may have been ammunition burning in the blaze, fire captain mike brown said.firefighters had extinguished the blaze by about 1:30am thursday, fire captain mike brown said.the two-storey home on a cul-de-sac was destroyed in covina, a quiet suburb 40 kilometres east of los angeles. http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_30422.aspx
