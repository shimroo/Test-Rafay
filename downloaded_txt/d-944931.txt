although i have been coming to the u.s. since 2010, the asa-sponsored fellowship remains the most amazing period in all my visits to the u.s. for academic purposes. from the visa application process to the accommodations and other logistics, the asa secretariat was exceptional. i am most grateful to the african studies association and the african humanities program for this support.
