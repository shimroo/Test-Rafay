thoroughly modern marx : npr





thoroughly modern marx : npr"ironically, one of the most radical proposals making the rounds today has come from an economist at the london school of economics, willem buiter, a former member of the bank of england's monetary policy committee and certainly no marxist. buiter has proposed that the whole financial sector be turned into a public utility. because banks in the contemporary world cannot exist without public deposit insurance and public central banks that act as lenders of last resort, there is no case, he argues, for their continuing existence as privately owned, profit-seeking institutions.""instead they should be publicly owned and run as public services. this proposal echoes the demand for "centralization of credit in the banks of the state" that marx himself made in the manifesto. to him, a financial-system overhaul would reinforce the importance of the working classes' winning "the battle of democracy" to radically change the state from an organ imposed upon society to one that responds to it."

last exit magazine « prophet of profit





a quote attributed to karl marx has been haunting the internet.“owners of capital will stimulate the working class to buy more and more of expensive goods, houses and technology, pushing them to take more and more expensive credits, until their debt becomes unbearable. the unpaid debt will lead to bankruptcy of banks, which will have to be nationalised, and the state will have to take the road which will eventually lead to communism.” -karl marx, das kapital, 1867the last exit magazine and james ledbetter discuss how the quote is in fact not karl marx's:last exit magazine « prophet of profit
