one thousand years ago, the system for using notes to accurately record musical sounds was launched into the world. with it, people received the powerful ability to write down and read music.  the author of this project was guido of arezzo, an italian benedictine monk. thanks to the guido recording code, the musical language became written once and for all.











the development of polyphony and the wide distribution of keyboard instruments made guido’s musical notation difficult to read. instead of integrating the keyboard and music system into a single visual unit, the music industry has chosen a different path: the way of worshiping people with inborn talents. little mozart became an icon of this global approach. this approach empoverishes the rest of us.















it is our mission to restore guido’s vision for music that is easy to learn and share. to do this, we’ve developed visual music notation system that returns to its origins. even children as young as 2 can learn to play the piano and truly enjoy the experience. the life-changing experience of playing music should be available to anyone, and that’s exactly what the soft mozart program offers.
