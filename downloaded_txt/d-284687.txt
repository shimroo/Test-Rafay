frequently asked questions

we are an independent healthcare charity which for more than 55 years, has been advocating and caring for women and couples who decide to end a pregnancy.






are abortions funded by the nhs?












most women living in the uk (excluding northern ireland) can have their treatment paid for by the nhs or another government department (97% of bpas clients in 2018). check if this applies to you when you call 03457 30 40 30 to book.
if you are a european national currently in the uk but do not have access to nhs funding and are more than 10 weeks pregnant, please contact the abortion support network for advice on funding: www.asn.org.uk/
if you need to fund your own treatment click here for prices






how confidential is the service?












very – we understand the need for confidentiality and have a legal duty to protect your privacy. we keep information about you safe and secure. it’s usual for healthcare providers to inform gps that we have treated their patients - we will ask you if it is ok to contact your gp. click here for more information about your health records.






why do i have to give my personal details?












we collect the minimum information needed to treat you safely, legally and check if your treatment can be funded by the nhs. we protect all the information you give us and use it to deliver and improve care.








will abortion affect my ability to get pregnant in the future?












if your treatment is uncomplicated it won’t cause any issues with future pregnancies. there is no proven connection between abortion and future infertility, ectopic pregnancy or other pregnancy complications. abortion can be associated with future pregnancies ending before the due date; this risk increases with each abortion but the medical evidence is not enough to show a connection. we use evidence based information to provide you with all the information necessary to make the decision that is right for you. a healthcare professional will explain all the known risks and complications associated with your treatment choice.






does having an abortion increase my chance of getting breast cancer?












no - there is no proven link between breast cancer and abortion.






is abortion legal?












abortion is legal in england, scotland and wales providing it meets the terms of the 1967 abortion act. the law allows doctors to end a pregnancy if they believe that: 

continuing the pregnancy would be harmful to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children
 
an abortion would be less risky than continuing the pregnancy, or
 
there is substantial risk that if the child was born it would suffer mental abnormality or serious physical handicap.

two doctors must certify that the legal grounds for abortion are met, but do not have to meet the woman personally.
abortion care must be carried out in premises which are licensed with the department of health and which are regulated.  bpas provides abortion treatment up to 24 weeks.
when there is a substantial risk to the woman’s life, or a fetal (foetal) abnormality, there is no legal time limit for abortion. abortions after 24 weeks must take place at nhs hospitals. the charity arc antenatal results and choices provides information and support about fetal abnormality.
see www.bpas.ie for more information if you live in ireland.
