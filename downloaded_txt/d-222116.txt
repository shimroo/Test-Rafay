moreeidon's mushroomsfor optimal gut health and balanceshop now    why minerals are essential for optimal healththe elemental building blocks of the universe and everything in it, alive or not, are the mineral and gas elements we have currently identified and probably numerous others we have not discovered yet. yes, we are in fact a living assembly of all of these elements. new research is demonstrating that optimal health is directly dependent upon an optimal cellular balance of these minerals and gasses. as we are a combination of water and dust.the minerals play roles in structural support, energy production and proper cellular functioning acting as catalysts for all of the enzymes our cells continuously make in order to do their specific job.we do not make minerals internally and therefore must consume them either via the food we eat or water we drink.these sources have become so depleted, that it is virtually impossible to obtain the necessary amounts of minerals we need daily via our daily diets.maintaining good cellular levels of all the minerals is essential for optimal cellular and therefore organ functioning. this state yields optimal health.eidon provides a comprehensive list of known essential minerals in a liquid, easy to use format and a hair minerals analysis to guide you towards mineralibrium and optimal health.featured articlesthe calcium-silica
