established in 1948, the modesto gospel mission has provided services to poor and homeless people to meet both their tangible and spiritual needs for the last 75 years
the mission is able to serve some of the most broken people in our community by helping them get off the streets and radically change their lifestyles through a myriad of programs and services. we offer hope through the love of jesus in word and deed. the mission ministers to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of each guest. more than a food bank or soup kitchen, we provide daily shelter, clothing, meals, showers, bible studies, life skills classes, employment training and assistance, addiction recovery, a medical clinic, and more.
