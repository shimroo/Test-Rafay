the alberta teachers’ association respectfully acknowledges that we are located on treaty 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 territories—the travelling route, gathering place and meeting grounds for indigenous peoples, whose histories, languages, cultures and traditions continue to influence our vibrant community. we are grateful for the traditional knowledge keepers and elders who are still with us today and those who have gone before us. we recognize the land as an act of reconciliation and gratitude to those whose territory we reside on or are visiting.
