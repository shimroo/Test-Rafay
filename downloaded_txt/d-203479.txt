3 points you should negotiate when you are losing your job






3 points you should negotiate when you are losing your job






you work for a company that has been going through a lot of changes and upheaval.  word is going around about lay-offs and you worry you will be next. if you’ve been an exemplary employee and the lay-off is not because of anything you’ve done, be sure you ask these three questions as you are being handed your pink slip:



1. ask for a letter of reference.  you can use this to help you land that new job because it will be beneficial to have a letter that praises you and your accomplishments.  this will show future employers that your termination was a business decision and not because of any wrong-doing on your part. most people forget to ask about this, and it is difficult to try to go back later and ask for one. 



2. ask about severance pay. you are not automatically guaranteed this unless it was stipulated in your employment contract when you were hired.. typically, one week of severance is given for each year of service to the company, but this can be negotiable. and, especially if you’ve recently finished an important project, been honored or achieved a major goal, be sure to remind them.  it may buy you another week of severance pay they weren’t planning on giving.



3. are you entitled to unused vacation pay? in most cases, the answer is no. some companies allow you to roll over your unused time from one year to the next, while others have a use it or lose it policy. most companies will explain their rules in the employee handbook, but asking to be paid for your unused vacation pay just may earn you a few extra dollars you could use right now.



you may not get any severance or vacation pay, and you especially won’t if you don’t ask for it.  don’t forget, this is a very difficult situation for your boss, too, so he or she may be willing to give you more than had been planned on. you’ll never know unless you try, and the worst they can do is say no. if the moment passes, chances are you won’t have another opportunity to ask these questions again. knowing ahead of time what to ask for may give you the confidence to speak up for yourself at this difficult time.  good luck!

3 job search tips that increase your success






3 job search tips that increase your success






1) approach finding a job as if it were a full-time job, because it is. if you had a job, you would report to work at the same time each day (like 8 am), take an hour (or less) for lunch, and quit at the same time each day (like 5 pm). you would work five days every week. and you would work hard to accomplish as much as you could because your career depended upon it.



when you are searching for a job, you should follow the same type of schedule because your future depends upon it.



treating your job search like a part-time hobby guarantees that it will take longer.



so, begin tomorrow by reporting to work and spending the day on tasks that lead to a job.



2) approach finding a job as if it were a project. that means you should set goals for yourself, make plans, and monitor your progress. you should apply all of the tools and skills that you used in your last job to the project of finding your next job.



as you must expect, this is an important project. the sooner you complete it, the sooner you gain a promotion into a job.



3) be your own boss. set expectations for what you need to accomplish, provide direction, and monitor your work.



meet with yourself once each week to evaluate your performance. i recommend doing this by writing two reports. the first is a candid evaluation of what you accomplished during the previous week. the second is a description of your plans for the coming week. your plans should include your goals, actions, and priorities.



the first time that you write these reports, write an evaluation of what you have done so far. describe the results that this effort has produced. and compare these results with what you wanted to have.



next, map out a realistic plan for the next week based on achievable goals. for example, you could set goals for the number of people you will call, the number of networking meetings you will attend, and the research you will conduct.



in the coming weeks, compare the results that you obtained during the previous week with the goals that you set. for example, if you planned to attend twelve networking meetings and you attended only two, you should a) explain why this happened and b) plan actions that will correct such a difference. you should also analyze why you missed your goal because this provides insights on what you need to do differently. for example, your goal (e.g., of attending twelve networking meetings) may have been set too high. or maybe there are things you can do that will make it easier to achieve your job search goals, such as car pooling with a friend who is also looking for a job.



finding a job is a full time job. work through it with a plan and the support of a good boss (yourself).



i wish you the best of success.

"take this job and shove it" is a country song not a best practice






"take this job and shove it" is a country song not a best practice






"find a job you like and you add five days to every week." 

-h. jackson brown, jr. 



sometimes it's an easy choice to leave a company. however, one of the most important choices that you can make in your career is to leave your current employer in the right way. like any other relationship, there are faults and virtues with every company. at the end of a relationship, people tend to focus on the faults. 



breaking up is hard to do

when you leave a company, it is like breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend. regardless of how you do it, there will still be emotions. the longer the relationship, the deeper the feelings. keep this in mind during the separation. people express their emotions in different ways so be prepared to respond with compassion. 



it's a small world

i've learned first hand not to burn bridges. in fact, i was hired by my former boss within two years of leaving the company. he had moved onto a bigger job with another company and thought of me when a position came open in his department. since we already had a great relationship, the interview process was both short and painless. also, the job was a significant step up for me both professionally and financially. 



to do or not to do?

here are a few do's and don'ts that may help make the transition a little easier for everyone. 



do write and give a simple resignation letter to your immediate boss and, perhaps, your human resources director, if appropriate. by putting a few key items in writing, it memorializes your intention to leave the company. it also gives you a chance to pre-play the discussion with your boss. the letter should include the following: your last day on the job, open items that you need to complete prior to leaving, and any work that you will need to pass off to someone else. 



don't say anything negative about the company or anyone working for the company. while this is a good policy to employ at all times, it is even more critical when you are leaving. disgruntled employees may seek you out during this time to air their negative feelings about the company or people working for the company. resist the temptation to entertain these conversations. it is likely that your comments will be shared with others. 



do give as much advance notice as possible to allow for a smooth transition. typically, this is two to four weeks. use your best judgment to decide how long you will need to give keeping in mind what's best for the company. be aware that is also possible that the company will ask you to leave immediately, especially if you're going to work for a competitor. this is nothing personal and should not be considered an insult. 



do work hard until you leave. it's perfectly natural to get "short-timer's disease" as you have already mentally moved onto the new position. whether discussing movies, books, or relationships; people generally remember the beginning and end more than the middle. 



don't take anything that is not yours. whether it's a stapler, a book that belongs to the company, copy paper, or paper clips; leave them behind. while you're at it, tidy up a bit. 



do make yourself available for your replacement. if the company hires your replacement before you leave, offer to train them. even after you have departed, it's a good idea to leave a phone number where you can be reach with times that it is acceptable to call. 



don't abuse e-mail, the telephone, or the internet during your last days. be sure to keep your communication as professional as you have during your tenure. 



there's no reason that you still can't be friends when it's over. if you are careful to maintain a good reputation with the company, their suppliers, their customers, and employees; it will pay off considerably. it may not happen right away, but your paths will cross again.

new job blues ... now what?






new job blues ... now what?






you’ve landed what you thought was the job of your dreams. each stage of the interview went smoothly - you sold them on your skills and expertise, and your prospective boss sold you on the position and benefits of joining the company. he/she seemed excited about extending an offer. and then, with offer in hand, it was thrilling to give your notice (or tell your friends you’re finally employed after a long stint of unemployment!). all seemed right with the world.



you’ve now been on board a few days…  a week… perhaps even a month. suddenly you’re not so sure you’ve made the right decision. the job that seemed like a dream is starting to feel like a nightmare. perhaps the position isn’t what you thought it would be; it’s either too narrow, too broad, not challenging enough, or more of a stretch than you imagined. maybe the company isn’t measuring up. or, perhaps your boss isn’t the caring, supportive mentor you thought he/she would be. 



in a state of confusion, you wonder what you should do. stick it out? for how long? leave? then what? the decision to stay or leave a new job is a personal one, with no right or wrong answer, as everyone’s situation is unique. and most people, at one time or another, have been faced with this dilemma. to help you think through your next move and determine what’s right for you, here are some questions you may want to ask yourself:



is it just the newness of the job? changing jobs can be an unsettling experience. in your previous job, you knew your way around - you knew what was expected of you; you knew your job; you knew the players; you felt like you belonged. in a new job, however, it takes time to learn the ropes and feel like you’re truly adding value. sometimes it’s best to give yourself time to get over the “newness” and then decide if the job is right for you. 



can you live with your boss? hiring managers sometimes put their best foot forward in an interview, then do an about-face when a new employee arrives. even though your boss isn’t the supportive manager you thought he/she would be, can you live with the change? if so, it may be worth staying. if, however, you experience a nauseous stomach on monday mornings or a rise in blood pressure every time he/she walks into your office, it may be wise to consider leaving.



can you navigate the politics? office politics can be the bane of many employees’ existence. if you’ve been hired into a political crossfire, it will be important to assess your political skills to determine if you can make it work. if politics aren’t your strength, you may want to leave before you find yourself failing without even knowing why. if you’re good at developing relationships and working with differing styles, as well as “managing up”, you may want to consider staying and seeing if you can make a tough situation work.  



what will you learn if you stay in this job? sometimes a seemingly wrong job can turn out to be a terrific opportunity to learn new skills, become exposed to new technologies, and gain valuable experience. is it possible this job could be a stepping-stone to a better, more satisfying job down the road? could it ultimately propel your career forward? if so, and you can tolerate everything else, it may be worth staying.



if the scope of the job has changed, can it be renegotiated? if the actual work turns out to be far different from what you thought it would be, you may want to speak with your manager to see if aspects of the job can be changed. if the scope is too narrow, can more responsibilities be added? if the workload is too great, can you get some assistance? if the job ultimately represents a step backwards and/or you’re doing work you didn’t feel like you signed up for, it may be worth looking elsewhere.



can you afford to leave without another job to go to? if your boss, or the job, or the politics are so bad it’s beginning to affect your health and personal life, then leaving sooner rather than later may be the best move. but can you afford it? carefully evaluating your financial situation prior to jumping ship will help alleviate regrets later on. consider also the momentum you had in your job search prior to starting your job. can it be easily resurrected so your time of unemployment is minimized?



the decision to stay or leave an intolerable new job is a tough one. how long to stay is also a dilemma. many have left after two weeks, never to look back. others have stayed, only to regret staying too long. and still others have stayed and managed to make everything work out. only you can decide what’s best for you and your situation. 



if you answer the above questions honestly, you will surely make the right decision for you. pay attention to how you’re feeling and what the job is doing to your health and self-esteem. recognize that the longer you stay, the greater the requirement to add the job to your resume. know that it’s always an option to stay and look for employment on the side. if you do that, it may be valuable to evaluate your job, boss, team, and culture requirements so you can develop some insightful interview questions to ask the next time around.



talking with a trusted friend or colleague can be helpful during this challenging time. whether you choose to stick it out and hope for the best, or leave right away and cut your losses, trust that you’ve made the right decision. and know that regardless of the outcome, the experience has presented an excellent opportunity for learning and personal growth that will be invaluable in helping you manage the rest of your career.

if your resume is the cake, your cover letter is the icing






if your resume is the cake, your cover letter is the icing




cover letter writing is almost as important a skill for a job seeker to learn as resume writing.  the cover letter accompanies the resume at all times as the primary support document.  whether you use traditional mail, email, faxing, or another type of electronic submission, this should always be sent with the resume.  there are, of course, other tools you’ll use when job seeking.  your cover letter and resume come first of course, followed by follow-up letters, thank-you letters for after the interview, reference sheets, salary histories, and job acceptance letters.  if you have good cover letter writing skills, and good resume writing skills, the other written tools should be a snap to compose.



your goal in this is to get the attention of the hiring manager, just as it is with resume writing.  the method and format are a little different however.  your resume will cover all, or most of your professional career, and will be from one to two pages.  your cover letter will be a very brief page serving as an introduction to the resume.  cover letter writing style must be direct, to the point, and able to grab the attention of the reader quickly, with a goal of making the reader want to read the attached resume.



many people, when engaged in this type of writing, have a tendency to say too much.  good cover letter writing is short and punchy, and will take two or three key points from the resume and emphasize them.  the old adage “tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you told them” holds true in both resume writing and cover letter writing.



as an example, let’s assume that you are a materials handling manager for a defense contractor, seeking another position.  in your line of work the buzz words are mrp, lean manufacturing, iso 9000, and cost savings.  your writing efforts should reflect these buzz words to show your value to your current employer and any future employers.  your resume will go into more detail about how you accomplished these goals.  the cover letter will simply point out to the hiring manager that you accomplished them.    an example of this would be two bulleted paragraphs in the body of the letter that say….



• experienced in  quality assurance and quality control, mrp, iso 9000, qs 9000, and lean manufacturing.

 

• demonstrated results in saving significant money for employers through cost savings, inventory level reductions, and on-time supplier delivery.





the hiring manager, according to many surveys, devotes only about fifteen seconds to each resume and cover letter he or she reviews.  with that in mind your writing skills need to be top notch to get this person to look at your resume.  your resume writing skills need to be just as good to get the reader to want to grant you an interview.  in turn, your interviewing skills need to be excellent to get the hiring manager to offer you the position.  this long, and hopefully positive chain of events begins with good cover letter writing skills and ends with job satisfaction and a nice paycheck.

3 jobseeking ways to find a job faster






3 jobseeking ways to find a job faster




got a difficult problem in your job search?

 

say, a lack of networking contacts? or trouble answering interview questions?

 

well, you've got company. problems in a job search are as common as mosquitoes in july.

 

but ... have you ever written your problem down on a piece of paper?

 

i'll bet you haven't.

 

because, when you write problems down, you take an immediate, huge leap towards solving them. think about it: every great invention or solution, from the atomic bomb to the xbox, was first worked out on paper.

 

why not solve your employment problems the same way?

 

here's a three-step method that will help you do it ...

 

1) start by asking the right questions

most folks put themselves behind the eight ball in their job search by asking questions that are depressing and demotivating.

 

questions like, why won't anyone give me a job? or how do i network when i don't know anyone?

 

ack. pass the happy pills.

 

instead, start asking questions that motivate and inspire you.

 

better questions to ask are:

 

* how could i give people a reason to call me with job leads?

* how did my 10 closest friends find their current jobs? how could i brainstorm with them and use their methods in my job hunt?

* what worked in my last job search? the job search before? how could i do that again?

 

important: ask questions that you yourself can solve. never depend on the government, your school, parents, family -- anyone else -- to do this for you. because, once you give up responsibility for solving problems with your job search (or anything else), you become a prisoner of outside forces.

 

when you ask the right questions, however, you're halfway to the answer. so write down at least five empowering questions about your job search, right now.

 

then, you're ready for step two ...

 

2) brainstorm at least 20 possible answers

after you write down five good questions, circle the one question that looks most promising. you're going to use it to get hired faster.

 

let's say you write the following question down atop a clean sheet of paper:

 

how could i give people a reason to call me with job leads?

 

write a number 1 below it. write a possible answer next to that number. then move on to number 2, 3 . and don't stop until you have at least 20 answers to your question.

 

not 15 or 19, but 20 answers -- or more.

 

there's a reason for this: left to its own devices, your brain will pull a homer simpson after two minutes and try to talk you into going out for donuts or beer. brains hate to think. like bench pressing, thinking is strenuous work, no matter how good it may be for you.

 

but don't let your head off the hook. don't stop until you get 20 possible solutions. brainstorm as if your career depended on the outcome. because it does.

 

now. most of your 20 answers won't be very good -- that's ok. your best answer may come right after the most hare-brained. by forcing yourself to write out 20 answers, you're flushing the creative pipes while going deep into your subconscious mind to dredge up a winner.

 

don't knock it until you try it!

 

3) take action on one solution today

choose the most promising from your list of 20 answers. then, get started -- today -- to make it happen. no excuses.

 

let's say the most actionable of your solutions is to throw a networking party where you can meet friends, family and acquaintances, and let them know about your job search.

 

now. what do you need to do to make this party happen?

 

well, you have to make the guest list, send invitations, get the food, etc. so write down all the sub-goals necessary for the party to be a success. check each sub-goal off your list as you complete it. before you know it, your networking party will be a reality.

 

after that, take the next most-promising solution from your list of 20 and make that one happen. repeat until hired.

 

here's why these 3 steps work when it comes to solving problems -- clear thinking plus continuous action equals results.

 

if you're struggling to find a job, write down clear, empowering questions of your situation. then, brainstorm at least 20 possible solutions and take action on the best one today. when you do, you'll be that much closer to getting the job you really want, faster.

 

now, go out and make your own luck!

'excellence' program assists people with disabilities






'excellence' program assists people with disabilities

people with disabilities remain an untapped resource in the nation's work force, facing an unemployment rate of 70 percent.

nish, a nonprofit organization that helps secure federal contracts for agencies that employ people with disabilities through the javits-wagner-o'day program, is working to change the status quo. the organization has introduced a new program whereby agencies designated as "centers of excellence" serve as mentors to other agencies to help them improve the quality of the service and products they provide to the federal government.

the javits-wagner-o'day program is the largest single source of jobs in the u.s. for people with disabilities. often referred to as the jwod program, it provides employment opportunities for more than 45,000 people who are blind or have other severe disabilities.

through the jwod program, nish works with a network of more than 600 nonprofit agencies that employ and train people with disabilities.

the program stems from the wagner-o'day act, passed in 1938, which provided employment opportunities for the blind by allowing them to manufacture mops and brooms to sell to the federal government. in 1971, congress amended the act to include people with severe disabilities and to allow the agencies to provide services as well as products.

according to a recent harris interactive survey, two out of three people with disabilities who are not working want to work, but the lack of opportunities and accessibility issues prevent them from finding employment.
