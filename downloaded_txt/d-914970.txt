 utilising thirty years of hyperbaric experience 


breathing life into your future!
... using high-density oxygen as a prescription drug ...






hyperbaric oxygen therapy (hbot) is the medical use of oxygen at a level higher than atmospheric pressure. the equipment required consists of a pressure chamber, and a means of delivering 100% oxygen to body cells. hbot is recognized by medicare in the united states as a reimbursable treatment for 14 uhms ‘approved’ conditions.
china and russia treat more than 80 maladies, conditions and trauma with hbot.






growth and expansion mean new centers and offices are opening across the united states, australia, southeast asia and the united arab emirates.

lyme disease
there never has been a more important moment to drill down into cellular science and understand the diagnosis and defy the prognosis.
[read more ...]


stroke
 the usual gloomy prognosis offered by neurologists for stroke patients is now changing because of their ability to accurately assess damaged brain cells and target those cells that can be rehabilitated.
  [read more ...]


support for cancer patients
 when to ask your oncologist about hyperbaric oxygen therapy? immediately! however, such patients must remain under the care of the specialist oncologists.
  [read more ...]







disease and trauma to bones
 hbot is a most useful adjunct to the repair of broken or diseased bones and is helpful in the maintenance of bone health.

children with autism and other challenges
  each small patient with a health challenge is unique. their circumstances are idiosyncratic: no other child has an identical condition.
  [read more ...]


problem wounds
  in an aging population an increased number of patients are referred to wound-care centers with atypical wounds. pictures of clinical wounds appear on this page.

rapid healing for cosmetic surgery
 hbot is the rapid recovery tool that will accelerate  your return into your regular lifestyle, quickly getting rid of post-operative swelling and bruising.
  [read more ...]


toxic mold, fungus
  high density oxygen (aka hbot)  not only acts as a potent bactericide, it also becomes a potent antifungal. 
  [read more ...]


smoke inhalation, chemical poisoning
  prolonged exposure to unhealthy air can lead to respiratory and vision problems. large amounts of invisible carbon monoxide is a cellular poison... pure oxygen under pressure can help.[read more ...]






'hard' vs 'soft' chambers – 
which is right for you?
inflatable chambers (mhbot aka mild hyperbaric therapy or soft chambers) vs hospital grade chambers (hbot aka hard chambers).
we asked one of our science and advisory board members, robert l. sands, for his opinion on the zippered urethane inflatable chambers, now becoming popular in the united states and elsewhere.
