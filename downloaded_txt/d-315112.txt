          we at skytribe not only create affordable paramotors but we take exceptional pride in what we do, be it our cars or our motor bikes. each one of our customized machines are created to turn heads where ever they go and we also have a reputation of telling it how it is. we dont sell you a concept or a product because its in our own interest to do so. we are not agents for any brand or design so unlike many schools we find the best application for each and every client. 
you do not have to spend thousands on equipment to fly. you can build your own ppg safely from go cart engines and motor bike engines and we can show you clients that   have successfully done this. and yes they do fly at elevated areas and you do   not need a min of 25hp to fly at johannesburg! 
 download the brochure.it is not very large and it will provide you heaps of information that you probably will not be told   anywhere else.

usually a standard paragliding 
  canopy may be used and simply clipped into our design. a forward 
  or reverse 
    take-off may be used depending on the weather 
  conditions. apart from the engine, 
  set up paramotors are available with various exhaust systems, four and two 
  piece cages, single and double outer rings and various tank sizes. 

unlike conventional paragliding high 
        performance wings are no longer needed, and lower aspect ratio wings may 
        readily be used. as the pilot is not relying on the glider now to carry 
        him to the next thermal, he simply applies power and flies along, older 
        safer canopies may be utilised
conventional high performance paragliders may 
        be used, however as with all competition wings, take care. 
railway pub crawl with a difference.
