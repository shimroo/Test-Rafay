yule



the celebration of yule in northern europe harks back to a transition from ancient pagan germanic culture to the more formal spirituality of the newer christian rite. christmas, as we mostly now call it, gave us hymns, processions and chants, and in between, silence in church. yule meant a vibrant pre-christian secularity, with feasting and dancing, the noise of instruments and decorating the house with holly, ivy and mistletoe as a tribute to the gods of earth and air. much of the music on this album dates from an earlier time when in a throwback to yule churches were decorated with christmas greenery, and at home there would be carols sung round a burning yule log, the two traditions side by side. but the songs on this album are contemporary performances, a matrix where acappella voices meet improvising instruments in a synthesis of secular and sacred.featuring artists: sinikka langeland, kantelevegar vårdal, hardanger fiddle and fiddlearve henriksen, trumpet and organanders jormin, double basshelge andreas norbakken, percussionmorten lindberg, balance engineer and recording producer

trio mediæval's collection of hymns and lullabies — intimate songs as old as time and as new as tomorrow: this is music with no boundaries, celebrating our common humanity. we'll never know the first song or the first singer, and we'll never know what they sang about. but if time could unwind and we could hear it, perhaps we would witness a mother or a father singing the first lullaby. when we sing a hymn or a lullaby we become a link in a chain that began in the unknowable past and will stretch into the infinite future: a timeless continuum of solace and comfort.the new lullabies by anders jormin and sinikka langeland began in their heads as little musical gifts for real children, and are here sung for all of us by three singers who have sung many a lullaby to their own children, aided and abetted on this album by trygve seim, and mats eilertsen, fathers both.
