about camp
















testimonials




this will be my eighth summer at ekc and the friendships i’ve made with campers and counselors, both in pittsburgh and out-of-town, are friendships that will last a lifetime. the memories i’ve made with them at this camp will be with me forever.

- ekc camper




the positive impact ekc has had on my two sons: not only do they have a ton of fun and cannot wait to go back year after year, but they have become more confident, independent and happier kids. they make friends from different states, try new adventures and they learn how to get out of their comfort zone by being away.
these are all good life skills that will be with them for the rest of their lives!

- robyn friedberg, fox chapel, pa
