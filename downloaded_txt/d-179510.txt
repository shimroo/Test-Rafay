welcome











the department of kinesiology relocated because "we're getting new digs!"
while construction on our new home takes place on the former site of mccarthy gymnasium (groundbreaking fall 2023), we will temporarily be housed in two separate buildings.
sport administration, physical education and coaching, some exercise science offices and the main office will be in rice hall (180 magruder st. mississippi state university, ms 39762).
the exercise science labs and some offices will be in 299-3, 299-9, and 299-10 morrill rd. mississippi state university, ms 39762.
we appreciate your support throughout this transitional period, and look forward to a bright future in the jim and thomas duff center which is currently scheduled to open in the fall of 2025.

kinesiology is an integrative discipline that focuses on the various components and processes of human movement related to physical activity and sport. it incorporates scientific, humanistic and professional research methodologies and concerns so as to better understand physical activity and its relationship to human well-being, health and culture. scientific areas include anatomy, physiology, neuroscience, biochemistry, biomechanics, psychology, and epidemiology. humanistic areas include history, philosophy and sociology.  kinesiology also includes professional fields such as clinical exercise physiology, physical education and coaching, athletic training and sport administration.
the mississippi state university department of kinesiology is housed within the college of education and features numerous exceptional areas of study for graduate and undergraduate students. undergraduate students can choose one of six concentrations: clinical exercise physiology, neuromechanics, strength and conditioning, sport administration, physical education and coaching, and physical activity and coaching. graduate students at the master's level can choose sport administration, sport pedagogy, disability studies, or exercise physiology (clinical exercise physiology or strength and conditioning). ph.d. students can choose exercise science or sport studies (physical education, sport philosophy, sport communication, sport administration and marketing).
the department of kinesiology is in the business of education. but education is not to reform students nor amuse them nor make them expert technicians. it is to unsettle their thinking, broaden their horizons, stimulate their intellects, develop skills, arouse their curiosity, and create in them a love for physical activity. if you are interested in this type of education then stop by for a visit and learn more about our department.
