procedures



  











plastic surgery is a very broad field and covers almost all areas of the body from head to foot literally. it is not possible to explain every possible procedure that could be performed. if you have an area of concern that you would like to improve it is quite possible that dr. green with his ability to innovate will be able to help you.

breast surgery
for women that spend years unhappy with small or asymmetrical breasts, breast augmentation with implants is a very gratifying procedure. implants add beautiful shape and volume to naturally small breasts and produce a classically feminine and busty appearance.



















liposuction & fat grafting
body contouring with liposuction or fat grafting is a wonderful option for individuals that struggle with stubborn excess fat. modern technology enables plastic surgeons like dr. rodney green to carefully remove the fat and improve the contour in that area of the body. the result is a more proportional and attractive body shape, which has psychological benefits, too.



















surgical facial rejuvenation
a facelift, or face lift, is a well-known operation to restore the youthful appearance of the face and neck. this operation has undergone many changes over the years and the focus has been on achieving a natural result without the stigmata previously associated with this operation and which are commonly noted in many celebrities.





















calf implants
calf implants are specially designed solid silicone implants that are placed underneath the fibrous tissue surrounding the calf muscles. typically, two calf implants are inserted in each calf to mimic the shape of the normal calf muscle.



















abdominoplasty
this surgery is designed to restore an attractive abdomen shape after events such as pregnancy or massive weight loss. tummy tuck is typically recommended when diet and exercise cannot improve the abdomen’s contour.



















non-surgical nose job
this is not really a rhinoplasty as such. temporary changes in the shape of the nose can be accomplished by injecting fillers such as juvaderm®. this is useful when the nose has a deficiency. this technique only allows the addition of volume but not subtraction of course.
