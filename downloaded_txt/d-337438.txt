bicentennial drug lordbdl
based in milwaukee, wi, bicentennial drug lord was formed when longtime friends john daniels (soda, maki), rick donner (punchdrunk) and alan weatherhead (soda, maki, sparklehorse, hotel lights) needed a side project where, as weatherhead puts it, “we could play and record the sad-sack country songs we wrote and couldn’t play in our main bands.” bdl’s debut record the first hit is free crystallized a minneapolis winter with music that could thaw even the iciest heart. for it’s new release, the six song ep bdl, the band got together during a long, muggy summer to record the songs in a cottage outside of richmond, va.  emerging from a weekend writing session at a nearby horse farm where daniels was living, the new songs reflect a fresh collaborative approach to songwriting and a shift away from the country focus of their debut. bdl gets the details right.  big choruses, subtle songwriting, indie pop in places with a dose of 70’s rock.  summer’s coming down.listen on bandcamp >>

j.b. mills presentsthe beetroot instrumentals
the beetroot instrumentals is the second collection of music to be released by brooklyn-based drummer/multi-instrumentalist jason b mills under his producer alias “j.b. mills”. for this ep, mills pulled some previously unfinished instrumentals from the vault. these are all songs that were originally written for his independent music awards-nominated band “beetroot”, who were a fixture on the nyc club scene in the early 2000s, but were never graced by (beetroot vocalist) fiona’s voice. deciding that they were too good to remain “unfinished”, he dusted them off, rearranged, and remixed them in the summer of 2020 at his “little house music studio” in brooklyn, ny. think king tubby meets the meters at a dc go-go club…. the lineup includes: derek nievergelt-bass; dave guy-trumpet; james hurt-keys; wynne bennett-keys; marivaldo dos santos-percussion, programming; jason mills-drums, percussion, guitar, additional bass, additional keys, samples & production. buy on bandcamp >>

two dark birds + j.b. millsporous
porous is the fifth release from two dark birds, the critically acclaimed band from the catskills. this four song ep, a collaboration between singer-songwriter steve koester and producer / dummer j.b. mills, is a distinct departure from the band’s previous more folk- leaning forays. sonically speaking, porous delves into the minimalist sounds of today’s pop and yesterday’s wave. it’s more j. dilla than j.j. cale, more new order than new riders, more billie eilish than billy bragg, more drake than nick. or something like that. lyrically speaking, the songs center around the usual subjects - love, family, nature, space-travel, roof-sitting, interdependent co-arising, bar hookups.buy on bandcamp >>
