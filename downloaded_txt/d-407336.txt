the barnstormers, located in the scenic village of tamworth, nh, is one of the longest-running professional summer theatres in the country. the company was founded in 1931 by francis cleveland, the youngest son of president grover cleveland, francis’s wife alice and their friend ed goodnow – all of whom were involved with theatre on broadway.  over eighty years later, their legacy continues.today, the barnstormers is one of three equity theatres in new hampshire and provides the region with brilliant summer theatre.like most theatres nationwide, ticket sales cover only about half of income needs, so every gift to the barnstormers is greatly appreciated.  
















mission statementto keep vital the value, spirit, and tradition of fine summer theatre in tamworth and to provide a venue for and to promote varied cultural activities within the region.





























our creative work is made possible by:our executive councilor, and our district’s members of the new hampshire legislature for their support of public funding for the state arts council, which made this grant possible.the haynes family foundationmadelaine g. von weber trustnh state council on the artsnh charitable foundation, francis & alice cleveland fund national endowment for the artsroyal little family foundationthe nancy peery marriott foundationgenerous contributions from the barnstormers theatre board of directorsdonors and patrons like you!
