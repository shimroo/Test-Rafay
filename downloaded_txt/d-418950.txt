“i was introduced to artisan more than a decade ago as part of a very challenging azeotropic separation challenge and quickly realized the value of artisan’s business model to help solve the toughest thermal separations problems. what makes artisan unique is their ability to help their customers conceptualize a potential solution, pilot that solution on a very short timeframe, and ultimately deliver a commercial scale equipment solution; they can pilot and test when all other oems cannot. since 2012, we have leveraged artisan to solve over a dozen different process technology challenges, all with unique solutions that have reduced operational expense, improved product quality and streamlined the overall process. artisan occupies a unique place in the chemical industry as a small oem that punches well above their weight class.”
mark barkett, lssbboperations technology manager | dover chemical corporation
“we have had the pleasure of working with artisan for the last 30 years on over 15 different projects. artisan’s thin film technology and experienced engineering staff helped us achieve lower residuals than the rest of the industry, allowing our company to experience explosive growth. as the world moves toward higher purity intermediates, we know we can rely on artisan’s highly dedicated pilot testing staff to push the limits of what was previously thought possible.”
celanese chemicalscelanese chemicals“i felt like the entire testing group was genuinely interested in satisfying my process needs and getting the desired end product.” “several conditions were tried to get the desired outcome, which provides insight on the equipment capabilities.”
mike leamen, phd, p.eng.director of engineering | strenna industries“everything we wanted to do was done and much was learned about the process/equipment.” “pilot operations made it work. without them it would have been inefficient and costly.”
jason danaprocess engineer | caravan ingredients“we chose artisan because they were knowledgeable and because they had a pilot plant that could prove the process before we scaled up to production.”
