âmay grandmothers for peace be the light in the darknessâ

this has been the most difficult newsletter to put together since i became director in 2001. we as an organiza- tion marched in the streets, stood on street corners, flooded congress with calls, letters and personal visits all with various issues, each time trying to make a better, safer world for the future. with the current administration and the crew supporting him so much has been destroyed or âexecutive orderâ out of existence â for now. yet, there can be hope for a grand rising of consciousness and intense participation in the voting process.
our headline quote comes from a grandmother for peace in santa cruz, california. she called to order several buttons, as she has before, and gives out at various events. she quietly spreads peace. as we spoke, she said those words. she does not use a computer and doesnât take pictures at the actions. but each time i talk to her i admire her dedication. we all work in our own way.

help the environment and gfp!
 let's try to help the environment, and collectively we can have an impact. we are dedicated to help stop the growth of the great pacific garbage patch and reduce our landfills. the island of mostly plastic in the pacific is estimated to be twice the size of texas. it kills wildlife and pollutes our oceans. you can help! just two less plastic grocery bags a week, 8 per month, 96 per year for 1,000 of us would keep 96,000 bags out of the landfills. peace comes in many ways, not just the absence of war. step by step, we can do this. continue, and never give up! join or renew today


the starfish flinger
as the old man walked down the beach at dawn, he noticed a young man ahead of him picking up starfish and flinging them into the sea. finally catching up with the youth, he asked him why he was doing this. the answer was that the stranded starfish would die if left until the morning sun.
âbut the beach goes on for miles and there are millions of starfish,â countered the other. âhow can your effort make any difference?â the young man looked at the starfish in his hand and then threw it to safety in the waves.
âit makes a difference to that one,â he said.


military recruitment opt-out form online
federal public law 107110, section 9528 of the esea, âno child left behind actâ requires school districts to release student names, addresses, and phone numbers to military recruiters upon their request. the military uses this information to recruit students. the law also requires the school district to notify you of your right to opt-out from this by requesting that the district not release your information to military recruiters.
although schools provide this information as required by law, it is frequently buried within the pages of student or parent handbooks and no form is provided to facilitate opting-out. please read and redistribute our booklet containing information about military recruitment in our schools; an opt-out form is included:

our beloved founder, barbara wiedner 1928-2001
barbara wiedner
on december 2nd, 2001, sunday evening, founder and director of grandmothers for peace barbara wiedner left this earth. we mourn her death, but rejoice in the legacy she has left for all of us.
barbara was working on, but never finished, a farewell message to her beloved organization. she was most concerned that the group would continue. it will continue â with help from those that wear the gfp shirt, you reading this, our supporters, and future members.
there will always be a grandmothers for peace, because it is now beyond an organization. it is a movement. while we still long for a peaceful world, barbara is truly a grandmother at peace.
with love and sadness, lorraine krofchok
