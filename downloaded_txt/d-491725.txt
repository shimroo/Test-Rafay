    talbot: quotes



"my artistic process is informed by my experience as a parent and grandparent. rather than attempt to predetermine the direction or final form of my works, i nurture them and help them become what they wish to become. when things go well, the works take on lives and personalities of their own and i learn from them." 
 

– jonathan talbot, 2019. 


		  "life is a do-it-yourself project. you can't hire anyone to do it for you. when you don't have the tools you need, it’s up to you to get them. when you don’t have the skills you need, it’s up to you to learn them. when you encounter obstacles, it’s up to you to overcome them. and when you need help, it’s up to you to ask for it. if you do these things, and if you celebrate both your own skills and the skills of others, then your life will be an authentic part of the world-wide do-it-ourselves project called civilization."
