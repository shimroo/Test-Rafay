roy sakuma ukulele studios is
                  hawaii’s foremost ukulele school with four locations on oahu.
                  since 1974, the roy sakuma method of teaching has brought the joy of music to
                  thousands of children and adults of all ages.
                  roy sakuma is recognized as
                  hawaii’s authority on ukulele instruction
                  and proponent of the ukulele.
                



 



 

in the 1960′s, as america’s youth latched onto the larger, louder, more swaggering
                    guitar, the little instrument from hawaii was relegated to the attic. roy knew the instrument’s
                    true worth. and so for over the past 30 years, with his wife kathy, and their staff of instructors
                    and supporters, his mission has been to spread the joy of the ukulele teaching students and promoting the annual ukulele festival, the largest ukulele festival
                    of its kind in the world.
the ukulele has come a long way. it’s cool to play the ukulele. youngsters jam at school
                    between classes, at the park and the mall.the ukulele embraces everyone who hears it.
as roy sakuma understood decades ago, that’s the irresistible charm of the ukulele.
