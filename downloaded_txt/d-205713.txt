interactive map: isis global activity



under the leadership of jihadism scholar aaron zelin, a team of researchers at the washington institute has built the islamic state select worldwide activity map, an interactive tool that provides a more accessible way to search, track, and understand the organization’s global reach. it represents the most comprehensive public archive of the group’s attack data, media output, government designations, and legal cases — information that is becoming invaluable as is affiliates disperse into a wider range of jurisdictions and the u.s. government continues shifting resources away from the global counterterrorism fight.
