there are only a few book left from my very limited edition of 250.  it honors the work i did and the friends who had a great time watching me.  the sounds of glasses and plates, laughter and silence were a powerful force behind me every month.





the sole mission of art for godis to reflect the life and teachings of jesus of nazareth in the 21st century. we neither criticize nor promote any denomination or religion.art for god exists to show the eternal master, jesus of nazareth, in a way that depicts his holiness, kindness, humility, unselfish love, strength, beauty, and his eternal relationship with us in this present moment. people need to remember jesus laughing and jesus smiling. contemporary christian art has a huge responsibility and art for god accepts that challenge.the life and teachings of jesus are for everyone who lives, has lived and ever will live. the gospel presented by jesus is that god is a loving and merciful heavenly father and accepting this truth allows us to love and serve one another as he served and continues to serve and love us.there is no greater opportunity to live in the presence of god than to serve others with a glad heart.
