twincast / podcast episode #369 "gattai-funding"
gattai-funding  - it’s time once again for the seibertron twincast podcast to take an in depth look at the latest transformers haslab. the reveal of a haslab liokaiser combiner as well as the first deathcobra toy starts the discussion with the group providing their opinion on the potential upcoming figure as well as its crowdfunding goals and tiers. toy discussion continues with looks at upcoming age of the primes heatwave and skybyte releases. hearts of steel exclusives that were also revealed by the brand team are talked about next, followed by earthspark deluxe class figures of soundwave and hashtag, as well as the gimmick toy swapticon line. bragging rights closes the show with each cast member sharing their most recent transformers related product acquisitions.                

 




twincast / podcast episode #368 "paint by numbers"
paint by numbers  - a catch-up on transformers toy news items is in order for episode 368 of the seibertron.com twincast / podcast, beginning with the generations selects titan class redeco of trypticon. in-hand images from one of the designers of the smaller upcoming titan star convoy prompt more discussion on that before several smaller releases are talked about, including an amazon 2-pack and several studio series items such as age of extinction optimus prime and que from dark of the moon. takara tomy's revealed items from a recent t-spark themed event are next, with amt predaking, missing link arcee and mpg nucleon quest convoy analyzed. kotobukiya's upcoming optimus prime girl model kit is next up in the chat, with mpg rattrap leading in to bragging rights, which conclude the episode.                

 




twincast / podcast episode #367 "2024 year in review"
2024 year in review  - episode 367 of the seibertron.com twincast podcast is the first show of 2025, but it provides a lookback at the best and worst of 2024 in our annual superlatives episode. the show begins with the best transformers toy of the year, objectively - independent of any sentimental value or emotional connection, what toy takes the top spot? this is followed by the subjective best toy of the year from the main collector lines (i.e. legacy, studio series, masterpiece) as well as choices for favorite toy outside the mainstream. the show pivots slightly to favorite media of the year, and the cast is torn between transformers one and the studio trigger 40th anniversary pv. we take a turn for the worst - worst toy of the year, that is, followed by the worst of anything else that isn't a toy. the cast ends this 2024 look-back with a look inward at their greatest collecting achievement of the year. as we do every year, the twincast makes two predictions: each cast member makes an obvious prediction, alongside a prediction that is much more of a reach. we end the episode with our regular bragging rights segment, where each cast member reviews what they've acquired since the last episode.                

 




twincast / podcast episode #366 "swap meet"
swap meet  - the final 2024 episode of the seibertron.com twincast / podcast starts out with a speculative discussion about the leaked upcoming swapticons which, in the presence of sparse actual information, evolves into a deeper look at the appeal of the transformers brand for younger audiences and its place in the current media landscape. after that, a listener question about pretenders sparks a look back at that gimmick of the past, with forward thoughts about how it could possibly be revived for today's market. the final installment of "40 for 40" has the crew looking back to the recent history of 2023 before the regular recurring "bragging rights" segment closes the show with the cast sharing their most recent transformers toy and product acquisitions.                

 




twincast / podcast episode #365 "13 and me"
13 and me  - the seibertron.com twincast / podcast returns to discuss the recent cybertron con reveals for the upcoming generations age of the primes series.  discussion starts with star convoy reimagining the titan class before hammering away at the other reveals such as solus prime, wasp and g2 grimlock, among others. a new set of aerialbots and their main torso bot silverbolt receive some additional consideration before the toy talk moves on to the sonic and tails collaborative figures. the recurring "40 for 40" segment reminds the cast of the best toys of 2022. finally, "bragging rights" closes out the show in the usual fashion.

takara tomy delays 40th selection lio convoy to undetermined date posted 1 hour ago by emerje - 571 views
new! if you were looking forward to getting the updated t-spark transformers 40th selection lio convoy at the end of february i'm afraid i have some bad news. reddit user electronic_zombie360 made the claim sunday that the figure had been delayed along with a low resolution and unreadable screen cap supposedly stating it was due to a factory misassembly that was caught. this appears to have been corroborated by amiami who sent out an email on monday stating the figure has been delayed to a yet to be  - read more
video review for transformers crossovers star wars the mandalorian posted 18 hours ago by william-james88 - 4,949 views
fans are getting their online orders fulfilled for the transformers crossovers star wars the mandalorian figure. and we now have a review from chuckdawg1999. while it has appeared at walmart in the us, sightings have been very sporadic and happen to be now that people are getting their orders, so it's unclear if it is available across the us or we are just seeing returns. for those unsure if this toy is for you, especially with that price in mind, this review is for you.

haslab liokaiser minimum funding goal has been achieved before orders open in japan posted 18 hours ago by william-james88 - 4,792 views
as predicted yesterday, the us/canada market alone bringing the haslab liokaiser halfway to being funded did indeed mean that the main goal would be achieved when lumping in the international orders. it turns out china alone added an additional 5000 orders, confirming that liokaiser was going to happen. however, it is yet to be fully funded, since there are still all the extra tiers to unlock. the crazy thing is that orders haven't gone up in japan yet. as of right now, there are 11380 backers  - read more
rumour: hasbro to bring made to order business model to transformers line posted 2 days ago by william-james88 - 23,264 views
the fact that this is a rumour cannot be stressed enough, there is currently no identifiable source for this, just info from the online "leaker" community, which was told to us from a fan wishing to remain anonymous. however, this does line up with what hasbro has been doing in other lines and is also in line with their current business model of making less toys than before, as we described in an editorial a month ago.

for those unaware, hasbro has been making "made to order" figures in  - read more
new images of studio series 86 constructicons show size comparisons with aotp aerialbots posted 3 days ago by william-james88 - 19,752 views
scale is a big topic of discussion among transformers fans and while no scale will please everyone, we at least want to know what to expect. so hopefully these images will help some fans. below we can see our first two consttucticons against our first two aerialbots. while one of the constructicons being a voyager might make you think they are all big deluxes, please remember that the aerialbots are as tall as the stuncticons. so everyone in the image is standard deluxe height. the images are  - read more
latest preorders on pulse include hearts of steel pack, silver rathalos prime and nucleon quest convoy posted 3 days ago by william-james88 - 16,443 views
this is more of a friendly update for those who were unaware. hasbro pulse has put up preorders for several of the latest reveals. the hotter one would be the pulse exclusive hearts of steel 2 pack featuring optimus prime and starscream. it is $59.99 for 2 deluxe sized toys. they also have the monster hunter crossover figure silver rathalos prime for $54.99. this is also a deluxe sized figure as it is a very heavy retool of kingdome airazor. the third preorder we wanted to bring to your  - read more
haslab transformers liokaiser is already halfway to funding goal after 1 week posted 3 days ago by william-james88 - 15,127 views
good news to those hoping that haslab transformers liokaiser gets to happen, because at this rate it is sure to be funded. without the addition of international numbers, the haslab has reached 5000 orders after just a week of being live. he might be funded already, if the international numbers match the domestic numbers. speaking of which, liokaiser became available in singapore, mexico, australia, china and korea within this past week. of course, it is unknown if all tiers will be reached, but  - read more

first look at onyx prime and alchemist prime toys box art from transformers age of the primes posted 4 days ago by william-james88 - 31,775 views
this was unexpected, while megacon gave us a great first look at the upcoming age of the primes (aotp) heatwave and skybyte (preorder links below), we now have a look at alchemist prime and onyx prime's box art. onyx prime is done in fiery orange with a winged robot mode that does indeed have four legs. alchemist is not as clear to see but he does have a mustache. there is also the box art for upcoming studio series figures like tf one deluxe starscream and elita 1 along with wfc voyager  - read more
siege sets reissued of phantomstrike with skywarp and alphastrike with g2 sideswipe posted 7 days ago by william-james88 - 41,256 views
we thank o.supreme for letting us know that there are some great preorders available now. just to give you an idea of how momentous this is, this is a toy that was selling for $350 usd plus shipping on e-bay just last week, as we can see in the thumbnail.

twincast / podcast episode #369 "gattai-funding" posted 9 days ago by scottyp - 40,832 views
the dust has settled. the dozens of wrong predictions are in the past. the speculation can end. finally, a new episode of the seibertron.com twincast / podcast has arrived! oh, and there's this haslab liokaiser thing happening too. not sure if you heard about it, but if you haven't, scotty p, aaarnhide19 and kuhlio are going to spend a bunch of time discussing it on this episode. all that other stuff from megacon 2025 comes up too, it's a pretty good time.

2025 megacon hasbro panel videos and breakdowns posted 10 days ago by sabrblade - 53,329 views
video of the hasbro pulse panel at megacon:



sounds like the video missed the liokaiser reveal part of the panel as the beginning of the video sees them talking about liokaiser like they've already shown it off. they also keep mispronouncing his name as "leokaiser" instead of "liokaiser".

sky-byte is very articulated in shark mode, they wanted to replicate his cartoony "muppet" qualities from the cartoon.

heatwave is a "partial" of legacy bulkhead. the fact that the mold looks like  - read more
transformers hearts of steel optimus, starscream, bb and megatron revealed + heatwave and skybyte posted 11 days ago by william-james88 - 57,834 views
megacon had some beautiful reveals today for transformers fans. not only did we get the haslab announcement but that liokaiser is available to back now. the order only goes through after the backing period is over so placing an order now is no different than placing an order in two weeks.
but back to the reveals, we got a look at the 4 hearts of steel toys. they come in two packs of optimus/starscream and bumblebee/megatron. we also got a good look at age of the primes skybyte (new mold) and  - read more
transformers victory liokaiser haslab live with 3 unlockable tiers posted 11 days ago by glyph - 48,534 views
via ign @ msn, confirmation that liokaiser will be the next haslab figure!

from the renders, it looks like the set will include not just the core 6 members of the team with their respective breastforce chest-force animal partners, but also the first official toy of deathcobra. the product images show deathcobra forming a shoulder-mounted weapon for liokaiser, and the haslab page confirms that he will also be able to take hellbat's place as the left arm.

the haslab page is now live with a  - read more
pictorial review for transformers swapticons wild jungle mission 5-pack posted 13 days ago by william-james88 - 55,758 views
pixelmaster posted a pictorial review about the new swapticon 5 pack what includes optimus primal, apelinq, gator megatron, skullcruncher and scorponok.
we also have additional pictures from cybeast.

only set of swapticons that came out in retail here. it goes for 199 hkd here (25.54 usd in the exchange as we speak), but for some magical reason there was a discount so i only paid 139 hkd (17.84 usd). as the gimmick suggests, this is just a kiddy version of the deleted baboon-cat hybrid  - read more

first look at 2 new deluxe earthspark toys: soundwave and hashtag posted 17 days ago by william-james88 - 73,153 views
looks like earthspark is going out with a bang as hasbro will be releasing 2 new molds for their deluxe line up: soundwave and hashtag. unlike what may be reported elsewhere, hashtag is not a rerelease of the takara retool, it simply looks the same at first due to the fact that the toys represent the same character in her season 2 alt mode. soundwave is a nice blend of the g1 character and his cybertron self. his calves are turned so that they can fit in the box, his legs will look sleeker when  - read more

carnage creations sent us a review of the upcoming transformers one studio series bumblebee deluxe toy. there has been a lot of discussion as to which toy one would keep in their collection between this new one and the prime changer we got in the movie line last year. while the studio series version has better articulation, many fans find the look of the prime changer to be more accurate. let us know what you  - read more
