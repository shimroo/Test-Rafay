votematch results



 
 
 



below are the summary results of our votematch 20-question political quiz,
										with analysis of the responses in terms of donald trump's & kamala harris' stances from
										the 2020 elections. this data summarizes about 1,580 votematch quiz responses. click on the links below for excerpts
										on each topic, or click for a summary of 
											kamala harris' votematch answers and 
											donald trump's votematch answers, with headlines evidencing how we concluded
										their answer to each question. click on the "analysis" link to see background
										and details about the question.







abortion is a woman's unrestricted right   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: 51%
										agree with harris' pro-choice
											stance, and only 36% with 
											trump;s pro-life stance. this issue has the fewest people answering "no
										opinion" of any votematch issue (only 13%), which reflects the fact that it is
										overwhelmingly the issue with the most voter interest (as indicated by our
										viewership statistics consistently since 1999). over time, the response set has become more polarized (both "strong" answers increased in percentage)
											and more shifted towards "support". accordingly, we "strengthened" the question text by adding the term "unrestricted" -- which reduced the number of "support" answers from 65% in 2012 to 51% in 2016. we count trump as "oppose" because, while he focused on overturning roe v. wade,  trump now focuses on keeping abortion rights as a states' decision. pro-life activists who "strongly oppose" want a national abortion ban, which trump does not support click for all candidates' headlines on 
											abortion or for background
											information. 






 




legally require hiring women & minorities   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: harris
										supports 
											affirmative action on the basis of past discrimination; trump opposes 
											dei (diversity, equity, and inclusion). note that
										our question specifies requirement: 50% support that, and 30% oppose. we added the term "legally" to attempt to skew more towards "oppose" (our goal is 50/50 support/oppose). we previsouly worded this question without the term "legally", and 39% supported that (the largest shift for
										any question which had identical wording previously). click for all candidates'
										headlines on jobs or for 
											background information. 






 




support transgender and lgbtq+ rights   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: joe biden 
											evolved over time to become "comfortable" with same-sex marriage (strong support now; opposed in the 1990s); we strengthened our wording from "comfortable with same-sex marriage" after 2020. 
											donald trump has generally supported gay rights, but does not support transgender rights. 
											kamala harris has always used the term "lgbt", with no evolution necessary to include transgender rights. the "strongly support" bar has the highest response of any
										quiz question (35% strongly support; that bar has grown recently) -- indicating that america has "evolved" on same-sex marriage along with biden. we strengthened the wording 
										(to include "benefits" instead of just "rights") then we strengthened it further (to include "marriage" instead of just "benefits"). despite those strengthened wordings, the "strongly support" ratio rose each election cycle. 
										click for all candidates' headlines on 
											families & children or for 
											background information. 






 




america was founded on christian values   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: 51% support (agreeing with republicans); 28% oppose (agreeing with democrats): it's
										difficult to decode harris' stances on religious issues, because she doesn't address the issue much. after 2020, we generalized this question's wording from "keep god in the public sphere."
										trump is less personally religious than biden or harris, but accepts the support of the "religious right". 
										under this topic, trump mostly talks about issues of 
											"political incorrectness" like saying "merry xmas". harris instead focuses on 


 




businesses have a right to pollute   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: this is a new question after the 2016 election cycle, reworded after 2020 when it read "fight epa regulatory over-reach."
										donald trump's desire to reduce regulations is backed up by 53% of viewers. kamala harris' 
										desire to protect the environment via federal action is backed by 27% of viewers. click for all candidates' headlines on environment
										or for background information.
									






 




make voter registration easier   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: 50%
										favor, and only 26% oppose, voting reform. this indicates a public reaction against "voter suppression" and gerrymandering, and perhaps for campaign finance reform. 
										(we refocused this question away from "campaign finance reform" since the citizens united supreme court decision
										which removed many restrictions on campaign spending.) viewers' responses favors harris'
										
											stance for more open voting compared to trump s 
											stance for more "voter security". click for all candidates' headlines on
											voting reform, or for 
											background information. 






 




stricter punishment reduces crime   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: trump
										supports mandatory sentencing, which matches voter preference: 52% to 29%
										opposed. harris prefers 
											prevention and rehabilitation support for mandatory sentencing, the death penalty, and "three strikes" (our previous question wordings) have increased over the last decade. the "black lives matter" movement, which arose in the 2016 election, might be credited with slowing support for this topic. click for all
										candidates' headlines on crime or for 
											background information. 






 




absolute right to gun ownership   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: the
										gun control issue is second in the big issues in terms of viewer
										interest, behind abortion -- all other issues are
										very distantly behind. voters support trump on the issue: 42% agree with 
											trump s pro-gun rights stance, while 33% agree with 
											harris' pro-registration stance. however, support has been weakening in recent election cycles, we previously registered 55% support to 37% oppose --perhaps due to the focus on mass shootings since then.
											this question exemplifies the "yes-bias": people prefer answering "yes" to any question; if we correct for that bias, this question is now opposed by the majority (but was not in 2012 or earlier). our wording on this question has never changed, since 1999 -- but america's view is evolving. 
											click for all candidates' headlines on 
											gun_control or for background
											information. 






 




expand obamacare   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: this
										topic is a leader in lopsided support: 56% in favor, versus only 24% opposing (slightly less favorable than 2012 and even less than in 2008).
										we've changed the wording of this question from generic "health coverage" to "obamacare" for 2016, but the support ratio has remained steady. 
										accordingly, trump (and many republicans) have been promoting various spending programs that 
											mimic aspects of obamacare without calling it obamacare (a term repugnant to trump). but federal health care is generally seen as a
										democratic issue, favoring harris' fervent stance of 
											incrementally reaching universal coverage. click for all candidates'
										headlines on health care or for 
											background information. 






 




vouchers for school choice   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: 27%
										agree with harris' stance favoring 
											public school choice and common core, and 47% agree with trump s stance to 
											fund vouchers for private schools. education is primarily a non-federal
										issue, with 93% of funding and most decisions occuring at the state and local
										levels. but education is solidly third in voter interest (behind abortion and
										guns, as measured by our viewership statistics), so the candidates are obligated to make their views known
										despite the limited power of the presidency on this issue. click for all
										candidates' headlines on school choice or for 
											background information. 






 




prioritize green energy   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: this
										topic offers another of the most lopsided responses: 56% in favor, versus only 22% opposing. the candidates sharply
										differ; this is a particularly sharp difference because the question is worded
										in stronger terms than our previous quizzes (73% support to 14% oppose "replace coal and oil with alternatives").
										the majority agree with harris' stance that 
											global warming is a serious threat, vs. trump s stance 
											questioning climate change. most notably, this question had the lowest "strongly oppose" of any question (only 7%) -- reflecting that everyone claims to support green energy. 
											the catch-phrase "all-of-the-above energy" really means "drill for oil and gas," but pro-oil and pro-coal candidates like to say it includes solar and wind also. click for all candidates' headlines on 
											energy or for background
											on environment or 
											background on energy issues. 






 




marijuana is a gateway drug   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: 53%
										support the drug war, while 28% oppose it. this has not been much of a campaign
										issue but trump & harris disagree: harris would 
											treat drugs with treatment, while trump would implement 
											stronger penalties. perhaps america has evolved due to marijuana legalization efforts, but trump has evolved in the opposite direction: favoring decriminalization in the 1990s but taking a harder line as a candidate. click for all candidates' headlines on 
											drugs or for background
											information. 






 




stimulus better than market-led recovery   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: this is a new question since 2016; it is a defining difference between republicans and democrats during and after president obama's "stimulus package" and now the post-covid recovery. 
										51% of viewers agree with kamala harris 
											on supporting the federal stimulus; 21% of viewers agree with the republicans and donald trump 
											opposing the federal stimulus. republicans recognize that viewers did support a federal response to the "great recession", so they pivot to their own definition of "stimulus": cutting taxes (question below) and reducing regulations (question a few above). click for all candidates' headlines on 
											budget and economy or for 
											background information. 






 




higher taxes on the wealthy   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: 28% agree with kamala harris that the 
											the wealthy should pay a greater share; 51% agree with trump on 
											cutting taxes on the wealthy. this is an enormous shift since the 2016 election cycle, when our question was worded "make taxes more progressive":
										53% agreed with a more progressive tax structure and only 32% opposed. this is the largest shift of any question on our quiz; we attribute it to (1) the harsher wording ("progressive" sounds nice; "tax the wealthy" does not); and (2) republican success at convincing the public that cutting taxes will create jobs and economic growth. click for all candidates' headlines
										on tax reform or for 
											background information. 






 




pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: our viewers are evenly split on immigration: 39% support a pathway to citizenship and 39% oppose. 
										this question has been evenly split for many years. 
										keep in mind that for all questions the bias is towards answering "yes", so an even split means, in general, that opposition is stronger than support -- and donald trump capitalized on that.  trump calls
										for tougher enforcement
											and a border wall; harris calls for 
											comprehensive reforms. click for all candidates'
										headlines on immigration or for 
											background information. 






 




privatize social security   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: only
										18% agree with harris' stance to keep social security 
											within the federal government, while 58% agree with trump s stance of 
											privatization (the highest support score of any question). support of privatization in some aspect -- including calling for "reforms" in general -- have been rising in recent years. social security until recently was called the
										"third rail" of politics -- touch it and you die -- but clearly the voters are
										ready for a change. this question is perhaps the most skewed by our
										demographics -- our respondents are all internet users, and hence are younger
										and more affluent than the general population. click for all candidates'
										headlines on social security or for 
											background information. 






 




support and expand free trade   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: free trade has a consensus in favor:
										47% to only 29% opposed. trump & harris agree in restricting free trade
										but for different reasons, with trump focusing on 
											nationalist & protectionist grounds, and harris insisting
										on labor and
											environmental standards in free trade agreements. click for all candidates' headlines on 
											free trade or for background
											information. 






 




expand the military   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion 






 










oppose 






 










strongly oppose 






 






analysis: this question has long yielded an even split among viewers, 35% support to 35% oppose. 
										 
										trump focuses on a general
											military buildup and a strong foreign policy. kamala harris echoes the even split of our viewership, focusing on 
											veteran's benefits but switching funds from military to diplomacy. the third-party candidates all point out the folly of supporting the 
											military-industrial complex, but they have no support from the two major parties.
										click for all candidates' headlines on homeland security in general,
										or for background
											information. 






 




stay away from the u.n. & globalism   

strongly support 






 











support 






 










no opinion

analysis: this is a newly-worded question in the 2024 election cycle, reworded from "support american exceptionalism". we mean the same thing, but the terminology and fervency have changed. 35% support "american exceptionalism" while 33% oppose. but "no opinion" is the single most frequent response, at 31%.
										that indicates that the population is unclear on the meaning of "american exceptionalism" -- because republicans and democrats mean very different things by it. 
										harris supports 
											multilateralism, internationalism, and accepting refugees. trump supports 
											unilateralism, nationalism, and barring refugees. click for all candidates' headlines on

analysis: 43% support exiting wars abroad; 27% oppose exiting. 
										this is a big drop from previous election cycle (where our wording was more specific, "us out of iraq & afghanistan") where 68% favored ending our ongoing wars and 15% opposed doing so. 
										the previous wording ("avoid foreign entanglements", which quotes president george washington) ignores specific wars, as does the current wording, rather than focusing on israel or iran or ukraine -- but the vague wording garners less support.
										both harris and trump disagree with the majority, but for different reasons. harris 
											supports military assistance to ukraine, while trump has long favored russia over ukraine but would 
											militarily enforce denuclearization in north korea and in iran. all candidates support israel's right to self-defense, except jill stein. click for all candidates' headlines on 
											war + peace or for

												methodology

this data summarizes about 1,580 votematch quiz responses prior to the 2020 election).
this data includes only people who took the "presidentmatch" or "partymatch" quiz (national quizzes, not state-oriented quizzes). 
this data includes only people who use the internet for political information and who chose to keep their answers stored by ontheissues (a self-selected group).  
we discuss in the context of several questions above the "yes-bias", that people are more likely to answer "yes" to any question posed, because of human nature. we quantify that bias at 61% (people answer "yes" on our quiz questions 61% more often than they answer "no"). 
we balance our quiz against the "yes-bias" by arranging the polarity of the questions so that half are answered "yes" by typical conservatives, and half are answered "yes" by typical liberals (also, half are "yes" for typical libertarians and half are social questions vs. economic questions -- those aspects are discussed further on the analysis page of your quiz results). 
any quiz that does not account for the "yes-bias" is what we call a "push-poll" -- guiding quiz-takers towards a desired set of responses. we attempt to avoid that. 
anonymized raw data for the 1,580 answers, with a summary as well as normalization for "yes-bias", is available in excel format.
