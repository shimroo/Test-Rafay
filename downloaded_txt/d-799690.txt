international medical corps is in south sudan as well.










international medical corps is currently monitoring the evolution of the nutrition crisis in south sudan. the torrential rains in this region during the months of july and august make roads and rivers impassible, making it even more challenging for aid agencies to provide necessary services. this season comes on the heels of six months of war that has uprooted 1.1 million people. while men, women and children leave their homes in search of safety from violence, they face further dangers such as hunger, disease and other medical concerns. displaced persons have been unable to plant crops and therefore the country is unable to feed itself. humanitarian assistance is crucial to the survival of the people of south sudan; however, access and security concerns to the highest priority areas with little or no nutrition support remains a serious problem. international medical corps is working with other un and ngo agencies to improve access to these areas. 

international medical corps has numerous other projects in several other countries around the world.

food for the poor | help aid jamaica relief efforts with your donation





jamaica’s economy has been in decline since 1974, when the energy-deficient country was hit hard by a rise in fuel costs. in addition, a worldwide recession reduced foreign demand for jamaican products.

jamaica was the first country assisted by food for the poor.
key developments include:

in 2012, the construction of 2,096 housing units
since inception, over 35,000 houses have been built
the building or renewal of 50 schools in 50 months

about adeso | international charity based in africa





adeso is a humanitarian and development organization that is changing the way people think about and deliver aid in africa.



we are an ngo in africa working in a very different way than most. we believe that development must come from within, not outside african communities. that it is africans themselves who must determine africa’s future, and that while international aid has provided much-needed support, it often falls short of enabling lasting change at grassroots level. - see more at: http://adesoafrica.org/about-us/#sthash.hte4rnh3.dpuf

dreaming big is how kenyan doctor built her own private hospital





in 2006, dr betty gikonyo’s 20-year dream came true when the karen hospital opened its doors to the public. the 102-bed hospital offers complex treatments including kidney transplants, cardiac surgeries, neurosurgery and dialysis for patients with chronic kidney problems.

the karen hospital has since increased its number of staff from 50 to 450, has opened six satellite clinics in emerging towns and started a nursing school.

african philanthropy on the rise





sustained economic growth in africa, accompanied by the economic downturn in the west, has contributed to the “rapid emergence of structured forms of strategic philanthropy by wealthy africans”, notes the report. although economic growth has seen a deepening divide between rich and poor, it has also spawned a rising middle class, which the report estimates could make a further $22 billion available in combined philanthropic giving.
