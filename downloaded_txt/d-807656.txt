welcome



for 35 seasons, phoenix productions has been dedicated to the mission of providing quality theatrical experiences on both sides of the footlights. after 3+ decades of performances at the count basie center for the arts, the organizations have merged, combining and solidifying their regional impact on the performing arts. together, phoenix productions and the count basie center have a clear vision: to be the place where a diverse mix of talented people want to do their best work. the organizations’ continued pledge to deepen their commitments to cultural competency, racial equity and social inclusion is at the heart of the basie center’s mission as a nonprofit.
