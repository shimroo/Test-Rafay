welcome to the outer banks

the outer banks of north carolina offers a welcome relief from crowded cities and overrun vacation spots. in fact, you won’t find any cities on the outer banks, just 100+ miles of wide-open shoreline, charming seaside villages, and a mix of towns brimming with personality and fascinating connections to our nation’s history. although we’re just a drive away, these barrier islands feel remote. choose an oceanside vacation rental home, and just pop in the keycode for your rental and start vacationing on your own stretch of beach. or, go for a different home experience at one of the romantic b&bs of roanoke island and enjoy the walkable waterfront downtown of manteo. this is where our country started (only makes sense to start a vacation here, too). you’ll find a variety of outer banks hotels, motels, cottage courts, campgrounds suitable for whatever experience you choose.
