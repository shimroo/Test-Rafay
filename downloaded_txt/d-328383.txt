and above all, remember…to build a life as if it were a work of art -rabbi abraham joshua heschel





















































































































the heschel schoolthe heschel school is a pluralistic jewish day school named in honor of rabbi abraham joshua heschel, one of the great jewish leaders, teachers, and activists of the 20th century.  the school is dedicated to the values that characterized his life: intellectual exploration, integrity, love of the jewish people and tradition, and a commitment to hesed / חסד / lovingkindness and tzedek / צדק / justice.















as part of heschel’s fortieth anniversary celebration and in recognition of our growth over the decades, we began the process of refreshing our school brand, including our logo, website, communications, and social media. as always, we began with our mission and set out to understand our community’s lived experience of our mission. to that end, we convened over forty focus groups, listening to over 500 parents, students, faculty, alumni, and parents of alumni. these rich and inspiring conversations formed the basis for our new logo. the logo brings together shapes that are pulled from the designs in our school beit knesset, a space that comes alive each day with tefillah (prayer), learning, music, and community.  we are thrilled to share the logo, as well as an explanation of its component parts, with you here.
