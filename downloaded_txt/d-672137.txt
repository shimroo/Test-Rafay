dr’s in the house hosted by the legendary dr jules is the ultimate party starter in cape town and is all is about tapping into the commercial club scene and taking the experience home to our listeners.

each night the show plays almost four hours of mixes by some of cape town’s finest djs and guest djs from around the country, and beyond our borders. the show plays several genres of music, including mixes that range from commercial dance music, house, electro house, afro house, hip hop, r&b and old school. the show has a club like feel with listener interaction via whatsapp messages and on social media platforms, and is fast paced, highly interactive and brings the party to your living room.

it allows djs from all over the city, country and internationally to showcase their skills and gain exposure in the art of curating and mixing music. we play multiple genres of music including commercial dance, hip hop, afro house, old school and more. i enjoy the hype while providing opportunities for those “undiscovered” talents and established names in the performing arts to show what they’re capable of. we certainly bring the heat and have thus nicknamed dith, “the lituation”.
