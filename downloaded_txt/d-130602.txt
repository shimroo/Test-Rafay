keeping free genealogy on the internet  


























































proudly serving free genealogy resources for 

	  over 

	  25 years
the usgenweb® project was established in 1996 by a group 

of genealogists who shared a desire to create free online 

resources for genealogical research. originally beginning with 

online directories of text-based resources, their vision has grown 

into a network of over 3000 linked websites, all individually 

created and maintained by a community of volunteers. today 

you may find a variety of unique county and state resources 

including photos, maps, transcriptions, historical documents, 

helpful links, and much more. 
nationally recognized
check out usgenweb in the media to see our 

	members in action through a variety of video and podcast channels. we are 

	also very proud to be named one of family tree magazine's 101 best websites 

	since 2000, and mentioned as a recommended resource by the national 

	genealogical society, eastman's online genealogy newsletter, family history 

	daily, the frugal genealogist's guide, ancestral findings, and education 

	world.
no registration needed
all usgenweb state and county sites are freely accessible to researchers. 

	you will never be asked to register and login, or provide personally 

	identifiable information to access and use our websites. simply select a 

	state from the drop-down menu at the top of this page to get started, 

	and from there you will find state-level resources and links to each county 

	site.

if you have an interest to support free genealogical research, we welcome 

	you to join our community of volunteers. opportunities for volunteers 

	include contributing original content, answering researcher questions,

	interest.we hope you find clues in our websites that will help you with your 

	journey to the past. happy researching!
