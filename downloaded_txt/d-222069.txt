choosing to attend cctcma has been one of the better decisions that i have made.  the instructors are dedicated and the students are passionate about learning.  i value the ’open-door’ attitude that the administration has, as well as the family-like atmosphere the college provides.  i would strongly recommend this college to anyone interested in a career in traditional chinese medicine and acupuncture!
cindy li
the dtcm program at cctcma has been more than i could ask for! the curriculum is extensive and very challenging but provides an amazing feeling of accomplishment. the doctors/instructors are fantastic and are always available to assist the students with the material presented. i would recommend cctcma to anyone who has a love for traditional chinese medicine and acupuncture.
kristin hintz
the dtcm program at the calgary college of tcm and acupuncture is fantastic. the teachers are thorough and present their material clearly. they come from a great deal of background knowledge and most have had extensive experience in china and abroad. the curriculum is incomparable to any other in calgary and the quality of education also far surpasses that of the other schools i have looked into.
christina burns
now completing my 2nd year, the calgary college of traditional chinese medicine and acupuncture not only has a well developed course structure, new facilities, the most qualified staff and an internship in china … it’s fun. the class size allows me direct access to my instructors and an excellent working environment with my classmates.
nicole mitchelson
the doctor of tcm program at cctcma is very rewarding! although can be challenging and hard work…the rewards keep coming… after the first year, my knowledge has greatly increased and i am continually entrigued to keep learning, growing and practicing skills that i learn each day. i suggest this program to anyone interested in a holistic professional academic program.
jennifer barrow
i would like to say i am proud to be part of the tcm health care program. in my opinion tcm has the most advanced theory in the health care field, it has been proven over thousands of years in china . tcm will prove itself again in the western world, and we are here to make it happen. i would like to give my thanks to dr. du for providing us this great opportunity. i will go through this program and be the witness in the future where the real impact will take place”.
