posted on february 18, 2022february 18, 2022stages of meiosis 


 


meiosis describes the process of cell division by which gametes are formed. in this process, we start with a cell with twice the normal amount of dna and end up with 4 non-identical haploid daughter gametes after two divisions. there are six stages of meiosis within each of the divisions, namely prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. in this article, we will look at the stages of meiosis and consider their importance in disease.
meiosis i
in meiosis i, the homologous chromosomes separate in two cells, so that there is one chromosome (consisting of two chromatids) per pair of chromosomes in each daughter cell, that is, two chromosomes in all.
prophase i
before prophase, the chromosomes replicate to form sister chromatids. initially, there are four chromatids (c) and two chromosomes (n) for each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes (4c, 2n). the nuclear envelope disintegrates and the chromosomes begin to condense. spindle fibres appear that are important for the successful division of chromosomes.
to further increase genetic diversity, homologous chromosomes swap small parts of themselves, so that one chromosome contains both maternal and paternal dna. this process is known as crossing over, and the points where this occurs on a chromosome are called chiasmata.
prometaphase i
spindle fibres attach to chromosomes at points along the chromosomes called centromeres. as this happens, the chromosomes continue to condense.
metaphase i
maternal and paternal versions of the same chromosome (homologous chromosomes) line up along the equator of the cell. a process called independent assortment occurs: this is when the maternal and paternal chromosomes line up randomly on either side of the equator. this in turn determines which gamete chromosomes are assigned to, leading to genetic diversity among offspring.
anaphase i
here, each of the homologous chromosomes is drawn to opposite poles of the cell as the spindle fibres retract. this equally divides the dna between the two cells that will form.
telophase i and cytokinesis i
during telophase, i, the nuclear envelope reforms and the spindle fibres disappear. in cytokinesis i, the cytoplasm and the cell divide result in two cells that are technically haploid: there is one chromosome and two chromatids for each chromosome (2c, n).
meiosis ii
prophase ii and prometaphase ii
these stages are identical to their counterparts in meiosis i.

metaphase ii
in metaphase ii, the chromosomes line up in a single file along the equator of the cell. this is in contrast to metaphase i, where the chromosomes line up in homologous pairs.
anaphase ii
sister chromatids are then attracted to opposite poles of the equator.
telophase ii
this stage is the same as telophase i.
cytokinesis ii
again, the cytoplasm and the cell divide produce 2 non-identical haploid daughter cells. since this happens in both cells produced by meiosis i, the net product is 4 non-identical haploid daughter cells, each containing a chromosome consisting of one chromatid (1c, 1n). these are fully formed gametes.




posted on february 18, 2022spliceosome 


 


abstract
the spliceosome is a large rna-protein complex that catalyzes the removal of introns from nuclear pre-mrna. a wide range of biochemical and genetic studies show that the spliceosome comprises three major rna protein subunits, the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snrnp) particles u1, u2, and [u4/u6.u5], and an additional group of splicing proteins. not snrnp. factors rapid progress is being made in unravelling the interactions that take place between these factors during the splicing reaction.
the emerging picture of the spliceosome reveals a highly dynamic structure that assembles into pre-mrna transcripts in a stepwise pathway and is organized, at least in part, by complex rna base-pairing interactions between small nuclear rnas (snrnas) and the intron substrate. many of these interactions can be detected in both mammalian and yeast spliceosomes, suggesting that the basic splicing mechanism is ancient and largely conserved during evolution.
what are spliceosomes?
spliceosomes are huge multimegadalton ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complexes found in eukaryotic nuclei. they assemble into rna polymerase ii transcripts from which they extract rna sequences called introns and splice flanking sequences called exons. this so-called pre-messenger rna (pre-mrna) splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic mrna synthesis. each human cell contains approximately 100,000 spliceosomes, which are responsible for removing more than 200,000 different intron sequences. human cells contain two types of spliceosomes: the major spliceosome, which is responsible for removing 99.5% of introns, and the minor spliceosome, which removes the remaining 0.5%.
how did the various parts of the spliceosome get their names? 
u snrnas were originally discovered as abundant small uridine-rich rna molecules present in mammalian nuclei and were initially numbered in order of their apparent abundance. u1, u2, u4, u5, u6, u11, and u12 were later found to be components of the splicesome. the u7 snrna is required for processing the 3′ end of histone mrna; the other abundant u snrnas (u3, u8, u9, and u10) are all involved in ribosome biogenesis. u4atac and u6atac are much less abundant than other spliceosomal snrnas, so they were only discovered and named when it was realized that there must be other snrnas that recognize the minor intron class.
the first and last two dna nucleotides of minor introns are usually at and ac, respectively, hence the names u4atac and u6atac. many spliceosomal proteins have prp names, e.g. prp2, prp5, prp8, etc. in yeast, mutations in these genes lead to “mrna pre-processing” defects. confusingly, orthologous genes may have different prp names in saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe because the original mutational screens were done around the same time and a unified naming system has not yet been devised.
other core splicing proteins include cwc (complexed with cdc5), cwf (complexed with cdc five), spf (pichia farinosa killer toxin sensitivity), syf (synthetic lethal with cdcforty). complex nineteen (ntc) is a large protein-only subcomplex named for its most abundant component, prp19, while another small protein-only complex known as ntr (related to complex nineteen) contains factors involved in spliceosome disassembly. some of the major spliceosomal proteins were first discovered in invertebrates.

the seven sm proteins, which form a ring surrounding a specific binding site on almost all spliceosomal snrnas, were named after the patient (smith) with whose autoimmune antibodies they react. a similar set of proteins (lsm, for “sm-like”) was later found to surround the u6 and u6atac snrnas, the only two spliceosomal snrnas that lacked a consensus sm binding site. two additional large classes of metazoan splicing factors are the hnrnp proteins, so named because they are found associated with heterogeneous nuclear rna (hnrna), and the sr proteins, named for a carboxy-terminal domain rich in arginine-serine dipeptides ( rs).
how does the spliceosome do its job? 
spliceosomes must remove non-coding introns from precursor transcripts and rejoin flanking exons to create mature spliced ​​mrnas. to do so, splicing machinery assembles step by step at the ends of introns, with u1 snrnp recognizing the start of an intron (5′ splice site, the donor site) and u2 snrnp recognizing a feature (the donor site). branch) at the other end in the vicinity of the 3′ splice site (acceptor site).
after numerous structural rearrangements involving both the addition of new components and the expulsion of many others, splicing occurs in two chemical steps: first, cleavage at the 5′ splice site along with the formation of a lariat structure. in which the first nucleotide of the intron is linked via a 2′–5′ phosphodiester bond to the adenosine branch site; and second, ligation of the two exons, along with cleavage at the 3′ splice site. the spliceosome then disassembles from the excised intron, which subsequently debranches and degrades.
how do spliceosomes affect gene expression? 
because the vast majority of protein-coding genes in humans contain introns (usually 9 or 10, but some have more than 100!), splicing is an essential step in gene expression. high-throughput sequencing has now revealed that ~95% of human genes are also subject to alternative splicing, allowing the synthesis of many different mrnas from a single dna gene. by encoding alternative protein isoforms or harbouring different regulatory sequences in their untranslated regions, alternatively spliced ​​mrnas greatly enhance biological complexity.
the act of splicing itself also has important consequences for gene expression beyond intron removal. by stably depositing proteins that accompany mrnps in the cytoplasm (e.g., the exon-joining complex, ejc) into exons, splicing can affect subcellular localization, translational efficiency, and decay kinetics of mrnp. mrna. in particular, mrna decay driven by the location of ejc relative to the stop codon is a crucial mediator of cellular protein abundance.
are spliceosomes associated with any disease? 
many human diseases are caused by the misplacing of a single gene or by the dysregulation of the entire spliceosome. about 35% of human genetic disorders are caused by a mutation that disrupts the splicing of a single gene. such mutations can add/delete a single splice site (eg, α or β thalassemia) or change the balance of alternative splicing by affecting the inclusion/exclusion of a cassette exon (eg, frontotemporal dementia driven by a misplacing of tau). some misplacing events generate an isoform of mrna that is subject to rapid degradation.
single point mutations affecting splicing can result in large changes in both protein structure and protein abundance. other diseases are caused by mutations in the splicing proteins themselves, affecting the splicing of many transcripts. for example, mutations in several core splicing proteins (eg, prp8, prp3, prp31, and brr2) have been shown to cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. mutations in splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (sf3b1) and u2 helper factor 35 (u2af35) are frequently associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and myelodysplasia. other types of cancer are associated with dysregulation of splicing factor levels. therefore, the spliceosome has recently emerged as a new target for the development of new cancer therapies.
what is left to explore? 
due to its highly dynamic and complex nature, an atomic-level structure of the spliceosome remains an elusive goal. however, much progress has recently been made by crystallizing subsets of spliceosomal components, including the u1 and u4 snrnps and the central core protein prp8. other important questions concern the exact molecular mechanisms by which spliceosomes achieve high splicing precision while allowing flexibility in splice site choice to enable alternative splicing. to answer these questions, new tools such as single-molecule microscopy, bioinformatics, and high-throughput methods for determining protein-protein, protein-rna, and rna-rna interaction dynamics are increasingly being developed and applied.




posted on february 18, 2022february 18, 2022spermatogenesis 


 


introduction
spermatogenesis, is the origin and development of sperm within the male reproductive organs, the testes. the testes are composed of numerous thin, tightly coiled tubules known as the seminiferous tubules; sperm are produced within the walls of the tubules. within the walls of the tubules, too, there are many randomly scattered cells, called sertoli cells, that function to support and nourish immature sperm by providing them with nutrients and blood products.
as the young germ cells grow, sertoli cells help transport them from the outer surface of the seminiferous tubule to the central canal of the tubule. the testes continually produce sperm, but not all areas of the seminiferous tubules produce sperm at the same time. an immature germ cell takes up to 74 days to reach final maturation and during this growth process, there are intermittent resting phases.
the immature cells (called spermatogonia) are all derived from cells called stem cells in the outer wall of the seminiferous tubules. stem cells are composed almost entirely of nuclear material. (the nucleus of the cell is the portion that contains the chromosomes.) stem cells begin their process by multiplying in the cell duplication process known as mitosis. half of the new cells in this initial culture become future sperm cells and the other half remain as stem cells, so there is a constant supply of additional germ cells.
spermatogonia destined to become mature sperm are known as primary sperm. these move from the outer portion of the seminiferous tubule to a more central location and coalesce around the sertoli cells. the primary sperm cells then develop somewhat by increasing the amount of cytoplasm (substances outside the nucleus) and structures called organelles within the cytoplasm.
after a resting phase, the primary cells divide into a form called secondary sperm. during this cell division, a breakdown of nuclear material occurs. in the nucleus of primary sperm, there are 46 chromosomes; in each of the secondary spermatozoa, there are only 23 chromosomes, as there are in the egg. when the egg and sperm combine and their chromosomes unite, the characteristics of both individuals mix and the new organism begins to grow.
the secondary sperm must still mature before it can fertilize an egg; maturation involves certain changes in the shape and form of the sperm cell. the nuclear material becomes more condensed and oval in shape; this area develops as the sperm head. the head is partially covered by a cap, called an acrosome, which is important in helping sperm enter the egg. attached to the opposite end of the head is the tailpiece.

the tail is derived from the cytoplasm of the secondary sperm. in mature sperm, it consists of a long, thin bundle of filaments that propel the sperm by their undulating motion. once the sperm have matured, they are transported through the long seminiferous tubules and stored in the epididymis of the testicles until they are ready to leave the male body.
characteristics of normal spermatogenesis based on histological sections
– diameter of the seminiferous tubule 180 μm minimum
– presence of spermatogonia type a pale, type a dark, type b
– presence of primary and secondary spermatocytes
– differentiation of spermatids
– spermiation zones
– score count of at least 8 (see section – “score count for the evaluation of spermatogenesis”).
– lumen of seminiferous tubule
– normal distribution of lipids in the cytoplasm of sertoli cells
– presence of spermatogenesis stages
– formation of germ cell clones
– thickness of the lamina propria of the seminiferous tubule of 8 μm or less
– structure and normal distribution of leydig cells
kinetics of spermatogenesis
spermatogenesis begins during puberty and continues throughout life and into old age due to the inexhaustible reservoir of stem cells. a large number of germ cells develop and are released from the seminiferous tubules. the process of spermatogenesis is highly organized: the spermatogonia divide continuously, in part spermatogonia remain and in part give rise to spermatogenesis. originating from the division of the spermatogonia, the groups of cells migrate from the basal to the adluminal position of the germinal epithelium.
differently developed cell groups are found in a section of a seminiferous tubule and contribute to the typical appearance of the germinal epithelium. six of these typical aspects were described in the human testis as “stages of spermatogenesis”. in any given region of the germinal epithelium, the same typical appearances of groups of germ cells appear every 16 days. this period of time is called the “seminiferous epithelial cycle”.
the development of a type a spermatogonium to mature spermatids requires 4.6 cycles, e.g. 74 days mature spermatids released from the germinal epithelium as spermatozoa are transported through the epididymal duct system for an additional 12 days. therefore, a minimum of 86 days should be calculated for a complete spermatogenetic cycle from spermatogonium to mature sperm.
alterations of spermatogenesis
the proliferation and differentiation of male germ cells and the intratesticular and extratesticular mechanisms of regulation of spermatogenesis can be altered at all levels. this may occur as a result of environmental influences or may be due to diseases that directly or indirectly affect spermatogenesis. in addition, different nutritional and therapeutic substances, drugs, hormones and their metabolites, different toxic substances or x-rays can reduce or destroy spermatogenesis. finally, also a fairly simple nose since the increase in temperature reduces the spermatogenetic activity of the testicles.
under these negative influences, testicles respond relatively monotonically by reducing spermatogenesis. this can be expressed in the reduced number of mature spermatids, in spermatid malformation, lack of spermiation, impaired meiosis, arrest of spermatogenesis at the primary spermatocyte stage, reduced multiplication or apoptosis of spermatogonia. if the spermatogonia survive, then spermatogenesis can be rescued.
otherwise, spermatogenesis ceases, and the shadows of the seminiferous tubules remain. alterations in spermatogenesis are evaluated in histological sections of testicular biopsies. the most suitable technique is the semi-thin cut of the material embedded in epoxy resin. in a semi-thin section, all the details of the testicle cells can be optimally evaluated due to their excellent preservation.

camillo golgi was a unprecedented scientist whose contributions within the area of neuroanatomy proved to be essential for emergence of neuroscience as a sovereign scientific self-discipline. golgi’s invention of the black reaction (la reazione nera) was a watershed occasion because it allowed outstanding visualization of the organizational sample of components of nervous system amongst complicated puzzle of shut knit interconnections. till this time skinny filamentary extensions of neural cells (axon and dendrites) couldn’t be visualized with accessible staining strategies as a result of of their slender and clear nature.
golgi was the primary to achieve success in staining myelin element of axon, which he used to find the myelin annular equipment. he recognized the entire life cycle of plasmodium (malarial parasite) in human erythrocytes. his analysis on histological particulars of human kidney highlighted the existence of juxtaglomerular equipment. later on spanish scientist santiago ramón y cajal, primarily based on the use of golgi’s staining (black reaction) documented the morphologic particulars of nervous system in a extra refined method, which finally led to the emergence of neuron doctrine. in recognition of their exemplary contributions in neuroscience golgi and cajal had been collectively awarded the nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 1906.
we use info on new sovereign debt points within the euro space to discover the drivers behind the debt maturity selections of governments. we arrange a theoretical mannequin for the maturity construction that trades off the desire for liquidity companies offered by short-term debt, roll-over threat and value threat. the common debt maturity is negatively associated to each the extent and the slope of the yield curve.
a panel var evaluation exhibits that constructive shocks to threat aversion, the likelihood of non-repayment and the demand for the liquidity companies of short-term debt all have a constructive impact on the yield curve degree and slope, and a damaging impact on the common maturity of new debt points. these outcomes are partially according to our theoretical framework. a forecast error variance decomposition means that adjustments within the likelihood of non-repayment as captured by the anticipated default frequency extracted from credit score default spreads are an important supply of shocks.



seeking justice: how vawa reduced the stronghold over american indian and alaska native women
 
the violence against women act (vawa), initially handed in 1994, was efficiently reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013. over time, vawa altered the surroundings for a lot of victims who had beforehand suffered in silence. this article focuses on how vawa impacted american indian (ai) and alaska native (an) victims of relationship and home violence. ai and an girls expertise these crimes at a fee larger than the nationwide common, but they’re typically denied justice as a result of interaction of federal and state legal guidelines and tribal sovereignty.
vawa affirmed tribes’ sovereign authority to train felony jurisdiction over non-indians who commit crimes in opposition to ai and an victims on tribal lands. this article additionally discusses future steps to boost justice reforms. extremist actions are rising within the united states. however invention of black reaction and its subsequent software demystified the essential structure of mind tissue which was now seen to the students in all its complexity in microscopic research. golgi can also be credited with the invention of two sorts of sensory receptors in muscle tendons: golgi tendon organ and golgi-mazzoni corpuscles.
one regarding extremist group is that of sovereign residents. sovereign residents have been labeled by the federal bureau of investigation as a terrorist risk. relative to different analysis about extremist teams, restricted analysis exists concerning the sovereign citizen motion. the function of this text is to evaluate all related literature regarding this motion, because it pertains to the risk posed to legislation enforcement, through descriptive analysis and to determine present information gaps. most empirical work, about sovereign residents, so far has targeted on authorized issues, psychological well being, radicalization, and postdiction of focused violence. the work introduced right here serves as a basis for future analysis regarding this group.




the embodied brain of sovereign2: from space-variant conscious percepts during visual search and navigation to learning invariant object categories and cognitive-emotional plans for acquiring valued goals.
 


this article develops a mannequin of how reactive and deliberate behaviors work together in actual time. controllers for each animals and animats want reactive mechanisms for exploration, and realized plans to effectively attain objective objects as soon as an surroundings turns into acquainted. the sovereign mannequin embodied these capabilities, and was examined in a 3d digital actuality surroundings. neural fashions have characterised essential adaptive and clever processes that weren’t included in sovereign.

a serious analysis program is summarized herein by which to constantly incorporate them into an enhanced mannequin known as sovereignrecord chunks, which management deliberate selections and actions towards valued objective objects. predictively profitable record chunk combos are selectively enhanced or suppressed through reinforcement studying and incentive motivational studying. expected vs. sudden occasion disconfirmations regulate these enhancement and suppressive processes. adaptively timed studying permits consideration and motion to match process constraints. social cognitive joint consideration permits imitation studying of expertise by learners who observe academics from totally different spatial vantage factors.








posted on may 17, 2021march 14, 2021twenty years of military prehospital care in the eastern sovereign base area, cyprus. 


 


the medical reception station (mrs) in dhekelia supplies a prehospital emergency care (phec) service for the eastern sovereign base area and surrounding cypriot cities. this service has been evaluated beforehand however some vital elements of care haven’t but been measured. the main goal of this examine was to undertake the most complete service analysis of the demand for the phec service at mrs dhekelia over a 12-month interval. the secondary goal of this examine was to match findings in 2018 to these in 1995-1998 and 2013-2016.all calls to the phec crew between 01/07/2017 and 30/06/2018 have been reviewed and in contrast with beforehand reported information from 1995 to 1998 and 2013 to 2016.
data have been collected from the prevalence e book, the logbook utilized by the phec crew to document the particulars of every name.there have been 164 calls to the phec service throughout the present examine interval. the quantity of activations has decreased since the 2013-2016 interval however stays better than 1995-1998. in each month there was a name to a scene the place a couple of casualty was current, with the highest quantity being 9 sufferers at one name. more calls have been obtained throughout the day (55%).
there have been extra calls as a result of of trauma than medical complaints (55% vs 45%). trauma calls have decreased over 20 years. the frequency of neurological and psychiatric complaints has elevated over 20 years.the phec service at mrs dhekelia is regularly used. the crew persistently face with scenes with a couple of casualty. trauma is turning into much less frequent however psychiatric and neurological complaints are more and more frequent. these findings are vital for coaching and repair provision.
most elements of our lives are ruled by massive, extremely developed establishments that combine a number of governance duties below one authority construction. but theorists differ as to the mechanisms that drive the improvement of such concentrated governance programs from rudimentary beginnings. is the emergence of built-in governance schemes a symptom of consolidation of authority by small standing teams? or does integration happen as a result of a posh establishment has extra potential responses to a posh surroundings?
here we look at the emergence of advanced governance regimes in 5,000 sovereign, resource-constrained, self-governing on-line communities, ranging in scale from one to hundreds of customers. each group begins with no group members and no governance infrastructure. as communities develop, they’re topic to choice pressures that maintain higher managed servers higher populated. we establish predictors of group success and take a look at the speculation that governance complexity can improve group health. we discover that what predicts success is determined by dimension: adjustments in complexity predict elevated success with bigger inhabitants servers. specifically, governance guidelines in a big profitable group are extra quite a few and broader in scope.
collaborating with sovereign tribal nations to legally prepare for public health emergencies.
 
public well being emergencies, together with infectious illness outbreaks and pure disasters, are points confronted by each group. to handle these threats, it’s essential for all jurisdictions to grasp how legislation can be utilized to boost public well being preparedness, in addition to enhance coordination and collaboration throughout jurisdictions. as sovereign entities, tribal governments have the authority to create their very own legal guidelines and take the vital steps to organize for, reply to, and get well from disasters and emergencies. legal preparedness is a key part of public well being preparedness. this article first explains authorized preparedness and tribal sovereignty after which describes the relationship between tribal nations, the us authorities, and states.
specific tribal considerations with respect to emergency preparedness and the significance of coordination and collaboration throughout jurisdictions for emergency preparedness are mentioned. examples of collaborative efforts between tribal and different governments to boost authorized preparedness are described. they additionally are inclined to rely extra on guidelines that focus energy in directors, and on guidelines that handle unhealthy habits and restricted server sources. overall, this work is in step with theories that formal built-in governance programs emerge to arrange collective responses to interdependent useful resource administration issues, particularly as components reminiscent of inhabitants dimension exacerbate these issues.

‘pulling the world in and pushing it away’: collaborating our bodies and the idea of coping.
 
in her lead article in this particular situation, monica greco (2018) gives the idea of collaborating our bodies as a ‘risk of conceiving our bodies themselves-and bodily occasions reminiscent of illness/illness-as expressing values and maybe even socially significant “preferences”‘. such a place seeks to keep away from capitulation to a) a picture of bodily processes as with out values or responsiveness, object slightly than participant; b) a picture of human brokers as unitary, self-knowing, sovereign choosers-unless ailing. this article will discover this angle as utilized to the concept of coping. 
the article will discover methods of on a regular basis residing, by way of specific consideration of lauren berlant’s studying of two girls, fat and thin by mary gaitskill. in her interpretation of the novel, berlant assesses the sorts of issues for topics and our bodies that could be solved or managed by way of participation in or refraining from participation in considering, meals or intercourse.

the account of coping and embodiment in berlant’s reflections will then be positioned in dialogue with findings by alexandra michel, who watched the course of of bodily burnout in funding banking associates throughout a 13-year cultural ethnography, observing as the bankers heeded or ignored the cues their our bodies gave about the limits of possible calls for. the article as a complete gives an illustration of the worth of greco’s reflections for providing a contemporary and beneficial perspective on the idea of coping.
