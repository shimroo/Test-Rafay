sfpal builds community by organizing
 youth sports and healthy activities
we develop personal character and foster positive relationships
 among police officers, youth, and dedicated volunteers.


sfpal is a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization, tax id# 94-6106198



















about us
since 1959, thousands of san francisco youth have participated in pal activities – kids on every block and every zip code have benefited from the dedication of volunteer adult mentors and role models. from a meager beginning and a handful of kids, sfpal currently serves almost 1,200 youth annually with the help of over 100 civilians, police volunteer coaches, and mentors through a variety of sports and leadership activities.  while many of our volunteers are parent coaches, a significant portion of our volunteers are pal alumni themselves who benefited from the program in their youth and choose to give back to the youth in their community with their time, energy, and commitment. read more…
