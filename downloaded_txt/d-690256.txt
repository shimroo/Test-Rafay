3d games
these games require a fast browser. the important thing is for the browser to be
					able to redraw the screen quickly. the best browser for this (by far) is internet
					explorer. netscape 6+ and mozilla 0.9+ are also fairly good but sometimes take a
					while to respond to commands. opera cannot cope very well and tends to stall.
					netscape 4 is a bit jerky and you can see it redrawing which can be distracting.
					these games provide an option to reduce the amount of redrawing required for browsers
					like netscape 4.
