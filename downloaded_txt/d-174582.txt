exclusive: listen to unreleased paris hilton songs (are you with it & don't wanna go down)these were clips released a month ago on http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=enkil50. check out dozens of exclusive paris hilton videos on this account."are you with it" is one of the songs that didn't make it on the debut album, however, it is suppose to be release on the second one, which should come out sooner than expect. "don't wanna go down" is a different type of song, presumbly made by scott storch, and you can only hear this one from our video only; no where else. the title of "don't wanna go down" isn't really "don't wanna go down", we just made it up to give it a name.are you with itdon't wanna go down
