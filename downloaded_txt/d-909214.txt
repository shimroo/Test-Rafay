our brand new outdoor trail. something strange is happening in the woods and along the river. a thick fog fills the trees and the smell of death lingers. every step could be your last!







inside the 44ft tall walls of a once working hydroelectric plant, your entire journey is like a nightmare you can't awake from. the is no rhyme or reason for what you see, only a fractured look into the mind of the former hydro curator, edison bates.







this corner of the hydro that has been abandoned for years has become nothing more then a toxic playground. unsafe to even visit as trash and waste litter the grounds. barrels are leaking some type of substance that is turning the ground black. keep out and do not enter!!
