enhancing life with light.
 































sounds a little lofty, but it's simple to achieve with ledalite. every product we invent is designed around how people see, with the goal to create spaces that feel bright and natural.

 the right lighting can increase visual comfort and maximize people's productivity. but we don't just design to meet these basic needs, we take it to the next level with architecturally pleasing, even illumination that does everything possible to minimize energy usage in a space.






about us




























lighting is a science.

 
in the true spirit of pushing the envelope of innovation, we turned to the science of nature to create a revolutionary technology we call mesooptics.
  
inspired by the butterfly, mesooptics offers the best possible combination of lighting control and brightness, with efficiencies that are almost 20% higher than traditional products.
