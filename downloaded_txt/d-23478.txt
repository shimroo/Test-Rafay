my husband asked me to hold 3 bags of dog food and i wondered why. he said, "that is what you lost. now you know what you've been carrying around!"

my favorite diet tracker is myfooddiary.

my health has greatly improved. my blood pressure dropped from 120/80 to 110/70, pulse rate is in the low 50s, and my cholesterol is in the 140s. the icing on the cake is that i dropped two jean sizes!
