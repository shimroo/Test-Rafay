starters - lissa price (review) 





review 

book : starters
author : lissa price 





" her world is changed forever

callie lost her parents when the spore wars wiped out everyone between the ages of twenty and sixty. she and her little brother, tyler, go on the run, living as squatters with their friend michael and fighting off renegades who would kill them for a cookie. callie's only hope is prime destinations, a disturbing place in beverly hills run by a mysterious figure known as the old man.

he hires teens to rent their bodies to enders—seniors who want to be young again. callie, desperate for the money that will keep her, tyler, and michael alive, agrees to be a donor. but the neurochip they place in callie's head malfunctions and she wakes up in the life of her renter, living in her mansion, driving her cars, and going out with a senator's grandson. it feels almost like a fairy tale, until callie discovers that her renter intends to do more than party—and that prime destinations' plans are more evil than callie could ever have imagined. . . . " 

when i saw this book in a bookshop ,  i was immediately captivated by its premise and also by its beautiful cover and i got it right away . 

the concept behind this story is really original,also. 
from the very first start , i thought this book was a really interesting read. callie,this book's herione , is an intelligent , fearless and well-built character.i also found it very easy to connect with her. i was impressed with how callie managed to deal with handling herself in some really difficult situations. i also liked how she always fought for her little brother and always tried to do whatever she can to help him ( he is the reason why she went to prime destinations ) . 

 there isn't a big cute love story in this novel, but we still get to enjoy a passionate romance that can easily catch your attention and that is not like any other love triangle. 

another thing that you should know about this book is that  when you think you understand what will happen next, another twist is thrown in .

the writing style is amazing, and it was easy to imagine the world lissa price creates. 

to sum up , i recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a phenomenal ya  dystopian book. i am looking forward to reading the second book of this series , "enders" . :) 





quotes from "starters" :  

 “did cinderella ever consider fessing up to the prince, that night she was enjoying herself in the fancy ball gown? did she even think of telling him, oh, by the way, prince, the coach isn’t mine, i’m really a filthy little barefoot servant on borrowed time? no. she took her moment. and then went quietly away after midnight.”  

“falling apart wasn't an option.” 

“i don't know you, but i'm sorry for having to use you in this way. and i'm sorry for the world we've left you”
