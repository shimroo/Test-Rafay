closing time!





while all good things must come to an end, all lame things must end as well, so it is with a heavy heart that i am closing the doors on dave’s long box. as many of you know, i’m busy with my full-time job blogging for my corporate masters at live from l.a. on abc.com. the demands of my regular job, family, and my career as a nude model for macramé classes has really cut into my ability to update dave’s long box as much as i’d like. heck, even before i got the abc gig things were starting to get slack around here. so instead of keeping this blog on life support and pain medication, i’ve decided to end things now before things get more pathetic than they already are. i have plans for another blog that i will unveil at the end of this post after making you read through all the people i want to thank. it’s been a hell of a lot of fun and i have a lot of people to thank – so let’s get to it.i first started blogging because of the example set forth by three guys: graeme macmillan of the dearly departed fanboy rampage, mike sterling of mike sterling’s progressive ruin, and the enigmatic neilalien of, well… neilalien. their blogs couldn’t have been more different, but they were always well-written and thought provoking and offered up an example of how blogs could be a uniquely personal reflection of one’s passions. i want to thank you guys for inspiring dave’s long box and for being so flat-out awesome. at the risk of sounding corny, your work has really made a positive impact on my life and i salute you, ric flair-style. woo!i also want to thank kevin church of beaucoupkevin.com – where is that norm breyfoggle original art that you promised me, church? much thanks to “bitter” andrew of armagideon time, dorian from postmodernbarney, bully the little stuffed bull, and the legomancer himself dave lartigue – all masters of their craft. i also want to thank ragnell from the written world, dr. scott from polite dissent, ken lowery from ringwood and kenlowery.com, and metrokitty for being their rad selves. as far as group blogs go, big love for the savage critics, when fangirls attack, blogzarro, superfrankenstein, and the late listen to us, we’re right, who usually were. thanks and praise go to scipio over at the absorbascon and big monkey comics for being such a swell guy and for keeping the vibe love alive. treacher, jim: madman. i also want to thank brian cronin and augie de blieck – jesus, this is like signing somebody’s high school yearbook, isn’t it? also thanks go to harvey b.r. jerkwater and his lovely wife. i have lots of respect for gorjus and the prof over at pretty fakes, greg burgas at delenda est carthago, the maniacs at the indian chief blowers, creators of laser force, the league of melbotis, bahlactus for hosting friday night fights, yet another comics blog, marc singer, tom foss over at the fortress of soliloquy, dial b for blog, seven hells! and howling curmudgeons. i would be remiss if i didn’t publicly declare my admiration for the work of alan david doane, johnny bacardi, tom spurgeon, david fiore, jog, tim o’neil, tom the dog, shane bailey, and ian brill. big shout outs to ed cunard, mark hale over at chaosmonkey, jim mcgrath, dr. k, benjamin birdie of the rack fame, and any other dead gopher that i have neglected to mention. crap, can i even mention the dead gophers? i think i just broke a bylaw. shit, i almost forgot! thanks to the people who used to run the comics weblog update-a-tron thing, whoever you are.i’m kicking myself because i’ve probably forgotten some blogger that i really really like, and they’re going to be pissed at me forever. let’s see, am i missing anybody…? oh. right.him. one of the most enjoyable parts of running dave's long box, aside from all the chicks, was my rivalry with chris sims of the invincible super-blog. i hand over my sword and concede the field to chris, who is a tremendous talent and a funny guy, but is a total cockhead. kidding! ha ha! look for mighty things from chris sims in the future - he is going to be a fucking titan! mark my words well.aside from blogging folk, i want to thank dusty abell and robert kirkman for the invincible handbook gig, which was fun. thanks also to gene ha, who does a hilarious alan moore impression, larry young of ait/planetlar, who is a mensch, jay pinkerton, and jeff parker, who totally likes me better than chris sims so eat it sims.  many thanks to ernie cline, the man who created airwolf: the adjective.  i also want to thank josh elder for the advice and the gcpd badge and kevin church for making me a hot reporter in cover girl. many thanks to craig brasfield, dave guttierez, the fine folks at cracked.com, ted “thunderbolt” bramble, mad michael moran over at the times online, and kent goodrich, my boss who let me present the shield career power seminar at work.finally i want to thank everybody who has ever read my humble blog and a double-thanks to anyone who has ever commented. a double-thanks with handshake to anyone who has commented 2-7 times, a hug for anyone who has commented 8-13 times, a 10-second french kiss to anyone who has commented 14-20 times… ok, you see where i’m going with this. fyi, at 40 comments you get maced in the face and at 50 you get a restraining order. anyway, thanks also to friends of dave’s long box, including but not limited to my mom, dan coyle, olav the hairy, chris arndt, james remar, mike hasselhoff, summer & virgil, bill, woody!,drake hogestyn, konstantinos stamoulis, edward liu, gayest neil, dara, kelvin green, p-tor, mike loughlin, winterteeth, cove west, tom bondurant, roel torres, mgk, anonymous, mcgone, ric flair, rachelle, koala mentalla, sallyp, todd fucking kaneko, chad sexington, oldsmoblogger, ghostman, martin wisse, haole, beta ray steve, john the ig, nimbus, peter, patrick, bill reed, spencer carnage, benari, woody, the real rick jones, jeff easton, dougbot, sleestak, your mom, sallyp, greg, brad curran, ted nugent, nshumate, ted, ian, rto trainer, matt murray, gbob, and mister sinister.manly thanks also to ken christiansen of bad flip productions and rocket bob lindenmayer who helped me fight off a bear attack. i also want to thank chava and mimsy and my wife, who is big barda and mary jane all rolled into one package.i'll be launching a new site shortly - i'll post the address as soon as it's up and running. my new site will be a little more expansive in terms of scope... meaning it will be an unfocused rambling mess. but we'll talk about that later. i hope you swing by and say hi once i'm open for business.so, to wrap it up, thank you. thanks for stopping by and digging through the ol' long box with me for the past few years. it's been a hell of a lot of fun.--dave campbell

stuff you should buy





occasionally i like to plug current comic book offerings, particularly when it might mean a royalty check for yours truly, so here is some stuff you should totally buy this week.batman strikes #44 by my homeboy josh elder.  this is a good ol' fashioned all-ages team-up between the dark knight and the man of steel as they hunt a maniac who is carving up trans-gender hookers on the streets of metropolis.kidding!!!  i kid.  there isn't even one dead hooker in the comic, i swear.  buy two copies and give one to your nephew, it's good old fashioned comic book fun in the mighty dc manner, with solid art by chris jones.  you might remember josh elder from his hilarious mail order ninja comic - he's the real deal and is one of those writers who hasn't lost sight of the whole "comics can be fun" thing.  go check it out.the official handbook of the invincible universe has now been collected in a slick trade paperback and is available for sale at amazon.  i highly recommend this as well because i wrote a lot of the entries and i think it's a neat homage to the old mark gruenwald era marvel handbooks.  plus, haven't you always wanted to know about shrinking ray's backstory?  sure you have. if you didn't pick it up in the stores when it originally came out, you owe it to your country to buy the trade paperback today!  yes, regardless of what country you live in - unless it's i hate comics land.  if that's the case, %&*@ you, pal!next up:  a big announcement that you won't like.

super skrull place holder!





i didn't want anybody thinking i had really dedicated this site to james remar, so i had to put up some comic related post.  since i'm totally lazy, err, i mean, totally busy, i'm opting for a picture of a super skrull statuette thingy. what do you call these things anyway?  statues?  maquettes?  3-d imaginings?  girl repellant?  i never know.  all i know is that it's super skrull and i loves me the super skrull.  plus with marvel's secret invasion upon us, many folks have skrulls on their mind, so it seemed appropriate. hey, here's a little insider tip for ya:  super skrull is really a skrull.  no shit.

james remar - warriors, come out and plaaayyy...





certain films are so potent andcaptivating that they fuck up an entire generation of kids. the warriors is one of those movies for me.   during the early years of cable tv my friends would stay up late and watch violent movies like the warriors and then, full of adrenaline and unreleased agression, we'd sneak out and vandalize a golf course or something.  along with movies like enter the dragon, escape from new york, excalibur, mad max, and death race 2000, the warriors is one of those movies that launched my lifelong love of genre entertainment. it is also directly responsible for young dave and his friends getting their asses kicked by mean older kids - but that's a story for another day. one of the things that made the warriors so damn cool was ajax, the brash gang member played by a young james remar.  ajax is all bravado and bad attitude - he's sort of the han solo of the group, and remar plays him with a perpetual scowl.  ajax would suck if he was just a blowhard, but as he repeatedly demonstrates, his mouth writes the checks and his fists cash 'em.  ajax is a total bad ass.   he gets to prove how awesome he is when the warriors (fourof them anyway) get attacked by the baseball furies, a gang of creepy silent guys in baseball uniforms and kiss makeup.  they're outnumbered, so the warriors queue up the john carpenter synth soundtrack and make a run for it.  ultimately it comes time to stop running and start kicking the living bejeesus out of the baseball furies, which ajax does with verve and elan. hey kids!  dave's favorite james remar line is at the 3:32 mark!truly the warriors represents a bigone age of cinema, when you could build a movie around a slightly subversive central idea and a couple of decent analog fight scenes.  i'll always have a soft spot in my heart for the warriors and its ilk, even if it was a bad influence and got me beat up.  i don't blame james remar, though.  if anything, my relationship to the warriors showed me that everyone takes a hit now and then.  sometimes you're the guy with the baseball bat, and sometimes you're the popsicle. thank you for that wisdom, warriors.  and thank you, james remar.

my favorite james remar quote





it's a tough call, but i'm going to have to go with the obvious choice for best james remar line ever. it's from the 1979 film the warriors, where james plays a gang member named ajax who utters this witty bon mot to a baseball bat wielding foe:"i'll shove that bat up your ass and turn you into a popsicle."i'm not certain, but that may be my favorite line from any movie ever. the only problem with it is that it's very context-specific; it's not a line that you can quote in public with a reasonable chance of a) it being appropriate, and b) anyone knowing that you are indeed quoting james remar in the first place. it's not like saying "say hello to my little friend!" when you pick up a chicken skewer at a buffet table or "may the force be with you" before somebody does karaoke. these are movie quotes that people might actually know and that could be situationally appropriate.but unless you're at a little league game, there are very few scenarios in which you could say "i'll shove that bat up your ass and turn you into a popsicle" and have it make sense. come to think of it, while it might make sense to say that at a little league baseball game, it should probably be avoided.anyway, it's still the greatest james remar line of all time, even if it's not that handy.

james remar - guest star





so the other day i was watching eli stone, a fine abc television program that i enjoy viewing for my job, and lo and behold, there's james remar.  he played a ruthless real estate developer that was trying to evict a bunch of low-income people from their historic neighborhood.  did he succeed?  fuck yes he did!  he's james remar!  those poor people were thrown out on their asses.  nobody can go head-to-head with the remar.a quick look at james remar's vast body of work will reveal the extent of tv work the man has done.  the breadth and range of his work is impressive - you'd think that he would just be cast as cops or psychos, but no.  let's take a look at some highlights from james remar's career.remar's most notable recent tv appearance was a recurring role as harry morgan on the showtime series dexter.  his character recently died (ooops, spoiler) but i'll bet you can still feel the lingering smell of awesome clinging to the dexter soundstage.tough guy remar has appeared on 7th heaven, walker texas ranger, and was a recurring guest star on sex in the city, where he did not shoot or punch anybody even once. for fans of genre tv shows, james remar is representin'.  he had a recurring role on the late, lamented jericho, and he played opposite richard hatch on several episodes of battlestar galactica (the new series).  remar was also in the x-files episode "daemonicus."so you see, james remar has a little bit to offer everyone in the family.  watch a james remar tv show today!  or so help me, he will totally shove that bat up your ass and turn you into a popsicle.

james remar - expository cop





sometimes you need a cop in your movie who will deliver big chunks of expository dialog to the main character in order to keep the plot going.  folks often think of james remar when it comes to casting that cop.  occasionally he might play a military guy, but the purpose of the role is always the same:  human info dump.here's james remar mocking blade with another officer in blade: trinity.  and you thought ryan reynolds was the best part of that movie?  think again.and here's james remar as uptight agent giving a briefing in the fine film 2 fast 2 furious.  "use extreme caution, this man has been known to use rats and blow torches to torture people.  yes, rats and blow torches at the same time."here's james remar playing expository cop on csi: miami.  sometimes your episode gets so fucked up that you have to bring in somebody to help explain the plot to the main characters.  james remar is that somebody.

james remar - his greatest role?





among james remar fans like myself a never-ending debate rages:  what is james remar's greatest role?it usually boils down to two choices:albert ganz, the maniacal escaped convict from 48 hours...?or rayden, the unnaturally pink martial arts wise man from mortal kombat:  annhilation...?you make the call.  what is james remar's ultimate performance, his greatest role?

james remar - voiceover master





like a lot of actors, james remar picks up the occasional voice acting gig for animated projects.  remar enjoys the variety and change of pace that voice acting offers, but has been somewhat dismissive of animated programs in the past.   "they're basically for kids and stoners," remar told wizard magazine.  "i mean, who watches cartoons? little fuckin' kids and dopers, that's who.  what magazine did you say you were from again?"* james remar has played black mask in the animated series the batman. james remar also did the voice of larousse in the pixar film ratatouille.  yeah, i don't remember which guy he was, either.  i'll have to watch that movie again with a new remarcentric mindset.  james remar also did the voice of carter hall/hawkman on the justice league animated series.  suddenly hawkman's looking a little bit cooler, isn't he?  it's the remar touch - it's like coolness pixie dust, remar just sprinkles it around wherever he goes, making the world a little cooler. *oh, and i'm totally lying about that wizard quote.  james remar loves cartoons.  really.

el cazador   crossgen comics





i loves me the pirates, although i'm not 100% sure why.pirates - both historical and contemporary - are not really nice people. they're seafaring thieves, rapist, and murderers. i don't particularly dig that kind of person on land, so i'm not sure why a thieving rapist suddenly becomes cool when they get on a boat. it's the romance of the sea, i suppose.that's what it comes down to, isn't it? people like me enjoy tales from the golden age of piracy because we're insulated from the brutal truth by several centuries and a firewall of fanciful books and movies. the romance and glamour of piracy has superimposed itself over reality, until we're left with a collective image of the pirate in pop culture that is utterly divorced from historical accuracy. kids dress up as pirates for halloween, we have national talk like a pirate day, and the pirates of the carribean films were blockbuster hits.it's inconvenient to contemplate what piracy really means, because that gets in the way of the iconography. little kids who play pirates never say, "avast, i'm going to rape all the women onboard this ship and torture this priest until you tell me where you've hidden the valuables!" well, i hope they don't anyway. the pirates movies embrace all the trappings and brand identity of 18th century pirates but coyly steer clear of the grim truth. for movies that are supposedly about pirates there are precious few instances of actual full-on piracy in them. i don't want to overthink this, but there's something a teensy bit dishonest about those movies.remember in the third movie, at world's end, when keira knightly's character tries to rally the pirates to fight with a rousing speech about freedom? if you stayed awake long enough to get to that point in the movie, you might have though, like me, "yeah, freedom to rape, steal, and kill." because that's really the core value of those movies - their freedom is dependant on someone else's misfortune.when people think about pirates they just focus on the window dressing, the iconic trappings of piracy rather than actual act of piracy. the jolly roger, walking the plank, buried treasure, cutlasses, frigates bristling with cannon, peg legs, squawking parrots, eye patches, violent diarrhea brought on by poor nutrition, treasure maps, etc. pirates are a glamorous remnant of a time when the world was vast and governments were small.but make no mistake - pirates are still out there, glamour or not. the us navy regularly skirmishes with brazen somali pirates who raid shipping in fast boats, then retreat back to the african coast before they can get caught. pirates routinely attack shipping in the gulf of aden, off the coast of nigeria, and ships in port at dar es salaam, tanzania.the big game in modern piracy is in the target-rich straits of malacca. this narrow waterway near malaysia is a superhighway for ships heading to east asia or india, and it's surrounded by thousands of inlets and creeks that make perfect hiding places for pirates. in 2004, a full 40% of all reported pirate attacks took place in these waters, and despite increased patrols, the problem is still out of hand. freighters and tankers who travel through the straits at night do so at great peril - many of them rake the darkness with deck mounted spotlights and high powered firehoses in an attempt to keep raiders at bay.check out the international chamber of commerce's piracy reporting center if you want a glimpse of the scope of the international piracy problem - they have piracy alerts and a weekly report on global pirate activity that will convince any skeptics that piracy isn't just a thing of the past. plus, it makes for interesting reading.so why aren't these modern pirates popular? they're practicing essentially the same craft that the buccaneers of the carribean practiced centuries ago. nobody romanticizes modern pirates, because they don't have the benefit of the brand identity their forefathers had - they're just violent thugs with aks and rpgs in small watercraft. nothing glamorous there.jeez, where am i going with all this? i don't know, i guess i just wanted to talk about pirates. oh! right: i'm here to talk about el cazador, a now dead pirate comic from now dead crossgen comics.el cazador was a slickly produced swashbuckler by writer chuck dixon, master of he-man action, and artist steve epting, who i like to think of as a modern gene colan. it follows the adventures of donessa cinzia elena marie esperanza diego-luis hidalgo - or just "becky" for short - as she makes the huge leap from being a victim of a pirate attack to a formidable, revenge-driven huntress of the high seas who kicks ass in her ship, elcazador ("the hunter").they only put out six issues and a one-shot before the series and the company were cancelled, which is a pity. they just don't make pirate comics anymore, and el cazador was a good one. dixon tread the line between familiar romantic pirate elements and a grimmer, harsher, scuzzier reality. the pirates in this book looked and acted like they haven't washed or gone to church in decades.epting's art is fantastic and perfectly suited for this project. i compare him to gene colan because of his liberal use of deep shadows and black ink, and his deft brush work. at least, i think he uses a brush a lot of the time. regardless of the technique, epting's art really raises the quality of el cazador and makes it a visually stunning comic packed full of salty atmosphere.i believe el cazador is collected in trade format. it's worth checking out, although the storyline ends prematurely and abruptly - just like many pirates.one last thing. here's a pirate map thingy i drew a little while back. regular dave's long box readers may know of my fondness for creating little cartoony maps, and it was only a matter of time before i did a pirate map. click for a larger picture:i'm not crazy about the coloring job i did on this one - those red parchment signs are hideous, and in the lower right hand corner? those white things under the tree are supposed to be fireflies. instead they look like christmas lights. oh, well. that's what i get for stealing my daughter's art supplies.wha--? stealing markers from a little girl? that sounds positively... piratey.

dave stevens - rip





man, say it ain't so!   artist dave stevens died yesterday, which totally sucks.  this has been a bad month for geeks:  steve gerber died, then gary gygax, and now dave stevens. stevens died on march 10 of leukemia. i have been and am still a big fan of dave's pinup work and his most famous creation, the neo-pulp hero the rocketeer. i remember picking up the first eclipse rocketeer issue back in the day and being a little baffled.  was this some pulp hero that i had just never heard of?  was he a contemporary of the shadow and doc savage that never reached the level of fame that his fictional peers did?  the answer of course, was no.  the rocketeer was created by stevens in the 80's as an homage to the rocket-pack wearing adventurers of serial fiction like commando cody.  stevens' rocketeer is a beautifully drawn valentine to a gee-whiz age of purehearted adventure.  in lesser hands this material might have seemed the work of somebody who couldn't let go of his childhood fantasies, but dave stevens made it work, and his love for the source material was infectious.  i'm sure i'm not the only one out there who took a second look at those old republic serials because of dave stevens, which is kind of a nice legacy.i only wished that stevens had created more rocketeer comics; he only drew a handful of them.  and now that he's passed away, that handful of comics is going to have to be enough.

lame-ass villain #19:  metalhead





metalhead was a batman villain that first appeared in batman #486, where batman beat the living crap out of him.  a completely forgettable villain with a dumb gimmick, metalhead has long since faded into the mists of comic book obscurity, and rightly so.  because he is lame.first off, the guy's name is metalhead.  i think we can all agree that is stupid.second, metalhead is called metalhead because he wears a ski mask with nails sticking out of it.  i gotta hand it to the guy, at least he's budget conscious.  his whole outfit probably cost less than slipknot's, and that is saying something.third, he has a spiky pony tail attached to his black ski mask that he whips people with.  for some reason, that would seem cool in an old shaw bros kung fu movie, yet here it just seems lame.batman #486 features several scenes where metalhead goes into sleazy underworld bars and whips people with his pony tail.  that will teach them from playing kylie monogue on the jukebox when metalhead is around.do none of the crooks in gotham city carry handguns?  because you know who could easily beat metalhead?  the rarely seen villain man with gun.

...and we're back.





okay, after nearly a month of total radio silence i am going to attempt to blog once again here at the mighty but dormant dave's long box. my schedule has been quite mad recently and the new blogging gig at abc.com is playing havoc with my circadian rhythm, but i'm getting used to it.  i'm trying to set realistic expectations of myself, so i'm hoping to do at least three posts per week.  i miss talking about comics and while having a blog can be kind of stressful and demanding, it's still fun - or at least it should be.so let's begin again, shall we?  let's look into one another's eyes and renew our sacred blog vows and put the past behind us and look forward to a shining future together, you and i.hey, look!  bird poop!  that's always good for a laugh.
