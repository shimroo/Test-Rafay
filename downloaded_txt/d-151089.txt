			jtrm in kinesiology - issn 0778-3906 

 
announcement: jtrm in kinesiology will cease operations in 2025 after 30 years of pioneering work
thirty years ago, we launched sports media, an international digital platform for physical education at all levels. experts from various domains of physical education were invited to join this groundbreaking initiative at the time. sports media played a true pioneering role.
soon, an international team of experts emerged, volunteering to answer questions from the field online. sports media was the first organization to provide professionals in the field and students in physical education teaching programs the opportunity to ask questions directly and online to experts. the platform grew steadily, gaining widespread recognition, eventually attracting over 100,000 visitors per month, a testament to its success.
in addition, we launched a prestigious project where students from different universities collaborated on online joint assignments. unfortunately, we faced persistent hacker attacks that destroyed all our carefully built data on the server. at the time, we had no backup, and the prospect of rebuilding everything from scratch was daunting. sports media was on the verge of discontinuing its original activities.
after a few months of silence, professor daniel frankl reached out to me and introduced a new initiative. this led to the birth of jtrm in kinesiology. many experts from the previous platform joined this new project, and an editorial board was formed, with daniel frankl serving as the first editor-in-chief. through the relentless dedication of the editorial board and the successive editors-in-chief, jtrm in kinesiology gained academic recognition and appreciation.
why stop now?
unfortunately, jtrm in kinesiology will have to cease operations after ten years, out of necessity. this decision is not due to a lack of will from the team but because i, as the managing editor, wish to pass the torch after 30 years of dedication to sports media and jtrm in kinesiology. i want to enjoy my retirement without further obligations. additionally, financial constraints make it impossible to continue maintaining jtrm in kinesiology.
i want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the incredible team behind jtrm in kinesiology for their unwavering commitment and selfless efforts. thanks to them, jtrm in kinesiology has become a cornerstone in the academic world. i cannot thank them enough.
a new future
although this marks the end of jtrm in kinesiology as we know it, my passion for physical education endures. new initiatives, such as:

the international linkedin group “sports media’s choice of best practice p.e. videos”
the youtube channel “sports media’s best practice p.e. videos”

offer fresh perspectives and new opportunities to contribute digitally to education.
through these initiatives, the expertise and experience built by sports media will continue to support teachers worldwide.
i extend my deepest gratitude to all users, collaborators, and partners for their contributions and trust in sports media over the past three decades. together, we have made history.
with warm regards, guy van damme founder of sports media

abstract
a mixed-methods study was used to determine if an online, mastery-based learning resource was successful in improving content knowledge and retention of critical elements and developmental stages of 16 fundamental movement skills (fms); a secondary purpose was to determine participant perceptions of their experience with the online resource. participants (n = 323; motor development (md) = 94; movement education (me) = 124; elementary physical education (epe) = 105) were teacher candidates (tcs) in a physical education teacher education (pete) program. pre- and post-survey data, and pre-, post-, and retention test scores were used to evaluate the program's effectiveness. paired samples t-tests indicated higher post-test scores for md (δ37.23, p < .001, d = 2.32) and me (δ32.12, p < .001, d = 1.72). results from a one-way anova indicated significant improvement and retention of test scores over time, f(3, 331) = 27.761, p < .001, ƞ2 = .963. perceptions of pete tcs reported positive reactions to the use of the online modules to improve their ability to analyze fms. based on these findings, the authors propose that implementing an online, mastery-based resource to analyze fms may be a positive learning experience for tcs and could lead to long-term content knowledge acquisition of critical elements of fms.
