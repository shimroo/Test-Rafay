what's happening today













everyone needs a place.
that’s what detroiter and comedian gilda radner said when she was facing a cancer diagnosis that seemed insurmountable. gilda’s club metro detroit is that place—a haven of support, resilience, and community for those navigating similar challenges. recently, while exploring ways to contribute to fundraising efforts for the club, i came across an innovative initiative involving the top crypto casino platforms. these platforms are not just revolutionizing online entertainment but are also being used to raise funds for charitable causes by hosting exclusive events and donating portions of their proceeds. it’s inspiring to see how cutting-edge technology can intersect with philanthropy to create meaningful change. click the video to learn more about gilda’s club.
