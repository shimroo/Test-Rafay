our story
after migrating to the united states in 1996 with her husband, mary got her first job as a cashier at bagel time. over time, her passion for working at bagel time grew tremendously as did her knowledge of the bagel business. she was eventually promoted to a manager, where she realized her true passion for owning a business. mary grew emotionally invested to bagel time to the point where her and her family lived, ate, and breathed bagels. she knew all there was about the bagels and providing exceptional customer service.Â after 15 years, her and her husband, gained ownership of bagel time in 2011. this was the true american dream for them! mary loves to interact with her customers, especially with the ones who still come in every day after 20 years. the rest is history.Â
