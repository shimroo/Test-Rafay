like to write?

                	we need writers. 
                    we like book reviews* and original technical articles for our newsletter. here's a chance
                    to get published and "become famous immediately". 
                    you have two outlets: the newsletter or
                    the website. we are somewhat independent.

more: july 7
                    have a look at the july 7, 2013, main meeting - in wide-angle photography. 
                    attendance was a little light, but 
                    
the presentation topic was well received.




computer classes
                    maybe, just maybe, if more people knew how computers worked, we'd get some
                    new members. placentia library is offering some computer classes.  
                    click here for more info.
                


                    some tee-shirts advertising noccc are available for purchase. most are xxl size, but 
                    they should shrink.
                    we also have some coffee mugs available (yes, they will also hold tea, or whatever you like). 
                    inquire from gerry resch at one of the meetings if interested. or contact the club secretary.
                    with enough interest, we may be forced do a re-order. 
                



                    the "raffle" prizes have been getting better and better. why not come by around 1:00 pm 
                    and buy some tickets. six for $5. non-members welcome.
