in their own words‚Ä¶










"i am visiting the area for the summer and i am returning to yoga after a long hiatus. 8 limbs had a great introductory offer for new students so at first that was the deciding factor to join. i have participated in two classes given by chiarra, and they were great. she was so supportive and kind to me. she also introduced me to a few other folks who were also very nice and supportive. i like the many different levels of classes offered each day as it allows me great flexibility in planning my day. the website is also very easy to use when booking classes. i am really happy that i found the 8 limbs studio in phinny ridge and look forward to my next class."

"i have really enjoyed the instructors, all of which have been kind, supportive, and patient. i have also appreciated the diversity of classes and times available at both locations. i look forward to doing more classes."
  michael m. -  jan 04, 2023






"how can one improve on perfection?! the variety of amazing and personable teachers, the choices of styles, the classes at different times of day, the options to zoom or attend live classes, and oh, the love! thank you all from the bottom of my heart."
shambhavi t.  - march 31, 2023






"8 limbs yoga was the most welcoming and caring yoga place!  the instructor was kind and easy to follow. the place had such great energy with members that felt at home and relaxed. it felt like being in a really happy home and i left feeling strong and limber. i have already recommended it to several of my friends."
mim t. - april 11, 2023






"the most welcoming yoga studio i've ever been to. a collective of teachers that bring in different approaches and styles but what all of them have in common is a depth of their own practice and classes that weave together not just the physical aspects of yoga but also the spiritual/wisdom underpinnings from the yoga sutras. also appreciate the kind management. 8 limbs feels like home at this point. "
suparna c. - june 2023






"i've been practicing online with 8 limbs for a couple of years now. the classes are easy to access, and the teaching is amazing--helping me to connect with myself and the best aspects of yoga. i would recommend it to anyone looking to explore yoga or advance their practice."
susan w.






i love the variety of classes and teachers. plus, it's been around for a long time. it's not trendy. and they want you to be who you are not what pose you can do!
diane s.  - may 17, 2023






my consistent experience with classes at 8limbs is overwhelmingly positive and satisfying. teachers bring different styles and i learn from everyone. this feels to me like a true community.
joan c.  - may 22, 2023






"i'm returning to yoga instruction after many years. the yoga instructors are clear and the classes are great for the beginner (or the returning beginner). it can be intimidating to start again and the instructors are very inclusive. i've been invigorated by the classes i've attended so far! thank you üôè"
leslie m.  - oct 16, 2023






i really love the instructors and laid back atmosphere. instructors are knowledgeable, kind, and attentive. i can come in on a good day and get a great workout or come in on a bad day and give myself credit for showing up without judgment. everything is organized and the system in-particular for signing up for classes is clear. very happy to be a part of the community. thank you!
m. akira  - jan 2024






i love the instructors! the class structure are excellent. they are welcoming, experienced and able to help folks adjust for different abilities. it feels like a welcoming community space
 kathryn a. - mar 29, 2024






‚Äúfinding 8 limbs has changed my life. i've had pain for 5 years‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ i've tried everything‚Ä¶within 3 months of joining  and coming consistently, my pain was gone! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the instructors are so wonderful, they go above and beyond what you would expect and they really care. i have met some great people through the 8 limbs community. the wedgewood studio feels like a second home, my happy place :)‚Äù
