celebrating 75 years












netter real estate has proudly served our community since 1949. our commitment extends beyond mere transactions; we strive to deliver unparalleled professionalism in all real estate matters to our valued clients and customers. yet, our role transcends that of traditional realtors®. we are deeply intertwined with the communities we serve, consistently reaching out to lend a helping hand when our neighbors need us most.
one of our enduring passions at netter real estate is gigi's playhouse. over the past decade, the netter family has been instrumental in establishing two playhouses, one in ardsley, ny, and more recently in patchogue, ny in 2021. we wholeheartedly embrace gigi’s playhouse mission, which revolves around providing free educational, therapeutic, and career development programs for individuals with down syndrome, their families, and the broader community. despite down syndrome being the most prevalent chromosomal difference in our country, it remains one of the least funded areas of research and support. gigi's playhouse long island stands as part of the nation’s sole network of down syndrome achievement centers, offering support from prenatal diagnosis through adulthood. through their efforts, gigi’s playhouse is actively reshaping societal perceptions of individuals with down syndrome, offering a haven where families can access vital resources and build supportive networks.
jim and kristina have a deeply personal connection to this cause, as their granddaughter, ruari, has down syndrome. their unwavering dedication and generosity has earned them recognition as the gigi’s playhouse long island honorees at the 2023 gala. we wholeheartedly encourage you to explore the remarkable work of this organization by clicking the link below.
