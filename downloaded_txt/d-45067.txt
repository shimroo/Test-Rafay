welcome to the new, improved 
		robert's rules of order 
		online! 
according to robertâs rules of order, parliamentary procedure is based 
		on the consideration of the rights: of the majority, of the minority 
		(especially a large minority greater than one-third), of individual 
		members, of absentee members, of all of these groups taken together.
"the application of parliamentary law is the best method yet devised to 
		enable assemblies of any size, with due regard for every memberâs 
		opinion, to arrive at the general will on the maximum number of 
		questions of varying complexity in a minimum amount of time and under 
		all kinds of internal climate ranging from total harmony to hardened or 
		impassioned division of opinion."
		
[robert's rules of order newly revised [ronr (11th ed.), introduction, p. 
		liii]
