listen to your feet!



• our feet are our foundation.
 • modern footwear acts as a crutch. additionally, tight socks restrict movement, which creates faulty foot and ankle biomechanics.
 • faulty foot biomechanics have a detrimental effect on our entire skeletal system.
 • our skeletal system is designed to absorb shock.
 • if our skeletal system is not functioning properly, the stress can be transferred to our muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints.
