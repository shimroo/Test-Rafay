testimonials

 

“i brought my daughter here for her first violin at age 6. she is now 11 and has been through several sizes - all through david michie. the quality of david's violins is exceptional, as is the service received in his shop. his staff members are friendly, professional and always willing to accommodate the schedules of busy out of state parents when trade in appointments are necessary. we wouldn't consider going anywhere else.”— michelle h.

 

“excellent place to purchase a stringed instrument. required appointments ensures that you receive totally dedicated service. post purchase support is outstanding and will be required - as your instrument will be naturally changing as a result of many factors. in our case, we had a tight timeframe and the shop was so kind to accommodate us. mr. michie also imparted some sage advice to our young musician - as he was preparing for some important auditions. we were also also allowed to try an assortment of bows. highly recommended for musicians of all levels.”— david s.



“looking for a no pressure violin buying experience? look no further than david michie violins! the staff is very knowledgeable and patient. even after the sale, expect top top notch service, because that is what they strive to provide. we purchased a fine violin and the staff was very responsive to questions and adjustments after the sale. appointments were easy to schedule. david michie violins goes above and beyond to provide quality instruments and exceptional service.”— angela p.

 

“are expert, professional, courteous, friendly, fair and kind. what more could you want? i purchased my daughter's nice 3/4 size violin here as was recommended by her teacher. not only that, but david smiled and made a bow for us to treasure using the hairs from one of our beloved ponies. the girls say that the sound is much better than from the regular bow :) once you've been, you wouldn't use anyone else.”— rose n.
