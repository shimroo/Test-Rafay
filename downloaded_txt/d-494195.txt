the down syndrome resource foundation is located on the unceded territory of the coast salish peoples, specifically the hən̓ q ̓əmin̓ əm and the sḵwx̱wú7mesh speaking peoples. without their long history of stewardship and continued care of this land we could not provide a safe space for families and individuals with down syndrome to learn and develop new skills.
