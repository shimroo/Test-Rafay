1960: penguin books is found not guilty of obscenity in the lady chatterley's lover case... but it is found liable for the disgusting things every 6th grade boy in america did while reading the book for the previous 20 years.  


1965: norman morrison, a 31-year-old quaker, sets himself on fire in front of the river entrance to the pentagon to protest the use of napalm in the vietnam war. the whole incident really puts a damper on the scheduled pentagon employee barbeque later that day.  


1966: the cuban adjustment act comes into force, allowing 123,000 cubans the opportunity to apply for permanent residence in the united states. just by coincidence, 122,000 of them happen to be very good utility infielders.
