librarian, you're a grand old




a newly hired librarian should spent part of his or her very first library paycheck to purchase a cat flag for every month of the year. fly them proudly at your work space, and forever in peace may they wave.

clothing, matching your coworkers'



if you and another library colleague arrive at work wearing remarkably similar outfits, you both automatically qualify for a one-time $500 wardrobe bonus and a paid "shopping day."

editor's note: to claim this offer, just print this page and give it to your immediate library supervisor.

leave, returning from



nothing says "welcome back from your extended leave of absence!" like finding your desk covered with months of unopened library mail, an inbox filled with 8,013 unread emails, and gary the intern drinking from your crazy cat lady mug.

bookmobiles, celebrating



librarians should celebrate national bookmobile day by going for a joyride in the library's bookmobile. if your library doesn't own a bookmobile, go for a joyride through the reference room on a fully loaded book cart.

work, celebrating library



library workers should celebrate national library workers day by taking the day off and watching all three the librarian movies in one sitting.

ask the readers: which of the librarian movies most represents your experience working in a library: the quest for the spear, return to king solomon's mines, or curse of the judas chalice?
