the digital development group is seeing tremendous growth in holiday sales for internet tv devices


		the digital development group foresees dynamic growth in its industry. “on nov. 21st we launched our first channel. we are excited to announce 5 more channels coming before year-end. on the heels of those developments we believe it is important to continue to define our mission.”

tct telco becomes first kansas company to deploy apmax middleware


		several factors were key in this northeastern kansas telephone company's decision to choose apmax iptv middleware from innovative systems. however, according to tri-county telephone association's general manager, dale jones, putting the customer experience first above everything else was their main goal in making the decision. 

jones stated, "the capabilities that the innovative solution gives us to reach out and touch the customer from our back office to help them over the phone is critical in the customer experience. without having to send out a service technician, which takes time and costs more, we are helping our customers in a timely manner and reducing our own operating costs." 

jones likes the fact that innovative systems is continually growing their products with new features to help the rural telco market stay on top of a very competitive market. jones advises other telcos to look to companies that are thinking outside the box especially when it comes to video. jones says, "today's business is nothing like it was in the past, if you are going to attract and retain video customers you have to give them the technology that is going to drive that experience."

report: mrg ranks global iptv market leaders


mrg is excited to release its highly comprehensive annual study iptv market leader report by product and region — fall 2012.

mrg’s iptv market leader reports identify which iptv systems and software companies are leading each of the six iptv market segments: access systems, video headend systems, video-on-demand server software, set-top boxes, middleware, and content protection/digital rights management.  the data is further segmented by geographic region as follows: north america, latin america/caribbean, western europe, eastern europe, asia pacific and the middle east/africa.

“iptv is continuing its rapid growth worldwide but some of the more exciting opportunities are only just beginning in the middle east/africa and latin america/caribbean regions,” said jose alvear, senior research analyst at mrg. “while the growth in the number of new iptv service providers has been slowing down because telcos around the world have already deployed iptv services for a number of years, there are still plenty of new opportunities available to vendors in emerging markets. in addition, vendors are now supplying multi-screen, content delivery and ott services, as the global pay-tv industry continues to evolve into new screens and devices.”[more]
