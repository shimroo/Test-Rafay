your frequently asked questions



what are your fees?
[expand+]


law firm fees vary by the lawyer and by the firm. at the dysart law firm, p.c., we litigate personal injury claims on a contingency fee basis. this allows for our injured clients to access skilled legal representation without incurring a lot of upfront legal debt.
a contingency fee arrangement means that we assess legal fees only if we negotiate a settlement for your case out of court or a jury award at trial. our fees are a percentage of the final total, including expenses incurred litigating your claim. we’ll gladly discuss fees during your initial free consultation.





how much is my personal injury case worth?
[expand+]


the value of a personal injury claim is based on the extent of the victim’s (referred to as the plaintiff’s) losses. some cases, where the injuries are mild and the plaintiff makes a full recovery, are worth just a few thousand dollars, while others, wherein the plaintiff suffers a permanent, debilitating injury, may be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. our lawyers have the depth of experience in st. louis personal injury cases to accurately value your case and assign a proper value to all your losses.





how do you prove negligence in personal injury claims?
[expand+]


our firm gathers evidence and investigates the circumstances of your accident to prove that the other party (another person or an entity like a corporation) owed you a duty of care but breached that duty of care through negligence.
we may depose witnesses, evaluate safety records, review photos or video footage of the accident, and use your medical records and expert witness testimony to build your claim.





the insurance company offered me a settlement. why do i need a lawyer?
[expand+]


be assured that any settlement the other party’s insurance carrier offers right off the bat is going to be a small fraction of what your case is truly worth. seasoned insurance attorneys, like seasoned personal injury lawyers, can quickly determine the value of a case. if they suspect the case is worth a substantial amount, then they’ll offer you what seems like a lot of money just to go away.
be wary. once you accept a settlement, you can’t ask for more money if it turns out that the settlement doesn’t cover the cost of medical complications or a stay in a nursing care facility. a lawyer can accurately value your claim and gather the right evidence to support a higher settlement counteroffer.





what if the other party’s insurance company contacts me?
[expand+]


you don’t have to say anything, and often, it’s best that you don’t. you’re not their client, so you don’t have to give them a statement right off the bat. you can feel comfortable referring any communication from the other side to your lawyer, including communications from the defendant’s lawyer. we can help make sure that your words aren’t twisted into an admission of fault.
