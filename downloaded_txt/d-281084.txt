edward avinger

my name is dr. edward avinger and i am an educational leader in the united states. 

i am taking a few minutes to write a recommendation for real estate agent, paul juan who i was fortunate to find in my search for a real estate intermediary for the purchase of an apartment in cartagena. 

in the united states, we hire attorneys to conduct transaction such as this, and they could be costly and you are at their beck and call for completion.

i had met several real estate agents before finding mr. paul juan and none of them lived up to the standard that he set.

because the rules are different in foreign affairs, it is vital that you find a real estate intermediary that is honest that is professional and capable of completing the assigned tasks.

i put him to the test by inquiring about a property which was a new construction. i was unable to see exactly what my view would look like once the apartment was completed and purchased. i gave him a criteria that i needed and met him on a sunday where he left his family to sit with me at a café, and he was honest in telling me that the project would not meet my expectations and instead of just taking my money, he was willing to sacrifice his short term financial gain for a long-term customer.

i knew immediately from his spirit and professional conduct that i had found the right guy and within a week or so he recommended another property in a location that i had been seeking in a price range that i could afford. i mean this apartment hit every checkmark on my list, and i jumped on it. 

i did not understand how the process worked and found out that i would have to send large amounts of money on the faith that he would conduct himself professionally and i would not be fearful of any unwarranted losses.

he assured me that his conduct was legal, professional, and accountable by law and that my investment was protected under the guidelines and the colombian laws and by way of his professional responsibilities.

nearly usd$200,000 of wire transfers later and every single thing that he told me was going to happen, did  happen exactly as he said it would and i was able to acquire the apartment of my dreams for my retirement.

in addition, he was willing to take on the responsibility of assisting me in transferring some of the utilities and other bills so that i wouldn’t have to fly back a few weeks later.

it is with the most security that i make this reference for real estate agent paul juan.  i am willing to be reached at any time by phone or email if you should have any questions regarding this process and his professional conduct.

feel free to contact me and i wish you the best of luck in your real estate ventures because you have found the right person in paul juan.

sincerely, dr. edward avinger
