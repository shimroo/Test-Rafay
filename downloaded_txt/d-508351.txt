i am ending the eminem blog 

dear readers,
this will be my last post at the eminem blog. i have lost all interest in eminem, the detroit scene and hip hop in general.
maybe i have been blind over ten years, but i do consider now that rap is misleading the youth and adults as well.
you might not like what i am saying right now, but it is the very truth. rap music is full of evil.
i decided to step out of it, for good. i am now pursuing a new path.
thank you for reading me and supporting me.
all the best,
isabelle

spotlight on eminem from a detroit perspective 

a lot of ink has been spilled about eminem and a lot of authors will probably write about him within the next years. from controversial to acclaimed, the famous rapper barely leaves people indifferent.
yet a lot of misconceptions about him are prevailing about marshall mathers and some of them are due to the fact that he is too often presented as a white rapping artist, while his connections to the detroit rap scene are occulted by many eminem biographers. this is one of the main reasons why i decided to write ” eminem and the detroit rap scene- white kid in a black music world”.
it would be really hard for people to understand who eminem actually is without mentioning the detroit scene that birthed him as an artist.
why you can trust my book

i have ten years of expertise in music journalism during which i have been expressing on eminem, the detroit hip hop scene and numerous hip hop related subjects. i have gathered a lot of verified facts about marshall mathers, the man and the artist.
because of his warped sense of humor contained in his wicked lyrics, eminem has often been depicted as a hate monger by the press, often by people who were quite ignorant of the world of hip hop. you could barely separate eminem from his musical environment.
wanting to go deep into the roots of detroit hip hop, i have been in touch with numerous local rappers, i interviewed and reviewed many of them, debatting with them: my journalistic curiosity lead me to investigate about how eminem was introduced to the detroit black rapping scene. people ought to know that african- american rapper champtown played a major role (that is underlined in my book) in eminems early rapping years, around 1992. champtown was the first to offer him some consistent musical collaborations.
besides presenting eminem in depth, my intent was also to unveil some known and hidden local detroit emcees talent ( sorry about the ones that didn t get a mention, there are so many talents in detroit).
i  interviewed some key rappers in detroit, including big proof of d12.
i also gave voice to local rappers who don t necessarely agree with eminem and his role within the detroit scene, like 5 ela.
if you want to understand eminem from an objective perspective and learn more about the extraordinary detroit rapping scene, get your copy on amazon.
i promise you a good read!
eminem and the detroit rap scene reviewed: my book is getting positive reviews so far…thanks to all of you who took time to read and review it:)
journalist at michigan citizen , steve furay, gave my book a review in michigan citizen. have a look!

rating of the product: 5 stars
if you want to know eminem the rapper, you first have to understand who marshall mathers is, where he comes from, what inspired him, his fight and struggle to succeed as an artist, and how those events made him the man he is today.
a young marshall came from very humble beginnings. those early beginnings also came complete with a dysfunctional family and a history of drug dependency. he knows what it feels like to be different, to be bullied and experience racism. experiencing life on both the black and white sides of the detroit ghetto provided a young marshall with a valuable look into two very different, separate cultures giving him a love for music that would set the stage and eventually change rap music forever.
marshall would spend a decade perfecting his rhyming skills and writing lyrics, but also building a reputation. his dream of rapping appeared impossible and maybe foolish to some; his family, friends and even his educators. no one wanted to believe in marshall, making it that much harder for him to believe in himself, but his best friend proof would give him enough courage, strength and inspiration that eventually made him one of the most successful artists of our time.
marshall had several approaches to music, but using his turbulent youth and relationships with his mother, debbie, and girlfriend, kim, created a rebellious alter-ego that would set the stage and make him the superstar he desired to be.
whether you have been a fan of eminem for years or if have recently discovered him, this book is for you! i highly recommend eminem and the detroit rap scene: white kid in a black music world. isabelle answers the tough questions so many fans desire to know. this book goes deeply within the reach of eminem’s early years, the detroit rap scene, what it is like to be a struggling artist in detroit and his rise to the top with many added bonuses.
isabelle’s insight alone gives the book credibility, but she digs much deeper showing how eminem and the detroit rap scene has impacted our american culture. this book is more than a well documented biography of the rapper’s life. isabelle has been given her readers a level of access to eminem that i feel no other journalist has come close to. her insight takes the reader deep into the heart of the detroit ghetto long before eminem was a superstar.
review by donna kshir ~ author, detroit examiner columnist and yahoo contributor
contel bardford, detroit writer
my rating: 5 of 5 stars
i introduced this book a while back. finally got around to reviewing it. here goes â€¦
love him or hate him, you’ve gotta respect eminem for the impact he’s made in the music biz. before the artist formerly known as slim shady hit the scene, white rappers were largely viewed as comedy routines. this includes noted acts like vanilla ice and the beastie boys, who some might call legends. em changed the game, and the environment he grew up in has a lot to do with his meteoric rise to the top.
eminem and the detroit rap scene: white kid in a black music world gives the reader an up close and personal look at the controversial rap superstar and the local rap scene in detroit â€” past, present, and a glimpse at the potential future as well. this book features exclusive photos and interviews with many people who know marshall mathers on a personal level, including the legendary dj butter, dogmatic, and the late great big proof, his bestfriend and the founder of detroit’s d12.
in addition to the struggle that almost saw him give up before blowing up, the author sheds light on sensitive subjects like em’s strained relationships with kim and his mother, as well as the drug overdose that nearly killed him. she also drops knowledge on how he is perceived by artists on the local scene, which i found very interesting seeing that many don’t feel he has done enough to put the city on the map, despite coming back for his crew in d12 and helping detroit talents like obie trice and royce d 5’9 obtain worldwide recognition.
what i enjoyed most about this book was simply witnessing how much work the author put into it. she revealed some interesting things i didn’t know about the detroit rap game myself, and i’ve lived here all my life. it’s obvious that a lot of effort went into tracking down artists, putting these interviews together, and making sure the facts were accurate. there are several books about mr. mathers out there, but this one offers a perspective that is fresh, unique, and captivating from beginning to end.
i highly recommend this book to fans of eminem and hip hop lovers in general.

exclusive mc lazarus interview 

i discovered emcee lazarus back in 2004 while investigating about the detroit underground hip hop scene. lazarus is far from being your average emcee. if you like the battle scene, lazarus will ignite your passion with his astute wordplays. he allies a very good flow, a fantastic rapping technique, a good dose of verbal tornado towards his opponents. mc lazarus knows how to rap. did you know? kamran rashid khan is also a doctor.
let me introduce you to the extraordinary rapper-doctor.

-what motivated you to become a rapper?
the biggest motivation for me was that i loved hip hop as form of expression.  hip hop is a vessel between an artist and the rest of the world.  it’s also a vessel between the artist and himself.  through the use of this art, one can express their deepest feelings in thought and translate them onto a canvas that can be interpreted by others.  when i was in high school, i found myself connecting with certain rappers that were asking to be heard and understood.  their music was built off of their personal story and struggle.  with everything i had been going through in my own life, i wanted to tap into that medium.  i wanted to spit my story out the world as well.  i became fascinated with the way words played with each other to create a rhythmic pattern. hip hop is a medium where the words you write on your pad become another instrument in the music.  i used to put on instrumentals with my boys in high school and just start freestyling to the beat.  over time, this became my personal addiction.  and then it just grew bigger and bigger.
-why did you choose lazarus, the biblical character as your nickname?
i was without a stage name for the first year or two that i was rapping.  my boys just called me kamran.  in the process of searching for a name that fit what i represented, one of the names that was brought to my attention was lazarus.  lazarus, being a character that rose up from the dead, instantly connected with the idea that i stood for which was to rise from silence.  freedom of speech is very important to me.  living in a society where so much of what is experienced by a muslim minoritiy is underrepresented and misconstrued, i felt that my presence would be one to enlighten and broadcast the tale of somebody who otherwise had no voice in the media.  even members of my own race and community discouraged me to pursue a career in music; there just wasn’t any place in that field for someone of pakistani descent.  at one point, all hope in my mind had died.  particularly after 9/11, i truly felt that my chances of making it as a rapper were finished.  but then i started rising.  i used the “terrorist” stereotype against itself and started taking other rappers’ racial slurs in battle raps and deflected them back with triple the intensity.  i wasn’t going to be silent anyomore.  lazarus rose from the dead.
-what is your outlook on the current state of hip hop?
it is devoid of stubstance.  hip hop used to be about passion, poetry and art.  look at krs-one.  look at rakim.  look at 2pac.  these people put their soul into the music they put out.  their music represented something and was a way for them to express themselves.  today, music doesn’t represent anything except money, sex, drugs and clothes. i look at mainstream hip hop as the endpoint of a corporate machine.  if you fit the stereotype that is projected to keep the masses dumbed down, then you get promoted and endorsed.  you are essentially the outcome of picking randomly out of a box of millions to determine who the next generic street rapper is going to be.  these artists get popular by way of forced promotion and as time passes, they get forgotten and so the cycle repeats itself.  if an artist through this machine happens to come out and start rapping about something meaningful or relevant, they slowly start seeping back through the cracks and are trapped back underground.  this is not to say that there aren’t any creative artists who are making names for themeselves, they are just managing themselves independently and building themselves without that commercial engine.
-what inspires you to write your songs?
lazarus is an alter-ego for me.  he is the superman to my clark kent.  when clark kent sees something troubling occur in his environment, he runs to the phone booth to transform into superman who then comes to save the day.  that’s lazarus.  whenever i see something going on in my surroundings, whether that be in music, something personal, political, or if i feel that a certain issue fails to be addressed, then lazarus will arrive at the scene and do that which others are either incapable of or too afraid to do.  he’s the side of me that says, “never say never,” or “do or die.”  he raises my confidence sky-high and allows me to be my own savior.  a real life superhero.  so when i feel there’s a need for that person, i call him out.
-what is the common point between being a doctor and a rapper?
there isn’t a common point between being a doctor and a rapper, but i make one.  both fields, in their own respective ways, require an unbelievable amount of perseverance and persistence.  they just so happen to be polar opposites in terms of career choice.  when i am practicing medicine, my focus is entirely on the patient in front of me.  likewise, when i’m in the studio, my focus is solely on making the best music i can make.  the initial
presumption was that i was going to have to be pick one over the other.  that was something i could never do.  i was passionate to pursue both fields.  so many people said, even using very humble and respectable approaches, that i would never make it past medical school with a career in music riding along with it.  i did that.  then they said i wouldn’t be able to do it during residency, whilst working 80 hours a week in the hospital.  i’m doing that.  now i am able to provide therapy to people with both my medicine and my music.
-what is the biggest challenge you ever faced as an emcee?
initially, the biggest challenge for me as an emcee was to gain respect.  in my early days, i felt that i had to do whatever i could do to separate myself from every other kid claiming to be able to spit.  everybody called themselves a skilled rapper the same way everybody thinks they’re jordan playing ball.  i realized early that there was a life force in me that made me feel invincible when i was on the mic.  i trained it.
i mastered it.  i would practice freestyling whenever i wasn’t studying.   so that would mean being in the anatomy lab for four hours, then going outside on campus at wayne state university and finding rappers to battle.  this led me to competitions around detroit and on various radio stations where i continued to battle and win.  the big challenge after that, however, was to show that i wasn’t just a battle emcee.  most battle rappers can’t write songs.  and to transcend from battling to song writing was necessary if i wanted to truly make an impact as an artist.  i began to develop the art of putting narratives into songs.  i wanted to tell stories about my life and my experiences.  this is what started giving meaning to my presence as a rapper.  my story being one that was distinct from the rest, i started to fill a void that was never tapped before in hip hop.
-which artists have you collaborated with on the detroit scene and nationwide?
i’ve collaborated with stretch money, quest m.c.o.d.y., proof of d12 and royce da 5’9.â€   they were all great experiences.  it was great to work with royce on the song â€œborn to dieâ€ and the late proof on helluva’s â€œi dare you.â€  recording with hip hop veterans definitely keeps my game sharp.  i’ve also had the opportunity to open up for p. diddy, d12 and g-unit.
-besides hip hop, what kind of music do you listen to?
i love anything that has a heart and a soul and feels good.  i’m a fan of various different genres of music.  i can listen to anything from wu-tang, n.w.a. and biggie to queen, pink floyd, bob marley, smokey robinson, michael jackson and al green.  outside of that, i’m a big fan of good bhangra and reggae.  if it’s good music, it’s good music.  i love quality music.
-how have you promoted your music to get to where you are?
the internet has been a great vessel for me to expand my audience.  i’ve gotten fans from various countries around the world who check up on me and support the music that i put out.  both “let the game know” which was directed by mtv vma director anthony garth and “drug of choice” which was filmed in pakistan, both received over 1 million views on youtube.  prior to that, you would’ve caught me putting flyers on people’s cars, going from club to club, battle to battle and selling mixtapes out of my pocket.  i sell my music on itunes and am in the process of starting my own independent company.  radio stations have been helpful in getting my music out.  fm 98 wjlb in detroit, the various college radio stations in detroit, stations in canada, india, pakistan, and the uk have been putting a lot of my records on blast.  bbc ranked “drug of choice” amongst their most popular songs.  the discovery channel and voice of america both shot documentaries about me and fox sports featured my theme song for the detroit red wings hockey team which i composed a couple of years back.  those have been great avenues to get my music and story more exposed.  lastly, doing shows has been a great way to gain new fans.  as hard as it is during residency, i still try to get on venues whenever i get the chance.
-what are your music plans for 2013?
i’m in the process of putting together a new mixtape to follow the last one i dropped which was called “lazarus story.”  i also plan on dropping at least a couple new videos this year.  in addition to that, i have plans to do some soundtrack work in hollywood and possibly getting an overseas tour going.  i look forward to getting a lot done this year.

hats off the detroit scene, by contel bradford

i sometimes call detroit the land of the forsaken. it sucks more than it doesn’t, and to be honest, i can’t wait to leave. having said that, i’ve lived here for like ever, so i can’t help but love it. this is why i used to get a little frustrated at the lack of detroit’s presence in the rap game.
it’s nothing i get too bent out of shape about, it just seems like the presence is stronger in other cities, and detroit kinda gets shit (shitted or shat) on. then i’m reminded how we’re home to some of the greats in the game. esham, big proof, and eminem are among the greats that comprise the detroit rap scene.
speaking of eminem and the detroit rap scene, i’d like to introduce you to a new book, which happens to be called, eminem and the detroit rap scene: white kid in a black music world. sweet how i tied that in, eh?
all kidding aside, this book is written by isabelle esling, music journalist and a good friend from a distant land known to me as isa. i can’t quite remember how we met, but it was online perhaps 8 or 9 years ago. our connection was a shared love for d12. she told me how she was planning to write a book about em and d12; i told her how i was just getting started as an author and had a book i was selling in detroit.
at least this is how i remember it going down. keep in mind i’ve lost countless brain cells since then.
anyway, isa was very instrumental in me establishing a presence of my own online. i let her read my first book, dark decision, and she loved it. she shared this in her circles and generated buzz that helped me sell future books such asthug nation. her support of my work also helped me connect with a long lost family member, who saw some of the reviews she wrote about my book, and build the credibility i would go on to use to start a career in freelance writing.
aside from being a good friend, isa is a great journalist who is passionate about her work, and that passion shines through in her extensive coverage of eminem and other artists on the detroit rap scene over the years.
if you want a candid look at eminem, the underground rap scene in detroit, or just want to read something fresh and interesting, i highly recommend this book. you won’t be disappointed.
you can learn more about isabelle and her book, eminem and detroit rap scene, here (or there, the link, ya know?).
