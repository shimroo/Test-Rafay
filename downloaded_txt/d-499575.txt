 letter from the pastor
 greetings from st. peter’s church in the loop!on behalf of the franciscan friars and our church staff, i want to welcome you to our website and also to our parish. we have been welcoming people to st. peter’s in this location since 1953, when the church opened primarily for the people who worked in the loop and those who came downtown to do their shopping. our location in the heart of the loop also allowed us to welcome the many visitors who came to chicago for vacations, attending a convention, for a family wedding, and many other events.﻿
