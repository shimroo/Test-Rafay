welcome to ascension parish


















 
mayclint cointment
sincerely,
message from parish president clint cointment
ascension parish is not “government as usual.” my administration believes in doing hard things to move our parish forward, and i’m proud to share the progress we’ve made together.
accountability has been a cornerstone of our work. by investing in qualified people, leveraging technology, and creating a culture of efficiency and transparency, we continue to build a government that works smarter for you. our open finance system gives residents insight into parish spending, and soon, new advancements will allow us to monitor and operate key infrastructure remotely.
drainage remains my top priority. since 2020, we’ve completed or initiated over $300 million in projects to protect homes and businesses. we’re also addressing long-standing transportation challenges, stretching every dollar through strategic partnerships to fund critical road improvements.
beyond infrastructure, we’re focused on building stronger communities. from new parks and playgrounds to the west ascension early learning center and expanded recreational programs, we’re ensuring a better quality of life for all residents. economic growth continues, with businesses of all sizes thriving in ascension, and our parish remains ranked #1 in louisiana for health, wealth, and living.
this success is not by accident—it’s a result of hard work, innovation, and the dedication of our community. as we move forward, we remain committed to making ascension an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.
thank you for your continued support. together, we keep ascension parish moving forward.
ascension parish president
