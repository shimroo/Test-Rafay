who is myrtle beach tours? myrtle beach tours is the southeastern leader in student group vacation packages. established in 1988 with 30 years of experience, we specialize in providing housing with events for high school and college groups.
the rumors are true! we are the ultimate social beach experience! an experience where people come together, relax, share, and build memories and relationships that last a lifetime, not to mention all the fun we provide! all of our houses are in the same neighborhood creating a block party atmosphere on peak weeks. over the past 2 years, we've had over 14,500 students join us at the beach! odds are you probably know one of them!
we know what students want, what students need and how to deliver it. we understand it's not just about having a place to stay, it's about a place that knows what having a good time is all about and works with you to ensure you have the best time possible - guaranteed.
