edward harpley ltd was established in 1991 by edward and patricia harpley as a culmination of careers in historical interiors, antiques, interior design and furniture. we strive to maintain those principles of craftsmanship and adherence to skills that have inspired us over the years, in order to bring the same quality to discerning designers today.  

often referred to as “antiques of the future”, our motto has always been to be the best, and not to cut corners but to be distinctive and to go that extra mile to achieve a beautiful product.
we specialize in making all our poles, accessories and pelmets in wood – from sustainable resources – in the uk. nothing beats the feel of hand-carved and hand-polished mahogany or oak finials, matching rings and brackets.many finials and decorative items are also made in resin, to enable us to offer a wider variety of designs, but all of them have been taken from beautifully hand-carved originals and, when gilded or painted, the effect is just as dramatic.
our bespoke design service, based on our extensive library and many years of experience, has enabled us to be involved with many prestigious projects. grand chippendale pelmets, carved and gilded four poster beds, louis 1v half testers, hand-forged steel triple poles for example, have all been made to specifications for interior designers around the world.
