msow does not discriminate based on gender, race, color, national or ethnic origin in our educational policies and admissions policies.the montessori school of washington (msow) aims to introduce children to the joy of learning at an early age and assists the child in creating an inner order. this self-discipline becomes the basis of freedom, within a framework, for children to learn through their senses according to their timetable of growth and level of interest.by achieving continuous success in learning experiences, the child will develop self-confidence and competence, attributes that are carried into maturity. when children acquire self-mastery and self-respect, they then respect others.learn more →admission for 2024-2025https://www.montessoriwashington.org/admissions-1

“my son, izzy, started msow and in four months has experienced extraordinary emotional and intellectual growth. there can be no doubt that most of the credit goes to the talented and conscientious staff at msow.”

—  lee l., mother of izzy (age 2)














““my daughter started coming to msow when she was 24 months old. i was so nervous! but she quickly bonded with the teachers and she loved the montessori activities right away. in addition to the essentials, she’s had exposure to spanish, french, music and all kinds of movement (even yoga!), and she brings those influences into our home where they get incorporated into other kinds of play. i am thrilled that we found such a nurturing and supportive situation for her... and the teachers are just incredible.””

—  kate b., mother of paige (age 3 1/2)
