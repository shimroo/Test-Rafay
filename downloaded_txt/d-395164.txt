"punk opera: chelennon" by the oz. 
            
 
this full-length experimental "punk 
            opera" project includes 13 unique post-punk  versions of john 
            lennon revolutionary and rare songs mixed with 6 reprises of 
            politically intense interviews with him. this brilliant work was 
            created by the oz -- a post-punk group located in the very heart of 
            the true underground of st. petersburg -- russia's cultural and 
            revolutionary capitol!
