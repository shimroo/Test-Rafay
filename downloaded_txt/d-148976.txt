this site is devoted to androids. an android is an anthropomorphic robot - i.e. a robot
that looks like a human. many android developers call their creations
"humanoids" rather than androids. we also have robotics links, robot links,
animatronics links, and research links.

the tara android


tara was built by john bergeron back in 2003 and 
			2004.  john was trying to bootstrap the android industry just 
			as i have been trying to do.  she is a bit primitive but that 
			is to be expected given the tiny budget available to john.  in 
			2004 john made a music video of tara singing.  some folks think 
			its creepy, but i think its just a little spooky. you can buy this 
			music video here for $11 in the us and $19 
			outside the us. i currently have no email address for john bergeron.

 android cop video   
  the embassy
          visual effects inc  of vancouver, bc, canada, has produced an
          android policeman video which is just outstanding.  the video
          shows an android cop patrolling in a poor part of town near
          johannesburg, south africa.  it shows the android running,
          driving a patrol car, and shooting guns.  fantastic!  (only
          problem is the video is 16m).

king's college london
          also has a robotic receptionist - which is called
          inkha. it was built by matthew walker and went on-line full time
          last december. inkha is attracted to small movements and is frightened
          by large movements which makes it a popular addition to the reception
          area. inkha's lifelike movement results from studies of human
          behavior.
