in the 2024 – 2025 social justice statement, “truth and peace: a gospel word in a violent world”, australia’s bishops scrutinise the signs of our own troubled times, observe the violence around us, and ask why it is so. they also ask what is needed if there is to be peace.
in a world full of pessimism, they put their faith and hope in the possibility of peace.
using scripture and the guidance of pope st. john xxiii’s pacem in terris and pope francis’ fratelli tutti, we learn that peace is possible if we put our trust in christ who is the way, the truth and the life and the prince of peace.
