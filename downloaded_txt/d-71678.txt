helicopters are flying metal death traps in real life, but even more dangerous in viewtiful joe where they will stop the titular hero before he can even complete the first episode. sean breaks down how he was able to make it past the earliest, and somehow toughest, boss in the game.

excite truck was a surprise hit launch title for the nintendo wii, taking cues from earlier games excitebike and excitebike 64 (in what later came to be known as the "excite" series), and dialing all of the tricks and land deformations up to 11 making the game really live up to its name. it's also an excellent showcase of the wii's motion controls, tapping into those primal instincts kids had to jerk the controller around as if it would have some physical effect, and making such motions essential to the gameplay. plus, players can load up their own mp3s onto the wii sd card and play them in-game — how cool is that??as the producers pick for december 2024, and the first stream of 2025, we're looking to kick off the new year right! the most right...

couldn't stop thinking about it while playing mega man 3, so we're going to take a detour to scrub our brains.mega man 3 may have been the first that sean felt like he could beat, but mega man x was the first one he loved with his whole body. it was a fantastic showcase for the new super nintendo entertainment system, from the extremely '90s intro that made excellent use of the sony-designed snes sound chip, to all the color, sound, graphics and frenetic gameplay that launched the mega man series into the 16-bit console generation.these cartridges are also insanely pricey to collect, so it's a good thing that various virtual consoles — including nintendo switch online — have made them all playable for the masses once more.

who knew down + b could be so powerful?after getting stopped last time at what seemed like an unstoppable boss, we learned through listening to you the viewers (and watching people who are actually good at this game) the right way to play ninja gaiden, which will allow us to defeat the undefeatable.join us as we replay the first level, but then return to where we left off to continue, and perhaps finish, the fight.

this big red button changes everything.nintendo has made it easier than ever to download all of the virtual consoles available for nintendo switch online. combine that with this one easy trick to change the region of the eshop, and you can download famicom, super famicom, mega drive, and japanese versions of nintendo 64, game boy, and game boy advance as well as the versions that exist in your own region. we also show you how easy and painless it is to upgrade to the expansion pack so you don't miss out on all of the n64 and gba games that are currently available.

unlike simon's quest, sean has never beaten the original castlevania. will this be his chance?the nes version of castlevania is a much more arcade-style experience, bequeathing powerups from items gathered in the level, which don't persist upon the character losing a life. this twitchier style of action platformer with more brutal punishment for failure wasn't really sean's jam as a kid, and so out of all three original nes games this is the one he's never sought out in cartridge form, so we'll be playing it on the nes classic edition instead. by contrast, the msx version of the same game could be considered as a forebearer of simon's quest, which is much more sean's speed.we actually played castlevania ii as an honorable mention for our producers picks around this time last year, and it was a big hit! we hope that playing the og will be just as satisfying.

the arcade-turned nes classic has spawned an entire franchise in the decades since its release. let's play it!sean made the comment recently that not many ninja games from japan were released in the us, but ninja gaiden, with its very japanese name and all, was a standout exception. we're going to play it to find out what makes it so special over its peers.

don't avoid this nes game based on the '80s domino's pizza mascot!the domino's pizza noid was an advertising mascot meant to bolster the company's promise of hassle-free and timely delivery. the noid would do all it could to prevent your pizza from arriving at your house, and in one piece -- a prototype of mayhem from more recent allstate commercials. you're in good hands with domino's!somehow this spawned two video games, and yo! noid for the nes is one of them. what kind of game is it? does it even have anything to do with pizza? our patreon producers picked it so that we can find out together.

sean helps simon belmont resurrect dracula to end his curse once and for all.the original castlevania is a classic, but there were many variations across different consoles. the nes version focused more on arcade-style gameplay, but the msx experience was quite different. when creating a sequel, konami took more from the latter. rather than knock down abilities and weaponry when injured, simon belmont can now collect items and upgrade weapons at shops, which will persist even after enough failures that a continue is needed. there are npcs, towns, and other locales that can be revisited throughout the game, as opposed to the strictly linear progression of the nes predecessor. in fact, this more rpg-like system is quite a bit like another maligned sequel, zelda ii: the adventure of link!sean has chosen castlevania ii: simon's quest as the first producers pick "honorable mention", plucked from the poll of january 2024. the game feels topical, given our recent experience with the zelda ii enhanced remake, and how the changes to that game have brought the two more in line. also, both games were sean's favorites as a kid, and the first titles he got along with his first nes back in 1989. 35 years later, it's time to see what he remembers about playing this game!
