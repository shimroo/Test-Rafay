everything 
                          you wanted to know about parrots - the winged flying 
                          colors

                          flying has impressed man ever since icarus tried his 
                          hand at it. it's a different story that he couldn't 
                          make it. many of us have wanted to fly freely in the 
                          air, without any inhibition or any traffic rules. i 
                          have always envied birds for their ability to soar so 
                          high and be so close to the world of the clouds. birds 
                          have therefore always interested and impressed me.
does flying mean the same to you? do 
                          colorful birds steal your concentration and make you 
                          yearn to be like them? if you are passionate about birds, 
                          especially parrots, and have always 
                          wanted to own one, but never dared to bring one home, 
                          this is the website for you. parrots 
                          are one of the most colorful members of the entire bird 
                          kingdom. they can be cute and cuddly, and sometimes, 
                          simply awe you with their majesty and elegance. parrots 
                          have many sub-species. macaws, 
                          cockatoos, cockatiels 
                          and budgies are some examples. they 
                          are often referred to as winged rainbows.

bringing a parrot home is like bringing 
                          home a new born baby. it is not easy to understand parrot 
                          behaviour. some pet 
                          parrots are very adjusting and will eat anything 
                          you serve. the bigger parrots are often stubborn and 
                          moody. they want your attention all the time and grow 
                          very loud otherwise. parrots may be eclectus, senegal, 
                          amazon, african grey and many more. parrot 
                          training is an art. a talking 
                          parrot can be hillarious and perform amazing tricks.
if you are in need of some color in 
                          your life, a macaw is the right companion for you. the 
                          blue and gold macaw is just as sensational as the hyacinth 
                          or the scarlet or the hahns. the green 
                          wing macaw will simply take your breath away. for 
                          a healthy bundle of colors, the macaw 
                          diet should be right. the old saying that the way 
                          into a man's heart is through his stomach applies to 
                          the secret to a healthy parrot.

                          a sweet pill at home. cockatoos
