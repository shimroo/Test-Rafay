use our maximum bid feature - a maximum bid is a confidential proxy bid that is used to bid for you should someone raise the bid. the smallest amount of your maximum bid necessary to be the high bidder is used when the system is placing the bid on your behalf. this is a useful tool for those of you who will be away from your internet connection for an extended period of time.  
 
 dynamic auction endings - in many of our stallion season auction events, if any listing receives a bid in the last 5 minutes, the auction will be extended by an additional 5 minutes. this will continue until there are no bids received in the final 5 minutes. at that point, bidding is closed for that auction listing. this option is in place to give everyone a fair chance to place the last bid and prevent snipe bids at the last second of the auction event. 

important info for participants - we recommend that if you are bidding or selling as a participant in any of our auction events, that you stay logged in to your account in order get up to the minute messages that have been sent to you. bid notices and outbid notices, important updates, roster changes and the like, are simultaneously sent to your account as soon as they are transmitted. to retrieve your messages,  please check your thoroughlybred message center which is found in the members area. doing so will avoid messages being sent to your spam folder or typical delays between your e mail provider and your account.
