what our clients say
in our pursuit of superior customer satisfaction, we survey every client after every closing.








holly chapman
viewing properties long distance was a new experience for us. holly provided expertise that was beyond the call of duty. she attended every single phone call, attended every meeting with each company that we asked to meet with, took notes, and asked questions about things we sometimes didn't think to ask. there was absolutely nothing that we asked her to do that she did not provide! i would work with holly again and recommend her without hesitation. we look forward to a continued friendship with holly and the entire helen adams team.

dayton butler team 
dayton butler team was awesome to work with! they were with us from buying our new home and selling our other place. great communication/knowledge and made the process so much easier! 10/10 and highly recommend!


benjamin simons






beth ebert
i couldn't have asked for a better realtor to walk with me through my first-time, home buying journey! beth was incredibly patient, diligent and offered an invaluable perspective as i navigated this crazy housing market. i have and would highly recommend working with beth ebert!


kate gatterdam






anish shah
anish has been our agent for more than a decade and we have done multiple deals with him. he is one of the best agents i have worked with across the nation, and we hope / expect to continue working with him in the future.

michael krueger
michael krueger is prior air force like myelf and simply clicked from the start. however, i had no idea i was getting myself acquantied with such an honest realtor! he is absolutly filled with integrity in every area and provided excellent services. he communicated very well and often, never making us feel like we were intruding when we had questions at random times of the day. i absolutely loved his patience, kindness, and all the advice he'd share that really showed how much he cared about our wellware over him making a profit. he cares about people more than making money and it shows which is probably what makes him super successful! i will forever be working with michael krueger as long as i'm needing to buy homes in charlotte, nc. i will also forever talk about what an honest realtor he is that truly cares about his folks and you can always depend on him doing right by you.

holly webster
holly webster provided wonderful service to us as we transitioned from fl to nc. holly is knowledgeable of the area and was inquisitive to ensure she was meeting our needs and expectations. she was patient and kind as well as honest as we had specific needs in a market that was challenging at times. holly went above and beyond in visiting properties in the cold and rain to provide us with a virtual walkthrough of potential properties. thankfully, we were successful in finding the right property for us. we appreciate all she did to help us in our move to nc. thank you holly!

kari kessell
kari had done her homework and was very familiar with the area/market. she gave us excellent recommendations for staging the house for pictures and showings. she priced our home perfectly! we had multiple offers over asking price within the first three days. she was in constant communication during the inspection/closing process. she negotiated well with the buyer/buyer's agent on multiple subjects. the closing went off without a hitch. we would highly recommend kari to anyone looking for an agent in the lake wylie area.

leize watkins
leize watkins was incredible to work with! she was always patient and understanding of the many questions i had as a first time home buyer. she was knowledgeable and took the time to talk through the process with me and show me as many homes as i wanted to see throughout the search. in a tough buyer's market, leize found me the perfect spot to call home! i would recommend her to anyone in the market!
