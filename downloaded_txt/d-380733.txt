do you know how much a fresh graduate in singapore earns?





it's really heartbreaking to know that in other countries, workers earn huge pay that allow them to live comfortable lives. in the philippines, unless you are politician or a member of a business family, you will have a slight chance of living a comfortable existence.

 in singapore for instance, philippinenewsnetwork.com reported that fresh college graduates earn an average monthly starting salary of usd2,200. that is around p90,000 for a starting pay. not even the president of the philippines get that much salary a month.

singapore practices "hyper wage". which means workers are given huge salary so they will have more buying power, which in turn stirs the economy. if you have give a worker comfortable salary that will allow him or her to buy the latest gadgets or an expensive clothing, that worker will surely buy that gadget and that cloth.

that means, business will enjoy great sales because people have buying power. that's what we need in the philippines - hyper wage. raise the salary of the filipino workers and the economy will surely further expand.

houston rockets wins preseason game vs indiana pacers





houston rockets triumphed against the indiana pacers, 116-96, during the first ever national basketball association (nba) preseason game held in the philippines.

thousands of nba fans trooped to the mall of asia arena to watch a live nba game, the first in the history of the country.

james harden earned 18 points to bring the rockets to victory together with jeremy lin's 12 points.

"we wanted to get off to a good start defensively. we set some defensive goals and the first unit really did a nice job establishing us defensively," said rockets head coach kevin mchale.

houston started the first quarter with a 12-0 run but indiana tried to keep the lead to a low with paul george and david west.

licensure exam for optometrists reset to december 2-4, 2013 (written) and december 5-6, 2013 (practical)





the professional regulation commission announces the rescheduling of the optometrists licensure exam from august 9-11, 2013 (written), august 16-19, 2013 (practical) to december 2-4, 2013 (written), december 5-6, 2013 (practical).

the licensure exam originally scheduled on august 2013 was indefinitely postponed due to vacancies in the professional regulatory board of optometry.

the required quorum has been met with the recent appointment of the new members of the board. in a meeting after being sworn into office last september 5, 2013, the board passed resolution no. 2 dated september 24, 2013 re-setting the dates of the optometrists written and practical examination.

the failure of the prospective examinees to secure the necessary documentary requirements due to the prevailing hostile conditions in zamboanga city has prompted the professional regulation commission and the professional regulatory board of respiratory therapy to extend the deadline for the filing of the applications for the said licensure examination.

barangay election season officially begins...









on friday, 11th of october, thousands of aspiring politicians will be trooping to the different commission on election (comelec) offices around the country to file their certificate of candidacies (cocs) as they try their luck in dipping their hands into the field of "public service".  thousands of incumbents will also be heading to the comelec as they will again try to woo constituents to vote for them.

the barangay election is a local election involving candidates who personally know each other. but according to the comelec and the philippine national police, the barangay election is the most violent and the most bloody of all polls in the country. election-related violence is expected in far-flung barangays, where candidates often go personal just to destroy the credibility of their opponents, and hopefully win votes.

we can expect members of the same family running against each other. relatives hurling accusations against another relative, destroying not just the reputation of the opponent but of the entire family. neighbors killing another neighbor just to win a barangay council seat. how sad, especially when you start thinking that these people are running in the name of "public service".

superstorm sandy triggers massive blackout, flooding





let's all pray for our brothers and sisters in the us as superstorm sandy is now moving in the northeast with strong winds and heavy rain that have triggered massive blackout and flooding in affected areas.


superstorm sandy slammed into the new jersey coastline with 80 mph 
winds monday night and hurled an unprecedented 13-foot surge of seawater
 at new york city, flooding its tunnels, subway stations and the 
electrical system that powers wall street. at least 16 u.s. deaths were 
blamed on the storm, which brought the presidential campaign to a halt a
 week before election day.



for new york city at least, 
sandy was not the dayslong onslaught many had feared, and the wind and 
rain that sent water sloshing into manhattan from three sides began 
dying down within hours.

pit señor - cebu's sinulog festival





cebu has been on a festive mood since last week as the entire cebuano population gears up for the annual sinulog mardi gras, a festival that celebrates the feast of the miraculous sto. niño de cebu every third sunday of january. this year, sinulog falls on january 15 and everyone is ready for the celebration.

the police will be fielding 30,000 personnel to secure the sinulog as authorities expect more than 3 million people to troop to the main sinulog parade route this sunday. pagasa has already warned of a rainy sinulog but i don't think that will prevent people from witnessing the festival.

fuente osmeña also been transformed into a plaza of shops and stores where people can munch on just about anything or buy stuff they can bring home. head up a few meters and you will see that the front side of the abellana national school is also occupied with stalls selling almost anything you can imagine.

here's hoping that this year's sinulog festival will be peaceful and orderly just like the previous celebrations. afterall, the festival celebrates the feast of sto. niño and i don't think the child jesus will ever allow any negative events to take place during that day.

viva pit señor!

it's more fun in the philippines







too early to say but i can sense that the department of tourism has finally found the right slogan that will surely capture the interest of tourists. "it's more fun in the philippines", a catchy slogan formulated under the leadership of dot's director ramon jimenez, the same marketing guy who instilled chicken joy into the minds of our children.

first off, i am actually against the move to change the dot slogan "wow philippines", which was formulated during the time of then sec. richard gordon. it was catchy and effective. two words that have successfully drawn the philippines into the world tourism map. and what an intelligent move then secretary ace durano made when he retained "wow philippines" during his administration.

"wow philippines" successfully competed with "malaysia, truly asia", "amazing thailand", and "uniquely singapore" until one man, just for the heck of introducing a new slogan, changed it to the controversial "pilipinas, kay ganda!", which sounded like the title of an early morning tv show and whose graphics became even more controversial because it was found out to have been copied from a polish tourism brochure.

but "wow philippines" is dead and "pilipinas, kay ganda" suffered a heart attack even before it was officially printed in our tourism brochures. and because we can't revive "wow philippines", i am slowly becoming a fan of "it's more fun in the philippines". an honest and truthful answer to the question "why should we go to the philippines?". it's more fun here - the people are smiling, the beaches boast of pristine waters and white sandy shores, and there are plenty of fun activities to do in the 7,100 islands that comprise the entire country.

the dot can advertise the new slogan over cnn or bbc, costly but proven-effective, just like what the other countries are doing, but i hope the country's tourism advertisements will not be followed by news of bombings, kidnappings, and beheading in mindanao, which are not the kind of "fun" that we are trying to sell to international tourists.

thanks, steve jobs





i never got the chance to see apple's founder steve jobs in person. well, i really never dreamed of meeting him in person because i know it was not going to happen. i'm just an ordinary journalist in the philippines, a lover of gadgets sold in stores here (these gadgets are years behind compared to what are being sold in the us), and an ordinary man whom steve jobs will never be interested in meeting.

but i have been reading about him - his works, his extremely private life, and his genius that is now the heart and soul of apple. i never got the chance to own an ipad, an iphone, or even an imac. not even a second hand of these units. i don't have regrets though because i am a person who doesn't really spend beyond what my pockets will allow. and yet, i admire the gadgets that came from apple although most of the time, these gadgets i admired were owned by friends and colleagues.

may 1, labor day





no matter how long the street march will be and no matter how loud the speakers will sound, there won't be any wage increase announcement today, may 1, labor day. that was what government spokesmen announced as thousands of laborers troop to the streets today for the annual labor day rally.

first of all, the wage board tasked to determine the supervening events that will lead to a wage increase has not come up with a decision on whether or not there is really a need to increase the salaries even if it is clear that our minimum wage earners are struggling to provide for their families what with the series of fuel price hike and the increasing prices of basic goods.

tostado festival of santander, cebu





i love travelling especially in the countryside to escape the daily grind of the city life. so when the provincial government of cebu invited me to witness the tostados festival in the town of santander, i immediately nodded without hesitation.

santander is located on the southern most tip of cebu. it's a quiet, laidback town blessed with several natural wonders, white-sandy shores, and warm, hospitable people. the town is a three-hour ride from the city but then i always love long road trips because i get to see the beauty of nature along the road - rice fields, old houses, century-old acacia trees, and the greeneries in general.

tostado is a local delicacy in the town. it's a home-baked cookie with delicious taste and the procedures and secret ingredients in making a really delicious tostado have been handed down from generations to generations.

another round of tuition increase





at least 10 universities in the visayas have filed a petition for an average of 10 percent tuition increase for sy 2011-2012. an official of the commission on higher education (ched) said they cannot stop any university from implementing an increase in tuition for as long as the said university has complied with all the requirements set forth by ched.

clearly, this is another burden on the parts of parents who are shedding blood, sweat, and tears just to send their children to school in the hope of giving them a brighter future in a country that has a dusty scene as a future. by next school year, more students will be forced to stop their education because their parents can no longer afford the rise in tuition.

cebu's sand, sea, and sun





it's summer officially, despite the torrential rains and reports about landslides and floods in other areas around the country. and when we mention summer, images of white sand beaches will surely conjure in the mind - the sands of boracay, the waters off dakak, the beaches of cebu, and a lot more. the philippines, being a tropical nation, offers more than just a plate of fun things to do, see, and experience this summer season.

and yes, i am still bias for cebu when we start talking about beaches. and i don't mean just the beach resorts you will find in mactan. recently, i was able to tour around the entire province and witnessed the naturally beautiful white sand beaches that surround the entire island. yes, these are beaches untainted by commercialism and are open for the public to enjoy.

small business idea : italy silver 925





my wife and i decided to venture into another small business that require small capital. i'm talking about opening a small shop selling authentic italy 92.5 silver jewelries - rings, necklace, bracelet, earrings, bangles, anklets and more. i also created a blog for this business at silver925philippines (click the link to go to the site)

92.5 silver refers to the highest grade for silver jewelries. it's only 92.5 and not 100 percent silver because a grade of more than 92.5 will be so soft that it cannot be molded to create jewelries. silver with 92.5 percent grade also do not stain, rust, or fade. it remains shiny with proper care.

we are looking for subdealers too. our subdealers get 20% off the price of all our items. just go to 
silver925philippines.blogspot.com for more information. more pictures of our items will be posted in that site.

taking the philippines hostage








stakeholders of the country's tourism industry have been shedding blood and tears to promote the philippines as a perfect getaway for tourists who want to enjoy tropical paradise and experience the combination of sun, sea, and sand. it seems that the efforts of the tourism players are paying off as the number of tourists coming into the country increased after the dot managed to ward off the bad news that had been happening in mindanao.

suddenly, a former police officer, who was stripped of his badge and income, is staging a hostage drama that will surely hit the tourism industry straight in the eye. at least 20 hong kong nationals, who after reading the the travel brochures about the philippines decided to come here for fun and leisure, are now being held hostage by the policeman inside the tourist bus infront of the quirino grandstand.
