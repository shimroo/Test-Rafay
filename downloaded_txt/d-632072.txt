our company
at ditek, we believe that our employees are the heart of our business, and we’re committed to fostering a company culture that is secure, respects diversity and encourages employees to reach their full potential. we consider our people to be one of our most valuable resources and every employee plays an important part in our winning team, whether they have just joined our workforce or have been employed with ditek for a long time.
today the business operates with more than 100 us-based employees and has been voted as one of the top employers in the tampa bay region for 15 years running. “the best part is that we’re the only manufacturer to make the list every year… and i know every person’s name and their kids because i care about each of them,” says robert mcintyre, ditek founder, former ceo, and current board chairman.
our company’s operational ethos rests upon three guiding principles: treat employees with respect, offer quality products and service, and give back.
company history
robert (bob) mcintyre, a navy veteran, founded ditek in 1988 in largo, florida. it started with a chance meeting at a super bowl party in the late 1970’s between robert and an entrepreneur making surge protection in his garage. after 10 years of business together, robert’s partner sadly passed, prompting robert to start ditek on his own in 1988.  he and his wife, joanne, developed the company into a multigenerational family business, eventually passing the leadership to his daughters, wendy gattis and melissa lostraglio. wendy gattis now serves as the ceo, while melissa lostraglio is the vice president of administration.
ditek in the community
from the beginning, robert instilled the value of supporting the local community. ditek’s success in business has allowed us to give back and actively support organizations that serve children, particularly in education and youth activities. beneficiaries include the pinellas county education foundation (enterprise village, finance park, violet milne mcintyre scholarship, yes i can, pride awards, take stock in children, evening of excellence, next generation entrepreneurs), the pinellas county sheriff’s office (ride with the stars, sheriff golf tournament, and the bob parlaman memorial fund), clearwater for youth, the beth dillinger foundation, indian rocks christian school stem program, pinellas pal, casa, pace and a number of youth sport teams.
in late 2023, ditek also partnered with the local habitat for humanity chapter to provide surge protection on the homes they build in the area, ensuring the electrical and hvac systems are proactively preserved and protected.
“giving back to deserving organizations in our local community is not only personally fulfilling, but also allows us to put company values into action,” notes ditek ceo wendy gattis. “as my father once said, ‘nothing is too small to make a difference. do something, anything, and it will come back to you.’”
ditek has been recognized as one of florida trend magazine’s suncoast fast 50 technology companies. ditek also received the governor’s business leadership award, recognizing the company for its strong record of capital investment, employment growth, community involvement, and civic contributions.
