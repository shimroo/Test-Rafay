the frederick news-post does not have a print edition on monday because it is presidents day, a federal holiday. the u.s. postal service doesn’t deliver mail, including the news-post. instead, the news-post published an electronic edition available to subscribers through epages at fredericknewspost.com. we will have a similar digital edition for future federal holidays.
