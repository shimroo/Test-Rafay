scripture readings for february 16, 2025sixth sunday after epiphany
blessings and curses abound on the sixth sunday after epiphany. we would do well to listen closely to whom the “blessed ares” and the “woe tos” are directed and to find our place in the crowd among those who desire to touch jesus. the risen christ stands among us in the mystery of the holy supper with an invitation to live in him, and offers power to heal us all.
jeremiah 17:5-10; psalm 1; 1 corinthians 15:12-20; luke 6:17-26
