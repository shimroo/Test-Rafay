congratulations goes out to the #1 ranked players on the year end 2023-24 ndfc youth ranking lists, as of september 30, 2024. 

#1 ranked junior female - caidynce rever (ab) has earned an invitation to the next wdf youth world masters
#1 ranked senior female - kylie chapman (ab) has earned an invitation to the next wdf adult world masters (dependent on the number of adult invitations canada receives) 
#1 ranked junior male - ben goddard (wo) has earned an invitation to the next wdf youth world masters
#1 ranked senior male - nathan osmond (ab) has earned an invitation to the next wdf adult world masters (dependent on the number of adult invitations canada receives) 

         
saylee blois (ab), who tied in points with caidynce but was #2 because of the ranking tie-breaker, has also earned an invitation to the next wdf youth world masters.
with the newly created jdc canada program, powered by maximum darts, caidynce rever and ben goddard have also earned a direct invitation to the new jdc canada finale for a chance to represent team canada at the jdc world championships in gibraltor. this qualifier finale will be held during the 2025 youth nationals in ste-hyacinthe.
we'd also like to thank all of the organizers that have ran ndfc youth ranked tournaments in canada this past season. the ndfc encourages all adult tournament organizers to consider adding a youth ranked event to their next tournament. see the ndfc youth ranked tournament package for more information.
