begin your new life!

take that first step to reach your dreams
welcome to my website! i’ve been on the internet since the early 1980s and have been publishing books and content since 1987. i launched this lisashea.com website on december 3rd, 2001.
i have published over 500 books. my focus is on supporting battered women’s shelters. most of my fiction features female characters, young to old, overcoming adversity and finding their inner strength. i write in a wide range of genres from fairy tale to mystery, from romance to dystopian, from science fiction to paranormal.
i also enjoy writing self-help books to assist people in making progress in their lives. i have books on yoga, meditation, stress relief, eating healthily, journaling, photography, and much more.
when i’m not writing i enjoy a range of visual artistic expression including watercolors, photography, cyanotypes, monotypes, and origami.
i enthusiastically enjoy helping people reach their dreams!
want to finally write that novel? need step-by-step instructions for getting it published? looking for how to work from home in some other field? i’m here to help. i know these things are possible because i’m doing them right now and have been for over ten years. tens of thousands of people visit my site daily and put into practice the tips i share. it all starts with that first step.
i’ve also got articles on thousands of other practical situations. how to hand-train parakeets. how to cure poison ivy. how to meditate. how to fall asleep more easily. an introduction to yoga. a birding encyclopedia. video game walkthroughs. money origami folding instructions. there are nearly 88,000 articles and photos on this site. there’s something just for you!
if you’re a methodical type you can browse my site map to get started, or if you’re more free-form why not:
