                                        flowers were fresh, admired by all attending and delivered on time. delivery person called me sunday morning because funeral home was not answering delivery door.  asked if he could go in the front.  told him to do so but then back door was answered.  he could have left but went through the process of calling me.  to me this went beyond the expected.  will always use this company!
