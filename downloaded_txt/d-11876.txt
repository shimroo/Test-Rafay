ystd was cigarette smell in my room... and the whole office and i had to open windows and use air purifier to get rid of the lingering smell...and today...omg...was overnight urine smell...i was at the showroom and i smelt sth fishy and tot maybe i sweat and stink then when i walked nearer to the toilet the smell got stronger so i opened the toilet doorto my horror...  i tot i was going to die.. the smell was so strong and the color...omg...it must be the doing of the same person..becoz the others dont come into the office in the late night...if its not him.. then its someone he brought into the office...there's soil all over the showroom floor...how can someone be so inconsiderate?i was so happy i was 15mins early for work then  in the end i spent the 15 mins washing the toilet....i really want to die... till now i still got the vomiting feeling...sickening...ahh... feel so sick now...
