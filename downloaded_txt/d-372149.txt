welcome to the home of the network time protocol (ntp) project.


the ntp project conducts research and development in ntp, a protocol designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network to a common timebase. ntp is what ensures the reliability of billions of devices around the world, under the sea, and even in space. accurate timekeeping is vital to the many applications which have revolutionized and are essential to our daily lives: satellites, gps, 5g, financial services, healthcare, and more.
the ntp project produces an open source reference implementation of the ntp standard, maintains the implementation documentation, and develops the protocol and algorithmic standard that is used to communicate time between systems. background information about ntp can be found in the reference library.
network time foundation provides support for the ntp project. learn more about the foundation’s work.
