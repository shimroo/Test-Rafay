amanda dottermanî¤³î¤³î¤³î¤³î¤³  


						when i was watching a kitten, she hurt her paw playing a little too rough. i immediately called every vet in the area, only to be told they couldn't help me for 4 weeks or that they weren't taking new clients. until i called wheatfield animal hospital! they got me an appointment the same day and even gave the kitten her vaccinations while she was there. they took such good care of of this kitten! i'm seriously thinking about taking my own cat here now!					






carol snyderî¤³î¤³î¤³î¤³î¤³  


						when my puppy foot/leg was stepped on i cannot express how happy i am with them.  when other vets said take her to emergency vet or plan on a two week wait to see her, wheatfield said bring her right in.  wow exceptional care and staff!ðŸ’–

						when i called to make an appointment for urgent care, they were great with getting me in for a next day visit. everyone i spoke with was friendly and informative. i did not receive food news about my dogs condition, but the vet was great at explaining everything so i could understand and was so caring when i had a hard time processing the bad news. i did not have a bad experience with anyone and they really took care of my baby.
