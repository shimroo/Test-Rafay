retail & lock-down security solutions  
 



understandably, one of the biggest worries retailers have is protecting their stores from theft. shoplifting accounts for a significant amount of shrinkage. although shop owners and managers may train their employees to watch for any attempts to steal merchandise, the unfortunate truth is that they can’t see everything that happens on the floor.surveillance cameras can watch over the vast majority of a store, but that’s all they can do. to help ensure shoplifters cause as little damage to the bottom line as possible, retailers need active anti-theft security solutions. at se-kure controls, inc.® we have a wide selection of retail security products to keep items where they’re supposed to be — and out of the hands of would-be thieves.
