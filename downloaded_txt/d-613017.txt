  hibernation  


				so, people have been asking... "what happened to mybaycity.com?"
				

				simply put, things change.  the publisher, editor, and programmers
				are well past retirement age.
				
				our main writer, dave rogers, passed away.
				our ad salesman, jim hollerback, also passed.
				

				things began to look like it could be time to stop.
				but we can't just close it out!
				instead in mid-may 2020 we just let the system hibernate.  
				
				everything remains in place.
				someone younger may want to pick up the torch.
				if that's you, just say something.
				

				in the meantime, thanks to all of our loyal readers.
				you made this e-publication so successful over the past twenty years and 
				over 11,500 articles.  
				without you we'd never have had the success that we did.
