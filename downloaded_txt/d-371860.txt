cmdalias: multi word alias

link: cmdalias: multi word alias: "just a small tool to help me (and you but without any guaranty) to create command alias and sub-aliases (multi word alias) - adoy/cmdalias" 
linked is not a recommendation - as i have not tried it. but i've been typing lots of repetitive commands the last few days and i got to thinking that having a way to have aliases which were more than a single word would make them easier to remember and more flexible. this is one that i found

browserai: run local llms inside your browser

link: browserai: run local llms inside your browser: "run local llms inside your browser. contribute to sauravpanda/browserai development by creating an account on github." 
this could be important. linked is a tool that allows you to run an llm locally in your browser. why is that interesting? after all you can already run it locally, just on your laptop. i think, if this thing works, one can provide llm features as part of a sas app, while guaranteeing your users that their information is staying with them and not going into “the cloud”.

a gentle introduction to sql queries

link: a gentle introduction to sql queries: "in this tutorial we will learn about the concepts behind the sql syntax. we will go through the basics of how to use the from and where clauses, and move on to more advanced topics like joins, aggregations and subqueries.
if you’re anything like me, sql is one of those things that may look easy at first (it reads just like regular english!), but for some reason you can’t help but google the correct syntax for almost every query." 
linked is a handy little sql tutorial and guide.

programming languages that blew my mind

link: programming languages that blew my mind: "i’ve been a programmer since the age of 8, and some kind of developer for most of my life. throughout my life as a coder, both hobbyist and professional, i’ve learnt plenty of programming languages that felt like cookie-cutter clones of each other, but also a few programming languages that changed the way i looked at programming, sometimes even at thinking." 
linked is a cool review of esoteric (some) programming language that you (might) have never heard of
