dano's place
feb 26, 2010 under bible studies, revelation, the prophecy of revelation, the seven seals and seven trumpets are finished, the
timeline is complete, now we will move forward to the several other visions. you too can understand the book of revelations
attention friends, brothers in christ, and visitors: danos place will be moving. up to this point it has been a
subdomain of the gourd reserve, (www.danosplace.thegourdreserve.com), but this hurts the
standings of this website in search engines. danos place is getting its  own domain, www.danosplace.com.  if you currently type in danosplace dot com in the address window of your browser, you
will autmatically be forwarded to the right and current location. during the transition, there may be periods of time when it is offline due to
internet pointers catching up with the new location. my plans for this transition are to have it complete by the end of the month of
february.
god created the heavens and the earth in 7 days. he said it, i believe it, that settles it. to believe god literally and
completely may be the difference between you and moses or david. if you felt like god was telling you to go to the white house and talk to
the president, you would probably believe, no, that could never happen. if you felt like he was telling you to run into the
middle of a bunch of soldiers with guns, and start killing them with a sling shot, you would probably say that is suicide. moses was sceptical,
david did not even need to be told. he knew that god was bigger than goliath and he would use david as his soldier. like a child, with
unquestioning faith and belief. god could have described creation without the mention of days had it taken hhim thousands of years or millions of
years, but he did mention days, and he even went so far as to declare the length of a day by stating the evening and the morning make
the nth day. - dano
new study!! do you find revelations confusing?  would you like to be able to read it and get real meaning
out of it? then follow with me as i write and update a new study on the prophecies of revelations. i believe much has been misinterpreted, and
with this new study, i think everyone will be able to read and get real comprehension out of it.  this is just the first in a series of at
least two or three studies on the book of revelation. this one will focus on the prophecies, and the next will focus on the revelation of our
lord jesus christ. so check out the new study, and come back often to stay up.  i will try to add to this study on a daily basis until it is
complete, but there will be days beyond my control when i cannot spend the time on the computer. please don't get frustrated or give up if it
isn't updated every day, i hope and pray that it will be worth the wait. join the study
 



and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any
more pain; for the former things are passed away. rev 21:4
in many of my studies i have mentioned that it is the power of gods love that holds the nucleus of an atom together. god holds
our bodies together, and as david said, "we are fearfully and wonderfully made". here is a video about a microbiological component called
laminin. while very interesting, please remember that laminin is a fairly new discovery and with all the good intentions of science, it is often
found to be wrong later when some new discovery is made. likewise, laminin has been shown to not always be in the exact shape presented here, but
it does still remind us of gods awe inspring creation of the living body. not just the human body, but all life from the single cell, to the
perfect balance of life on the entire earth, to ponder the miracle of life is a voyage of infinte proportions. none the less, i hope you do watch
this full presentation as it does give some meat to chew on.






again, this is science, discovered and defined by man, it is not gods word and should not be used in place of gods word, but as i
stated before, regardless of what might be discovered later, here is yet another small thing to add to the wonders of life, and gods magnificent
perfection.

it's the stuff nightmares are made of, do you own any of this stuff?
cute video with important message





no only your kids, but do you question what you watch on tv? it was said during the release of the television, that this is the
greatest brainwashing tool ever placed before humans.  you can reach them in their home where they let their guards down and are more
susceptable to influence. you don't really think that a person or group of people could actually deceive do you? it only takes the right one to
deceive and that deception will spread. remember, it isn't about a group of people trying to coordiate a massive deception, that is flesh
thinking.  be spirit thinking, it isn't about people, it is about the devil trying to take over the world, the greatest deceiver of all
time, since the deception of eve. he will succeed in deceiving mankind and even many believers will be deceived, as if it were possible even
the very elect would be deceived. there is a global dictator already in television that tell us in this country why we should hate and fear
those of another country, and that countries machine is telling its people why they should hate and fear us. hmmm, the work of god or the devil?
what do you believe?
jesus loves you this much!
sept 24, 2007 - i'm sure most of you have seen or heard the saying, jesus loves you this much, accompanied with the outstretched
arms or an image of such. i'd like you to consider this --> go outside on a clear night and really contemplate the stars, the universe, and
the size of the universe.  even before jesus hung on the cross, god showed us how much he loves you by spreading the expanse of the
heavens.  as stated in genesis, the greater light for the day and the lesser light to rule the night, and all the stars were put in place
for signs and for seasons.  imagine at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, it would take 30,000 years to reach the center of our
galaxy, and that is just one galaxy in a countless number of galaxies across the seemingly unlimited universe.  god put every single star in
place for you, and for me to show his love for each of us is beyond reach.  you might say, before jesus spread his arms for us, our heavenly
father spread his arms our to show the immensity of his love for us.  
are these two verses related?
deut 32:22 for a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with
her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
ok, if a fire is consuming the earth, (from the inside out), the foundations of the mountains must be that which holds up
their massive weight.  if god has said this, then has he stated the final outcome of this consuming fire and his anger?  his anger
culminates in the outpouring of the wrath of god in revelation..
rev 16:18 and there were voices, and thunders, and lightning's; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not
since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
19 and the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great babylon came in remembrance before god, to give
unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
20 and every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
immediately following the disappearance of the mountains and islands the earth is bombarded with great hail stones falling
from heaven. 
and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed god
because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

    if the mountains and islands collapsed into the earth, the sea which borders many mountain ranges would also fall with them into the core,
    much of the water would be trapped in massive amounts where molten lava at thousands of degree's would heat up the trapped water causing it
    to explode. water expands 100 times when converted to steam. (have you even poured a few drops of water into a deep fat fryer?) this massive
    explosion about 1/3 the size of a continent, (in the case of america), would cast rock and stone probably for thousands of
    miles. read the article on earthquakes
