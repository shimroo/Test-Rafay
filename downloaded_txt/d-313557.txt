gleanntan has been responsibly breeding healthy and sound skye terriers for 55 years without interruption. gleanntan has produced some of the breed’s greats with all-breed best in show winners, best in specialty show winners, and the breed’s top producers. gleanntan skyes have been regarded for their strong breed type and sweet temperaments. 






















ch. gleanntan feather duster - “dusty” - born in 1971 and owned by jane lodgethis photo has always been one of my favorites, because it captures a skye from gleanntan’s second litter. it also serves as a reminder to me that, while bone and strength are essential breed characteristics, it it also important that skyes be attractive, with quintessential “terrier expression.”
