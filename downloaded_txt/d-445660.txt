  click here for the list of ho stuff. 
click here for the list of n-scale stuff. 
i grew up in central wisconsin, near the soo line main between chicago and minneapolis,
so much of what i've collected over the years is from that railroad.
since then i've lived in minnesota, texas, north carolina, kentucky, florida and tennessee.
because of that experience i've collected a few pieces representing
southern pacific, louisville & nashville, and nashville, chattanooga & st. louis.
contact me by email (link at the bottom of the page) if you're interested. thanks!
