marlin provides information to support marine conservation, management and planning. our resources are based on available scientific evidence and designed for all stakeholders, from government agencies and industry to naturalists and the public. marlin hosts the largest review of the effects of human activities and natural events on marine species and habitats yet undertaken.






marine biodiversity and conservation
information on the biology of species and the ecology of habitats found around the coasts and seas of the british isles.  the information includes those species and habitats that characterize our shores or that require conservation and protection.

marine evidence and sensitivity assessment
information on the likely sensitivity of species and habitats to the pressures resulting from human activities or natural events.   access to evidence databases on marine biological traits, seabed indicators, the effects of fisheries, and marine protected areas.
