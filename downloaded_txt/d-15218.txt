dark reddish-purple with a bright garnet edge, stolpman la quadrilla  starts with a floral blast of freshly ground black pepper on the nose, quickly joined by notes of black cherries and blackberries and a hint of tobacco leaf. all that delight comes together in a bright, ripe but balanced flavor framed by food-friendly acidity, lingering with palatable tannins in a very long finish.

bosnia-herzegovina? when we hear the name of this balkan nation, sadly, we’re more likely to think of war, ethnic cleansing, and genocide than wine.

 dark reddish-purple mi terruño “expresión” mendoza cabernet franc surrounds cherry and plum aromas with whiffs of cocoa, fresh herbs, and a hint of wood smoke. it’s dry and freshly acidic on the palate; plum and cherry carry over from the nose and add black pepper notes and gentle smoke testifying to its relatively brief stay in oak barrels.
