sportsman gun safes vs. box store gun vaults

				research shows consumers who buy box store gun safes think they are getting a high quality safe. but this couldn't be further from the truth. most of these drywall gun safes are unable to withstand standard fires and can be pried open easily. selling factory-direct allows sportsman safes to offer you twice the fire and security. our 2" step doors, 6000 degree concrete fireproofing & 3/4" thick pry-resistant frames reflect how real safes are built. most box store gun safes are manufactured with inexpensive drywall fire board and thin security doors. not sportsman safes. our 6000 degree concrete fireproofing is 4 x more fire resistant than drywall and our 2" step doors have two strength points; similar to how commercial-grade safes are built. call us today for gun safes on sale - 800 266-7150.
