edsman spotlight







i live in conneaut, so people always ask me why i drive so far. i do it because iron sharpens iron. i want to be the very best i can be, both in the classroom and in sports. to do that, i have to surround myself with iron—top teachers, coaches, and classmates.

you can't be comfortable and grow at the same time. that’s why the service learning program pushes us out of our comfort zones. i spend time at the greater cleveland food bank, and have met so many people — cool people i otherwise probably wouldn't have talked with.

nick variglotti ’25






i really looked up to the edsmen i met as a camper at get the edge! i had this overwhelming sense they had my back, and it was a big part of why i chose to attend st. ed's. now i’m a counselor and i hope to pass along that same feeling.

charlie mcgurer ’25






in a traditional classroom, you have one teacher and a group of students. in an ib classroom, everyone is a teacher. we all learn from each other!

nate sinchak ’25






at the empowered maker challenge, we spent a weekend working together to design and produce a cup holder and storage area for sean's wheelchair. it was intense—i only got a few hours of sleep! however, seeing his smile when we presented our solution was amazing!

will day ’25






at st. ed’s, we learn by doing. you'll find yourself studying french by writing skits, preparing and eating french food, watching french films, and other out-of-the-box activities. we're never stuck in our seats!

heri ramadhani ’25






i've now visited ghana, london, paris, and the netherlands. the people i've met on these school trips have given me a new perspective. our challenges may differ, but i focus on the commonalities we share.

andy scott ’25






mrs. munnell challenges us to search for meaning in films and photography. that got me thinking about scars. other people see only an injury, but the scar has a story. i created an entire photo essay about people and their scars; i'll never look at gnarled skin the same way!

archer soltis ’25






i love the st. andre scholars program because it helps people understand people like me. i love being an edsman!

nick gray ’25






we have many great business classes that taught me how to network, define an audience, and market my services; lessons i've already put to use with my graphic design business. you can see my work on the school's athletic instagram pages!

danny ottiger ’25






i'm vp of the student diversity association. we bring in speakers and plan events that celebrate the different faiths and cultural identities represented in our student body. our work lets every student know that no matter who he is or where he comes from, he's our brother.

angel hillsman ’25






it's the people who make up a school. bonds and connection are what it really means to be an edsman.
