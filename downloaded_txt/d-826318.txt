the national turfgrass federation is now partnering with the u.s. national arboretum in developing an initiative exploring turfgrass and the turfgrass industry. the initiative, entitled ‘grass roots', will run for four years and features an outdoor turfgrass exhibit, as well as programs, symposia, demonstrations, workshops and so much more. the turfgrass industry has been instrumental in contributing funding to hire a grass roots coordinator and to develop and install the outdoor turf exhibit. we now need your help to raise the funding necessary to maintain the exhibit for the next four years. information on grass roots can be found on the left side of our main page.
