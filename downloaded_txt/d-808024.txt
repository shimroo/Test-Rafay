attention mccu members:

fraudsters are always finding new ways to target our community, including attempting to spoof our phone number. to help you stay secure, here are some essential tips:
mccu will never request personal info by phone: we will never call and ask for your debit card number, account details, or passwords. if you receive such a call, hang up immediately and reach out to us using a verified phone number.
stay alert to caller id spoofing: even if a call appears to come from mccu, always be cautious. when in doubt, hang up and contact us directly to verify.
double-check caller identity: if something feels off, ask for the caller’s name, department, and callback number. then, independently verify their information before sharing anything sensitive.
report any suspicious activity: if you suspect you’ve encountered a scam or spoofing attempt, report it to us and the appropriate authorities as soon as possible. your vigilance helps protect the entire community.
keep informed: stay updated on the latest fraud tactics targeting financial institutions. we’re here to provide you with the resources and alerts needed to recognize and avoid these threats.
thank you for your ongoing efforts in helping us safeguard your financial security!
