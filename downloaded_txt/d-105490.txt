                    the division of licensure and regulatory services involves the oversight and enforcement of five regulatory programs: private security services; 
                    bail bondsmen; bail enforcement agents; special conservators of the peace; and tow truck drivers. the division supports our constituents and 
                    professionals who serve the private side of public safety.
