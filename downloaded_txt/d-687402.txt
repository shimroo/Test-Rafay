welcome to tropical rayz tanning beds

now you can buy 
				commercial 
	
   tanning beds with style and steel!   
				introducing 
				the tropical rayz indoor tanning systems: a combination of 
   solid steel, tropical designs, and a great value in indoor tanning equipment.  please select from one of the following links to view pricing, 
   details, and specifications of each of our models:  
				
commercial tanning beds 
				or 
				
home tanning beds.  
				view our complete lineup here >>>
						our home and commercial 
tanning beds are solid steel...not just the frame, but the entire bed! other 
				solid steel components of our indoor tanning equipment include 
				the "skin", acrylic supports, and the most important: the front 
				rail support (the place where everyone sits before swinging into 
				the bed to lie down).
				
			  

				

 we believe in our solid steel construction 
				 and the durability of design. our tanning salon equipment will last at least 15 years in a moderately used salon environment, our competitor's plastic covered tanning beds last only 3 or 4 years in a tanning salon environment and in some cases, they do not make replacement parts for tanning beds older than 4 years old.   
we have parts for every bed we have ever manufactured.  this includes parts 
for the grandfather of the tropical rays model:  sunal tanning beds, which 
are still in operation today at a salon near you. 
				

 we manufacture the only all-steel  (not just the frame) and welded together 
	 home tanning bed on the internet today.  our residential tanning beds are built with the same components
	 as our  
	 commercial tanning beds.  which means you get commercial quality for residential prices.  we utilize one ballast per lamp, unlike many home units which drive two lamps with one ballast to reduce costs.  please compare our life time guarantee 
	 tanning bed versus the competition and you will see why spending a few extra dollars is worth it!

	 tanning beds.

				and we build tanning beds in the us 
				from the ground up 
				in our 
				
				sheet metal job shop and prototype building facility in 
				central florida.

				sunal 
				design, the 
				

				tropical rayz tanning beds, the south beach stand up tanning 
				booth, and the

				luxury tanning bed line featuring the uv scan 360 high pressure 
				bed pictured here.
