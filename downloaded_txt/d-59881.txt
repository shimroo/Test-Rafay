2 hrs ago



a delta air lines plane has flipped upon arrival at toronto’s pearson airport and ended up on its roof, injuring 18 people. the airport's chief executive says all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries. the flight from minneapolis attempted to land on a dry runway at around 2:15 p.m. monday in toronto. wind gusts of up to 40 mph were blowing snow at the time. the cause of the crash remains under investigation. video from the scene shows the mitsubishi crj-900lr upside down on the snowy tarmac as emergency workers hosed it down. the plane was somewhat obscured by snow from a winter storm that hit toronto over the weekend.
