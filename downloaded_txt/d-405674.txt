                        what a pleasant surprise!  srb is back and fantastic. great atmosphere, friendly staff and generous portions!    i tried the three piece fish and chips with bowl of clam chowder.  it was cooked to perfection.  i couldn't be happier.  plenty of inside and outdoor seating.  restaurant and restrooms were very clean.  i can't say enough good things.
