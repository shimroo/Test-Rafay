gourmet:
cooper’s mill was established in 1969 and produces high-quality jams, jellies, relishes, sauces and fruit butters that offer customers a “difference you can taste.” cooper’s irresistible apple butter is cooked slowly in 50-gallon copper kettles over a wood fire, and the delicious jams and jellies are made in small batches so that the best flavor and consistency is obtained every time. no artificial colors, sweeteners, preservatives, corn syrups or dyes are ever used in the manufacturing process. only simple, all-natural ingredients go into every jar.
