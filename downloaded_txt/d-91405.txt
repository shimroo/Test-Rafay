about us: womenâs international center was founded in 1982 as a non-profit education and service foundation [501c3] with the mission to âacknowledge, honor, encourage and educate womenâ. for more than thirty years at our living legacy awards ceremonies, we have brought hundreds of people together to celebrate the accomplishments and lasting contributions of women. many now know, understand, appreciate, and hopefully incorporate, the gifts women have given to improve our world. we have gathered some of civilizationâs great women and men whose deeds have genuinely benefitted humanity. our honoree list of over 300 is a veritable âwhoâs who' of global innovators and humanitarians.
