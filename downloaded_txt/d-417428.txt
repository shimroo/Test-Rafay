sanctuary institute

little flower ufsd is a certified sanctuary institute, symbolizing an organization’s commitment to providing a higher level of care, a trauma-sensitive environment for the people they serve and a better work environment for employees. sanctuary certification requires re-evaluation every three years, as it is designed to promote, sustain and strengthen an organization’s commitment to the maintenance of a trauma informed culture for all of its stakeholders.

therapeutic crisis intervention (tci) 

little flower proudly implements the therapeutic crisis intervention (tci) training program for child and youth care staff. developed by cornell university, tci presents a crisis prevention and intervention model designed to teach staff how to help children learn constructive ways to handle crisis. the ability of the entire organization to respond effectively to children and young people in crisis situations is critical in establishing not only a safe environment, but also one that promotes growth and development.

restorative practices

the district is committed to its implementation of restorative practices, an emerging social science that studies how to strengthen relationships between individuals as well as social connections within communities. proven to dramatically improve the school climate and strengthen the social and emotional skills of young people and adults, restorative approaches address the underlying reasons for students’ hurtful behavior and nurture their intrinsic desire to treat others with care and respect.
