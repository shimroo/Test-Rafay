the best praise 



testimonials 
















dan is a natural storyteller. the lectures are both an accessible guide into understanding the human mind and an eloquent examination of relationships that are scientifically accurate and understandable to the lay clinician. 






mario cepeda, mft 












freud’s theory of the unconscious and darwin’s model of evolution continue to help us understand the findings from current research on human behavior….daniel siegel’s theory of mindsight— the brain’s capacity for both insight and empathy—offers a similar ‘aha!’ “ 






daniel golemanauthor, emotional intelligence
