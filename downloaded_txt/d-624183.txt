delivering operations research and analytics innovation


the airline group of the international federation of operational research societies (agifors) is a professional society dedicated to the advancement and application of operational research within the airline industry. the membership consists of operational research professional employed by recognized civil airlines and related industries and correspondents keenly interested in the application of operational research to aviation problems.
agifors is the outcome of informal discussions between six airline operational research workers (from air france, bea, klm, sabena, swissair and trans canada) who were present at the second international conference in operational research at aix en provence, france, in 1960. these informal discussions led to the formation of a committee, which organized a symposium on the use of operational research within the airline industry, at spring valley, new york in october 1961. this symposium was deemed successful and resulted in the formation of agifors as a professional society dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and new advances in operations research within the airline industry.
today the agifors membership exceeds 2000 professionals representing more than 500 airlines, airline manufacturers, universities and aviation related companies and associations.
