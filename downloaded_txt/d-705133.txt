excellent furniture buying experience! salesperson mahogany freeman was a real pleasure to work with. when told what i was looking for, she directed me to several options around the store. she had great patience with my pickiness about style, etc.! ultimately i found exactly the sofa i was looking for and made the purchase. delivery was on time by a friendly crew. i’ve purchased from turner’s in the past and would not hesitate to do so again. thanks again, mahogany! i’m enjoying the sofa!

i live in valdosta but decided to go to thomasville to check this store out. there were so many beautiful pieces to choose from so it took me a while to decide what i wanted and my house is not a big open floor plan with lots of space. derek was very helpful and patient. i did buy a few things. i will definitely shop with turners again. service is always great!

my family has been shopping at turners for 50+ years. we bought a chair from lori five years ago and when it was time to by a lift chair for my mom, lori was the one we sought out. she is friendly, professional and knows her business
