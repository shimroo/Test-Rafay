why is grant money available? 


 the federal and state governments 
            are required by law to issue grants for many diverse needs. the influx 
            of grant money into the economy creates jobs, which in turn creates 
            more tax revenue and reduces individual (and corporate) dependency 
            on government subsistence programs. 







with our economy in severe downturns, the need to distribute this free money and create jobs to jump start the economy has become 
                  critical. 
                  many corporations and foundations are required to grant a 
                  certain amount of their assets annually for a variety of 
                  reasons. foundations are required to give away at least 5% of 
                  their total assets each year to maintain their tax-exempt 
                  status. 
                  all of these programs don't require credit checks, 
                  collateral, security deposits or co-signers, even if you have 
                  a bankruptcy or bad credit, you as a taxpayer and u.s. citizen 
                  are entitled to this money.

  outs to helping average people start their own small business. they also give grant 
  money to students, men, women, children and minorities to go to attend private

   medical bills, general welfare and much more!
