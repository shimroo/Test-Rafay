about wdi
wilmington downtown, inc’s roots go all the way back to when it was formed as d.a.r.e. (downtown area revitalization effort) in 1977 as a public-private partnership between the city of wilmington and the private sector. wdi has been providing excellent – and evolving – economic development services to downtown for over 40 years. today, the three main areas of focus for wdi are business recruitment and retention, developer services and public outreach. if it has something to do with economic development and our downtown, you can bet that wdi is involved!
wdi is partially funded by the city of wilmington and new hanover county but also relies heavily on private donations. our organization is able to operate with the support of our partners. wdi is a registered 501(c)(3) organization, and all donations are tax-deductible as allowed by the irs. we encourage you to invest in your downtown, and we are proud to call anyone donating $100 or more a wdi partner! click here to learn more about wdi and our partnership program.

about msd
ever noticed our ambassadors walking around downtown? they work for the municipal service district (msd), which is managed by wdi. the downtown wilmington msd was originally created by city council on december 6, 2016 and began operating at the start of the new city fiscal year on july 1, 2017. as per the state enabling legislation, msd’s allow local governments to increase the assessments on real and personal property within a defined district to pay for an enhanced level of “clean and safe” services, over and above what is normally provided.
