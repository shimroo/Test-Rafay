      it‚Äôs all good at minerals hotel 
  

this has such a welcoming & relaxing atmosphere. the views everywhere you look are spectacular-whether you are at the pool or in your room, or sitting outside, every view is breath taking. the food and beverages are excellent. the body scrub i got was excellent. i saw jules in the elements spa and it was the best body scrub i have ever had. the room was comfortable, clean and it was easy to get to the perfect temperature. the lobby & convenience store on premises are on the same level so you can grab a coffee, coconut water, or a just water, a snack-all kinds of things- i was very pleased with their selections. and you can sit comfortably and wait to meet up with friends or family-it was so perfect-even the weather was perfect! and you can even sit out & make s‚Äômores believe it or not. it was an exceptional weekend. looking forward to doing it again.

      great experience!!
  

i have never written a trip advisor review before (i rarely write reviews in general) but i had to write a review just to set the record straight - this place is amazing! my family and i had the best time. seriously, my kids all agreed that this was their favorite vacation ever. there was so much to do, the rooms were spacious and clean (we got 2 connecting rooms), the grounds were beautiful. my kids loved all the pools and activities like rock climbing, archery, movie night, crafts, axe throwing, etc. special shout out to sheryl in the adventure club- she was so warm, friendly and patient with a really positive vibe, and sue and alex at the front desk were so pleasant and accommodating. really great experience and we will definitely be back!








      august 2024
  








      great trip to grand cascades
  

this was our first time and we will definitely be back. the property was beautiful and my two boys were very happy hopping from one pool to the next! our room was spacious and we loved having a kitchen to keep our little ones happy. the meals we ate on the property were delicious. next time i would love to check out the spa.








      august 2024
  








      relaxing weekend with my bff
  

had a wonderful relaxing time. all the staff were friendly and attentive to all our needs. the room was clean and comfortable, and the pool was a joy. the entertainment at the moonshine bar was fantastic. they played all of "our music". i highly recommend this for a girl's weekend, a family reunion or a couple's getaway. they really cater to all. p.s. the breakfast buffet was delicious!!








      july 2024 
  








      we will definitely be back.
  

the employees were excellent. a great spa experience. the food was very good. the property was a "taste of heaven". my wife and i had a very relaxing time. both the indoor and outdoor pools were great. the wine tour and the wine tasting that we attended was very informative. susan wagner the wine director really knows her stuff.








      july 2024 
  








      slice of heaven on earth!
  

the rooms are huge, modern and clean. i‚Äôve been here during the winter and summer and there is always something to do. i stayed at grand cascades and that allowed access to minerals property which is also fabulous. my family and i have decided to make it an annual event because it is a one stop shop for family, fun, relaxation, fine dining, countless activities and so much more!!








      july 2024
  








      great family getaway! 
  

we came for our friends wedding and decided to bring the kids with us to make a long weekend of it! the resort was very family friendly with lots of activities for the kids and adults!! the kids loved swimming in the pools, splashing around in the splash pad, playing in the game room, and seeing the animals at the petting zoo. my husband and i enjoyed the easy access to all amenities, the great customer service and the comfy suite as our home base. we will definitely be coming back!








      june 2024 
  








      great experience 
  

we stayed at the minerals hotel, it was a great experience from the moment we checked in. kristan and blake, front desk, were extremely friendly and very helpful. they gave us all the information needed to go on the appalachian trail. the resort, our room was clean and ready when we arrived. lots of resort activities if you'd like to join or simply sit by any of the many pools. only one restaurant on site (a little pricey) but, the burger was excellent. we are planning another visit in early october. highly recommend this hotel.








      june 2024 
  








      thank you minerals staff!!
  

we had an absolutely amazing girls getaway for my daughter‚Äôs 16th birthday! from the moment we got to the front desk, we were greeted by krista who instantly bonded with my daughter and her bestie. throughout our entire three days we enjoyed activities like archery, the wild animal educators, the rock climbing wall, and the indoor/outdoor heated pools and hot tubs. we each got a facial and the spa was truly pampering! every single person i interacted with from the wait and bar staff, activities, housekeeping, janitorial, and the pool staff- everyone was friendly and truly seemed to be welcoming and caring. i‚Äôve traveled quite a bit and stayed at everything from luxury hotels to tiny motels and this is probably one of the best run resorts i‚Äôve ever stayed at. i saw staff regularly checking the ph in the hot tubs and pools, checking temperatures, and cleaning down hand rails. i would highly recommend a stay at minerals!








      april 2024 
  








      restaurant latour @ grand cascades lodge 
  

the hotel was very clean, with friendly staff, and the ambiance was relaxing and luxury vibes. it was a nice weekend getaway to relax and have a nice dinner. i enjoyed that the restaurants and amenities are in the same building as my hotel room which makes it so convenient to go to the pool and back to my room without going outside and getting in the car to go somewhere else. i wish i stayed longer to enjoy more of the hotel. i am telling my friends and family about this place.
