it is with great sorrow that we have decided to close texas street grill.
it was our hope to bring great quality food at great prices for mid-week dining to the steiner and lakeway communities.
our transition from 827rays to texas street did not go as planned.  we had successfully grown the texas street brand at our pavilion as a quality burger place for casual dining and when trying to associate this brand with our restaurant we confused our patrons on what we were really striving for……quality food for fine dining at reasonable prices.
we are however excited to announce that we are in the process of finalizing plans where executive chef wayne brooks would create a new concept under new leadership.
look out for the new vision where plans are being drafted for a stunning outdoor area and improved parking lot lighting in order to improve the visibility from rr620.
thanks for your patronage over the years and we appreciate your patience as we make additional improvements.  it will indeed be an exciting time with a spring opening in mind.
sincerely,
owners, texas street grill, dba
