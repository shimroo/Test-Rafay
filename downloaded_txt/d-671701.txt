lima memorial auxiliary celebrates generosity and service
the lima memorial auxiliary presented a remarkable $125,000 donation to the lima memorial foundation at its annual december meeting, honoring lima memorial’s 125th anniversary. this generous gift, the result of year-long fundraising efforts, will address the healthcare needs of our community now and into the future.
five extraordinary volunteers—karla donnelly, martha fisher, alberta jean mack, darlene saine, and sandra webb—were honored with the lifetime achievement award, having collectively contributed an astounding 18,425 hours of service.
new 2025 auxiliary officers were also announced: jackie binkley (president), tami hurley (president-elect), penelope rice (treasurer), mindi wells (recording secretary) and jan mccluer (corresponding secretary).
the celebration featured a festive holiday luncheon and a performance by the elida high school chorus, perfectly honoring the incredible impact of our volunteers and leaders.
to all our honorees, officers and volunteers—thank you for your unwavering dedication to great care!
