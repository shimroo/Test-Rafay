how to use this
                            site: if you are looking for a specific
                          species, use theâ  individual species index, which includes common
                          and scientific names. use the species group index to browse through
                          a list of the common names of each species grouped by category (e.g. "cats"). you
                          can also search the site using the search box in the top right. once at an individual
                          species' page, a summary about the animal's biology and history can be obtained from
                          the profile section near the top of the page. for detailed information, use the
                          clickable contents section or browse through the page.â
