the mint finally took hold, two years of drought later.the blackberries are blooming too, green thorns and white blossoms.her roses are doing great and i am tempted to poison them where they stand,mow them down, plow them under, bury them,and plant a goddamn boxwood where they were.instead, i haunt the usual places, hoping to run into her “accidentally”and say, “remember when you asked me if leaving was a mistake,and i said ‘yes, but it doesn’t matter what i say, you’ll do it anyway’?”well fuck you.

losers indeed
[may. 5th, 2010|05:53 pm]

i was camping last weekend and don’t have any musical review but the prophesy section got a major update so i slapped together this movie review as an excuse to broadcast this week’s episode. heed the prophets!film flamdegenerate sg gave a positive review to last week’s drive in selection, the losers. i think the only losers are the people that pay to see this stinker. except for the occasional plot hole big enough to fly a plane through, the film is predictable to the point of dull. only one action sequence even got the drive invaders clapping and the only excuse anyone could offer for the film was, “well, it was based on a comic book.”kick ass, iron man, the watchmen, sin city, hellboy – there are plenty of interesting stories told through the comic book medium that have translated well from still to motion pictures – but this ain’t one of them. this ranks down there with the punisher (any of the versions) or the fantastic four. don’t be a loser. skip it.( read more...collapse )

ear plugsnow in blog form for your flaming use!the atlanta mess-around:http://www.degeneratepress.com/wordpressin other news, bubbapalooza 2010 is scheduled for fri-sat may 28 & 29 at the star bar. bands scheduled to perform includethe billygoatscharlie pickettdex romweber duothe blacktop rocketscaroline & the ramblersthe psycho devillesghostrider car clubslim chance & the convictsam goldpinche gringothe madeirawalk the plankand many many more. a portion of the proceeds to benefit the familyof gregory dean smalleyfilm flamlast week’s drive in pick was kick ass, both the film and a description of the evening. i can understand why robert ebert would write, “will i seem hopelessly square if i find “kick-ass” morally reprehensible and will i appear to have missed the point?”yeah, you have missed the point. art, particularly action films based on comic books, is pure fantasy. the film shows almost exactly what i’d fantasize about when i was 11 and reading super hero comics. which is absurd and over the top and often gory, since even then i didn’t understand why the good guys let the bad guys live to fight another day. my ultimate hero would’ve been the character hit girl, an 11 year old who butchers the bad guys wholesale.but i don’t think this should be seen by 11 year olds. they see more than enough of this crap day to day and we don’t need to encourage violent fantasy any more than we already do. but that’s why it’s rated r, mr. ebert. so we adults can enjoy some retroactive adolescent fantasy and make adult decisions about how cool it is.and holy shit, it’s fuckin’ coooool.it borrows heavily from half a dozen action or super hero films, but it steals from the best and does so honestly, even dropping john woo’s name in one of the lines. in fact, the film looks like john woo directing watchmen, as penned by the scriptwriter for kids. it has a sense of humor about itself, yet turns on a dime back to a serious tone. we had a huge turn out at the drive in for the feature and everyone clapped and hooted and raved. so apologies to you, mr. ebert, but yes, you are hopelessly square.( read more...collapse )

it’s april, fools!“listen groucho is this an april fool's joke?? [no more degeneratepress??”degenerate z“good one - actually the first april fools joke i fell for this year!  it kind of bummed me out because you cover all the shows that i would like to go to, but otherwise don't have time for.  i know knee surgeries can be crazy, so i could totally see you retiring from the club circuit due to this.  that was a good one, and glad you'll be around for more good times to come.”degenerate jjyes, it was the 13th or so annual “no more degenerate press” april fools joke. i’ve been doing them so long some degenerates didn’t even believe i was having knee surgery. yet i still manage to catch a few folks every year, so it’s worth it. the joke, that is. the knee surgery was no joke, but i’m doing well. i haven’t even needed the prescribed pain meds. the stitches come out in a couple of weeks and hopefully i’ll be dancing a jig at a show and hiking up and down the hill at the river as spring turns to summer. though with the weather lately, it seems like summer is already here!speaking of, this wednesday is the first weekly drive invasion, coinciding with the monthly get delicious supper club. if you aren’t on either or both lists email me back and i’ll tell you how to get on board. in may we’re moving the supper club to sundays to take advantage of afternoon patio possibilities. join us!( read more...collapse )
