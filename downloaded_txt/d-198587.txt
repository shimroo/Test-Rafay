if youâre new to videoccasions, weâre a national and local award winning family owned and operated company in bellevue,
washington, catering to clients with a wide range of interests, as our list of services suggests.
judy, who worked in the video industry for several years, opened videoccasions in 1998 and was joined by jack, who has 
worked in television and related fields since 1964.


among those who work with videoccasionsâ clients we can point to more than 
175 years of professional experience in television and video, still photography 
and printing; theatre staging, design and lighting; computing, web design and  
the graphic arts, to help you create solutions to your video needs.
all the work at videoccasions is done locally and by hand, not shipped out-of-
state for processing by machine in a bulk plant. we process and inspect each 
film transfer, each download to flash drive or hard drive, each dvd we create 
and thereâs no risk of work being lost in transit. 
 come see us again.
