thank you!what a triumphant climb we had! huge thank you to all who supported our climbers. we had eleven incredible survivors join us up hyndman peak. you can learn more about these inspiring women and support them here.


























































our improved hike program is designed to meet each survivor where she is on her physical journey. everyone’s journey is different, and we celebrate each step, each milestone, each ‘summit.’ we will be meeting for training hikes, movement events, and social gatherings throughout the spring to ensure that we are physically, mentally, and emotionally supported on our journey to hyndman. for more information, please visit our climb page or contact hailey directly: ei@expeditioninspiration.org thanks!
