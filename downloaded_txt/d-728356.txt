police remembrance trust

the police remembrance trust operates throughout the united kingdom under a royal charter granted by queen elizabeth ii in 2018. the charity exists to ensure all those police officers who lost their lives on and in the line of duty are never forgotten.


this site will inform and update you about how the police remembrance trust is commemorating fallen police officers. in particular, we invite you to explore the uk police roll of honour to help you understand the service and sacrifice made by those men and women remembered within. our work relies on the support of the public by way of donations but also research and submissions to enhance the uk police roll of honour.
