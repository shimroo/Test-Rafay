reviews





















"brooke’s place helped her so much emotionally and for that i thank you.  it was so important for her to see that other teens were going through what she was and that she would be able to get through it and be okay. we both really appreciate the wonderful staff and will always remember those that we met along the way.  thanks again for everything."— brooke's place parent






















"i am so thankful for brooke's place. it got our family through some very dark times. i highly recommend it to anyone who's experienced a loss."— amy






















"i'm sure you don't remember me since it has been at least 12 years since my son came to brooke’s place. i think of you often and your kindness you gave to me and (my son).  he is doing great in school and in sports. most of all, he's a well rounded young man. i can't help but think that it's because of brooke’s place. i just wanted to thank you and your staff for everything you do for the children."— brooke's place parent






















"brooke’s place provided comfort at a time when i thought we couldn’t be comforted."— brooke’s place adult






















"thank you to all of brooke's place for being exactly what it is for. it is a wonderful mission everyone there fulfills. what is more important than helping to mend a broken heart? it is with brooke's place that we who attend are able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. we look around the group and see those who joined earlier than us and realize they are in a different place and there is hope. we look around and see those newest members in incredible pain and see we have moved to a different place. we have grown and survived and that gives us hope to continue our grief journey."— brooke's place parent






















"thank you for all of your help thus far.  (child) really enjoyed his time there.  he got in the car and the first words were, “did you know that every kid in my group had their dad die?”  to most that would seem like a horrible thing to say but in our car it was music to our ears.  he was comforted to know that he was not the only kid living this ride on the crazy train… we look forward to an ongoing relationship with brooke’s place… thank you again for everything.  (child) loved the folks working his group!"— brooke's place mom






















"i love it when we get done with group we feel so much love"— mandy kay
