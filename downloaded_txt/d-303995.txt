andi dema, casady theatre director
"my favorite moments, whether i am teaching or directing a play, are the moments when a student gets comfortable enough to share their positive unique energy with the rest of the group. for some students, it can be a big moment, for others, a small one--but each discovery is such a huge growth to that performer, and it keeps me going as an educator. i teach to invigorate students to find self-confidence through sharing their stories, and i encourage discovering empathy through listening to others’ stories. casady inspires students to be more: kind, hardworking, empathetic, and adventurous."













caroline hall '21, casady senior
"i have been lucky enough to spend the past 13 years growing up around the lake. i love casady because of its orientation around personal connection. your teachers and peers know you as a student in the classroom but also as an individual. the opportunities that casady has brought both on and off the campus will help me throughout the rest of my life."













dini '00 and sam homsey, current parents
"my experiences as a student at casady prepared me for my future educational pursuits and career in a way that set me up for success. when it came time to choose a school for our children, we knew that casady would provide the best education in order for them to succeed as well. not only will our children learn at the highest academic levels, but also they will have the opportunity to engage in music, theater, athletics, foreign languages, art, volunteerism, and religion. casady’s holistic approach to education empowers your child to learn, grow, thrive, and succeed and is worth the investment. there is no better gift to give your child than the power of an excellent education."
