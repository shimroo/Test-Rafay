i'm back





because some social media are now apparently hunting and banning/suspending those who are over the target, sharing too much truth and evidence, i've decided to resurrect my old moniker, "the canadian sentinel", to see if i can speak freely so long as i link to my blog posts while keeping it mild mannered on facebook.of course, blogger is owned by google.  but hopefully they won't notice i'm telling the truth here.  so...nothing can stop what is coming.  nothing.where we go one we go allthe globalist deep state cabal will be destroyed by a coalition of militaries, globally, within an 18 month window.

the danger posed by delusional progressives













the average person, particularly those with "progressive" mindsets borne of media brainwashing and disinformation, literally have no idea how horrible trudeau is, nor how horrible obama was.

they also have no idea that they've been brainwashed to hate trump based on nothing but progressive big lies and hate campaigning by the left's corporate, controlled media wing.

they are of the same sort of ignorant, gullible, manipulable mindset as the people of germany were when they mistakenly voted for the nazis.


so no wonder they're insane-due-to-acquired-falsehoods-which-they-believe-without-question. such fools refuse to think independently and insanely trust the left's corporate, controlled media unconditionally. this is dangerous. this makes them into controlled-voters-for-danger.

ominous internal party signs for conservative leader andrew scheer...







ominous signs for conservative leader andrew scheer...



reports that he's facing opposition from both "social moderates" and "social conservatives" in the party.



then there's this: via cpc fundraising e-mail, i see that suddenly they're not raising funds anywhere near how rapidly they had been prior to the election. few days ago they set a goal to raise another 50 grand in a hurry. they failed. they didn't fail like this before.




this means that conservatives are watching and seeing nothing being done or said by mr. scheer to assure them that he's learned from his mistakes in his first campaign as leader. it's not enough to merely replace a couple of people. that's no different from a cabinet shuffle to make people forget the past. won't work. 

we must hear from mr. scheer that he has been taking the wrong advice from the wrong people and will now focus on actually winning by listening to the harper people and the trump people, listening to them say stuff like "build a much more aggressive quick-response communications war room that isn't afraid to offend the communists and their media wing with the plain, proven truth" and doing hard-hitting tv/newspaper ads that tell everyone how dangerous it is just to vote for the trudeau liberals, how criminal, corrupt and treasonous trudeau et al really are. 

got to make even progs see the liberals as super-radioactive and biohazardous... with the truth, which the conservatives haven't been hollering far and wide via tv/newspaper ads like they must. and it must be done now, to define trudeau et al properly to everyone, including those who are brainwshed by the establishment media.

ball was dropped and a horrifying tyrant was shockingly re-elected. so now what does scheer have to say about how he plans to win next time for sure? people are waiting and time is wasting.

media hates trump for what it loved obama for






double standard.

story here.


whether russian president vladimir putin, north korean dictator kim jong-un, or iranian president hassan rouhani, the media insisted that trump’s willingness without preconditions to meet was reckless. many even suggested that he could not be trusted alone in a room with putin. congress wanted his translator to testify.

of course, the media were delighted when then-sen. barack obama (d-il) was asked if he would be “willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of iran, syria, venezuela, cuba and north korea,” and answered in the affirmative. that was proof of his commitment to diplomacy, as opposed to the supposed warmongering of then-president george w. bush.

but trump, somehow, was not to be trusted.

trudeau won't  like this.  tough!










justin trudeau voluntarily gave this murderous terrorist scumbag over ten million of our tax dollars.  crazy, i know.

well, it's not over for the evil omar khadr, an al-qaedan who murdered an american soldier.

story here


a u.s. military court has decided that it will not rush to hear omar khadr’s appeal on his war crimes conviction. 

since being released into canada in 2013 after pleading guilty to five war crimes in relation to the death of u.s. soldier christopher speer, khadr has attempted to appeal his conviction.
