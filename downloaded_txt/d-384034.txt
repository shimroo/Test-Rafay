	if there were no words...
	
  
this weblog has gone through many changes since i started it in may 2003. it was originally created to keep family and friends informed of my grandmother's (who we called mema) progress when she was diagnosed with a recurrance of hodgkin's lymphoma. sadly, she unexpectedly passed away on may 22, 2003 and i miss her more than words can express. this weblog then became a grief journal. now its a little of all of the above.

      instead of a regular entry.. you get how to make cinnamon rolls.. step by step.. with pictures.. this is my grandmother's recipe. enjoy!cinnamon rollswhat you need2 yeast2 tablespooons sugar1 1/3 cups warm water1 1/3 cups milk, scald and cool1 stick of margerine3/4 cups sugardash salt 6-7 cups of flourfor filling:brown sugarchopped walnutsmelted butter or margerine cinnamonbake at 400* for 15-20 minutes*just a note.. use the recipe i wrote down.. not the one in the picture.. i added a little more of everything to get more cinnamon rolls. lol*small bowl, or small pyrex measuring cup- combine warm water, yeast and 2 tablespoons sugar.. mix with wire whisk and let sit for at least an hour, it'll most likely double in size.in small saucepan heat milk until it comes to a boil, then remove and add stick of margerine and let melt, and cool.in large bowl - sugar and the dash of saltonce the milk mixture is partially cooled, add it to the sugar and salt and mix with wire whisk until combined.once yeast is ready, add to bowl with milk, sugar, margerine and saltnow, start adding your flour.. one cup at a time.once its ready, knead it so it looks like this.then cut it in half, and put each half in a bowl to risenow wait about 2 hours.i forgot to take a picture of the dough doubled in size.start with first bowl, lightly flour the counter or work surface and tip dough out of bowl, cut in half..then carefully flatten it like this..and start with melted butter, then a little cinnamon, then brown sugar and nuts, top off with a little more cinnamonroll it up!and slice, i usually do about one inch slices.place in pan and repeat with rest of the doughpretty?now let them rise, at least an hour.. i usually wait 2 hours.then preheat oven to 400 and bake for about 15 or 20 minutes, depending on your oventil they look like thisyummy!but they're not ready to eat yet!let them cool for about an hour and then make your glaze.very easy.2 cups confectioners sugar, and just a little butter and vanilla, then add milk slowly til its got the consistancy you want.then frost and eat!

      i really need to update more often. laura recently wrote about people who haven't updated in awhile and it made me realize i hadn't updated in awhile. i update on open diary about once a week, but rarely write here. i think i just feel a little "safer" at od, because there, i know whos reading!its been a bad week. jamie's uncle ray passed away saturday night and its been difficult at times. he was a wonderful man, he always had a kind word to say and he'll be greatly missed. i remember the first time i met uncle ray. it was almost 15 years ago, i had just started dating jamie and i was at his parents house visiting and aunt joan and uncle ray had just gotten back from a vacation and they'd stopped by the house to visit. uncle ray had a cats eye ring that he had gotten on vacation and he was showing it to everyone and he showed it to me and he said "this is from a real cat" with a very straight face. i actually believed him for a second. i've been out of work since 2/29. i've had problems with my foot for awhile and started having even more problems and couldn't walk on it at all for about 3 weeks, now i'm doing alot better, but i've decided not to put the surgery that i've needed for 2 years off any longer and i'll be discussing it with my doctor on monday and most likely having it done soon. at this point, i just want to get it over with.more to come...=)

      atlantic city picturesthe above 2 pictures are from "the walk" the new outlet mall in atlantic city. there were tons of great stores, including a borders book outlet, yankee candle, lane bryant, kenneth cole, kb toys, guess and tons more. the only store i actually bought anything in was the borders book outlet. liz got a few things in the carters outlet and a cookbook in borders, but that was about it. neither of us were really impressed with the prices, but it was nice to walk around and kill a few hours. its only 2 blocks from ballys, so we just walked back. we took a cab there cause we didn't know how far away it was. lol it was a cheap cab ride!the above 3 were taken from the tropicana, where we stayed. the hotel closest is the new tropicana south tower, then you can look down the boardwalk and see trump plaza, ballys and some of resorts and the tajmahal.boardwalk, looking toward the tropicana.. the construction you see is the new mall that connects to caesars.ballys and johnny rockets, where we ate dinner thursday night. it was cool eating outside on the boardwalk. the food was awesome, but the service left alot to be desired.couple more random boardwalk shotsthis pretzel shop was pretty cool, you could watch them make the pretzels and they were cheap too. 3 pretzels for a dollar, they were good too. the second shot is the store floor.this picture came out really cool. i have no idea why the picture came out this way, but i kinda like it!more random boardwalk shots.. and shops. i love these souvineer shops on the boardwalk, everythings so damn cheap too.. keychains, magnets and crap like that are all 99 cents, tshirts range from $3 up to about $7. most of the stores sell the exact same things, so don't waste your time going in each one. you could also literally eat your way down the boardwalk, there were tons of fudge stands, hot dog and ice cream stands, and candy, salt water taffy, peanuts, etc. the trip was a blast, it took about 6 hours to get there and about 7 to get home cause we got stuck in traffic in connecticut. damn connecticut! this is the borgata, the newest hotel in atlantic city, its on the other side of town, by harrahs and trump marina, so we never went in.taken from the car on the way out of town.
