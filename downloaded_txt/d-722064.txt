noel jones, aago began working with digital organs in 1977, and after some years, became involved with rodgers organs.â â â â eventually, he joined up with lauren gadd, a lifeway composer, to create books of music with midi files that permitted organists to perform live with a midi orchestra playingâ â from a rodgers midi module.
â â â â working as a rodgers sales person and designer/voicer, he began to write instruction books for organists that turned ownerâs manual information into words that related to organists and arranged music as well in the books, to assist them in understanding how to fully use these new features,â â including voicing and adding stops to each manual.
these books are based upon his experience working in churches, assisting organists who were often quite afraid that they would not be able to learn to play and operate the organs and let down their congregations.
â â â â â â  the first book in the playing the organ series was dedicated to ikutaro kakehashi, the founder of roland and the co-creator of midi.â â ikutaro kakehashi was kind enough to provide a quoteâ â to be placed on the dedication page for which we are grateful.


playing your rodgers classic, artist, infinity or roland classic organ.

book 1 gives you 10 preset pistons and organ music pieces for each of the 10 to get you familiar with a basic framework of organ registrations and the music that may be played with them.



book 2 gives you more music and variations on the 10 pistons using the stops showing on the stop rail, but also using alternate voice palette stops behind these stops and, when they are lit, the user stops.â â user stops are totally voiceable by the player and these stops have been voiced in these settings.
introducing you to the wide variety of the stops in these organs, book 2 is created to interest you in learning to use the voiceâ â palette stops and user stops yourself.

book 3 leads you through using the voice palette stops that you activate by holding set and touching the stop.â â each stop has three others playable from it on all the organs except infinity organs.â â these include french, english and german stops, each of which may be added to the other stops that pay from each of the stop tablets.
other systems move between set stop groups, requiring you to use the stops in the set only.â â these organs permit you to mix and match any of the 4 voices with any of the other voices of the other stops on the organ.

book 3 explains this and illustrates the use of them with music.
of course, you are still limited to only usingâ â one of the four voices at a time.â â and there are times that being able to use two from the same stop tablet group would buy convenient.

book 4 opens the door to the stop library in the organ that you may open, choose and voice and save to pistons.â â this lets you create a stop that will work with the stops in book 3, giving you that second stop we just talked about.
even better, you may choose a trumpet and match it and its power to the room that you are in.â â trompette en chamades are disappointing if too soft to play over full organ - this gives you the ability to adjust the stop, as a voicer would, to work in the building with the organ stops you want underneath it.
even tracker noise is available for you to truly create the sound of a historic organ.

book 13 goes through operating the controls of the organ, how to find the one you want to use, such as the transposer, and use it.
