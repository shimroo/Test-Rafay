we refer to the god of sorrow, the god of pain. why? because, who's
satan? satan is the illegitimate husband, where god is the legitimate
husband. he is the love enemy. think about if somebody stole your wife and
is living with her, yet you are in the position to love both of them. that's
god's position. we didn't know, so we didn't feel it. we must understand.

rev. sun myung moon, february 1, 1993
this country desperately needs a god-centered president, senators and
congressmen. america's intellectual establishment is liberal, godless,
secular, humanistic, and anti-religious. we are declaring war against
three main enemies: godless communism, christ-less american liberalism,
and secular-humanistic morality. they are the enemies of god, the
true parents, the unification church, all of christianity, and all
religions. we are working to mobilize a united front against them.
