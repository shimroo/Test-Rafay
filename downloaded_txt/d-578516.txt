  it’s a….. boy💙

celebrating life’s special moments with our guests is truly a fav at the @coastalchateauocnj 🥹

we recently had an amazing family stay in sunscape villa with their service dog, finley may🐕

after hanging out at the hotel, we learned their plans involved a pregnancy announcement/photoshoot on the beach for @liz_digneo & @bimmer_maniac05 so obvi we needed to document this awesome moment for a great fam (plus they were all so on brand with coastal colors🙌🏼)
