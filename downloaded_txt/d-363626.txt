little brutus is our trusty (and 
                     as
						expected) very spoiled
                  pomeranian
                     mascot.  despite the fluffy hairdo,
                     he's all boy and does his best to
						protect mom at work and at home.
						so...if you 
                     hear some puppy noise
                     in the background, it's probably
                     little brutus just doing his job.
