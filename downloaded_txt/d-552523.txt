dear friends of green table farms,ashley and mary have made the decision, mostly due to advancing age, not to continue the poultry business. we are sorry to disappoint our wonderful customers who made our work so fulfilling. we have looked forward to our market days and thoroughly enjoyed seeing you, many on a weekly basis. we already miss that community and are sad we will no longer have it in our lives.ashley and mary plan to continue stewardship of the 200+ acres at green table farms. we are hoping to transition the infrastructure we have built and the fields that have been so well nourished by the poultry to a younger group of farmers who will carry on the work, and with luck, may also be able to enter the grownyc greenmarket system at some point. we will certainly keep you informed if that comes to pass.thank you for your support and for enjoying our birds over these past few years. we hope to run into you all at the market, where we will continue to be regular customers!mary and ashley (and emma)
