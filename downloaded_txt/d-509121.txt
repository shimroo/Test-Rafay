welcome to the agape ringers
for over 25 years, we have been thrilled to share our music with audiences throughout the united states, puerto rico, canada, and england.  founded by david l. weck in 1992 and under the baton of kc congdon since 2019, our 15 musicians come together to play this unique instrument comprised of over 150 bells and chimes.  members are selected through an open audition process every three years.
the mission of the agape ringers has four pillars:

to inspire audiences through the art of handbell ringing
to challenge ourselves to reach higher standards of musical accomplishment
to encourage handbell directors and ringers through our leadership and teaching
to foster a warm, caring community of friends
we continue that mission today: with the handbell musicians of america, we regularly teach workshop sessions and serve in local and national leadership roles.  our live performances each year allow us to share our music across the greater chicago area and beyond. we've also been honored to perform multiple times at national handbell events, and directors around the world listen to our promotional recordings for hope publishing company.
