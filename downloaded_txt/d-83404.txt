how would this laser and inkjet cartridge fundraising program benefit my school or organization?
this is a quick and easy way to earn money - without selling or buying!
how does this program work?
all you have to do is collect empty cartridges to recycle and return them for money.
how do i get started?
it's as easy as 1-2-3:

start collecting cartridges. please download how and where to collect cartridges for ideas to help with your colection efforts..
check our acceptable cartridge list and print the cartridge inventory sheets.
complete the cartridge inventory sheets and fax it to us in advance or enclose a copy in each box.  if a cartridge inventory sheet is not filled out we will take inventory of your empties for you.

it's as simple as that!
once we receive your cartridges, we'll send you your "rewards" in the form of a check. we have the highest buyback prices in the industry and the quickest turnaround time on payment (3-14 days)!
effective immediately: for every laser cartridge we receive that is damaged, previously refilled, or not on our accepted cartridge list we will deduct $1.00 from payment.  also, if only a small precentage of the lasers are broken, previously refilled, or not on our accepted cartridge list you will not be penalized and we will make every effort to absorb these losses. this only applies to laser cartridges only, not inkjet cartridges. please understand that these situations inflate our shipping costs and also incur handing costs on our end to properly dispose of the cartridges and in the long-run causes us to lower our pricing.
