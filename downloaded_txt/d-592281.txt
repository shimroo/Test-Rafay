november madness 2022 results!





 (crossposted to jewschool.)
thanks to all who participated in knesset november madness 2022!  the final election results
 are in, so we’re ready to announce the november madness results.  there
 is a lot to say substantively about what happened in this israeli 
election (and in the american elections, where the votes are still being
 counted), but we’re going to try to avoid saying those things here, and
 instead focus only on the prediction contest.
the final results were:
likud 32yesh atid 24religious zionism / otzmah yehudit 14hamahaneh hamamlachti 12shas 11united torah judaism 7yisrael beiteinu 6ra’am (united arab list) 5hadash-ta’al 5labor 4meretzbaladhabayit hayehudihofesh calcalib’ometz bishvilchahakalkalit hahadashatzeirim bo’arimpirate partykol hasviva v’hahaida’at tov vara ubrit shevet avrahamnativkol kol koveiayesh kivunisrael hofsheetseder hadashhaatzmaim hahadashimmanhigut hevratitreshimat shloshim arba’imani v’atashahar koah hevratihalev hayehudibible block’vod haadamanachnutzomettzav hasha’ashema partyunited sons of covenantkamah – kidum ma’amad hapratkoah l’hashpia
now, let’s go to the november madness results.  some aspects of the 
results were widely predicted, while others (e.g., meretz not passing 
the 3.25% election threshold) were not.  we’ve been doing these contests
 since 2006, and we’ve never had a repeat champion before, but (with 5 
elections in the last 4 years) it was bound to happen eventually.  and 
sure enough, when we had two contestants tie by correctly predicting 113
 out of 120 knesset seats this year, both of them are past champions!  our top two were march madness 2020 champion isaac brooks fishman of washington, douglass commonwealth, and march madness 2021 champion jonathan gruenhut of jerusalem.
to settle this, we had to go to the tiebreakers.  the first 
tiebreaker question was “of the parties that do not win seats in the 
knesset, which will come closest?”.  isaac brooks fishman picked balad, 
and jonathan gruenhut picked habayit hayehudi, but neither of them 
correctly predicted meretz.
next we go to the second tiebreaker question: “which party will get 
the fewest votes?”.  isaac brooks fishman picked k’vod haadam, and 
jonathan gruenhut picked yesh kivun, but neither of them correctly 
predicted koah l’hashpia.
so now we go back to the first tiebreaker question, and see who was 
closest.  balad and habayit yehudi both failed to make it into the 
knesset, but balad came closer, so isaac brooks fishman is the 2022 november madness champion (and the first ever two-time champion)!
we asked both top finishers for statements.  our runner-up, jonathan gruenhut, writes (once again):
i think my original suggestion holds up!
“judge every person favorably (avot 1:6).”
and our champion, isaac brooks fishman, writes:
i really didn’t want to win this one; one of these days i’d like to be wrong in my pessimism. support bds.
so that’s all for this year.  if this knesset serves its full 4-year 
term and elections happen as scheduled (which last happened in 1988), 
we’ll be back on tuesday, october 27, 2026 (which, once again, is one 
week before the us midterm elections).  if not, then we’ll see you 
sometime before that!

knesset november madness 2022!





 (crossposted to jewschool.)
now that the chagim are over, we’re turning our 
attention to the upcoming israeli election (among other upcoming 
elections).  for a while we were doing this every few months, but now it
 has been a whole year and a half since knesset march madness 2021!  but now it’s time for knesset november madness 2022!!!  if
 you’ve been closely following all the developments leading up to the 
election, or if you haven’t been following this at all, you’re invited 
to enter with your predictions!
once again, here’s how it works:
how to enter: go to the november madness
 link and put in your predictions for how many seats each of the 39 
parties will win.  all predictions must be non-negative integers (0 is 
allowed), and your predictions must add up to 120. (for reasons 
discussed below, it is impossible for a party to win 1 or 2 seats, and 
unlikely that a party will win 3 seats.  however, if you choose to hedge
 your bets and guess that a given party will win 1, 2, or 3 seats, that 
is a legal entry in the contest.) entrance is free, but there is a 
suggested donation of $10 (or 35 nis) to the organization of your choice
 dedicated to making israel the best it can be. (if you win, feel free 
to share which organization you chose and why.)  israeli citizens are 
encouraged to vote in the actual election as well.
the rules (for the real election): the 40 parties have submitted ordered lists of candidates. here is the full list of candidates in hebrew, and a list of the parties in english.  wikipedia also has partial lists of candidates
 in english.  on election day (november 1), israeli citizens will go to 
polling places in and near israel, and vote for a party (not for 
individual candidates). all parties that win at least 3.25% of the vote 
will win seats in the knesset, proportional to their share of the vote. 
 for example, suppose seder hadash wins 1% of the vote, hakalkalit 
hahadasha wins 33%, and haatzma’im hahadashim wins 66%. then seder 
hadash wins no seats in the knesset (since they were below the 3.25% 
threshold), and the other parties will proportionally split the 120 
knesset seats: hakalkalit hahadasha gets 40 seats (so the top 40 
candidates on its list are elected), and haatzma’im hahadashim gets 80 
seats. if vacancies arise later in the term, there are no special 
elections – the next candidate on the party’s list (e.g. #41 on the 
hakalkalit hahadasha list) enters the knesset. it is mathematically 
impossible for all 40 parties to win seats in the knesset.  (we are 
unclear on what happens if all 40 parties split the vote evenly so that 
none of them is above the threshold.)
the rules (for the knesset november madness pool): the 
deadline to enter is monday, october 31, 2021, at 11:59 pm israel time 
(5:59 pm edt). when the final election results are published, each entry
 will receive a score based on how many knesset seats were predicted 
correctly. for example, suppose the results are as in the above example 
(haatzma’im hahadashim 80, hakalkalit hahadasha 40). i predicted 60 
seats for hakalkalit hahadasha, 50 for haatzma’im hahadashim, and 10 for
 hadash/ta’al. then my score is 90, since i correctly predicted 40 seats
 for hakalkalit hahadasha and 50 seats for haatzma’im hahadashim.  the 
entry with the highest score wins!
ties will be broken based on two tiebreaker questions:
1) of the parties that do not win seats in the knesset, which will come closest?
2) which party will get the fewest votes?
the tiebreakers will be resolved in this order: exact match on 
question 1; exact match on question 2; closest on question 1 (if you 
picked a party that does win seats, you’re out of consideration for this
 one); closest on question 2.
good luck!!!!!!!!!!!

knesset march madness 2021 results!





 (crossposted to jewschool.)thank you to everyone who participated in knesset march madness 2021!  now that the election results are official, we’re also ready to announce the official march madness results.
the democratic party (no relation to the american party of that name)
 dropped out, but here are the results for the other 38 parties:
likud 30yesh atid 17shas 9blue and white 8yaminah 7labor 7united torah judaism 7yisrael beiteinu 7religious zionism 6joint list 6new hope 6meretz 6united arab list (ra’am) 4new economic partyrapeipiratesani v’atahhatikvah l’shinuihamapatz hahevrati – pensionersmishpat tzedektzometam shalemseder hadashkamahthe impossible is possiblehalev hayehudiatzmeinubible bloc partyolam hadashbrit hashutafutthe israelisshemada’am green economy one statemanhigut hevratitma’anhetzanachnukevod haadam
let’s go first to the bonus tiebreaker questions (just for fun, 
because we didn’t have to use any tiebreakers this time to determine the
 winner).  on the second tiebreaker question (“which party will get the 
fewest votes?”), honorable mention goes to april madness 2019 champion aaron weinberg
 of washington dc, who successfully picked out kevod haadam from a very 
crowded field of very minor parties.  kevod haadam finished with 196 
votes, just barely behind anachnu with 220 votes and hetz with 226 
votes.
the first tiebreaker question (“of the parties that do not win seats 
in the knesset, which will come closest?”) was tricky this time.  a lot 
of people predicted that one or more of the parties that in the end did 
make it over the threshold were not going to make it over the 
threshold.  so on this question, we had votes for ra’am, meretz, blue 
and white, religious zionism, etc.  but in the end, everyone who was 
anywhere close to the threshold reached the threshold; no one just 
barely missed it.  so the correct answer to this question was the new 
economic party, with 0.79% of the vote (well under the threshold of 
3.25%, but well above all the other parties that didn’t make it).  
honorable mention goes to march madness 2020 champion isaac brooks fishman of washington, d.c., who (along with our winner and runner-up; see below) correctly picked the new economic party.
so that leads us into the overall results!  as we said above, a lot 
of competitors fell short because they predicted that some of these 
parties weren’t going to reach the threshold, even though all 13 of 
these party lists made it into the knesset.  this is the largest number 
of party lists to be elected to the knesset since the 2003 election 
(when the threshold was only 2%, so it was easier for smaller parties to
 get in). (that only counts party lists at the time of the election, and
 doesn’t account for knesset factions splitting up after the election.) 
 our top finishers correctly predicted that all 13 parties would be 
elected, and made their picks accordingly.
in second place, congratulations to eliana fishman of washington dc, who correctly predicted 108 out of 120 knesset seats!  we asked her for a statement, and she writes:
i urge everyone to register for hishbati: a non- and 
anti- zionist beit midrash, because israeli election results are easier 
to digest once you’ve rejected zionism!
and in first place, one point ahead with a score of 109, congratulations to our 2021 march madness champion jonathan gruenhut
 of jerusalem!!!  we also asked him for a statement, and he wrote (back 
on friday, when he first found out that this was the way things were 
going):
i’m too overwhelmed with shabbat/pesach prep to worry 
about partisan politics right now.  we’ll see if anyone can form a 
coalition.
in the meantime, as always, judge every person favorably (avot 1:6).
thanks again to everyone for playing!  if this election results in a 
stable government that lasts its full 4-year term (lol), we’ll see you 
again on tuesday, november 11, 2025!  otherwise, keep watching this 
space to participate in the next madness contest sometime sooner!

knesset march madness 2021!





 (crossposted to jewschool.)it has been an entire year since the last israeli election!  this is the longest such gap since three elections ago!  but all things must come to an end, and so the next election is coming up in about two weeks.  that means that (following march madness 2020, september madness 2019, april madness 2019, and all their predecessors) it's time for knesset march madness 2021!!!!  if you're feeling excited about the election, this is your chance to show that excitement by entering this prediction contest!  or if you're feeling more depressed or fearful, this is your chance to distract yourself by pretending it's all a game.  either way, all are invited to submit your predictions!for the fourth time in two years, here's how it works:how to enter: go to the march madness link and put in your predictions for how many seats each of the 39 parties will win.  all predictions must be non-negative integers (0 is allowed), and your predictions must add up to 120.

knesset march madness results!





(crossposted to jewschool.) 

well, ncaa march madness may be proceeding this year without fans in the stands, but knesset march madness 2020 is still proceeding normally!


the election results are now official.  tzomet dropped out before the election, but here are the results for the other 29 parties:

likud 36
blue and white 33
joint list 15
shas 9
united torah judaism 7
labor-gesher-meretz 7
yisrael beiteinu 7
yaminah 6
otzmah yehudit
otzmah liberalit-kalkalit
kol hanashim
pirates
mishpat tzedek
yisraelist – zechuyoteinu b’koleinu
ani v’atah
(tie) haberit hameshutefet
(tie) seder hadash
koach lehashpia
mitkademet
da’am green economy one state
halev hayehudi
shema
bible bloc party
kamah
adom lavan
hahazon
manhigut hevratit
kevod haadam
peulah l’yisrael

as we keep repeating essentially the same election over and over, the
 top scores in the prediction contests keep getting higher and higher, 
as the results become more and more predictable.  but there were still 
no perfect scores this time – there were still some changes from last 
time that participants had to predict (e.g. the gains for likud and the 
joint list, and the losses for labor-gesher-meretz).


but before we get there, let’s talk about the tiebreaker questions.  
once again, the first question (“of the parties that do not win seats in
 the knesset, which will come closest?”) was very straightforward.  
otzmah yehudit wasn’t close in either direction: it came in far below 
the threshold to get into the knesset, but far above any of the other 
unsuccessful parties.  most of our entrants got this one right (though 
some predicted that otzmah yehudit would make it into the knesset).  the
 second question (“which party will get the fewest votes?”) was harder. 
 no one predicted the “winner”, peulah l’yisrael (which didn’t run in 
the previous election), or the “runner-up”, kevod haadam.  so honorable 
mention goes to dmh in dc, and eliana fishman
 in washington dc, who both picked perennial last-place finisher 
manhigut hevratit, which got the fewest votes of any party that anyone 
picked for this question.


now to the overall knesset prediction results!  we had a tie for second place: eliana fishman in washington dc and samantha brody
 in teveria, israel, both scored an astonishing 116 out of 120.  so we 
go to the tiebreaker questions.  eliana fishman picked otzmah 
liberalit-kalkalit (which came in second among the parties that didn’t 
make it into the knesset), and samantha brody correctly picked otzmah 
yehudit, so samantha brody is our runner-up!  congratulations!


and in first place, isaac brooks fishman in 
washington, douglass commonwealth, correctly predicted 117 out of 120 
knesset seats, the highest score in the history of these prediction 
contests!!!  congratulations!!!!


we asked our champion for a statement, and he writes:

there is no god but god, and yeshayahu leibowitz is the 
messenger of god. now for my next prediction: the winner of the 2020 
democratic presidential primary will be eric swalwell.


thanks to everyone for playing!  if the newly elected 23rd knesset 
somehow forms a stable government that manages to last its entire term, 
then we’ll see you again on tuesday, november 5, 2024 (yes, that’s the 
same day as the us elections).  otherwise, we might do this all over 
again in a few months!

knesset march madness 2020!!! (sigh)





(crossposted to jewschool.) 

do we really have to do this again?  i guess we do, don’t we.   we just had september madness a few months ago, and april madness
 before that, but now israel is (for the first time ever) approaching 
its third election in less than a year.  so that means we have to hold 
another knesset prediction pool.  maybe everyone is sick of it at this 
point, but such is the price of democracy.  but you should totally enter
 the contest even if you’re not feeling it, because if everyone else 
decides to sit it out, you can win by default!  do you have opinions 
about whether this election is going to turn out the same as the 
previous two, or different?  here’s a chance to put your money (no 
actual money required) where your mouth is.


so here’s how it works, yet again:

how to enter: go to the march madness
 link and put in your predictions for how many seats each of the 30 
parties will win.  all predictions must be non-negative integers (0 is 
allowed), and your predictions must add up to 120. (for reasons 
discussed below, it is impossible for a party to win 1 or 2 seats, and 
unlikely that a party will win 3 seats.  however, if you choose to hedge
 your bets and guess that a given party will win 1, 2, or 3 seats, that 
is a legal entry in the contest.) entrance is free, but there is a 
suggested donation of $10 to the organization of your choice dedicated 
to making israel the best it can be. (if you win, feel free to share 
which organization you chose and why.)  israeli citizens are encouraged 
to vote in the actual election as well, and american jews are encouraged
 to vote in the world zionist congress election.

the rules (for the real election): the 30 parties have submitted ordered lists of candidates. here is the full list of candidates in hebrew, and a list of the parties in english.
 on election day (march 2), israeli citizens will go to polling places 
in and near israel, and vote for a party (not for individual 
candidates). all parties that win at least 3.25% of the vote will win 
seats in the knesset, proportional to their share of the vote.  for 
example, suppose the pirate party wins 1% of the vote, the bible bloc 
party wins 33%, and manhigut hevratit wins 66%. then the pirate party 
wins no seats in the knesset (since they were below the 3.25% 
threshold), and the other parties will proportionally split the 120 
knesset seats: the bible bloc party gets 40 seats (so the top 40 
candidates on its list are elected), and manhigut hevratit gets 80 
seats. if vacancies arise later in the term, there are no special 
elections – the next candidate on the party’s list (e.g. #41 on the 
bible bloc party list) enters the knesset. it is mathematically possible
 for all 30 parties to win seats in the knesset, but many experts 
consider this unlikely.

the rules (for the knesset march madness pool): the deadline 
to enter is sunday, march 1, 2020, at 11:59 pm israel time (4:59 pm 
est). when the final election results are published, each entry will 
receive a score based on how many knesset seats were predicted 
correctly. for example, suppose the results are as in the above example 
(manhigut hevratit 80, bible bloc party 40). i predicted 60 seats for 
the bible bloc party, 50 for manhigut hevratit, and 10 for kamah. then 
my score is 90, since i correctly predicted 40 seats for the bible bloc 
party and 50 seats for manhigut hevratit.  the entry with the highest 
score wins!

ties will be broken based on two tiebreaker questions:
1) of the parties that do not win seats in the knesset, which will come closest?
2) which party will get the fewest votes?

the tiebreakers will be resolved in this order: exact match on 
question 1; exact match on question 2; closest on question 1 (if you 
picked a party that does win seats, you’re out of consideration for this
 one); closest on question 2.


maybe we’ll put up a post soon with descriptions of all the parties 
and links to their websites, or maybe we won’t, because it’s mostly the 
same as last time.

good luck!!!!

yom tov survey results!








thanks to everyone who filled out the survey about 1-day and 2-day yom tov!  we received 133 responses, but we should
emphasize that we did not employ any sort of scientific sampling methodology, and
therefore we cannot assume that the quantitative results can be extrapolated to
any particular population.  indeed, we received
some comments expressing this concern:




·       
the sample bias of this survey
will likely be too large to draw any conclusions.

·       
there has likely been a
move towards 1-day yom tov over the past 10 years, but i don't know if that can
really be attributed to the days of the week. that shift will also likely be
over represented in this survey, as people who have made the switch will
certainly be more inclined to take the survey and may even be more likely to
see the survey.




however, given that the original prediction was nothing more
than “this decade … will see lots of 2-day-yom tov people switching over to 1
day” (without a formal definition of “lots”), it is safe to say that this prediction
was confirmed.  beyond that, the qualitative
data also provide an interesting snapshot of the diversity of thought and practice
around this issue.



the survey was distributed by posting it on this blog (where
very few people may have independently seen it without being directed from elsewhere,
since the blog is largely inactive), on the author’s facebook timeline, and in
a number of jewish-themed facebook groups, and then some people further shared
it from there.



the survey defined “yom tov” (for the purposes of this
survey) as the festival days of pesach, shavuot, sukkot, and shemini atzeret /
simchat torah (not rosh hashanah or yom kippur).  (one respondent commented “thank you for
noting the survey excludes rosh hashanah and yom kippur. i am adamant about
observing yom kippur for only one day. does that make me a heretic?”)  it asked respondents whether they did 1 or 2
days of yom tov (or “other”) as of 10 years ago, and whether they do 1 or 2
days of yom tov (or “other”) now, and invited them to comment on any part of
this.  (the vague language of “do” was
intentional, so as to capture the many ways that people approach yom tov.  we didn’t use language like “observe”, so
that respondents wouldn’t get hung up on what counts as “observing” yom tov,
and we didn’t ask “how many days of yom tov do you think there are?” because
that doesn’t reflect the way that everyone relates to yom tov.)  the survey further asked for respondents’ age,
number of children under 18 (10 years ago and now), how they describe themselves
jewishly (10 years ago and now), country of residence (10 years ago and now),
and what they do/did (student, employed inside/outside the jewish community,
etc.).



the ways that survey respondents describe themselves jewishly
were all over the map!  in addition to all
the standard denominations and the nondenominational labels that one might
expect (“postdenominational”, “trad egal”, etc.), here were some other
highlights:


·       
non-believing member of a
religion: nominally secular but heir to a long tradition that is very
meaningful and which i strive to continue

·       
egalish orthoish havurahish
frummie

·       
predenominational

·       
observant with minor
laxities

·       
it’s complicated

·       
somewhere on the halachic
spectrum

·       
lazy hadar alum who will
help at your new minyan

·       
short answer: fuck if i
know
long answer: i find myself unsatisfied in any one jewish community and i am
trying therefore to find community in many places. i’m working towards engaging
in judaism in ways besides just what i grew up with (artistically, spiritually,
academically, physically, as a nation, as opposed to just halachically) but
halacha is still an important piece of it to me. i have grown increasingly
uncomfortable with the way (orthodox) judaism deals with gender and sexuality.

·       
[10 years ago] traditional
but egalitarian conservative / [now] traditional and egalitarian conservative


to the extent possible, we grouped all the responses into
four categories: 1→1 (i.e. they did 1 day of yom tov 10 years ago, and do 1 day
of yom tov now), 1→2, 2→1, and 2→2.  in
most cases, this matched the answers to the questions, but we also coded some
of the “other” responses based on the free-response comments.  for example, someone who wrote “i have two
seders at the beginning of pesach, and don't eat chametz for 8 days, but i do
one day for all of the other holidays listed” was coded as 1→1; someone else
who said they converted within the last 10 years (and therefore wasn’t doing
the holidays at all 10 years ago) and has always done 2 days since converting
was coded as 2→2.



out of the 133 responses, there were 10 that we couldn’t
place into one of the four groups.  this
included some who left one or more of the relevant questions blank, and others
whose responses didn’t fit into a box, such as:


·       
i’ve vacillated over the
years depending on how flexible my job has been to my taking off lots of time.
and depending on whether the chagim are on weekdays or not.

·       
i did not observe yomim
tovim 10 years ago … i went from completely secular, to observing 1 day with a
reform community, to now observing 2 days with a conservative community


of the remaining responses, 18 are 1→1, 5 are 1→2, 30 are 2→1,
and 70 are 2→2.  or to put it another
way, out of the 123 respondents who were placed into these groups, ten years
ago 23 did 1 day and 100 did 2 days, and now 48 do 1 day and 75 do 2 days.  we’ll look at each of these groups on its
own.



1→1 




18 respondents did 1 day of yom tov 10 years ago and still
do 1 day.  only one of those is in israel
(which is one indication that the sample is limited; israelis either didn’t see
the survey or didn’t think it pertained to them), but some others said they
were originally israeli and have maintained their 1-day practice after moving out
of israel (more than 10 years ago).  many
of the non-israeli respondents in this category identify as reform, but not all
(one describes themselves as “flexibly traditional”; another identified as “sefardi
orthodox/traditional” 10 years ago and “conservative/masorti” now).  most had relatively little to say about their
non-switching, but one wrote:


·       
born and raised reform, and
support 1 day for religious reasons. … i respect others practices, but believe
it is wrong to continue to observe 2 days in the diaspora, as the reasons for
it are long since gone, and i believe it is important, and mandated,  for us to continually reevaluate certain
things.


1→2 



5 respondents did 1 day of yom tov 10 years ago and switched
to 2 days.  only one of these moved from
israel to outside israel (and switched for that reason).  the other 4 respondents (all outside israel)
all have similar trajectories:  they are
all under age 23, grew up reform (and were minors 10 years ago), and are now
part of non-reform communities that do 2 days.



2→1




30 respondents did 2 days of yom tov 10 years ago and switched
to 1 day.  9 of these respondents moved
to israel in the last 10 years.  the other
21 are doing 1 day outside israel.  unlike
the 1→2 switchers, many of the 2→1 switchers do not report a substantial change
in the way they label themselves.  some
of their self-descriptions include conservative, independent/conservative/havurah-y,
non orthodox member of chabad shul, orthodox, reconstructionist, shomer
mitzvoth conservative, traditional, and traditional-egalitarian.



here are some of their comments:


·       
i changed because (and
when) i moved to israel. actually, before i *moved* to israel, i would only
keep one day if i happened to be in israel for that yom tov. by the time i
found out that there are those who say visitors should keep two days even in
israel, i had moved there.

·       
[from someone else who
moved to israel] it’s very weird

·       
my kids moved to public
school and 7 missed days in a single month was too much to justify.

·       
having a partner who does
only one day definitely has made a difference. :-)

·       
i was miserable and
stressed by all the missed work/school and i thought observing one day might
reinvigorate our practice.

·       
because of community, i
treat the second day as a “liturgical yom tov”, but do malakha.

·       
after studying responsa on
the topic, i have decided there is no compelling reason to continue to observe
yom tov sheni as there is no uncertainty over the days of chag anymore, and i
generally find the arguments for "ancestral practice" uncompelling
since our world is greatly different then theirs and to claim that we practice
judaism in the same way as it was practiced and understood a thousand years ago
is false - this can change like other elements have changed.

·       
i’ve never felt
particularly attached to two days of yom tov. it’s always felt rather silly to
me. but that’s what i grew up with and i didn’t have a good reason to change
it. this year i’m working and even with only taking one day off i’ve gone into
negative for pto. i didn’t want to take off more days, and felt no need to. 
i will maybe go back next year because (1) there is a lot of jewish community
in my area and i would like to spend the hagim at lots of different shuls, and
(2) they fall on the weekend

·       
it became unsustainable for
work to observe two days and i don’t believe it is halachicly required anyway,
so i stopped.

·       
school and work have made
it nearly a requirement to switch

·       
we began by holding
services on only one day because we could not get a minyan the second day, but
counting the second day as yomtov nonetheless. 
i found that one day was enough for me, and i don’t intend to go to
second-day services if they’re held this year.

·       
1. working in the secular
world, taking 2 days feels both overly burdensome and unnecessary: 
- the "three days on - two days off" work schedule for a month is
stressful. it turn into constant catchup.
- imposes burden on my colleagues; i'd otherwise take my time off in different
configuration. (eg. week at at time)
- reduces other kinds of vacation i can take from work
- i enjoy yom tov more when it does not feel like a burden. 2 day yom tov feels
like a burden.
- many of my friends who do not work in the jewish world find the second day to
be egregiously burdensome.
2. i believe that the 2 days imposes unnecessary financial hardship and stress
for some, given the communal pressure to take two days off. 
3. i feel fortunate:
* to be on the same page as my spouse in this practice.
*  to be in a family and community where
my practice is known and i'm not marginalized as a result
* i currently do not need to "say yizkor" (for a parent etc). this
poses a challenge for second day.
* i work in a company with lots of jewish people who practice differently, so i
do not need to be overly concerned about my personal practice negatively
affecting others. 


2→2 



the remaining 70 respondents did 2 days of yom tov 10 years
ago, and still do 2 days of yom tov.  all
are outside israel.  their comments fell
into several categories.  some expressed surprise
or disbelief that the very question was being asked:


·       
out here in diaspora, it's
what we do, and always have done. as such, i can't imagine anyone choosing not
to "do" the second day, unless they also aren't doing the first day. …
if i chose not to "do" the second day but still did the first, i'd be
a hypocrite.

·       
i'm jewish and i live in
america. how could i change?  … i think
this is ridiculous. no one should be switching. if that was an option we'd all
switch.

·       
we live outside of israel,
seems pretty obvious.


others explained why they haven’t changed:


·       
why i did not:  i don't have an employment situation that
creates outside pressures.  i prefer to
keep my practice consistent with the majority of observant folks in my
community, who belong to conservative and orthodox shuls.  my conservative synagogue observes second day
and needs people to show up to services and participate, and i am a person who
can do this.

·       
too important to change!

·       
once hillel established the
calendar, the need for two day yom tov was "eliminated", nevertheless
the rabbonim decided to maintain the practice. nothing significant has changed
since that time.

·       
i didn't because i had no
external pressure to do so.

·       
i have changed many other
aspects of my life drastically but this feels like a very big step.


and others talked about the possibility of switching:


·       
one day i will! but i have
so much inertia.

·       
i'd definitely be open to a
switch if my synagogue switched, but that isn't likely.

·       
it’s very difficult to have
to sacrifice so much work vacation time on the alter of two day yom tovs. when
i hear rabbis talking about what can’t be done on chol hamoed and what
loopholes can be used to work on yom tov, i wonder how anyone could have a
secular job and not work on yom tov. if major poskim had to work in the secular
workforce, i wonder if the winds would shift. also, i think there is a shift
among americans in israel temporarily to observing one day of yom tov only.

·       
i haven't changed, but it's
become more difficult to maintain

·       
i briefly kept 1-day yomtov
for 2 years when i had a job/academic schedule that did not allow me enough
days off. it felt very much like a compromise, like "this is not my ideal
but it's temporary."




thanks again to everyone who participated!  we’ll see what the future brings.  and in fall 2020, the tishrei holidays will be on weekends for the first time since 2009!
