in loving memory



this guide is dedicated to the memory of its founder, sylvia stultz, phdsylvia was awed by the healing power of children playing together in community and delighted in the marvels of each child’s uniqueness. her understanding, wisdom, humor and soft touch helped countless children and families and continues to live in their sense of self and connections with others.therapists who offer groups are excited about their work, but are often frustrated by difficulties in matching appropriate groups and families. this guide is an attempt to assist professionals in this difficult process. contact therapists directly to get more information and to make decisions about particular groups.every effort has been made to ensure accuracy. however, errors may exist; please notify allison sibley (allison@thesibleygroupdc.com) of corrections and additions.please note: inclusion in the guide does not imply endorsement.
