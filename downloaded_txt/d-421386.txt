about stepstonequality, service and integrity



stepstone, llc is dedicated to work with architects, builders and end users to create innovative, effective and beautiful precast concrete solutions, including stair treads, pavers, wall caps, and pool coping. manufacturing handmade, wetcast precast concrete products since 1963, we developed dozens of new products. our wetcast production process generates elegant finishes and a vast array of standard products to meet your projects demands.


we define linearity as the line that designs the project; we define our linearity as the line that designs the shape of our pavers. stepstone's pavers merge the two lines - the line of the project and the line of our pavers. our experience teaches us that every project demands we first work with our customers to clarify a wide range of details: from the expectations of our precast materials - aesthetically and functionally - to production and delivery schedules.

testimonialswhat theyâre saying about stepstone...


"choosing materials that enhance both the architecture and landscape is at the core of every ceara studio project. with a refined palette and customizable options, steptone integrates beautifully with its surroundings, bringing an enduring quality that elevates the design. perfect for creating a cohesive look, steptone enhances the visual flow of any project, connecting each element with a timeless and polished foundation."

"we were able to look at a large variety of sizes and finishes, and stepstone offers the same pavers on pedestals and mortar set (pool deck and coping) in the same finish for a continuous appearance. really helps to get everything from one source vs a variety for consistency."
greg cheng, aia associate
koningeizenberg
"when i think of stepstone i think about two words â quality and integrity! their diverse product line offers great flexibility and reliability to our design team, why we have specified stepstone for over 20 years. their pavers, stairs, and other hardscape elements come in a multitude of sizes as well as a variety of colors and finishes that satisfy our firmâs aesthetic requirements and our customersâ tastes for beauty and durability"

"lydia, thank you for all of your extra care and hard work in getting our product together (multiple times!). it looks terrific and our clients are very pleased. no one ever really knows how much effort is on the back end of juggling schedules, adjusting billing, coordinating production, expediting delivery and still managing to ship a quality product. the fact that you guys succeeded at this is truly remarkable. you and your production crew have a class a operation and were an absolute pleasure to work with."
