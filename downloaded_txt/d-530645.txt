	 i'm back again just like a long lost friend.............
	 
    


where have i been? nowhere. just right here at home for the most part, doing my daily activities.  i have been looking for a job part of the time. i've had nibbles and bites, but nothing that has worked out so far. with the economy today, finding a job is not as easy as it once was. so i will continue searching and the right one will come along. 


this past weekend i went to a family reunion and i thoroughly enjoyed it. i'm still trying to sort out who is who and whose daughter or son that one belongs to, etc. a lot of them come from in and oh, and some from ky.  they have been posting some old photos on fb and it's really been nice getting to look at them. when i was growing up we did not own a camera so the only photos we got was when an aunt or uncle came to visit and brought a camera and was generous enough to share a photo or two with us.  i also lost some of my favorite photos when we had a tornado in 1974. 

this one below is my brother and i back in ...gosh...not sure of the year, but probably late 60's. i can't tell what kind of car that is back behind us. i know my brother in the photo had a brand new roadrunner. i can't tell if that is it or not. 

a short post tonight. i so appreciate all the comments and wishes from everyone. thank you granny annie (http://granan10.blogspot.com/ )for threatening my life if i didn't start posting again!! haha!! nah...she didn't really do that, but she did send me an e-mail with caring words and that gave me the motivation to start back. i've been meaning to anyway, just keep putting it off day by day and before you know it half the year is gone. 
﻿

note: i just found out that grannie annie's husband passed away. my thoughts and prayers are with you annie.

	 happy new year
	 
    


i hope to return to blogging soon.  it's been awhile, but life has been getting in my way.

my husband who has been ill for several years, which most of you knew that, but he became sicker and was in and out of the hospital, and then home with hospice briefly. he passed away this month on the 3th, here at home, with me by his side. he was struggling there at the end so it was a blessing to see him not suffering anymore. it's so strange without him here and i miss him terribly. 

i was with my family at christmas and i'm taking things a day at a time. 

i hope everyone has a wonderful blessed new year!

	 i'm alive
	 
    


well, it's been over a month again, but yes, i am alive!!!  my computer had a meltdown, or so i thought. you all should know that i'm computer illiterate, so when it crashes i toss my hands in the air and holler, "help!"  i have used the same computer guy ever since my first computer. the last few times it has had problems he has been in california. same thing this time! someone at church recommended someone else to me and i took my computer to him. he got it fixed fast and was much cheaper than the guy i had been using. so now i have a new computer guy!

blogger has changed the looks of things. hmmmmm..... i'll have to try and figure it out. remember...illiterate! i don't see anywhere to post photos....hmmmmm.....no photos this time folks! 

what have i been up to you wonder???  well, not much really, just life things. the usual things. housekeeping. fighting cobwebs and puzzling over where all the dust comes from. taking care of my husband. last night he called for help and i went in to see what he needed. he said he needed "attention." i asked him what kind of attention he needed. no response. i asked again and got no response. so then i stood up very straight at attention and i gave him a salute! that did get a smile from him! it was finally determined that he didn't know what he wanted. i told him to just try and relax and think relaxing thoughts and go to sleep. he did. well..i don't know if he had relaxing thoughts but he did go to sleep! 

ohhhh...i do have a new great nephew. he was born last week and came into this world weighing in at 11 lbs. 9 ozs!  needless to say some of his newborn things will not fit that big fellow!! i was surprised at his weight but shouldn't be really. his parents are both 6 feet tall. i have not gotten to see him in person yet. only photos! he is cute and very alert! 

the other day i was eating at one of our downtown restaurants and i had a piece of pecan pie. i can't recall the last time i had a piece of pecan pie, so it was really delicious. 

a friend of mine had one of their barns go up in flames on saturday. it was the biggest barn on the farm and had all the hay stored in it to feed the cattle this winter. it also had their biggest, best, and newest tractor, as well as a hay roller they had gotten last year in it. luckily no one or no animals were hurt. the fire marshall is investigating to try and determine what caused it. she was very upset but also grateful that no one was injured, as material things can be replaced. i go buy meat from them since they raise their own beef. it is so much better than what i buy at the grocery. 

zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-aymy, oh my oh what a wonderful day!plenty of sunshine heading my wayzip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay!!

just thought i'd best check in and let you know i'm among the living! ya'll come back now, ya hear?

	 a memory
	 
    


wow, over a month since i last posted. each day i say "oh, i'll get a post up today." then the day passes and it doesn't happen. next thing you know over a month has gone by. that's kind of how it is with me losing weight;  "oh, i'll start my diet tomorrow!" tomorrow comes and then i say the same thing over again. and so it goes! 





i just love these barns with the nice quilt patterns on them. there are lots of them around and i think they sure do brighten things up. in the top photo it had just came a rain shower and was still sprinkling and not the best photo. harder to see the log cabin quilt pattern on the top but you should be able to click on them and enlarge the photos. 

i was thinking today about  a car my brother had when he was a young man. he bought a new 1969 plymouth roadrunner. his was green...kind of  a grassy green color. he sure loved that car and it was pretty. i drove it a few times but we lived way back in the country and when you met another car you had to get over to pass and he'd have a fit if a tree limb or the weeds raked against it. no, i was never allowed to drive it without  him being along! i did love the roadrunner beep-beep horn it had. i remember my dad was riding with him and when they were at a stop light, dad warned him not to take off too fast. when the light changed to green my brother took off so fast that it threw my dad's cap off his head and into the back seat!! i was thinking about that today and couldn't help but laugh.  this photo below i found online. i don't have any photos of my brother's car.

	 keeping cool and happy 4th!
	 
    


things here are hot and dry. i have been staying inside a lot where it's cooler. unfortunately, just when it's sweltering outside, our hvac decides to die. it's about 20 years old, so i guess with all this heat it just couldn't hold up anymore. it'll be monday before they can put a new one in so, in the meantime, i went out and purchased a window unit. i am so glad i did. we are under a heat advisory and i think i, and my husband, would have had a major melt down by now without it. our house is small, so the window unit keeps it cool enough for us to be comfortable. i had to go to 3 stores before finding one. they said they are selling out as soon as they hit the shelves, especially the smaller ones. the one i got was the only one on the shelf. i stood guard over it while i called my nephew to see if he could come and put it in the window for me. i was ready to fight anyone who tried to take it!! i know this drought and heat is reaching a lot of states, so i hope that everyone is staying cool and that things aren't too bad where you are. 

hope everyone had a wonderful, safe, and happy independence day!

"what'cha looking at? this happens to be a very comfortable position."


i had shown these pretty flowers i had found while walking the dog and had no idea what they are.  mr. bowles gave the closest thing to what they must be. he thought they were a castor bean vine and would get bean like pods on them. he was right about that! i went back to where i got them and took some more photos. 






most of the blooms were gone but this is the vine and it does have some bean pods on it. trying to figure it out, the closest thing i could find by googling it, that looked like it, was a hyacinth bean vine. i couldn't really find anything about a castor bean vine. 









in this next photo below you can see the bean pod on the vine. you should be able to click on the photos to get a better look, if you want to that is!









we have been having bible school at church and we had a good crowd of kids each night with an average of 101. kids enjoy coming to bible school and i don't blame them. so many fun things to do and learn!



this year the theme was babylon and below is the props they used in the sanctuary. they do so much work that i am amazed at what all they do and i admire them for it. all this below is hiding the choir area and the organ. to get to the organ she has to pass through that curtain on the right side. all of this is particle board with cloth that they painted over it. not only this prop but they had several of the sunday school rooms decorated to fit that time period as well. i did some of the helping with taking things down. sure easier to take it down than to put it up! they start months ahead of time preparing.









here's a little something that may make you smile!

(and yes....i have called wondering where my paper was on a day that we do not get one. sigh.) 



'where is my paper?' the irate customer calling the newspaper offices, loudly demanded to know where her sunday edition was.'ma'am, said the employee, today is saturday.the sunday paper is not delivered 'til sunday.'there was quite a pause on the other endof the phone, followed by a ray of recognition.'so that's why no one was in church today.'

hope everyone has a better than great week!!!
