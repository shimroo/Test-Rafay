frank dibella started selling race horses, hunters, and jumpers in his early 20's. he made frequent horse shopping trips across the country in a 1960's international 6 horse van and transported horses back to eastern pennsylvania to sell. with transporting so many horses, over thousands of miles, frank gained hands-on knowledge of the horse transportation industry. in 1972 while still selling horses, he started refurbishing and selling horse vans from fox ridge farm in malvern, pa. frank slowly shifted his concentration from selling horses to focusing on selling horse vans. after a few years at the farm he moved his horse van sales to laverty's gmc truck sales in west chester, pa. he conducted 4 years of business in that location and in 1993 realized the need to expand again, so he built a new dealership in pottstown, pa. frank remains in this location and continues to serve the surrounding horse community.
