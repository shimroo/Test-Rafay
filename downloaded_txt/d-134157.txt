medical compression therapy for poor circulation, lipedema & lym​phedema
poor circulation. graduated compression therapy can help manage symptoms such as tired achy legs, swelling, spider veins, varicose veins, skin changes or leg ulcers by aiding your circulation.
lymphedema. compression garments are designed to comfortably keep pressure on the swollen or affected area to assist the drainage of fluid and minimize swelling.
lipedema. compression stockings can help decrease pain and hypersensitivity, increase mobility and minimize additional issues such as edema.
