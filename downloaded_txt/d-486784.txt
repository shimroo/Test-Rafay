the key to excellence in education & faithserving children 2 months through 8th grade














with christ as the ever-present teacher, good shepherd catholic school is committed to provide academic excellence, catholic values, and a faith-filled community to its students.
























faithwe focus on the spiritual and moral growth of our students. through classroom studies, daily prayer, the weekly celebration of mass, and service to others, our students learn to understand catholic values and beliefs. we teach respect for the dignity and rights of all, through an awareness of christ’s presence within us.













communitywe are a welcoming, family-centered school community, embracing families of all faith, cultural and ethnic backgrounds. we celebrate the unique gifts and talents of our students, teachers and families and recognize that we are created in the image of god. 













innovative educationwe offer a hands-on, cross-curricular approach to teaching, with small and large group instruction enhanced with technology.  whether in our hydroponics garden or classrooms, and even within our livestream learning opportunities, our students learn to become critical thinkers and problem solvers of the 21st century.
