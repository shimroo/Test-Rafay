 repairs, upgrades & custom modifications  even the best boats and sups need some tlc every now and then, especially the ones you love to use the most. we love extending the life of kayaks and paddleboards with repairs, upgrades and custom modifications. this fall and winter, get ready for 2024 with better safety (reflective tape, new deck lines or hand grabs), more comfort (seat, thigh or hip pad adjustments) and lots more. our shop is located in langley, just 10 minutes from the ferry dock in clinton.

used equipment for salekayaks, paddleboards & accessorieswe accept paddling equipment for consignment sales. we love finding new homes for used craft + helping paddlers buy with confidence + keeping the transactions local. we show by appointment and we strongly encourage potential buyers to test out any craft, so come dressed and ready to paddle when making an appointment. used equipment is sold strictly as-is. customers are responsible for state and local sales tax of 8.8% at time of purchase.
