reviews


the kids have a great time while learning to play.
lifelong skills and relationships are born here. the staff shares their passion for music and are very professional and accommodating. wish i had this type of exposure to music when i was growing up!
lori h, downington, pa


it's the best music program in the city.
dedicated instructors and staff, vibrant atmosphere, and most importantly, it's fun! my 8-year-old has grown leaps and bounds in skill and personal confidence. if you're thinking about checking it out, don't wait, just do it!

the structure around how kids learn is amazing.
taking lessons to learn an instrument is one thing, but learning how to be a part of a band is on another level. these kids are learning how to communicate, respect people and their opinions, and how to be accountable for themselves. it’s more than just music here.
dustie s, austin, tx


what i like about the program is that my kids love it!
this is so different from the music lessons that existed when i was a kid. these kids are actually making music and learning to play as a band. the performances are so impressive, and watching the kids gain confidence and express themselves on stage is priceless.
