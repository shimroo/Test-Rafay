check out our upcoming specials page
wfmu has cool special programs happening all the time. sometimes it’s hard to keep track of what they are and when they are, especially when you are listening and miss an announcement. for these reasons, and many others, we devote a page on our website to all of the specials coming up on wfmu. go to our upcoming special programs page to see the latest updates. you can also check out any fill-in shifts for regular djs from the same page by clicking the link at the top. nifty!

donate your old car or boat to wfmu and we promise that we will never play the “kars for kids” jingle, ever. plus, you get a tax credit for the book value of your old beater! wfmu seeks donations of used aquatic and land-based vehicles from any state in the u.s. and in any state of disrepair. call 1-855-wfmu-car (855-936-8227) to arrange for vehicle pick-up. it’s free and it’s painless!
