what our guests say 



 











 






we had our wedding reception at tribeca rooftop and working with their team was incredible! 
“our operations manager made wedding planning a breeze – attentive, responsive, and focused on every detail to ensure perfection. she coordinated with all vendors, ran the show on our wedding day, and made it absolutely perfect. the venue itself is stunning with rooftop views, an immaculate reception room, and amazing city views. the food and service were exceptional – comparable to fine dining in manhattan. the staff went above and beyond, ensuring everyone had a great experience. we wholeheartedly recommend tribeca rooftop – they made our dreams come true!” 





gab & matt  |  wedding at rooftop 






tribeca rooftop made our wedding day absolutely magical – not enough can be said about how truly exceptional their team is. 
“from the day i met the tr team, i knew everything was falling into place, which is all a bride-to-be could ask for.
every detail of the wedding was done right (the ceremony and rooftop decor layout, the raw bar, the martini bar, the champagne, the timing and presentation of the courses, the timing and flow) – our guests had an incredible time and we have memories to last a lifetime, and in our own neighborhood, which we love. the views from the rooftop are as stunning by day as they are at sunset and at night, it’s the quintessential downtown manhattan wedding. thanks to the whole team for making the day so incredible and being so helpful through the entire planning process.
”

tr team- we cannot thank you enough for making our wedding night so special.
“there was not a detail missed, faulted, or imperfected. your team, including the food and the space went above and beyond what we could have ever imagined. 
it is clear why tr has the reputation that it does. you guys are absolute best.”
