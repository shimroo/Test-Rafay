kafka... for our time: journeys of discoverymichael majorinterpretations of kafka£7.99the book consists of thought provoking interpretations of 24 kafka short stories, based around entirely new and modern translations. franz kafka's writings have long been analysed and debated in the academic
world, in search of a definitive meaning, through a plethora of interpretations. this, along with the complex nature of the works themselves, have made kafka's literature mostly the realm of the academic intelligentsia and consequently somewhat intellectually intimidating and inaccessible to the general public. michael major breaks through this invisible daunting barrier and offers the common man access to kafka, presenting fresh insights into a selection of short
stories, inviting the readers to explore their own interpretations, based upon their own personal social experience and cultural background, free from the burden of any prescribed academic school of thought.
michael major's original book stems from his own particular experience. for most of his life he had been unaware of franz kafka's literature, much less its literary significance or the high regard it commands. his introduction to kafka came purely by chance, when a friend outlined one of kafka's more notable works, ''before the law''... and from that moment michael was drawn into the intrigue of his style. kafka's mysterious and somewhat confusing prose forced him to contemplate the story and its relevance not only to the characters within, but also to kafka's life and his own life. by conceptualising, designing, self-publishing his book, michael major sets an example as to how a person can create a worthy cultural piece of work, from inception to completion, all by himself; and he offers hope to a wide range of readers, of any age and background, that high culture is not only the domain of society's cultural elite; it could rather be explored and enjoyed by everyone.
