roots radio news


they have no words: recent americana instrumental albums

i was raised on instrumental music before i fell in love with songs and songwriters, so i keep my radar scanning for contemporary instrumental records in the roots music space. for years, such albums came predominantly from the bluegrass universe, but through 2024 and on into this year, i kept latching on to sonic excursions encompassing rock, blues, guitar folk and twangy jazz. here’s a roundup of recent recordings that will set your head bobbing while requiring no verbal skills.

on the string: red young’s epic life behind a keyboard



craig havighurst



when i met lifelong musician red young on board delbert mcclinton’s sandy beaches cruise, i knew i had to interview him. he’s had one of those journeyman’s careers that ties together all the threads of american music, from pop to r&b to jazz. he’s a pianist, hammond organ specialist, singer, arranger and producer, and at 76 years old, he’s seen it all. he’s worked with kinky friedman, joan armatrading, dolly parton, sonny & cher, linda ronstadt, eric burdon of the animals, marcia ball, janiva magness, and of course delbert mcclinton himself, whom he met in his home town of fort worth, tx some sixty years ago. sit back and enjoy the stories.

songwriting star gary nicholson stands up for 'common sense'



craig havighurst



it would be hard to name any songwriter in nashville’s long history whose work has been recorded by more stars across more genres of music than gary nicholson. the texas native came to nashville in 1980 after stints in ft. worth and los angeles, and not only did he amass an impressive string of country music hits with vince gill, patty loveless, and more, he became music city’s go-to soul and r&b man, conjuring songs for bonnie raitt, etta james, bb king, the fabulous thunderbirds and even ringo starr. now at 74 he’s turned his own performing/recording life to songs of conscience and social protest, as on his new album common sense.
