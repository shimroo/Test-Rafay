our journey:
since our inception in 1999, goldtrowel has been at the forefront of trade training. we began by offering courses in solid plastering, fibrous plastering, and traditional sand & cement rendering. driven by our success and the demand for high-quality training, we rapidly expanded our offerings to include additional trades. today, our extensive course portfolio covers tiling, bricklaying, specialist render systems, and, more recently, block paving.
