we sold our house with eau claire realty and they were an amazing team!! they were extremely professional, had excellent knowledge and timely communication. based on the showings we had on our house they were spot on with where they thought we should list our house and also did a great job with marketing. i would recommend to anyone looking to buy or sell their house!

in our initial meeting getting to know eau claire realty, john basche provided a very thorough and comprehensive overview of the area and the various points of interest of the city that meshed with our developing ideas for our property search. he is a great listener, very thoughtful and patient with the delivery of his information and knowledge.

over the last couple of years, we've both sold multiple properties and purchased a home using eau claire realty. they are always quick to respond, knowledgeable and willing to put in the effort to provide a great experience. highly recommend using them as your one stop shop for property management as well as buying/selling.

we have worked with mike oplinger through several rental property sales. mike has great communication with the seller! if we had questions, he had the answers quickly! thanks mike!!
denis & karen lotts








we began the process looking for land to build on. even though we were only looking at spending a few thousand on the land katie was very responsive. we had 3-4 family members all with different ideas asking questions and making various requests. katie was able to answer all of our questions and concerns. when we came to the conclusion that we should just buy an existing home she seamlessly changed gears and started showing us houses.

i've had good experience with eau claire realty. i've had all things, fixed or replaced, that needed attention. good people to deal with.
russ johnson








we purchased our first home this past summer and eau claire realty was the best! their team was efficient and made me feel like their number one priority. being my first home purchase they were also very good at taking the time to really explain things with me.
