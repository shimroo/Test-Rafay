hot air balloon rides
this was one of the best experiences i had!! the hot air balloon ride wasnâ€™t scary at all! my boyfriend was super scared of heights and to my and his surprise it wasnâ€™t as scary as we thought it would be! it goes up about 1,400 ft and only travels about 5mph.! the host renee was amazing! she made the experience so much better! she kept us very entertained throughout the morning ðŸ™‚ and the champagne at the end was priceless ðŸ™‚ thanks for the experience renee
