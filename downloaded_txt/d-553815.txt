create lasting family memories at foothills family campgroundwe find ourselves reflecting on the past four years of owning foothills family campground. it has been an incredible journey filled with challenges, triumphs, and endless unforgettable moments. we often joke with each other saying “what were you thinking?” when referencing buying the campground but in these four years, we have witnessed families bonding over crackling campfires, children laughing with joy and pride catching their 1st or 40th fish, and couples reconnecting with nature amidst the tranquil beauty of the surrounding mountains and lakes. we have been honored to witness generations of families come year after year to our beautiful campground. the sense of community and friendship that has flourished within these grounds warms our heart. so, pack up the car, gather your loved ones, and discover the joy of creating precious memories while camping at the foothills. we’ll see you soon.your hosts,patrick and laura mcneilly
