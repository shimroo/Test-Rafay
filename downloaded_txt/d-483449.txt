graduate, ben e.
"attending rca helped build a strong foundation in my life that helped turn me into the person i am today. i believe rca helped open doors in my life that i never thought were possible. i am thankful to be an alumni of rca!."

 



graduate, raymond c.
"academically, the teachers i had were compassionate, knowledgeable and challenging.  consequently, i was able to graduate with honors from the university of south carolina and within the top third of my class from liberty university school of law. 
spiritually, rca built an unwavering spiritual foundation centered on biblical truths. as i attended a secular university for my undergraduate degree, i was subjected to constant negative peer pressure and surrounded by people who didn’t share my beliefs.  due to my solid spiritual foundation, i understood who i was, knew my beliefs, and why i believed."

 



graduate, stephen p.
"rca, and the loving, supportive faculty there, provided me with a firm biblical foundation and sound christian worldview that has lasted me to this day.  as i look back through my life, and all of the choices that i have had to make, i can see the hand of god directing my path."

 



graduate, ashley a.
"raleigh christian academy has taught how to grow spiritually and academically. raleigh christian academy has helped me prepare for college by giving me opportunities to show my potential in academics. the staff has helped me grow my faith stronger in order to share it with others."

 





































why choose rca?
















...not just because of its facilities, although we are continually updating.









...not just because of its graduation rate, although it is 99% in its history.









...not just because of its college prep and honors programs, although students who work hard can reach their academic goals.









...not just because of its teachers who love their students.














but...because rca has a proven track record of educating students from daycare to 12th grade and has kept the word of god its central focus. we seek to please the lord and to glorify his name. you can trust your children’s future to that!
