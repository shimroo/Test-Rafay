 sanford arms
when cbs attempted to save two and a half men without the show's star charlie sheen they are not going into uncharted territory. nbc faced the same dilemma when they lost  redd foxx, the star of their number one sitcom sanford & son in 1977. the result, sanford arms, was a true debacle and one of the first programs cancelled that fall.

outrageous 
          outtakes!
warning: 
              harsh language! when elizabeth taylor was on the set of general hospital she 
              was just having toooo much fun. it's been said that the ultimate diva 
              was hyped up on pills and/or booze - that might explain her behavior 
              - or was she just the happiest person on earth!?! her 
              co-stars seemed none too happy.

john wayne's final years
a 
                longing look at the legend's last years. his tv appearances, 
                battles with cancer, the last great adventure films and how the duke faced 
                death head on. "on location in durango, mexico, he amazed me," 
                film producer hal wallis stated. "even though he was functioning 
                on one lung and had a terrible scar running down his back, he showed 
                no sign of illness or weakness. he did this own riding, roped in 
                steers, rounded up cattle, and handled the fight scenes without 
                a double. only occasionally, in high country, was he short of breath."

 cher's lost record albums of the 1970s
stars  was an attempt to warm up cher's image, to make her less icy and 
        more real. the result was a fine album by any measure, especially when 
        you consider that, up until this point, cher had mostly been portrayed 
        in public as a wisecracking, singing, dancing barbie doll come to life.

the original mr. belvedere
these feature films starred the impeccably prissy clifton webb as mr. belvedere, it's the most well-rounded character of his career and a rare starring role for this popular supporting actor. the first, sitting pretty directed by walter lang, is a riot as this erudite genius, who has seemingly been everywhere and done everything, goes to work as a live-in nanny for a typical american family so he can secretly write a tell-all book. pretty modern concept, huh? robert young and maureen o'hara co-starred.

timmie rogers
i 
                    was thinking the other day about the great, pionering black comic 
                    timmie rogers. he came up through vaudeville, he was one of (if 
                    not the) first black comedians to appear without blackface 
                    makeup in the 1940s. yes, even the 'negro' comics had to wear blackface back in the day!

della 
          reese' tough tv career
when 
                abc decided to continue with 8 simple rules  after star john 
                ritter's sudden death in 2003, they did so knowing it was a risky 
                strategy. but there was one star, della reese, who had been through 
                that very situation - twice!

bill 
            bixby's forgotten series
this 
            was supposed to be bill bixby's breakthrough into dramatic television. 
            fresh off the courtship of eddie's father, bixby was considered 
            a top audience draw when the magician premiered in 1973. 
            both nbc and paramount pictures had high hopes for this light action 
            dram about a troubleshooting illusionist named anthony blake. but 
            fate intervened, in the form of a writers guild strike in the spring 
            of '73 that threw a wrench in production schedules throughout television 
            (it's rather difficult to shoot anything when there aren't any scripts 
            ready).

overheard conversation - bob einstein
if you asked me for a list of people working in television that i'd most like to talk to, at the top of that list would be bob einstein. i've been a long-time fan, since the smothers brothers comedy hour where he played officer judy. since that time he's been a television variety show writer / producer and is today best known for two roles - super dave osborne and larry david's nemesis marty funkhauser on curb your enthusiasm. listen to the interview.

who killed elvis? 
when elvis presley passed away in 1977, the official diagnosis was a heart attack but a special investigation 2 years later revealed a massive coverup by police and medical authorities. this 60 minutes australia  segment encompasses (and condenses) the 1979 abc special investigative report by geraldo rivera; that was the first time most americans learned that elvis was a drug addict.

 wonderama!
with 
            ultra-rare video! 
wnew dropped bob mcallister following an emotional christmas day broadcast 
            in 1977 then aired reruns of wonderama for three years afterwards. 
            mcallister went public with his distaste over this practice after 
            watching reruns of his show one sunday and seeing an ad for a charles 
            bronson movie. "i had never allowed violence in the frame work 
            of wonderama. so i took out a rather elaborate display ad 
            in the new york times and told parents not to watch it anymore."

judy 
              garland's rollercoaster career
she 
                  was bred to be an entertainer; like tarzan raised by the great apes, 
                  hers was an almost impossibly insular existence. frances gumm, rechristened 
                  judy garland, was a wholly manufactured product of a stage mother 
                  that pushed her relentlessly and a movie studio that programmed her, 
                  sheltered her from reality, then coldly spat her out into a world 
                  she knew little about.

the ironic death of redd foxx!
for 
                            whatever reason (and the actor's drug and alcohol consumption was surely 
                            a factor), the network that capitulated to everyone from bob hope to 
                            johnny carson over the years refused to (or could not) make redd foxx 
                            happy.

saturday 
              morning shows 1971
1970 
                  was a very good year for network saturday morning revenues, so 1971 
                  brought a continuation of the shows that were working - along with 
                  remakes of proven series from the past. all three networks started 
                  giving in to pressure from parent groups to offer more educational, 
                  and less violent programs. for the most part, they are all flops.

1980's 
          punk rock
          in the early-eighties, young people in los angeles were flocking to 
          makeshift clubs in droves to see new, up and coming bands. live new 
          music, not djs, was what they craved. these writings provide a sketchy 
          look at the underground club scene in los angeles during the time 
          that groups like x, missing persons, the go-go's, the minutemen and 
          wall of voodoo entered the public consciousness.
