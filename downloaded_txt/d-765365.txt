 philosophy
 cosmetic surgery can and should be one of the most joyful experiences in a person's life. it is an elective choice freely made to alter one's facial image or body contour to achieve a desired and improved appearance. our patients are unique, as they should enter this experience in good health. this imposes an even greater responsibility on your surgeon to not only produce an artful result but as importantly a healthy healed patient. only in this way can we have happy patients.

our specialty of plastic surgery is based on the meticulous performance of operations grounded in basic principles of surgical science. the doing of an operation on a patient is a serious responsibility, which must have the patient's safety and well being as its main concern. cosmetic surgeries are real operations whose successful outcomes require a standard of performance and care equal to any surgery a patient might undergo. to this foundation is added the surgeon's personal skill, judgment and aesthetic eye. cosmetic operations are not trivial events. they are not "in and out" procedures, nor without discomfort or a period of appropriate healing.
