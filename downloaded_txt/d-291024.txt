                high time for the citybug!
            

                     you know what it's like! traffic jams on the way to work, people squashed together in the underground station or at the bus stop, and a search for a parking space that takes longer than the drive from home. haven't you had enough of all this? we certainly have! 
  
the time is ripe for a new way of getting about and for you to change
                    over to our new path breaking citybug! the highly efficient electric scooter is a stylish and handy alternative for short-distance trips. environment-friendly and easy to drive, it is also great fun to use. what are you waiting for?
