	welcome to simple tractors, home of the simplicity and allis-chalmers garden tractor club.


	this award-winning site is dedicated to preserving and maintaining old simplicity and allis-chalmers garden tractors -- and to you, their loyal owners.  started on december 15, 1998, this is also one of the oldest and perhaps the largest garden tractor site on the internet.  the site is largely member supported and without your help and enthusiasm, it wouldn't exist nor have endured!  


	note that there are different levels of access for visitors, registered users, and club members. access to some areas and features is restricted, based upon your status. registration is free, while club dues are only $10 per year. see the membership section for the benefits of becoming a club member and more details on the access privileges.. 


	navigating the site structure


	use the browse menu option to navigate and explore different areas of the site. you will find these interactive areas of the “clubhouse”:



discussion forums, where you can ask questions and interact with the “experts”
	

classifieds, where you can buy or sell tractors, attachments, parts, or related items
	

photo gallery, where members upload and share pictures of their tractors and equipment
	

videos section, where you can view operation, service and repair videos
	

articles section, a collection of member-submitted articles on service and repair
	

links directory, listing sources for parts, manuals, and more related information
	

calendar of club events, gatherings and related tractor and equipment shows
	

downloads section where you can download operation, service and repair information
	

blogs by our club members, covering their tractor-related “adventures"
	

		and more …
	


	or use the activity option to see the latest content, keep track of content you started or posted in, or even to create your own custom activity stream to track things


	use the research section to browse through over 1,000 pages of detailed, richly-illustrated content, categorized as follows:



allis-chalmers brochures, photos, and specifications organized by series, for their lawn and garden tractors 
	

simplicity brochures, photos and specifications organized by year, for their lawn and garden tractors
	

other labels of equipment manufactured by allis-chalmers or simplicity, including montgomery ward, homelite and deutz-allis (for now)
	

cross-reference information showing the similarities and differences between these brand labels
	

reference information including such things as what attachments fit which tractors, when the tractors were made, which engines were used, what drive belts are needed for the tractors and attachments, etc.
	

		 and more …
	


	use the tractor registry to find where members have recorded their tractors' information, provided pictures and descriptions, etc.  there's currently close to 1200 tractors listed.


	you can search all this content using the search form on the right in the yellow header bar, above.  if you click on that box, you can select specific areas to search.  to search only the research section, select posts. 


	we appreciate your patience and understanding during this ongoing construction and remodeling project as we settle into this new software system.  things will be constantly changing for a while yet, but we will try to keep the disruptions to the key navigation methods to a minimum. 


	please monitor the news and announcements forum regularly for key updates and reports on this ongoing project.  report any problems you encounter or ask for help in the appropriate using the clubhouse forums. if you find an issue with a specific page, please leave a comment on that page, if you have that option.  that makes it easier to pinpoint where there's a problem or issue. most importantly, explore the new capabilities and “enjoy the ride!” 


keep it simple, keep it going, and keep it!
