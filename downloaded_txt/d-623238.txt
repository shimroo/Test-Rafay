welcome to the official stanford prison experiment website, which features extensive information about a classic psychology experiment that inspired an award-winning movie, new york times bestseller, and documentary dvd.

  

what happens when you put good people in an evil place? does humanity win over evil, or does evil triumph? these are some of the questions we posed in this dramatic simulation of prison life conducted in 1971 at stanford university.













"how we went about testing these questions and what we found may astound you. our planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life had to be ended after only six days because of what the situation was doing to the college students who participated. in only a few days, our guards became sadistic and our prisoners became depressed and showed signs of extreme stress. please read the story of what happened and what it tells us about the nature of human nature."–professor philip g. zimbardo
