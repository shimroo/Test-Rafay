our daughter being out of the gym has such mixed emotions. as a parent, i miss the structure so much. i just wanted to let you know something. you do good things in that gym. you and kurt built something amazing there. she has been there for 10 years, almost every week, for 10 years! you have kept her safe, your staff has loved her, kept her from the cruelties of “school life” and taught her how to encourage others always. as we start to mix and mingle with non-gymnasts at school, i am reminded of these qualities that you have taught my child and i am so thankful. she spent the weekend with a former kt gymnast and their friendship is so different from the friendships she shares with school friends. always encouraging and positive and fun. and i do believe they got that from the gym. thank you again so much for the time you spent in her life. she hopes to come back some time and work for you….i think she told you that. you push your gymnasts hard….but that hard work is evident in the women they become.cathy i love seeing my daughter excited, encouraged, happy and having the passion for gymnastics that had disappeared! i know that i have said this before, but thank you, thank you, thank you, to you, kurt, your awesome staff of coaches and office personnel for the communication. we are thrilled at how much information we get and how timely the communication is. there is a genuine warmth that you feel from ktg the moment that you make contact. i love the sense of pride that is so evident in how the facility looks and how the girls and coaches act. it is such a refreshing change! you are teaching the girls not only gymnastics but a sense of respect, responsibility and pride in their gym and teammates. we are in awe of the way that practice is run and the organization that is clearly seen in everything that you do. most importantly our daughter loves practice, she is so happy, she is having fun and she has a smile on her face! thank you again! we are so glad that we made the move to ktg!d.wright dear kurt and beckie, wow. i wanted to let you know my daughter loved your gym. i was going to have her try a couple more, just to be sure, but she said absolutely not. the kids were nice. the coach was great. nice experience all around for a child who was sad and worried about leaving her friends and gym; that says more than you can believe…m.rodriguez i’m actually not sure how to put into words how very grateful we are for all 3 of your hand in my daughters life. it really is so much more than just coaching, it’s teaching perseverance, working hard to reach your goals. it’s demonstrating patience, when you have to say the same thing over and over again, not getting frustrated and having a good attitude even when you can’t get a skill. it is also amazing coaching, attention to detail and so much more, things i know i’m not even aware of. i just want to say thank-you for pouring into her, she loves all of you and kt.anonymous hi all, we just wanted to let you know how grateful my husband and i are for how great our daughter looks. you have done a wonderful job with her i cannot believe the difference in this year than from her old gym last year. please let all the coaches know that both my husband and i are really impressed in our daughter’s improvement. she came home so proud of herself and confident something we did not see in her last year… please tell all the coaches thank you from our whole family. we know we made the right choice in bringing our daughter.t.keogh the girls get medals for all their hard work…so i just wanted to send a note to say thank you for all your hard work! a big thank you to you and all the coaches for all the time and energy you all put into these sweet girls! what a fantastic first meet! i love to watch the way our coaches ease nerves of anxious girls, support them when they fall or don’t perform as well as they expect, and celebrate with them when the perform the way they wanted! i have said it before, but i truly believe that the kurt thomas gymnastics team (including staff) stands out above the rest. thank you!j.johnson   latest news  26 sepour beckie thomas live with “the fan – 105.3fm”  10 novfaces of frisco: kurt thomas gymnastics  10 novjoin the team!
