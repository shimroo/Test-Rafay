standard series house plans
this site first started out catering to the narrow lots found in old urban areas, and the arts & crafts bungalow home styles. these house plans have been built for over twenty years all across the us and in several other countries.

sustainable house plans
most stock house plans and custom homes are not placed on a building site with consideration to the sun’s path across the sky. i see only one valid reason for not considering the sun’s path in siting a house, and that is when there is no direct sun available for most of the day. unfortunately, this is often the case and that’s the end of the story. site specific design is limited with stock plans, but i have made several available. green roof house plans are also a valid option worth serious consideration. as interest develops i will add plans based on living roof design concepts. i invite people who are interested in these options to contact me.

universal design house plans
these are plans from the standard series house plans that have been adapted for typical accessibility standards. all of the universal design house plans strive to conform to several main design principles. these deal with the interior layout being open, efficient small floor plans, and exteriors centered around large usable porches.

many years ago the interior layout was generated by needs that are no longer valid today. we no longer find it necessary to separate the kitchen from the house to protect the home in case of fire, and we don’t heat with wood in the same way, etc. today, we tend to congregate around cooking activities and the entertainment (tv and music). incorporating the main living area, kitchen, and dining areas results in a space more enjoyed by most families, and maximized usable floor area. this creates larger feeling rooms and a smaller footprint.
relationship with the outdoors is also an important design principle. on narrow lots, there is only so much one can do, but the use of porches, found in traditional craftsman-style bungalows, unites the inside with the outside very nicely. the humble styles of the arts & crafts bungalows provide comfort and utility, simply and beautifully.
