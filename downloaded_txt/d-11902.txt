about compuchild 



the compuchild franchise has been providing stem and steam based after-school enrichment classes to children at pre-schools, elementary schools, after-school centers and various other venues since 1994. initially, we were focused on educating children about computers, hence the name – compuchild. over time, we broadened our mission to offer all kinds of stem (science, technology, engineering, math) programs for children. furthermore, as researchers recognized the value of art in teaching various stem concepts, we found it prudent for our franchise to focus on steam (a stands for art). most recently, we have expanded the scope of our enrichment programs even further by creating curricula in entrepreneurship.

children’s after-school 



educational franchise 







compuchild’s unique entrepreneurial steam™ educational franchises introduce children to a holistic learning experience. compuchild has been offering stem (science, technology, engineering and math) based enrichment classes to children in the united states since 1994 and recently, the franchise has started to expand in canada. understanding the significance of art and humanities in a child’s growth, the franchise expanded its focus to steam (science, technology, engineering, art and math) almost 5 years ago. by emphasizing stem subjects in collaboration with art, our after-school franchises in canada and the us were able to spark the lights of knowledge and creativity in young minds.the pace of innovation has continued to grow at an exponential pace into the 21st century and a multidisciplinary approach to research and innovation is becoming increasingly critical. along with topics related to stem and steam, we believe an entrepreneurial bent of mind with genuine consideration for business, communication, and ethics is equally important for successfully addressing the technical and social needs of a progressive society. with this in mind, compuchild now offers a unique opportunity for you to own an entrepreneurial stem™ focused educational franchise business for children. established in 1994 and franchising since 2001, compuchild has one of the most proven after school franchise models in the united states and canada.
