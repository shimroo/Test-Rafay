as performers, we offer concerts by two to five musicians.
as educators, our teaching programs range from youth orchestra training school assemblies and hands-on workshops that offer a unique introduction to chinese music, history and culture.
as artists-in-residence, we craft individual programs – from one day to a week – that include concerts, musical demonstrations, community outreach and collaborations with local performers and composers.
¬as new music sponsors, we commission and perform work by contemporary composers, and encourage new music with our premieres works concert series, the annual music from china international composition competition and the music from china prize.
