ptsd may persist in combat veterans for decades


the april 2006 edition of the american journal of psychiatry
has an article about the longitudinal course of posttraumatic stress disorder.
 the abstract is here;
the full version is here,
but requires a subscription.  additionally, there is a medscape
article based upon the original paper, here
(free registration required).  from the medscape
synopsis:
the study was done with israeli soldiers who served
in the 1982 war with lebanon.  the results are at least
vaguely consistent with my own observations of soldiers in the us who
served in viet nam, but one would need to be cautious about
generalizing the results.
the israeli investigators compared ptsd symptoms exhibited at 1, 2, 3
and 20 years after the war among 131 veterans diagnosed with combat
stress reaction and 83 soldiers in the same units who did not develop
an acute stress reaction. the researchers note that the two groups did
not differ significantly in their premilitary screening of physical and
psychiatric symptoms. [...]
at year 1, subjects in the combat stress reaction group had
a
10.57-fold higher odds of meeting ptsd criteria than the comparison
subjects. at years 2, 3 and 20, the odds were reduced to 5.15, 5.41,
and 3.09, respectively.
those with a combat stress reaction also had significantly
more ptsd symptoms at all four time points.
the authors observed that 19.8% of the combat stress
reaction group
and 61.4% of the comparison group did not meet ptsd criteria at any of
the four tests. however, members of the comparison group were more
vulnerable to delayed onset.

what they did was to divide the soldiers into two groups: those who had
shown "combat stress reaction" immediately during or shortly after
combat, and those who did not have obvious symptoms in the immediate
aftermath of combat.  note that they used dsm-iii criteria,
since the dsm-iv did not exist in the early '80s.  if they had
used the dsm-iv, they probably would have used the term acute
stress disorder.  (acute stress disorder
was not
defined in dsm-iii.)

there are a few key points here.  one is that, in this study,
they did not find premorbid psychological factors that were associated
with the subsequent development of combat stress reaction.
 another is the unsurprising observation, that the persons who
had the most symptoms early on, also had more symptoms over time.
 

perhaps the more interesting finding is that the soldiers who did not
have combat stress reaction were more susceptible to delayed onset of
ptsd.  that is, some soldiers deal with the stress well on an
acute basis, but then are more vulnerable to have problems later on.
 
"our findings suggest that (war veterans) need
long-term monitoring and professional attention," the investigators
conclude.

i hope that the people in charge of disability determinations for the
va system are paying attention.  often, veterans who turn up
years after war, claiming disability for ptsd, are greeted with
skepticism.  that merely adds insult to injury.  the
situation is already difficult enough for veterans who have
delayed-onset ptsd.  for them, one of the most vexing things
about the condition is that it seems inexplicable to them, to have done
well acutely, but to develop problems later on.  when they
take note of that apparent paradox, they tend to ascribe meaning to it.
 these faulty attributions usually are self-deprecating.

delayed-onset ptsd can
occur also in civilians, although a quick medline search did
not turn up very much information of this.  there might be
articles out there that i did not find, but if not, i would think this
would be an important question to look into more thoroughly.

candidate's forum


this is a quick report on the washtenaw county democracy for america
candidates forum, held on april 5, 2006, at the superior township hall.
the purpose of the forum was to have democratic party candidates for
state of michigan offices answer questions about themselves and their
campaigns.  this forum was small; there were three candidates
there, two
for the attorney general spot, and one for the secretary of state
(sos).  they
invited three attorney general candidates, but only two agreed to
come. 
scott bowen is the one who did not come. amos williams and alexander
"sandy" lipsey did come.  geoffrey fieger also may be running,
but nobody
even mentioned him.  for reference, here are their campaign
sites:

http://www.bowen4ag.com/
http://www.amoswilliams.com/
http://www.citizensforalexanderlipsey.com/
http://www.fiegerlaw.com/

actually, fieger's site is not a campaign site, it is the general site
for his law practice ("the nation's premier law firm").

scott bowen apparently is grandholm's pick for the ag spot.
 the two who
were there were asked if they knew why bowen did not come.
 williams
said that the rumor is that bowen is on vacation in south
carolina.  i
don't think anyone knew for sure.  

at the end of the forum, i found that
someone had placed little fliers under the windshield wipers of all the
cars.  it was a notice that said that scott bowen in pro-life.

ron suarez is making a podcast of the forum; a link should be posted here
soon (or here).

i enjoyed the candidate's forum.  both candidates for attorney
general
were impressive; i would have no trouble supporting either of
them. 
sandy lipsey is currently a state representative.  amos
williams is an
attorney, a retired cop, and a military veteran.  both name
civil rights
as important issues, although williams was a little more vocal about
that topic.  both are strongly pro-choice. lipsey talks a
little faster,
and gives a better global impression, but williams comes across as more
thoughtful.  he sometimes ran out of time while responding to
questions
(all candidate's responses were limited to two minutes.)  both
candidates
often drew applause from the audience.  both seem intelligent
and
well-educated.  lipsey has a bachelor's degree in physics,
graduated for
the kennedy school of government, and michigan law.  williams
graduated
from the fbi national academy, and detroit college of law.
 both make an
issue of consumer protection.  both characterized the current
ag, mike
cox, as being excessively pro-business and weak on consumer protection.
 they characterized cox as being a man of little action.
 they claim that
his centerpiece accomplishment -- the increased aggressiveness in
collection of child support -- as an unnecessary duplication of efforts
already carried out by individual counties. 

the sos campaign is less interesting.  the site, http://www.uselections.com/mi/mi.htm,
lists mary waters as the only active democratic candidate for sos.
 she
is hoping to unseat the incumbent, terri lynn land.  she
mentioned that
one of the reasons she is running, is that people asked her to run.
 the
other reason she gave is that the current sos had an important position
in bush's campaign, which is a conflict of interest.  waters
currently
is a state rep, and has asked for legislation that would prevent such
conflicts of interest.  the main concern that she expressed
was that the
sos in the chief elections officer in the state, and it is important to
have someone with no conflicts of interest.  she exhibited
some
awareness of the current concerns about the integrity of the voting
process.  however, i would have preferred to hear from her a
greater understanding of the complex issues
involved.  

for reference, the current sos, terri lynn land, was interviewed
previously by jack lessenberry (1
2). 
she has the idea of having picture id voter
registrations, that could be swiped in a machine at the voting
precinct.  her idea is that all of those machines would be
connected
together, so that all could be machine-verified, and no voter id could
be used more than once on a given
day.  that sounds like an expensive proposition to combat voter
fraud,
when we all know that election fraud is the real
problem.

after hearing the interview with land, i wondered how anyone could
propose to set up
hundreds of nodes in a secure network on monday, and expect it all to
work at 7am on tuesday.  it is one of those things that is a
nice idea,
but anyone who has tried to set up any large network, not even a secure
network, would probably tell you it would be foolish to expect it to
work right away.  to expect to be able to set it up and have
it be secure, and then to verify
the security and functionality, in a short period of time, seems nutty
to me.  it might work, but it might
not, and
what do you do if it doesn't work?  (not that i am an expert,
but i
think i know enough to be able to say that much.)   sure, you
could set it up weeks ahead of time, but that gives it more time to
fail, and creates a problem of how to make sure no one tampers with it
in the meantime.

is it strange to have two opposing candidates, one named land, the
other waters?

collateral damage in the war on terrorismmedical ethics in inaction


this post is about the case of a patient with duchenne muscular
dystrophy, whose life-prolonging medication was intercepted at the
border by homeland security agents.  the post includes a long
excerpt from the grand rapids press.  i
would not ordinarily excerpt so much of an article, but i think the
article will disappear behind a firewall in a couple of weeks.
boys'
medicine held up by homeland security
monday, april 03, 2006
by pat shellenbarger
the grand rapids press

tyler fehsenfeld's doctors said the 6-year-old needs a drug from a
company in england to delay his deterioration from muscular dystrophy.

the u.s. department of homeland security said he couldn't have it.

only after u.s. rep. vern ehlers' office intervened last week did the
u.s. food and drug administration release it.

tyler's parents, anessa and scott fehsenfeld, of rockford, were
relieved but perplexed the federal agencies blocked a medication vital
to their son's health.

"i'm choosing to give this drug to my son that a doctor says he needs,
and my country says he can't have it," anessa fehsenfeld said. "as if
the diagnosis isn't bad enough, and then you have this to deal with."

she ordered the drug, deflazacort, in late january after tyler's doctor
prescribed it to slow rapid muscle decline and perhaps prolong his
life. on march 6, the couple received a letter from homeland security's
border protection division saying it confiscated the medicine because
it is not approved by the fda.

"i was shocked," fehsenfeld said, frantic that her son soon could lose
his ability to walk. "you think of sneaking it over the border. you're
willing to do whatever you have to."

several other parents of boys with an aggressive form of muscular
dystrophy called duchenne received the same form letter. in november,
customs began cracking down on shipments of prescription drugs from
outside the united states.

while deflazacort is available in canada and throughout europe, the
company that makes it has not sought fda approval to sell it here. the
reason, some doctors and advocates for muscular dystrophy patients
believe, is because it is an "orphan drug," with a market too small to
be profitable.

an estimated 12,000 u.s. children have duchenne, which affects only
boys, said pat furlong, president of nonprofit parent project muscular
dystrophy. [...]

margaret wilkinson, of spring lake, said she was notified
dec. 23 that the deflazacort she ordered for her 14-year-old
son, jeffery, was confiscated. the fda released it a month
later after she called u.s. rep. pete hoekstra's
office. [...]

without the drug, duchenne patients typically lose their
ability to walk between the ages of 6 and 12, said marianne
knue, a nurse practitioner who works with wong. since the
disease also affects the heart and breathing muscles, they
often die in their teens.

"but with deflazacort, we are finding boys are able to ambulate much
longer, well into their teens," knue said, adding she has patients on
the drug still living in their late 20s.

knue said she has heard from several parents whose deflazacort orders
were impounded. she began calling customs and the fda.

"they wouldn't give me a straight answer," she said.

ehlers had better luck. after a press reporter called his washington
office this week, a staff member contacted the fda on the fehsenfelds'
behalf.

tyler fehsenfeld is the grandson of press publisher dan gaydou. [...]

in the usa, a drug can be sold only if it is approved by the fda.
 the approval process is excruciatingly complex, and costs
millions of dollars to do.  and the longer the clinical trials
take, the more expensive it is.  because md develops so
slowly, the trials for this drug, in this disease, would take many
years.  in order for it to be worthwhile getting the approval,
the potential profits from the drug sales would have to be greater that
the profits that could be gotten merely by investing those same
millions of dollars for the same number of years.  evidently,
the analysis of the potential profits failed that test, so approval was
never sought here.

now, obviously, nobody would have thought that this kind of outcome,
bizarre and inhumane as it was, would come from the global and
perpetual war on terrorism.  call it collateral damage.
 still, in any massive, complex undertaking, there are bound
to be unanticipated consequences.  

the thing is, intercepting unapproved drugs really has nothing to do
with terrorism.  in this case, the war on terrorism was merely
a cover for another part of the administration's agenda.  the
department of homeland security surely has better things to do than
confiscating some terminally-ill patients medication.  it is
difficult to figure out exactly how this fits in with their mission.
 sure, stopping some overseas drug shipments might protect
pharmaceutical industry profits, but that clearly does not apply here,
even though it would be consistent with the mission of our current
administration.  likewise, stopping shipments of abusable
drugs would fit in with their puritanical notions, but that clearly
does not apply in this case.   no, this case was the result of
a mindless power struggle.  

all ethical questions eventually boil down to the central question: who
gets to make the decision?  that is, who is in charge here?
 who has the power?  clearly, the administration has
decided that it has the power.  not the doctor.  not
the patient.  rather, some nameless customs agent who has no
idea what the drug is for, or why it is being imported, or whose lives
will be affected by the confiscation.  none of that matters.
 the only thing that matters is that it is that the
administration has to be in control of all things, at all times.
 the war on terrorism is used to justify this power grab.

in this case, the patient was the grandson of a newspaper publisher.
 he eventually got the drug, but you have to wonder what would
have happened if he hadn't had such an influential relative, and a
congressman had not gotten involved.  

this case arose from a longstanding problem with the fda approval
process.  the thing is, the system has been broken for a long
time, and it still is broken.  it's just that for decades,
doctors and their patients acted in accordance with common sense.
 the government, rather than fix the broken system, simply
looked the other way.  that was a fair solution, until some
ideologically-driven zealots decided that they would not look the other
way.  instead, they now insist that the rules be followed,
even thought the rules don't make any sense.

blogworthy articles in nejm


the most recent (3/25/06)
issue of the new england journal of medicine contains several items
that deserve a mention here at corpus callosum.  it is worth
noting that there are three items related to psychopharmacology; this
degree of attention is unusual in a general medical journal.
 all require a subscription for the full text.

there are two papers that report on results from the star*d
(sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression) project.
 one study shows what happens when patients are switched from
one antidepressant that is not working for them, to a different one.
 the other shows what happens when a second drug is added to
the first one.   

the significance of these studies stems from the fact that it is a
common decision point in the application of psychopharmacology, to have
a patient who has not responded to the first drug tried.  the
question then comes up: is it better to stop drug a, and try drug b
(switch); or, to stay on drug a, and add drug b (add)?
 although the studies do not provide a really definitive
answer to the question, they at least provide some useful information.

one of the studies examined the question of what happens when the drugs
are switched (bupropion-sr,
sertraline, or venlafaxine-xr after failure of ssris for depression).
 briefly, the result is that about 25% of the patients achieve
remission.  it did not matter which f the three drugs was
chosen:
results remission rates as
assessed by the hrsd-17 and the qids-sr-16, respectively, were 21.3
percent and 25.5 percent for sustained-release bupropion, 17.6 percent
and 26.6 percent for sertraline, and 24.8 percent and 25.0 percent for
extended-release venlafaxine. qids-sr-16 response rates were 26.1
percent for sustained-release bupropion, 26.7 percent for sertraline,
and 28.2 percent for extended-release venlafaxine. these treatments did
not differ significantly with respect to outcomes, tolerability, or
adverse events.

a few observations are in order.  first, conventional practice
has been to switch from one family of drugs to another family, when
employing the switch strategy.  in this study, all of the
patients had not responded to an ssri, citalopram.  it did not
matter if they were switched to another ssri, or a similar class
(snri), or a completely different class (buproprion).  note
that the "conventional practice" was never based upon empirical
evidence; up until now, there simply wasn't much empirical evidence to
go on.  second, the study does not tell us which patients
would be better off with one drug over another.  we are still
waiting for that study.

the second study examined what happens when a second drug is added (medication
augmentation after the failure of ssris for depression).
 briefly, the study took a group of patients similar to those
who enrolled in the other study; they all had not improved sufficiently
on citalopram.  briefly, about 30% attained remission:
results the sustained-release
bupropion group and the buspirone group had similar rates of hrsd-17
remission (29.7 percent and 30.1 percent, respectively), qids-sr-16
remission (39.0 percent and 32.9 percent), and qids-sr-16 response
(31.8 percent and 26.9 percent). sustained-release bupropion, however,
was associated with a greater reduction (from baseline to the end of
this study) in qids-sr-16 scores than was buspirone (25.3 percent vs.
17.1 percent, p<0.04), a lower qids-sr-16 score at the end of
this study (8.0 vs. 9.1, p<0.02), and a lower dropout rate due
to intolerance (12.5 percent vs. 20.6 percent, p<0.009).

note that the bupropion group did somewhat better.  this is
interesting.  in common practice, it is much more common for
psychiatrist who employ the add strategy to add bupropion, even though
there previously was no specific empirical guidance for this:  
background although clinicians
frequently add a second medication to an initial, ineffective
antidepressant drug, no randomized controlled trial has compared the
efficacy of this approach.

the common practice was guided by intuition, more or less.  in
this case, the intuition appears to have been correct.  

the third psychopharmacology paper in the nejm issue is a "perspective"
piece on the cardiovascular safety of stimulants used in the treatment
of adhd.  that paper is available only as a (180kb) pdf
download.  their conclusion: 
although the committee recognized that there are
important potential benefits of these drugs for certain highly
dysfunctional children, we rejected the notion that the administration
of potent sympathomimetic agents to millions of americans is
appropriate. we sought to emphasize more selective and restricted use,
while increasing awareness of potential hazards. we argued that the fda
should act soon and decisively.

this sounds a bit harsh to me, but i would still take it seriously.
 it may be that we need to start systematically monitoring
blood pressure in all patients who are getting these drugs.
 the number of deaths reported was extremely small, given the
millions of patients who receive these drugs.  even allowing
for vast underreporting, it still means the risk is small.  
but since the potential consequences are great, and the monitoring is
so easy, it would make sense to do it.

on the authenticity of human personality


i am just an amateur at this kind of thing, but sometimes i
just
blurt things out.  one argument that people sometimes raise,
against the use of psychotropic medications, is that the state of mind
that results from the use of such substances is somehow not authentic.
 part of this argument is seen in the controversy about
so-called enhancement technologies, in which people argue about the
propriety of using technology to make people "better than well."
 that phrase seems to be used particularly in the context of
persons using medical technologies when they are not ill, in order to
enhance some functional capacity.

it has been reported that some nondepressed  persons taking
ssri antidepressant medication become better than well.  some
may argue that there is a problem with such a mental state.
 one of the arguments is that such a mental state is not
authentic, and thus it is to be avoided.  it turns out,
though, that for the vast majority of persons, any such enhancement is
subtle.  in fact, it is barely measurable.
 certainly, no one has documented any large flux of
nondepressed persons flocking in to their doctors, trying to get
prescriptions for ssris.  granted, there is no reliable way to
prove that it isn't happening, but it is hard to base an argument on
evidence that does not exist.  could it happen? sure: it would
not be difficult for someone to read up on the symptoms of depression,
and go in to get a prescription.  moreover, someone could
order such medications over the internet, without a prescription (which
i don't recommend, by the way.)  having said that, i am fairly
sure that the majority of physicians would not expect this to happen.
 the most likely outcome, if a person were to try this, would
be for the person to take the medication for a few weeks, maybe months,
then stop.  any changes probably would be so small that they
would not be apparent to casual observation.  in order to see
the changes, one would have to do careful studies of various
parameters, and take averages among a large group.  the
changes in any one individual probably would be so small as to be
clinically insignificant.  

if we agree that any such changes are small, does that make the ethical
concern go away?  in my view, it does.  for those who
still wonder, consider the following study on nonpharmaceutical
compounds, as noted on the blog, crumb
trail:
omega
3 fatty acids influence mood, impulsivity and personality, study
indicates

denver, march 3 – omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may
influence mood, personality and behavior, according to results of a
study presented today by university of pittsburgh school of medicine
researchers at the 64th annual scientific meeting of the american
psychosomatic society in denver.

in a study of 106 healthy volunteers, researchers found that
participants who had lower blood levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids were more likely to report mild or moderate symptoms of
depression, a more negative outlook and be more impulsive. conversely,
those with higher blood levels of omega-3s were found to be more
agreeable.

"a number of previous studies have linked low levels of omega-3 to
clinically significant conditions such as major depressive disorder,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse and attention deficit
disorder," said sarah conklin, ph.d., a postdoctoral scholar with the
cardiovascular behavioral medicine program in the department of
psychiatry at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine.
"however, few studies have shown that these relationships
also occur in healthy adults. this study opens the door for
future research looking at what effect increasing omega-3 intake,
whether by eating omega-3 rich foods like salmon, or taking fish-oil
supplements, has on people's mood." [emphasis added]

note that the study participants were identified as "healthy
volunteers," so presumably none had a diagnosable mood disorder (see this
link for more detail on the study).
 the study is suggestive (although not conclusive) in that it
does not tell us for sure whether a healthy person could become better
than well by deliberately increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids.
 although not conclusive, the study raises the question: if
deliberate dietary supplementation with an ordinary food can cause a
person to be better than well, is that better-than-well mood state
inauthentic?  or is the enhanced mood state inauthentic only
if it is produced by an artificial chemical?  if there seems
to be a difference in authenticity, why does the source of the chemical
matter?

credit goes to aspazia
for the inspiration for this post, as well as some of the background
information.

early hurricane season in florida


those of us who have been following the news about global warming are
worried about the upcoming hurricane season.  but now another
storm is brewing in florida, and it has nothing to do with global
warming.  

the storm is being generated by black box voting,
which describes itself as "a nonpartisan, nonprofit, 501c(3)
organization. we are the official consumer protection group for
elections, funded by citizen donations."  they have released a
report
of their inspection of voting machine logs from palm beach, volusia,
and broward county, used in the november 2, 2004 elections.
 their report shows that the logs contain over 100,000 error
messages.  in addition, the logs show many votes were recorded
in october 2004, even though the specific machines were not used for
early elections.  
after investing over $7,000 and waiting nine months
for the records, black box voting discovered that the voting machine
logs contained approximately 100,000 errors. according to voting
machine assignment logs, palm beach county used 4,313 machines in the
nov. 2004 election. during election day, 1,475 voting system
calibrations were performed while the polls were open, providing
documentation to substantiate reports from citizens indicating the
wrong candidate was selected when they tried to vote.

another disturbing find was several dozen voting machines with votes
for the nov. 2, 2004 election cast on dates like oct. 16, 15, 19, 13,
25, 28 2004 and one tape dated in 2010. these machines did not contain
any votes date-stamped on nov. 2, 2004. [...]

the palm beach county supervisor of elections, arthur anderson, said
that his staff had looked into the problem and that the votes were
normal, it's just that the dates somehow changed.  [...]

"the votes were normal, it's just that the dates somehow changed."
 if that was intended to be reassuring, i would say anderson
failed rather miserably.  if, as he says, his staff looked
into it, then there should be a written report.  anderson
should say to the journalist, "we prepared a report, and i would be
happy to send you a copy," or something like that.

google news lists about 100 news articles that reference the black box
voting article.  most of these are reprints of an associated
press article dated 2/23/2006, by brian skoloff.  the ap
article was picked up mostly by small organizations, although some of
the big media outlets, such as the
washington post, also printed it.  a couple of
conservative sites printed it as well, including town
hall and the
conservative voice.  another news article on the
subject appeared in the south
florida sun-sentinel, dated 2/24/2006, by kevin connolly.
 

both news articles are disappointing, although they live up to the
usual journalistic standards.  

the ap writer, in a superficial effort to be fair and balanced,
contacted the spokesperson for the manufacturer of the voting machines,
and asked for a reply:
sequoia spokeswoman michelle shafer disputed the
findings, saying the company's machines worked properly. sequoia's
machines are used in five florida counties and in 21 states.

"there was a fine election in november 2004," shafer said.

she said many of the errors in the computer logs could have resulted
from voters improperly inserting their user cards into the machines.
the remaining errors would not affect the vote results because each
unit has a backup system, she said.

the problem with that, is that there is no analysis of the adequacy
of sequoia's response.  the black box voting article
indeed does cite voting card errors, but that is only one type of error
that they document.  there are many more kinds of error
reported, and most of them have nothing to do with the voting cards.
 furthermore, a reasonably inquisitive reporter could wonder
how it is that the machines handle these card errors, and what the
procedures are for responding to the errors.  one might wonder
why the logs do not show what was done to correct the error.
 furthermore, the respons that "the remaining errors would not
affect the vote results because each unit has a backup system" is
inadequate.  how does that address the problem of incorrect
date stamps?  

many such errors that black box voting reported simply are not
addressed in the ap article.  for eample:
polls closed and results
report messages would be expected to appear on every voting
machine at the end of the voting cycle, but these revealed problems
with poll worker training and procedures at the administrative/training
level. some logs reported one report printed, some two, three, four or
five, and several not only had no results tape printed but showed no
closing of the polls. (closing the polls tells the voting machine not
to accept any more votes). 

card encryption bad and card read fail
errors also appeared, with the encryption error message the more
frequent of the two. 

some logs show that no results were printed, indicating that there is
no paper record of the votes that the machine recorded.  some
show that the machine was not properly shut down at the end of the
polling session.  that would not neceassirly be a problem, if
all the votes had reliable date stamps; and vote recorded after the
polls were closed could be discarded.  but as we have seen,
the date stamps are not reliable.  i would like to think that
a vigilant reporter would notice this, and ask about it.

likewise, the south florida sun-sentinel article is only a superficial
report.  they quote a volusia county official:
volusia officials said the charges are groundless and
questioned harris' credibility.

"if you wish hard enough for a problem, your mind can imagine it," said
former volusia county election supervisor deanie lowe, who ran the 2004
election.

"i don't know of any election or of any voting system she has ever
programmed, so she does not understand the situation. . . . she doesn't
know what she's talking about."

i think it is fine to give the county officials a chance to respond,
but the reporter could do better than that, by pressing for specifics.
 lowe's response is a sweeping rejection of all claims, based
upon a vague dismissal of the credibility of the balck box voting
director, bev harris.  vague ad hominem attacks tell us
nothing.  i want to know what the county officials have to say
about the individual error messages.  i want to know what
happens when error messages occur while votes are being cast.
 are poll workers aware of the errors?  is there a
log kept by poll workers, showing when the errors occurred, what was
done in response, and which poll workers responded?  is there
a policy and procedures manual that specifies how these situations are
handled?  if so, how can citizens get access to that manual?
 what does it say a poll worker should do, if, for example, a
voting machine reports a card encryption error?  

bloggers have been commenting on this, typically with a high degree of
skepticism.  for example, an it guy, truthspew, writes:
can a president elected through fraudulent
means be tossed out?

because black box voting is really going gangbusters identifying
serious election hanky panky.

for example, while i find the grammar and syntactical skills of the
journalists at the associated press to be very disappointing, this
article ineloquently states what the problems encountered
happened to be.

even during the 2000 judicial fiat we knew something was wrong. same
happened in 2004 and dubya's plunging
numbers only reinforce the notion that something is seriously
rotten in denmark.

elisabeth, writing
on infomanic, picked up on the story, and got a useless comment:

um, elisabeth. we need to talk. the dummie funnies has long
chronicled the foibles of the veracity challenged bev harris. even the
democrat underground has banned her from their leftwing site. check out
our december 2004 archivies of the dummie funnies and then do a search
on the many references to bev harris and that should get you up to
speed on the whole black box voting thing.
the only thing bev harris and black box voting are really
good for
is as a reliable source for comedy material and for that we thank
her.---p.j.

again, attacking bev harris may be interesting, but it is a different
story.  we need to see an analysis of the specific claims made
by black box voting, and a credible explanation of each claim.
 harris provided the actual
logs -- the raw data -- that were used by black box voting.
 if someone wants to complain about her reporting, that person
needs to look at the logs and explain what all those error messages
mean, and show why they should be disregarded.    

independent
report picks up on the story, and points out:
does this sway the election results any? no, probably
not. however, we find it curious that the voting machine manufacturers
fought, kicking and screaming, against providing their source code or
the machine's capabilities. "trade secrets" they claimed, while also
claiming the machines worked wonderfully well and could not be
sabotaged. well, we know they can be hacked pretty easily, and these
irregularities point to some fishy business going on somewhere.

bev harris does not claim to know if election results would have been
any different had these errors not occurred.  from the ap
artiicle:
however, harris said it was impossible to determine
what information was altered or if votes were shifted among candidates.

that, in itself, is newsworthy.  the fact is, the results of
the election cannot be verified, because the machines do a lousy job of
telling us what actually happened on voting day.  as one
comment states here:
i started reading the actual log files... as far as i
can tell, it doesn't look like the numbers were manipulated to benefit
a specific candidate. it does look like the company is totally inept,
and isn't qualified to count jellybeans.

some people read the black box voting article and concluded that there
were problems, but the problems probably did not change the election
results.  others looked at the same article and concluded that
the problems do indicate election fraud, such as this post at what a
mockery: concrete
evidence that 2004 vote was rigged in florida.  some
echo the report, and imply that the report indicates fraud, but do not
state that explicitly; ranting
and venting: florida voting machine logs reveal anomalies,
by mindwolf,  is an example of this approach.
 
it seems like all this work the gop is doing is just
to make it easier to stage an election so they can seize power and make
it look like it was legal.

others merely report on the findings, without
adding anything; presumably, they are content to let readers draw their
own conclusions.  for example, rob galgano, at the
great leap forward, does exactly that.  in a way,
that approach is preferable to the approach taken by news writers who
provide a half-hearted attempt at being fair and balanced, but no
analysis of their findings.

what i notice about this situation, is that the black box voting
article, and the news stories about the findings by the black box
voting (bbv) organization, both illustrate similar concepts.
 what bbv found, is that one of the fundamental guarantors of
our democracy -- accurate vote counting -- is no longer credible.
 similarly, another fundamental guarantor of our democracy --
good journalism -- suffers from a credibility problem.  both
of these problems are serious, but having the two together is
especially bad.  together, the lack of credible voting, and
the lack of credible journalism, threaten to create a new storm system
in our political ecosystem.

prozac otc?


aspazia
left a comment with some questions, pertaining to my last post.
 since the response is way to long to fit into a comment box,
i've responded here.  note that the response might not make a
lot of sense unless you first read the original post, and the comment,
here.

yes, the term hysteroid dysphoria is attributed to
donald klein, from the late 60's. at this point (year 2006), it is more
of historical and sociological interest, than medical interest. as for
the question of whether maois or prozac would be better for treating
rejection sensitivity, the answer is the predictable one: it depends on
the patient, and to some extent, on the doctor. 

i am confident that the magnitude of the therapeutic effect is greater
with maois, and that a higher percentage of patients will respond. but
at least 30-35% will stop taking an maoi because of adverse effects,
compared to 10-15% with prozac.   

from the psychiatrist's perspective, the judgment about which is
"better" will depend upon a number of factors.  mds who see a
lot of young, relatively healthy patients, with clean diagnoses, and
without a long history of multiple medication trials, will naturally
see prozac as the better choice for their typical patient.
 mds who see patients with multiple diagnoses (e.g. depression
and panic disorder and ptsd),
patients who have had multiple trials on modern antidepressants, will
tend to think of maois as better.  that's because there is no
point in starting yet another trial of yet another ssri in such a
patient.  (if that was going to work, it would have worked
already.)  

some younger psychiatrists have little or no experience prescribing
maois, and would need to do their homework before doing so.
 some will do their homework, while others will not.

psychiatrists vary considerably in their practice patterns, thus there
are systematic differences in their patient populations.   it
is important to keep this in mind when listening to a psychiatrist talk
about his or her own experiences.  this is because it is
impossible to know what conclusions can be drawn from those
experiences, unless you know something about the population of patients
among whom those experiences occurred.  

as for whether patients can pressure doctors into prescribing
antidepressants, i would like to think that it would not happen very
often.  it is pretty easy to say to someone, "look, i know you
think this would be best, but i really have to prescribe according to
my own judgment..."

a bigger concern is that it is fairly easy for someone to come in and
give all the correct answers, to manipulate the doctor into prescribing
an antidepressant.  there is no good defense against that.
 as a physician, one has to assume that the patient is acting
in good faith, and the suspicion level is going to be low unless the
patient seems to be fishing for a controlled substance.  

make ssri's available without a prescription?  first you would
have to get a company that would be willing to sell them without a
prescription, and i tend to doubt that anyone would do that in the usa;
the liability issues would be horrendous.  but i realize that
is a different issue.  assuming that a company would do it,
would it be advantageous for society?  the issues i see are
these:

1. selling antidepressants over the counter (otc) might do something to
destigmatize depression, and mental illness in general, and there could
be benefit there.  

2.  it could trivialize mental illness, which would be bad.

3.  a lot of people who don't need them would end up taking
them.  most of those people would suffer no harm, except for
the wasted money, and would stop taking them after a while.

4. some people with bipolar disorder would became manic or hypomanic,
and that would be a problem; in some cases, it would be a big problem.

5. some people would try to abuse them.  most of those people
would get no appreciable effect, and would stop, no harm done.
 some would combine them with other substances, and that could
be very dangerous.  

6. some people report that antidepressants intensify the effect of
alcohol.  that is not directly dangerous, assuming that the
person does not intentionally overdose, but it can be hazardous because
the person may not realize how much impairment there is.  (of
course, that can happen with alcohol alone, but it is more likely to
happen with some kind of cns
drug involved.)

7. some people who need treatment, but who for some reason will not see
a doctor to get treatment, might end up getting beneficial treatment.
 while not optimal, that would be more good than bad, except
for #8...

8. some people who are at risk for suicide would try to treat
themselves in isolation.  isolation is very bad for persons
who are suicidal.  self-treatment almost certainly would be a
bad idea, and could have disastrous consequences.

policy wonks may have some way of estimating the magnitude of those
good and bad factors, and coming up with some kind of pronouncement
about whether the good would outweigh the bad.  personally, i
would be highly skeptical of any such analysis.  so, to answer
the question about whether ssris should be available otc, i would not
attempt a numerical analysis.  rather, i would rely on the
following kind of judgment:  

in general, it is a bad idea to make a radical change in
how a medication is used, unless the likely consequences can be
anticipated and quantified.
selling antidepressants otc would be a radical change in
how they are used.
the likely consequences cannot be anticipated, nor
quantified.
therefore, it would be a bad idea.

i realize that that is a simplistic analysis, but even so, it pretty
much sums up what i think about the idea.

it has been bugging me all day


yesterday, ambling around the internet, i read an article, and a blog
post, that seemed to call for some kind of response.  the
article is on the nation's website: brave
neuro world: the ethics of the new brain science,
by kathryn schulz; the blog post is prozac feminism?,
by aspazia.  what was bugging me, is that my intuition was
telling me that there is some kind of important connection between the
themes of the two pieces, but i could not quite put my finger on it.

tonight, i am going to try to clarify for myself what the connection
is.  this is not a post that was thought out before writing
it.  rather, i let my unconscious mind wrestle with it, and
now i am going to sit down and start typing and see what comes out.
 ah, the joy of blogging!  

i will refer to the schulz' article as bnw, and aspazia's as pf, just
as a kind of shorthand.

in bwn, schulz poses a number of questions that are created by advances
in neuroscience, and in our ability to control what the brain does.
 essentially, she points out that the prospect of enhancement
technologies will pose ethical quandaries.  if enhancement is
possible, to what extent will humans be free to make use of those
enhancements?  will it be possible, or proper, for anyone to
coerce another to make use of such enhancements?  what are we
to do about the inevitable unequal access to enhancement technologies?
 

schulz can no more answer these questions that anyone else.
 admittedly, i was sort of hoping that she would venture some
answers, no matter how speculative or premature.  

aspazia takes a different approach.  not surprisingly, she
ends up with different questions.  rather than viewing prozac
as an enhancement technology, she views it as a means of promoting
conformity to social expectations.  in that way, prozac
becomes a metaphor for the social pressures that promote conformity and
compliance in women.viewed in that way, prozac is only an "enhancement"
technology to the extent that conformity and subservience are
improvements over the original.

i will leave aside the question of whether prozac actually does that,
or can do that.

what occurs to me first, is sort of an odd parallel.  i
realize that understanding this requires some specialized knowledge,
and that i am too impatient to expand on all of the prerequisites in
sufficient detail, so i may loose some readers by not explaining things
sufficiently.

in the 1950's, three particular new molecular entities were developed
for the treatment of depression: phenelzine, isocarboxazid,
and tranylcypramine.  these were marketed successfully as
nardil, marplan, and parnate, respectively.  all three are
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois).  although there are
highly effective, they were supplanted rather quickly by the tricyclic
antidepressants (tcas).  the reason is that all of them
required that the patient follow a special diet, in order to avoid an
interaction with a chemical found in certain foods.  (see the wikipedia
article for details.)  maois also tended to cause
weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and various other adverse effects.
 

although the maois were supplanted by the tcas, and the tcas were
supplanted by prozac, they continue to excel in one respect.
 maois have particular efficacy for the treatment of atypical
depression.  atypical depression is characterized by
a cluster of four symptoms: overeating, oversleeping, leaden fatigue,
and rejection sensitivity.  ordinary depression, in contrast,
tends to involve loss of appetite, insomnia, intentional social
isolation, and fatigue that does not have a peculiar somatic sensation
associated with it.  maois are particularly effective at
reducing the symptom of rejection sensitivity, and thus are the
preferred agents for treatment of social phobia.

as an historical aside, there is a disused term lurking in the dustbin
of psychiatry: hysteroid
dysphoria.  the term hysteroid
was used in reference to an ancient (but not ancient enough) belief
that certain emotional symptoms were caused by a wandering uterus.
 (really.  people actually believed that.)
 it was thought that certain emotional symptoms tended to
cluster together, along with rejection sensitivity.  that
cluster was given the name hysteroid dysphoria.
 in the 1980s, someone got around to analyzing the statistics,
and it was found that the proposed
symptom cluster had no validity.  the term has been
abandoned since then.  in retrospect, it seems that it was
merely a term of disparagement that was applied to women who had
emotions that were inconvenient to men.  (as a part of the
process of discarding pejorative terminology, the symptom of rejection
sensitivity now is often referred to as mood reactivity.
 the two are not exactly synonymous, but close enough for some
purposes.)

anyway, in the 1950's, the treatment of mood reactivity was hard:
the patient had to memorize a list of foods to avoid, learn new
recipes, get the family to accept a new menu, and scrupulously avoid
dietary indiscretions.  likewise, in the 1950's, housework was
hard.  

prozac changed the treatment of mood reactivity, sort of like the way
the microwave oven changed housework.  just push a button, and
you're done.  nothing hard about it.   that is the
odd parallel that i referred to earlier in this insufferable stream of
consciousness.

both bnw and pf pose questions about bioethics.  specifically,
they ask how society should deal with the fact that we are developing
new ways to alter brain function.  both essays point out that
there is a potential for coercion.  

bnw concludes with this:
if we fail to have that discussion, we risk winding
up with a social
policy for neuroscience based on tactical decisions, not ethical ones;
benefiting the few, not the many; and obscuring the complex
relationship
between personal decisions about our minds and public decisions about
our culture. that is a social policy we need like a hole in the head.

pf concludes with this:
what sort of culture do we become when we can gender
engineer ourselves right into the sort of personality types that kick
ass in business, that make us less sentimental about sex, and less
overly sensitive to the needs of others?

are we ready for this medically enhanced post-modern feminism?

i think these issues are important.  what is important to
note, though, is that society does not put people
on medication.  doctors put people on medication.
 society may exert unarticulated pressure on companies to
develop products, on doctors to prescribe those products, and on people
to go to their doctors to get those products, but ultimately it is the
responsibility of the physician to be aware of those pressures,
counteract them, and to make the prescribing decisions based on
clinical grounds, with the patient's interest and value system in mind.
 

i have mixed feelings about this.  on the one hand, many
medical decisions are complex.  with that in mind, it seems
that the need for a physician to sort out sociological and gender
issues and consider them in the prescribing decision is no more complex
than the decision about who should get bypass surgery.  on the
other hand, the medical profession has a spotty record when it comes to
that kind of thing.  it has been reported that women with
heart disease have not gotten treated as aggressively, or as
appropriately, as men.  there are other examples of bias in
medical decision-making, such as racial or class biases.  i
don't think the problem of potential biases is intractable, but i do
think it requires some attention.

it is not something that worries me, really, because i do think that
the medical profession is responsive when such biases are documented.
 if we are paying attention, we should be able to avoid such
biases, so hopefully they will not occur in the first place.
 the authors are correct to point out the potential for such
biases.

why i'm no good at cryptography


one of my favorite stories from the world war ii era is that of the
cracking of the enigma
ciphers.  individuals such as the polish
mathematician, marian
rejewski, figured out how the enigma machine worked to
scramble information.  but even after that discovery, it was
not simple to figure out how to decipher each message.  that
is due to the fact that nazis changed the key for the cipher every day.
 even knowing how the machine worked, it was necessary to
figure out what key had been used, in order to decipher the message.

there are many interesting details to the story, but the main point is
that the cryptanalysts working on the problem could not rely only on
their math skills.  a certain amount of intuition was
necessary.  for example, the keys were supposed to be
combinations of letters that were chosen at random.  but
people being what they are, it was common for non-random factors to
intervene.  one such departure from randomness occurred when
the enigma machine operation would spontaneously make up a pseudorandom
sctring by typing arbitraty keys.  but since the machine
operators fingers generally started from the home positions on the
keyboard, the home keys were much more likely to be pressed.
 furthermore, it was common for the operators to alternate
keypresses between the fingers of the left and right hands.  

on the enigma machine, the home keys are asdfghjk.  so an
operator who is not careful might choose a-k-a as a key.
 cryptanalysts often used intuition to help them narrow down
the list of possible keys.  rudimentary computing devices
could help, but the intuition of the cryptanalyst often
resulted in saving a great amount of time in the process.  

now that computers have become much more advanced, it might seem that
there would be no place for intuition.  just set up the
computer to do a brute-force attack, trying every possible key in order
to crack the cipher.   but that turns out to be wrong.
 a good illustration of this comes from the story of the
chinese mathematician, xiaoyun wang.  she has been working on
cracking the md5 and sha-1 hash functions.  from an article
posted on maa online, cracking
the code, by keith devlin:
wang's approach was to input to the algorithm two
strings that differ by just a few bits and look closely at what happens
to them, step-by- step, as the algorithm operates on them. this led her
to develop a "feel" for the kinds of strings that will result in a
collision, allowing her to gradually narrow down the possibilities,
resulting eventually in her developing a procedure to generate a
collision. others working in the field remark that her ability to
intuit which of the many possible paths to follow, coupled with her
tenacity, is remarkable. commenting to the magazine new scientist,
which covered the story in its 17 december, 2005 issue, charanjit
jutia, a cryptographer at ibm's watson research center in yorktown
heights, new york, described the challenge of cracking a hash function
like sha-1 as being "like a giant puzzle." referring to wang, he added,
"most people get tired and give up. she did not"

i don't want to spur a mass panic, by starting a rumor that sha-1 has
been cracked.  i know full well, what pandemonium would break
out if that turned out to be the case.  so, i will clarify
that, so far, wang has only reduced the number of steps required to
guess the key.  it had been thought that 2^80 steps were
needed.  wang found some shortcuts that got that down to 2^63
steps.  so sha-1 still works to effectively obscure private
information.  
following the announcement at crypto 04, wang and yu
teamed up with yiqun lisa yin, now an independent security consultant
based in greenwich, connecticut, and started work on the crown jewel of
current hash functions, sha-1. this proved a much harder nut to crack,
but to the general dismay (and admiration) of the computer security
community, at the annual rsa security conference in san francisco in
february last year, they were able to announce that they had developed
an algorithm that could generate two sha-1 colliding files in just 2^69
steps.

unlike md5, wang and her colleagues have not (yet) cracked sha-1, they
have just produced a method that could crack it in far fewer steps than
was previously believed possible. that number 2^69 is still
sufficiently high to provide some degree of confidence in the system's
security - for now. so too is the even lower number of 2^63 steps that
wang and other collaborators managed to achieve in the months following
the february 2005 announcement.

a lot of computing power is still needed to get the key.  even
so, it is evident that successful cryptanalysis gets a boost from
intuition.  and that is why i am not good at it: i don't have
the right kind of intuition.

ann coulter as metaphor

peter westre, of left in the
heartland, recently asked for some commentary about
ann coulter, from a clinical perspective.  this is an
interesting topic.  in fact, one could write a book about the
subject.  

i am not going to write a book, but i will make a few comments.
 

first, the requisite disclaimers.  i have never met ann
coulter, and i cannot actually make a clinical diagnosis pertaining to
someone i've never met.  second, if i had met her in a
clinical context, i neither could nor would say anything about it.
 third, the only information i have is what is available on
the internet, and i haven't read all of that.  what i can do,
though, is use the public persona of ann coulter as a metaphor for the
dark side of the republican party.  it would be appropriate
for me to say that i do not think that ms. coulter
is at all representative of members of he republican party.
 rather, i would say that the party has been infiltrated and
co-opted by mean-spirited persons who have sociopathic characteristics.
 thus, ms. coulter can be used as a convenient metaphor to
describe this phenomenon.

ann coulter has made some remarks that could be taken as evidence that
she is a sociopath.  editor and publisher picked up on a few
in this
article.  max blumenthal has more
on huffington post.  back in 2001, the washington
monthly put together a decent
collection of some of her earlier and more offensive
comments.  indeed, some of these are highly suggestive.
on rep. christopher shays (d-ct) in deciding whether
to run against him as a libertarian candidate: "i really want to hurt
him. i want him to feel pain."--- hartford courant 6/25/99

the thing is, in order for someone to be a sociopath, they have to
actually do some bad things, not just talk about doing bad things.
 of course, i have no idea if ms. coulter ever has done bad
things.  probably not; surely the media would pounce on it if
she had.  but the fact is, it is not normal
for someone to state openly that they want someone else to feel pain.
 the fact that she makes such statements openly is not normal.
 it is not normal for someone to say openly, even in jest,
that a supreme court justice should be poisoned.  while not
conclusive, diagnostically, for someone to make such statements does
suggest the possibility of some kind of personality disorder.  

technically, there are four types of personality disorder that might
cause a predilection to make such statements.  if one cared to
attempt to establish such a diagnosis, in a casual, armchair-musing
kind of way, that could be done.  one would first read the
general criteria for a personality disorder.  (the list of
criteria can be found on wikipedia, here.)
 if the general criteria are met, one then would read the
specific criteria for those personality disorders that tend to be
associated with people doing bad things.  those would be the
cluster b personality disorders: antisocial,
narcissistic,
histrionic,
and borderline.
 antisocial personality disorder is the one that is most
closely synonymous with sociopathy.

to meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder, the person in
question has to have a history of repeatedly doing bad things.
 but what about someone who does not actually do those bad
things, but does talk about them in public, repeatedly?  
   

looking at the question from a clinical perspective, i would wonder
about the narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders.
 narcissism can be understood as being pathologically
self-centered.  histrionic personality disorder can be thought
of a being pathologically attention-seeking, especially if done in a
theatrical manner.  

narcissistic persons have a massive failure of empathy, but typically
do not go out of their way to cause harm to others.  on the
other hand, if they do happen to cause harm to others (say, by
accidentally shooting them in the face with a shotgun), it is no big
deal.  after all, it is just "collateral damage."

histrionic persons tend to be so theatrical that they may, perhaps
without really meaning to, cause great insult to others.  like
the narcissist, if they do happen to insult someone, they typically
feel no shame; they may even take pride in it.  after all, it
is "just a joke."

with those points in mind, now, ignore ms. coulter.  instead,
consider  the extent to which the narcissistic and histrionic
personality disorders can be used, collectively, as a metaphor for the
dark underside of a perverted political party.  

here are the formal criteria for the two disorders:

diagnostic criteria for 301.81 narcissistic personality disorder
(cautionary
statement)
 
  
a pervasive pattern of grandiosity
(in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy,

consider the question, of whether there are elements within the
republican party that reflect these criteria for mental disorders.
 are there frequent instances of the party have a grandiose
sense of self-importance?  has any member of the party ever
stood on an aircraft carrier, with a large banner proclaiming "mission
accomplished?"  do any of them ever seem preoccupied
with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or
ideal love?  well, forget the ideal love part, and think about
the rest of it.

what about the third criterion for npd?  any hint of
exclusivity in the statement
about the "haves and the have-mores?"
“what an impressive crowd: the haves, and
the have-mores. some people call you the elite. i call you my
base.” 

i could go through most of these criteria, and find numerous suitable
examples for each, but that merely would be feeding
the vampire.
