attention high school coaches: check the coaches only area of the forum and vote/comment on the pre-sason team polls, which will be released friday morning, november 29.  if you need a username/password to get in this area, send an email to wvmat@outlook.com and we'll set one up for you.

a couple of notes:
1. this is a special area of the forum to which only coaches have access.  also, coach usernames/passwords given for voting purposes are given as aaacoach456 or some such, and email attached to that particular coach's name come to me.  that is so that coaches may vote anonymously - no identifying data is associated with these usernames. if you have access you have been using for a few years and are ok with it, that is fine.
2. coaches will only be allowed to vote on teams in their own classification.  this prevents, for instance, a coach from one of the aaa schools from voting an overall "agree with wvmat" vote when he has never even seen any of the single a teams in action.

editor's note:  now that it's mid-april and the weather is getting nicer, updates will be less frequent, as i plan to spend nice days with my husband at our family farm after several months of sitting with my face planted in front of a laptop!

i'll be removing the 2023-2024 information from the front page soon, but i'd like to start archiving previous seasons, providing links for those in case anyone needs to reference older information.  sean "shaggy" smith does this with the ovaec.org page and i've used the feature a lot!

if you see anything that needs updated, please send an email to wvmat@outlook.com.  thanks, and have a great summer!

note about the individual rankings:  some wrestlers who are not wrestling in the state tournament are still ranked in the top 10 due to the fact that there were already more than 4 wrestlers from their respective regions ranked in the top 10.

there are a lot of things in the works this morning.  i'll be posting state tournament ticket information as well as girls state tournament information.  i've received a few late high school results from earlier in the year, so i'll get those posted.  i'm also working on getting the conference page updated.  there will be updated team and individual rankings posted in the coaches' forum for voting on the final rankings release of the season.  and yes, the rankings are only for entertainment purposes and discussion.  the real rankings happen in less than two weeks!

if you see any name, grade, or record corrections that need to be made to the state brackets, please send me an email at wvmat@outlook.com.  (if the email comes from a parent or fan, i will confirm with the coach.)  we're compiling a list of corrections that need to be made prior to submitting the brackets to the printer.

and remember to check the front page every day.  if there are any scratches/substitutions, they will be announced on the front page.

important information regarding regional seeds and brackets:
no regional brackets or seeds will be posted until all seeding meetings are complete or until aa/a region iv begins wrestling friday morning, whichever comes last.  this will prevent coaches from other regions having the chance to move their wrestlers to other weight classes to gain unfair advantage.  therefore, no individual rankings will be released this friday morning, since the coaches won't have the opportunity to vote.

attention everyone:  you may or may not have heard that i've lost almost two days' work due to forgetting my laptop power cord in lewisburg sunday morning.  i am doing my best to get caught up, but i had to get the rankings out to the coaches first, and i have been at this since 4:00 a.m. and that is not an exaggeration.  now i have to put wrestling aside to prepare for my wednesday night kids' class at church.  i should be caught up on the state duals page, high school and middle school results, academic lists, and youth postings by tomorrow afternoon.  thank you to garrett railing for all your help, and to the coaches who have been so prompt at returning my emails!  and thank all of you for your patience!

attention high school coaches: check the coaches only area of the forum and vote/comment on the second set of team polls, which will be released friday morning, december 15.  if you need a username/password to get in this area, send an email to wvmat@outlook.com and we'll set one up for you.

a couple of notes:
1. this is a special area of the forum to which only coaches have access.  also, coach usernames/passwords given for voting purposes are given as aaacoach456 or some such, and email attached to that particular coach's name come to me.  that is so that coaches may vote anonymously - no identifying data is associated with these usernames. if you have access you have been using for a few years and are ok with it, that is fine.
2. coaches will only be allowed to vote on teams in their own classification.  this prevents, for instance, a coach from one of the aaa schools from voting an overall "agree with wvmat" vote when he has never even seen any of the single a teams in action.

important information regarding state tournament ticket sales and concessions
i have reached out to both bill archer and wayne ryan regarding ticket sales and concessions at the state tournament.

tickets for the state wrestling tournament are available at the door and do not have to be purchased through ticketmaster.  however, all ticket sales, even at the door, are digital only - no cash!

as for concessions, concessions are cashless as well.  you may use a credit or debit card, or you can visit a cash station where you can use cash to purchase a card for concessions.

attention high school coaches: check the coaches only area of the forum and vote/comment on the third set of individual weight class rankings and second team polls, all of which will be released friday morning, january 27.  if you need a username/password to get in this area, send an email to wvmat@outlook.com and we'll set one up for you.

a couple of notes:
1. this is a special area of the forum to which only coaches have access.  also, coach usernames/passwords given for voting purposes are given as aaacoach456 or some such, and email attached to that particular coach's name come to me.  that is so that coaches may vote anonymously - no identifying data is associated with these usernames. if you have access you have been using for a few years and are ok with it, that is fine.
2. we are changing the team poll voting this year.  coaches will only be allowed to vote on teams in their own classification.  this prevents, for instance, a coach from one of the aaa schools from voting an overall "agree with wvmat" vote when he has never even seen any of the single a teams in action.

    i have had several calls about bringing the 5th places and to go by last year this is what i can tell you. 
    i only remember one person not making weight and i don't think anyone was taken out for other reasons. so with the 5th placers coming this year odds are 108 to 1 they won't get in tournament.

memo from north marion assistant principal jared mileto regarding the big 10 tournament
principals,

after consulting with a few of the conference officers, the decision has been made to make the big ten wrestling tournament a one-day event.  speaking with coach hays the start time will be pushed to 8 am for weigh ins and skin checks.  
jv participants will need to be dropped from the tournament due to the one day.  again, we will still utilize the cards to gain entry.  if any further action is needed, we will reach out and make everyone aware. 

thank you,
jared mileto

attention high school coaches: check the coaches only area of the forum and vote/comment on the first set of individual weight class rankings as well as the first in-season team poll, all of which will be released thursday morning, january 13.  if you need a username/password to get in this area, send an email to wvmat@outlook.com and we'll set one up for you.

note that this is a special area of the forum to which only coaches have access.  also, coach usernames/passwords given for voting purposes are given as aaacoach456 or some such, and email attached to that particular coach's name come to me.  that is so that coaches may vote anonymously - no identifying data is associated with these usernames. if you have access you have been using for a few years and are ok with it, that is fine.

memo from coach bill archer:
hey wvmat fans- let's see if we can help one of our own out. george keeney cast a very big shadow in west virginia wrestling for over 50 years.
we spend a lot talking about high school age kids. george's grandkids do not have anywhere near enough money to support what they need. 
officials, coaches, parents and fans let's help some kids that need it.
bill archer
p.s.
yes-we have introduction of former state champions at the 75th annual state tournament.
waiting to see where situation with covid is.
i have been told the tournament will not be separate again. really hard for us to get kids out to work for both tournaments. as of now, food will be allowed to be brought in the back.
wvssac paid $21500 for meals for kids, officials and coaches last year.

team polls - aaa / aa / a
from bill archer:  bridgeport will not be participating in the aaa state tournament due to covid quarantine restrictions.  the following weight classes are affected:  120, 138, 145, 160, 170, 182, 195, and 285.  all region i wrestlers will be bumped up where applicable, and the aaa region i 5th-place finisher in each weight class will now fill the "f1" position in the respective brackets.
complete updates will be posted soon, and corrected brackets will be forthcoming.  coaches will be given updated brackets at the state tournament.
editor's note:  while it's always heartbreaking for a wrestler to have to withdraw from the state tournament for any reason, it's absolutely devastating when an entire team has to withdraw.  i am not ashamed to say that i am a praying person.  i am sincerely praying for peace and comfort for these young men, their coaches, their families, and their fans.  please take a moment to do the same, and also thank god for his mercy.  it could just as well have been your team.  please do what you need to do to remain healthy for the next several days.

attention high school coaches: check the coaches only area of the forum and vote/comment on the second set (post regional) 2021 individual wt class rankings* as well as the latest 2021 team poll (which should be ready for voting later today).  as always, if you need a username/password to get in this area, send an email to wvmat@outlook.com and we'll set one up for you.

note that this is a special area of the forum to which only coaches have access.  also, coach usernames/passwords given for voting purposes are given as aaacoach456 or some such, and email attached to that particular coach's name come to me.  that is so that coaches may vote anonymously - no identifying data is associated with these usernames. if you have access you have been using for a few years and are ok with it, that is fine.

* individual rankings are totally independent of the pill, so for instance, a deserving wrestler can still be ranked #2, even if he is expected to meet the #1-ranked wrestler in the quarterfinals or semifinals.

from independence athletic director:
due to the restriction on seating capacity placed on us by the county health department and our county board we can only have 25% seating capacity in our gym.  this was based on the number of wrestlers entered into the regional tournament this year.  to keep this fair for all wrestlers we will allow each athlete two tickets.

aa/a region ii seeding meeting is tonight.
aa/a region iv seeding meeting will be friday morning.

disclaimer: we have already received word from aaa region 4 that there are several weight class changes that will not be reflected in these rankings.  there will probably be changes in all regions in both classes.  we will release a subsequent set of individual rankings after the regional tournaments.

note from bill archer regarding state tournament ticket limitations: the rules we were given for now by the civic center, governor and wvssac - capacity is limited to 1180, not counting workers, wrestlers and officials.  why would any of the people running the tournament want to keep people out of seeing the tournament?

due to the ongoing pandemic, an already shortened season and after conferring with sports medicine

however, should a wrestler choose to wrestle at a lower weight class for the regional and state tournament
