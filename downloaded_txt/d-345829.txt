getting to the heart of what matterslearn more





 adhd/neurodiversity coaching | organizing & productivity consulting | executive function skills building & support  whether you have a formal diagnosis or suspect one, you may be looking for solutions to what no longer feels tolerable. perhaps you are overwhelmed by the scope of what is required to make significant, lasting change and have lost sight of your inherent strengths and supports in the midst of these emotions.  if you are ready for change and a partnership designed to break the cycle of overwhelm, i would love to help you feel powerful in your life again.  coaching establishes a truly collaborative partnership built on trust and compassion. coaching conversations are opportunities to focus upon your needs, values, goals, and unique brain wiring. discovering how to create the life you want is a process of developing awareness, re-designing and refining processes to support your goals, and taking action knowing adjustments are to be expected and are part of the process. my role as your coach is as a reflective, thinking partner. i ask you to bring an open mind and a spirit of inquiry as you develop an operating manual that is as unique as you are. it is my mission to get to the heart of what matters most to you, in a personal, non-judgmental way. if you are looking for specific ways to create an environment and habits that support your life and who you are becoming, let’s explore coaching integrated with professional organizing & productivity consultations. reimagine your life as you learn to manage your routines and stuff rather than feel burdened by them. whether we meet in person or virtually, we work to streamline your environment and productivity habits in ways that support your sense of calm and well-being, and harness your energy, creativity, and curiosity in powerful ways. my clients are navigating life with adhd, audhd, autism, and other co-existing, brain based challenges. i know your struggle is real; it is a lived experience for me, too. i am an advocate of neurodiversity and believe it is possible to thrive as you gain a clearer understanding of how your brain is wired and determine your unique path to success. see more on my adhd page. find hope and know you don’t have to walk this path alone.   less-stress organizing solutions® was established in 2013 as a professional organizing and productivity company based in san diego, california. learning to understand and embrace my own adhd led to further study and coach training. coaching as a practice was a mindful next step for me. i am now a certified neurodiversity coach and honored to walk alongside my clients as they discover their way forward.coaching sessions and organizing/productivity consultations are held via zoom videoconference and/or by phone. on-site work is limited and decided on a case-by-case basis. sessions are conducted using mindful safety practices and are informed by current covid-19 restrictions and best practices. thank you for the opportunity to be of service. see my contact/scheduling page to schedule time to learn more.
