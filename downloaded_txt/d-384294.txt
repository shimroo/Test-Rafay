simon maccorkindale site








simon maccorkindale site@over 100 pictures, bio, films, articles


















advanced version on
http://simon.helenheart.com

    t his website is dedicated to simon maccorkindale, the british actor, 
who well-known for his role in 'manimal'
as prof. jonathan chase who can turn into any animal.
    simon first attracted me in 'death on the nile' based by agatha christie's novel starred peter ustinov, mia farrow, angela lansbury. 
he played as charming simon doyle, the murderer, but i felt sorry for his character.   
and long after i liked his reed horton, all-time villain in  'poltergeist: the legacy'. i'm great fan of this show and i maintain some sites for it (see links). when our russian tv has become to air 'counterstrike', i fall for his peter sinclair, a lead of a strike team, which was formed by a billionaire industrialist alexander addington (christopher plummer) after his wife was kidnapped. 
and i decided to make this site for simon.

    this site contains the images&clips from movies&tv made from my own video tapes, also biography, filmography, some articles, links.
