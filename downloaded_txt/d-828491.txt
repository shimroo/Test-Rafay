dravid group research in the newspearl featured on scripps

based on the recent publication in pnas, prof. dravid, dr. nandwana, and phd student stephanie ribet were featured in a story by scripps regarding their revolutionary nanocomposite coating. now, a common kitchen sponge can be used to clean water of phosphate. click the link to view full story: learn more
