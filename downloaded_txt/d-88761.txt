send me some 
		videos of your ride!!! 
		(see the faq for additional information)
now that digital video cameras have been 
		widely available for several years, and with the advent of websites such 
		as youtube that provide a forum for amateurs to post short videos of 
		just about anything, more and more video of pontiacs of all types have 
		become more widely available. in keeping with the times i would like to 
		adjust the format of the gallery to include video content that features 
		members cars. if your firebird is already here on the site and you have 
		the capability to send in some short videos of it, please feel free to 
		send them in and i'll add them with your entry. if your new to the site 
		and are planning to submit an entry please consider including a short 
		video of your firebird to send along with the pics and text.

		lastly, if you're firebird is already on the site please make sure i 
		have your most current e-mail address and send me updated pics and/or 
		information if the content currently on the site is out of date. 



         



         



 



although gm has unwisely decided to close pontiac 
		motor division forever the effort to produce a 5th gen trans am 
		continues on. several vendors are now 
		producing trans am conversions using the new camaro as a baseline. one 
		of those companies, trans am depot has partnered with kevin morgan to 
		build
		the tas inspired by his artwork. click the link below for more 
		information on kevin's designs and the new trans am being developed in 
		his name.








year one has been working to transform a number of 
		77-81 tas into super tas!!
