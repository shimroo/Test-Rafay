good news






i have two bits of uplifting news. the main is that the frozen yogurt creator that i requested this last weekend arrived sooner than required today. i didn't accept my flat mate from the beginning when he said it had arrived (it was planned to land one week from now, around this time), however once i saw it i transformed into a five year old. i'm going to make frozen yogurt tomorrow! frozen yogurt! what's more perhaps sorbet. furthermore conceivably different things, i don't even know yet they will be both chilly and sweet. it's going to be unpleasant. i'll simply quit consuming else other possibilities (note that this dessert creator is related with the increment in temperatures outside) and inflatable outwards until i'm (much more) fat! the second is that evidently my degree will be very remunerating once i've got it (i mean, with philosophy one dependably ponders). i got an email today that depicted precisely what anticipates me - a prosperous future, cash gaining force, and the admiration of all.....get the job, promotion, business opportunity and social advancement you desire!* i don't know for certain what that all methods, yet it sounds really sweet. what's more that was from a prestigious nonaccredited college! envision what an authorize one will accomplish for me. yes to be sure, great times are nearing. furthermore dessert. (perhaps simply the dessert.) *(also shallow-establishing phloem rot polyhedron equation oak-leaf bunch track pointer duroc-shirt pre-arthurian steers crossing bacterio-opsonic sheep shrub terra-cotta lumber. marble bloom anyway i take that to simply emphasize the introductory point, not particuarly detract from the guarantee included.)

name used in the united states and parts of canada for an unsweetened,
unfiltered, non-alcoholic beverage made from apples. apple cider is simple and
economical to produce. it may be thick due fine apple particles in suspension
and may be tangier than usual filtered apple juice, based on the apples used. 



this untreated cider is a seasonally produced drink of limited shelf-life that
is usually available only in fall, though it is at times frozen for use all
through the year. it is usually served on the hallowmen, thanksgiving,
christmas and different new year’s holidays, sometimes mulled and heated. it is
the official state beverage of new hampshire.

sheep






sheep (ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to ovis aries. numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep.

sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of europe and asia. one of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. a sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.
sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. in the modern era, australia, new zealand, the southern and central south american nations, and the british isles are most closely associated with sheep production.

sheep-raising has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect. use of the word sheep began in middle english as a derivation of the old english word scēap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. a group of sheep is called a flock, herd or mob. adult female sheep are referred to as ewes, intact males as rams or occasionally tups, castrated males as wethers, and younger sheep as lambs. many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.

being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology. as livestock, sheep are most-often associated with pastoral, arcadian imagery. sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the golden fleece—and major religions, especially the abrahamic traditions. in both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.

layout coordination






so if we want to get this looking substantially different to the way it looks right now we should coordinate what changes should be made and how they're to be made. i don't know much about html, and i suspect that that's true for the rest of you as well, but i think we should at least figure out what we want (lg has already mentioned separating links by blog member, which is probably a good idea). anyway, we should either talk over this here (in comments, posting, etc) or in some other venue fairly soon and if something seems out of our range ability-wise get someone who does know how to do things to help out.
