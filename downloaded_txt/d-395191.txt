'via rishikesh: en route to chittavrittinirodha'

the real life chronicle of a crazy quest, an epic hitchhiking trip, way back when...







a trip taken without preparation or proper funds, from england, through europe, north africa, and the middle east, to india.







*







paul mason was just 18 years old when the notion of visiting india
stirred in him. in order to raise money for his travels he began
selling off his possessions, but unable to raise enough ready cash for
the flight, he decided instead to hitchhike there, accompanied by
yolanda, his italian girlfriend.







the journey wasn't envisaged as a vacation but a pilgrimage of sorts,
an exploration of both inner and outer life, which, totally unexpectedly, resulted in the discovery
and exploration of authentic yoga meditation.
