the persian version: film synopsiscoming from two countries at odds with each other, iranian-american leila (layla mohammadi) strives to find balance and embrace her opposing cultures, while boldly challenging the labels society is so quick to project upon her. when her family reunites in new york city for her father’s heart transplant, leila navigates her relationships from arms length in an effort to keep her “real” life separate from her family life. however, when her secret is unceremoniously revealed, so are the distinct parallels between her life and that of her mother shireen (niousha noor). punctuated by a bright color palette, snappy comedic relief, and vibrant dance numbers, the persian version delivers an honest portrayal of a woman who remains unapologetically herself, blended seamlessly into a heartfelt story about family, belonging, and the undeniable influence of pop music.winning both the audience award and the waldo salt screenwriting award in dramatic competition at this year’s sundance film festival, writer-director-producer maryam keshavarz delivers a universal and timely story of the iranian and the iranian-american experience.written & directed & produced: maryam keshavarzproducers: anne carey (can you ever forgive me, 20th century women), luca borghese (monsters & men, okja), ben howe (goldie, diane)genre: dramedyinternational screening schedule tbt june 1, 2023sundance film festival 2023
