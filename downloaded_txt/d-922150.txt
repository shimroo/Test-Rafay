about me

i was born in 1980 and i live in brussels (belgium, europe).
two of my interests are cars and movies/series; i combine these two by managing the imcdb.org website, dedicated to cars seen in movies. i also collect model cars and like building things in lego, so in the same way as imcdb i made a small site about lego seen in movies: bricks.inmovi.es.
