what makes it official?
on each term's census date, institutional research takes a snapshot of student-related data. for fall and spring semester, the date coincides with the last day to withdraw from a course with no grade assignment, the 15th class day.  for summer semester, the date is the 5th class day of the second mini-semester.  this data is verified and compiled for official reporting needs.
