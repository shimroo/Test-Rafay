swearing in installation
 

on january 26, the dominican bar association held its annual induction and swearing-in ceremony of its officers and directors, at the united states district court for the southern district of new york. the ceremony had many guests in attendance, including, but not limited to, community leaders, judges, lawyers, and law students from throughout the state and even from the dominican republic.
the officers and directors were honored to be sworn in by the honorable judge rita mella, of the new york county surrogate's court. judge mella also swore in rosemarin belliard as the president of the dominican bar association. president belliard inspired us with her inaugural remarks as president of the dominican bar association by introducing the 2024 theme, “a labor of love.” we were honored to have chief administrative judge, joseph a. zayas of the new york state unified court system in attendance. judge zayas delivered a moving keynote address and walked members down his rich judicial journey.
we are so grateful to our sponsors and ceremony attendees for their continued support and generosity. notably, the dominican bar association extends its gratitude to gibney anthony & flaherty, llp. members may view the pictures of our swearing in on our facebook page.
