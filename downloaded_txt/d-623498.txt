got bait? got tackle?
come to portside where the service is friendly, the coffee is strong, and the fish tales are many – and where you’ll probably run into lots of other folks meeting and talking about what’s happening on mille lacs.
portside has the largest selection and highest quality live bait in the area. carrying rainbows, shiners, fat heads, crappie and sucker minnows, as well as waxies, larva, night crawlers and leeches. we stock the live bait and all the tackle you need to be successful on the lake year round.
