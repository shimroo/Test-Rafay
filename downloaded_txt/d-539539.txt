sam here people. i'm off to late start for 2011 and will try to get a weekly post on the events and goings on in my world. lots of news and changes that will be coming in regarding possible moving to boston or just staying in brooklyn. we'll see. just finished my 2010 taxes, just under the deadline.my huge question is really dudes, what's the deal? the 2011 bosox are a train wreck. it is very hard to watch these games. the can only get better. they have to get better. this is ridiculous!anyway, that is all for now. more very soon. welcome back!labels: april 2011, changes, moving, taxes

it's with a heavy heart that i bid farewell to my great grandmother: n. she left our world to hopefully a better place, aged just shy of 91 years. without a doubt, she was one of the kindest, most caring individuals i or anyone has ever had the pleasure of knowing. if heaven exists, it's a far better place with her up there. i'll bet that much bingo, bowling, gossip and laughter are being enjoyed together with her friends & family upstairs in the sky. she will be missed and never forgotten. hugs, kisses and love always, sammy, d & l and everyone who loved you the most.

can you stand it? two posts nearly back-to-back! what's gotten into this internetly-aggressive canine you ask? well, the words are flowin' like some delicious alligator wine, people! i've been trippin' the light fandango & fantastic these days people, despite the rain. damn, my peeps in ne got the brunt of the bad ass weather. the bosox were in the middle of all that horrible weekend weather too. they took care of business yesterday. and both manny ortez and my buddy #7 hit 'em outta da park! mom is cookin' up some chix for me! actually, it's for d, i think. but i know that she'll hook up her little baby!woof! woof! sammy :3-<

hidey-ho, people! sammy back here for my update on this, that & the other. over the last week or so, l, d and i spent some quality time at prospect park and then some fun was had at the dog run at union square. but some a-hole with his two damn bigger dogs than me; a rottweiler & an akita got the better of me. i was a bit underprepared, plus i'm not a fighting dog. in any event, i got bit, but am no worse for wear. don't y'all going worrying. nyc is a great place, but can be bullshit occasionally. turn the mo-fo page, i guess. i'm way too good looking to take a hit with my looks. so i gots to look ahead. see you next time.woof! woof! sammy :3-<

sammy back here folks, just been ticking away the moments that make up a dull day. not to alarm anyone, things are well, but i'm on some meds. even allergy season spares not even us canines. but i've got some bumps on the face, and some near my can. nothing to alarmed about, just seasonal bullshit. my good friends at richmond valley animal hospital in staten island took care of business. and i'm no worse for wear. happy still as can be, yo!here's a photo of me in my mommy's arms. it's just where i want to be!:on to baseball; what's the deal with the tampa bay devil rays? why are they so damn perplexing? they're as pesky as those darn poodles. the similarities are uncanny; constantly barking, kind of weird looking with that freaky curly hair, a bit ugly, if you ask me.as the month of april comes to a close, we all are looking forward to the great mid-spring good weather. we've seen some beginnings of that, thus far with some nice weather here in breuckelen.see yous all later!woof! woof! sammy :3-<

howdy partners. sammy's back here in the game. feeling good now that we've got some great springtime weather here in the n'east. heard from my buddy niall in the bay area that they're getting pummeled  with rain. damn shame. from what i hear, that's a great place to live & visit. my dad, d used to live out there and he's taken my mom, l out there a coupla times. i hope to go on the next trip. with the good weather brings some good baseball. and the red sox haven't disappointed. in regards to last night's game, i was pretty hard on our old closer, but then realized that it was rockstar #2's replacement's fault. just a note (or warning) to the folks who are looking for dog-related info. i'll definitely post some items from time to time, but while baseball season is here and the sox are doing well, then my priorities are with them. see you all later!woof! woof! sammy :3-<

some excellent baseball last night. my fav team, the bosox, won in dominating fashion 14-8, with my favorite dirt dog leading the charge, #7. a walk in the park indeed, and i, the bulldog, certainly approve of any walks in the park. some other odds & ends in the 'dog news'; are you a nyc dog owner? check out the new york dog magazine. #38 goes for the olde town team tonight. it could be a good pitching match. but i do hope good things for our old first baseman, even though he's now gone, but my dad d was going to name me for our old  #15. more later.woof! woof! sammy :3-<

quoting the great emerson, lake & palmer song, it is with great pomp & circumstance that i welcome you and myself back to the blog. where did i go? nobody knows! no big deal, really. just taking care of some dog-related business. if you're noticing my dog tag (as well as the look on my face!), you can probably imagine that i'm looking forward to the red sox game later. after the red sox took 2 of 3 from texas, they're on to baltimore for a clement vs. cabrera matchup. very excited at what myself and others are seeing with the good changes in red sox nation this year. keep up the good work, dudes! have a great weekend.woof! woof! sammy :3-<
