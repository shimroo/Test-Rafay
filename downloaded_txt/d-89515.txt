questions about nuclear power !!!!
	  a revision to the site is in progress to eliminate broken links and update 
	  the site about new reactor trends and designs. my intent is to make more 
	  use of pdf pages and combine pages, where appropriate. due toa a request 
	  from some who use the website for online courses, i will leave the site up 
	  and implement changes separately.
