about us



in 2004, canman & angela cannistraro opened visions tattoo, piercing and art gallery to combine their passions for the arts and to make a space with a focus on creativity.what we’re offering is much more personal than that. we want you to feel at home in our studio. in order to ensure that you are comfortable and confident in your decisions along the way, we work collaboratively to ensure that the artwork or piercing is representative of you and your vision for your body. we want you to leave here feeling more complete than when you walked in. we work passionately to uphold this standard.when angela is not piercing, she is stretching her creative wings with photography, gardening, painting or obsessing over her favorite 80’s hair metal bands.when canman is not tattooing, you can find him picking up the paint brush creating new worlds on canvas or meandering on trails through the woods grooving to the soundtrack in his head.

marina quintilliani











if i could give visions 10 stars i would! the environment is clean and friendly. there are a lot of options for ear jewelry to choose from. i had two piercings performed by angela and it was the best experience i’ve ever had. her passion for piercing is obvious in her professionalism. angela explained everything thoroughly, and made the process stress-free!    i’ve also had my conch & helix pierced by cynthia! she is just as amazing, professional and very thorough in explaining everything! cannot thank you ladies enough.
