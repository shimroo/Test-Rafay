car buying tips
when it comes to car buying, we've been there, done that, now serving 147 tips in 17 categories ranging from auto warranty to vin.











											what information is excluded from a vin decoder?
									 	

vin decoders omit certain car history details
due to confidentiality issues and inept inspection practices, not all vin decoders will include a car's complete history. 
here is a list of information that is not included on a vehicle history report: 
- the previous owner's name(s) - according to the 1994 drivers privacy protection act, vehicle history reports are prohibited from including such information.
- lien release information is not generally included in a vehicle history report.
- data and information regarding pre-1981 vehicles - since, the standard of manufacturing cars with vins was not legalized until 1981, adequate information is not available on models produced before that time.
