antique & 19th century cameras

before photographic apparatus was made of plastic and metal, beautiful 
cameras were hand-crafted of finely polished woods, brass and leather. 
the golden age of wood cameras lasted from the birth of photography in 
1839 to the early part of the 20th century. 

even though the industry is predominantly digital, the roots of 
photography can still be traced in its early cameras, advertising, and 
references. 

stop in and immerse yourself into the world of 19th century vintage 
camera photographica as we move deeper into the new millennium. this

"... how charming it would be if it were possible to cause these 
natural images to imprint themselves durably, and remain fixed 
upon the paper! "and why should it not be possible? i asked 
myself." 
.....- william henry fox talbot, 1844
