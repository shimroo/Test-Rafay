using text over images to develope keyword density



one of the most common mistakes i find while making sites for clients and surfing the web is the lack of keywords in a site. in order for your site to be found you need to have keywords multiplied in your page. many small businesses out there focus on trying to stick pictures all over their websites. they believe this will get them business. this may be true but you have to get them to your website first! this means finding out what your keywords are and placing them into your text as much as possible. this is called keyword density. in order to do this right you need to develop a list of keywords. pick three main keywords and about 5 minor keywords. what you should do is try to use your three main keywords as many times as possible. then you want to place your minor keywords in every once in a while. this means if your keyword is “snowman” you want to use this as much as possible. this means if you start a sentence saying “we built a huge snowman in the front lawn.” then don’t start the next sentence like “it was very large and we had fun making it.” instead you want to say something like “the snowman was very large and we had fun making the snowman.” this repeated the keyword twice now. search engines will now rank your site higher than the site that had “snowman” listed less.  remember, the more content…the more times you can place your keyword into your website. pictures will not help your site be found but text will.

analysts up price targets for google after strong results - apr. 21, 2006



analysts up price targets for google after strong results - apr. 21, 2006can you believe this! i wish i had invested in google when they went public a few years ago. firday morning the shares of google shot up 8 percent which bring the amount to about $447! price tragets for this stock are being set to $500, $540 and even $550! remember when they went public at the price of around $80 dollars a share. all those that bought shares in this stock are now driving a brand new car off what they are earning. the question is when will it end? when will google slow down? well from what i have seen google is not slowing down. they are going to continue to shoot up. i dont see gogle dorping any time soon.

google analytcis - greatest seo tool



google analyticsi have been using google analytics for about a month now. as a professional web designer and a seo i have found this to the most useful tool around. these stats will show you every kinda of graph and stats you could ever use. this beats using the stats program that comes with your web host. if your trying to improve your rankings in the search engines you can use this tool to do some seo work. i use it on a varity of my websites. not only does google analytics help you with seo but they also help you with your marketing on google adwords. google analytics will download your data from your adwords account and apply that information to the stats to help you understand where your money is acually going to. my favoirte tool in google analytics is site overlay. it loads your site and over lays information about each link contained on your site. it helps with allowing you to see what parts of your site are being clicked alot. you then can figure out how to lay your links out to better help those find what they need quicker therefore making your site more user friendly. why have a site if people leave because its to hard to find what they want. google analytics has become so popular that google is having to make people wait. you have to sign up with yoru name and email and they will contact you when they have an open slot. they are working to increase their capacity to accomodate more sites. also currently for those that are signed up you can only use up to 5 sites per account. click here to sign up for google analytics waiting list.

whats going on with tv



okay so yes, i normally only post about computer and internet related items but this just had to be done.this is in regards to mtv. i was flipping channels today trying to find something on. i come accross this show called yo mamma on mtv. now i will be honest with you...mtv always comes out with some of the most crackpot ideas on the planet. this show tops all of their crackpot ideas. this show is about putting wannabe thugs up against each other making jokes about each others moms. now i will tell you the truth. i have done this before with friends. thing is that was back when i was in elementary school! how in the world do you make a tv show about this. they sit here and declare the winner of the round based off how orginal the joke was, how quick it was thought up, and how little studdering you do to try and tell it. i know we have 500 billion tv channels but just because we have so many of these shouldnt mean that every retard that has an idea should be allowed to produce it! whats next...making a show about having stareing contests?

colorcombos.com - web color combinations tool and library



colorcombos.com - web color combinations tool and librarythis is a great site for any web designer. if your trying to come up with a color combo for your new design this is the place to go. it has many colors already put together for you to look at and also allows you to create your own colors and see them next to each other. this site helps with many aspects of creating a web design that is color friendly. my favorite part of this site is how it allows you to grab colors from an exisiting web site. this makes it easy to use a similar color scheme from an exisitng site. a must bookmark for everyone!

dietstudy.com possible scam?



dietstudy.com seems to me to be a scam. it sounds legit and they will tell you that they are legit but they are not. there are 118 reports filed against them in the bbb (better business beareu).dietstudy advertises on the radio that they will pay you $1000 dollars to participate in a diet study. you have to qualify by going to their website and answering a few questions. what is funny though is they are just part of the show. dietstudy.com uses these to distract you. you can put any answer you wish into the fields and still make. you can select to loose 200 to 240 lbs which any doctor will tell you no matter how you loose that much weight if its done in a 90 day period you can die.  once you have selected anything you get a dynamic number to use to call in to a 1-800 line. dietstudy.com has some answering service answer the phone. they will build you up and reask all those questions you submited on dietstudy.com. they do this because the code is not real. once you answer those they tell you about this one day diet program. they build you up and keep saying imagine your self in that swimsuit this summer 20 lbs lighter. dietstudy.com keeps telling you this. why? because they are about to blindside you with what the program is about. they will then tell you that you qualify for the study. wow! it really was that easy? you can hear in the background other dietstudy.com represenatives talking to others saying that they qualify too. wow! what a great program! everyone qualifies for $1000 dollars! if only it were this easy! after they tell you this the person on the phone then says..."now sir imagine your self right now being 20 lbs lighter this summer and getting all the girls you could ever want....now all you need to do is enroll!." im like sure! wow if i could ever be so lucky! "sir, we do have to ask you for a deposit of 115 dollars." at this point i was asked why. she goes on to explain to me that its to make sure your serious and it will be refunded plus you will get the $1000 dollars at the end too. this gal on the phone from dietstudy.com goes on to explain to me that during the study i will need to get refills of the pills aswell. i will need a total of two fo these before the study is over. the cost of these is $75 dollars each. i said that i believed it was a scam and she said no no no no no! we do send a contract laying out all this that will state that you will get your $1000 at the end. i asked to see the contract and she stated taht it will come in the mail 10 days after i purchase the $115 dollars dietstudy.com package. i asked if there is a pdf she could send me or even if she could read the contract to me. at this point she says "no but sir we are not a scam if thats what you think" (which at this time i was begining to think that dietstudy.com is a huge scam) "i mean sir we are not legally allowed by the fcc to advertise a scam on the radio". now this statement is true which means that someone somewhere will get paid their $1000 dollars. but this also means that they have many loop holes to save their selves that $1000 dollars. through the whole phone call i act very wishy washy and asked to cancel the order. each time i ...yes i was shot down and told  everything will be okay. she then goes on to say that she is adding a $39.95 bottle of some vitamin to my order aswell. i told her no i want to cancel the entire order! she said okay so no $39.95. she then goes on to say "sir just think of it as a small investment in your health and your perfect figure you will have". now if you ask me if this is a scientfic study why all the sales talk. why pushing someone who seems reluctant to purcase from dietstudy.com. its obvious that i do not want this product!from this phone call and further research online i have come to a conclusion that dietstudy.com in my opinion only is a scam. i got the feeling that dietstudy.com will rip you off. dietstudy.com is a company not a research lab. i would not trust dietstudy.com.  they have complaints against them in the bbb. don't believe me...take a look yourself:one day diet/products for life/dietstudy.com is looking for participants          in, what they claim, is a weight-loss study. when a bbb rep, posing as          a potential customer, called the company, she was told that the typical          weight loss was 20-30 pounds in 90 days. the "one day diet"          consists of weight-loss tablets, supplements and dieting every other day.          there is a $150 "deposit" for the first month and $75 per month          charge for the following months. at the end of the 3-month "study,"          the money is supposed to be refunded, and $1,000 is supposed to be paid          to the participant. the bbb rep was also told that the company is a bbb          member. not true! 118 complaints have been filed against this wisconsin          company, and they have the bureau's lowest rating.-bbb  (http://www.fortwayne.bbb.org/alerts/20060301.html)if you want more proof just google dietstudy scam, dietstudy, dietstudy.com and other like terms.also thier support number is horrid. if you call that number it goes though a recording of a guy yelling at you to use thier online faqs which have no valuable information at all.i will add a disclaimer to all of this. this is only my view and could be wrong. it is possible that dietstudy.com is a legit company and dietstudy.com can manage to payout to everyone that qualifies (which is everyone in the world) a nice lump sum of $1000 dollars.updatei have viewed the contract for this. it states in the contract that only 1,000 participatants will be choosen to be paid 1,000 dollars. this mean not everyone that is involved will be paid. im guessing it will only be the ones that did the best on the program and lost the most weight. i will not upload the entire contract up here just because it could be breaking laws.also, i have been corrected. the acuall company that is doing this studdy is not the one day diet but a company called products for life. i do want to restate that this entire blog is my opinion and only mine. my comments are just telling you about my experence with this company. i am in no way able to prove that they are a scam therefore this blog remains only what i have gone through with them.
