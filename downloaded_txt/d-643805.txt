khatami plots comeback
by najmeh bozorgmehr in tehran
iran’s reform-minded former president, mohammad khatami, is
considering running for the 2009 elections in the apparent hope that
he will be seen as a saviour who can extricate iran from domestic and
international troubles.
while cautioning that it is still early days, close allies of mr
khatami say he remains one of the rare personalities in iran who has
enough appeal to wrest the presidency from fundamentalists. “he is
willing to run and we think he’ll win in a landslide if elections
were held today. but we still have to wait and test the waters in due
time,” said one ally.
another ally said mr khatami had become increasingly pessimistic
about iran’s prospects, with the escalation of the nuclear dispute
with the west and the deterioration of relations with europe under
the radical president mahmoud ahmadi-nejad.
diplomats from the five permanent members of the united nations
security council will meet in washington today to discuss further
action against iran over its refusal to suspend its uranium
enrichment activities.
“he thinks both domestic and international developments will go in
such a wrong direction that the regime [leaders] will askhim to run
to help the survival of the system,” said the ally.
whether this proves to be more than wishful thinking remains to be
seen. mr khatami, who governed in 1997-2005 with a reformist agenda
that advocated “religious democracy” at home and detente with the
west, ended his second term disillusioned and facing accusations that
he had disappointed his support base.
while hardliners blocked some of his key reforms, including attempts
to expand the powers of the presidency, his followers became
disenchanted with his inclination to compromise rather than confront
his opponents.
his government’s emphasis on political reform - overshadowing
attention on social and economic problems - also proved costly,
facilitating the rise of a populist mr ahmadi-nejad.
in the absence of credible opinion polls, it is difficult to gauge
the popularity of either man.
but mr khatami has joined forces with the so-called conservative
pragmatists - the moderate conservatives close to akbar hashemi
rafsanjani, also a former president - to undermine mr ahmadi-nejad.
they are hoping that within two years, the president’s populist
economicpolicies - to reduce inflation and tackle unemployment -
would have sufficiently backfired and provokedan erosion of popular
support.
the first test of their political weight will be in the parliamentary
elections in march. radical forces in the regime, however, are
already mobilising against mr khatami.
the conservative media posted a video in june showing him shaking
hands with italian women during a visit, something considered taboo
by the clergy.
his denial of the incident did not stop young radical clerics in the
holy city of qom from taking his case to the special court for clergy
and calling for him to be defrocked.
analysts said the case showed that radicals might be looking to
disqualify mr khatami from the presidential poll.
according to the constitution, the guardian council has to vet
presidential candidates for their belief in islam and the principles
of the regime.



even more money for war september 21st, 2007   (0)

bush may boost spending request for iraq war
25 minutes ago
washington (reuters) - the bush administration may increase the
amount of money it is seeking for the iraq war for the 2008 fiscal
year that begins october 1, the white house said on friday.
the white house outlined a request for around $147 billion for fiscal
2008 for the wars in iraq and afghanistan. but the administration is
reviewing those figures and is considering giving congress an updated
request.
“i would expect it to be higher, i can’t tell you what the number
will be,” white house spokesman tony fratto said.
the washington post has reported the administration may increase its
request by up to $50 billion, which would bring the total request to
nearly $200 billion.

robert tait in tehran
  thursday september 20, 2007
  the guardian
iran’s president, mahmoud ahmadinejad, has suffered an embarrassing
  blow to
  his prestige after his own party attacked him for adopting a
  jocular tone
  towards inflation at a time of rampant price rises.
  http://www.guardian.co.uk/iran/story/0,,2172852,00.html

the rest of the piece is quite excellent:

the islamic revolution devotees society - a fundamentalist grouping
  of revolutionary veterans co-founded by mr ahmadinejad - has added
  its voice to a rising chorus of economic discontent by warning the
  president that spiralling living costs are hurting the poor and
  undermining his stated goal of social justice.
the society says the government is to blame because it embarked on
  extravagant projects while failing to control the money supply.
  “unrestrained inflation increases the pressure on the weak and
  leads to the poor becoming poorer as owners of non-monetary assets
  get richer,” it says in an economic report. “the result is counter
  to the goals, plans and slogans of dr ahmadinejad’s government.”
  the report also accuses mr ahmadinejad and other officials of
  refusing to acknowledge the problem and of making light of it with
  inappropriate jokes. it says: “sometimes some high-ranking
  government officials deny the growth of prices and deal with them
  through making jokes. to deny the current inflation or ignoring it
  through jokes is totally unacceptable.”
mr ahmadinejad has frequently dismissed complaints of rising prices
  as the invention of a hostile media and blamed “secret networks”
  for rising house prices. this year he responded to mps’ protests
  over the rising price of tomatoes by urging them to visit his local
  greengrocer in narmak in east tehran. he also answered recent
  criticism of his policies by saying he took advice from his local
  butcher. “there is an honourable butcher in our neighbourhood who
  knows all the economic problems of the people. i get my economic
  information from him,” he said.
the latest report implicitly criticises his contemptuous view of
  economics by describing it as a “specialised science” and says
  iran’s inflationary problems cannot be solved by “ad hoc
  decisions”. that may partly refer to one of mr ahmadinejad’s most
  controversial recent moves in which he ordered banks to cut
  interest rates to 12% - below inflation, which is estimated at
  between 20% and 30%.
mr ahmadinejad is on record as saying, “i pray to god i never know
  about economics”. that echoes a comment attributed to the late
  ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, leader of iran’s 1979 islamic
  revolution, who is alleged to have said that “economics is for
  donkeys”.

secret networks indeed. no wonder ervand abrahamian has a book
chapter on the paranoid style in iranian politics.

gallup poll of fsu: not better off than they were 15

hardships still common in former soviet nations
many citizens say aspects of life are worse now than under the soviet
union
by patricia guadalupe
gallup news service
washington, d.c. — when the soviet union collapsed in 1991,
residents of the emerging countries likely hoped that independence
would bring greater economic prosperity and personal well-being.
however, when the gallup world poll interviewed citizens of 14 former
soviet republics throughout 2006, respondents often reported being
worse off now than they were under the ussr.
in the transition from communism to capitalism, one might expect to
see a trade-off between affordability and quality, especially for
aspects of life that were previously subsidized or free. but while
59% of respondents across the countries surveyed say they face a
higher cost of living now than they did under the soviet system, they
commonly report deterioration rather than improvement in key
indicators of well-being, including housing, healthcare, and education.
in the case of the once heavily subsidized housing system of the
former soviet states, it is not surprising that 61% of respondents in
these countries say housing is now less affordable. but when asked to
rate the quality of housing now versus in the soviet union days, 42%
say it is worse now than it was then. twenty-eight percent of those
living in the former soviet republics say the quality of housing has
improved and 20% say it remains the same. residents of lithuania
(64%), georgia (60%), tajikistan (54%), russia (50%), and armenia
(50%) are most likely to say the quality of housing has deteriorated.
in no nation is there a majority that says the quality of housing has
improved, though residents of belarus and estonia are the most likely
to say so, at 49% and 47%, respectively.
a similar pattern emerges when examining ratings of healthcare and
education. more than half of respondents (55%) say healthcare, which
was provided free by state health institutions in the soviet era, is
now less affordable. when respondents were asked instead about the
current quality of healthcare versus the quality of care available
under the soviet union, they were more divided. thirty-four percent
of people across all nations surveyed say the quality of healthcare
is better, 38% say it is worse, and 19% say it is the same.
uzbekistanis (49%), armenians (48%) and belarusians (47%) are the
most likely to say the quality of healthcare is better today, while
those in kyrgyzstan (60%) and tajikistan (55%) are the most likely to
say it is worse.
similarly, about half of respondents (49%) tell gallup that
education, which was free, universal, and multilingual under the
soviet union, is currently less affordable. when asked to rate the
quality of education available to them, respondents are again
divided, with 36% saying it is better, 27% saying it is worse, and
23% saying it is the same. people in lithuania (61%) and uzbekistan
(50%) are the most likely to report improvement in the quality of
education, while those in azerbaijan (43%) and tajikistan (41%) are
most likely to report deterioration.

loony press release of the day: ahmadinejad to visit
	ground zero & he must be stopped! september 19th, 2007   (0)

ahmadinejad, president of the world’s biggest terrorism-sponsoring
country,
requests to visit ground zero,
the ultimate symbol of terrorism
“what a mockery! a public, bold sponsor of terror should never be
allowed permission to visit this sacred site.”
says syndicated columnist, terrorism expert, and middle east analyst
micah halpern
mahmoud ahmadinejad, the president of iran, has reportedly asked for
permission to visit ground zero during his visit to new york city
(september 25-29) when he is here speak at the u.n. general assembly
(sept. 25). this story appeared last night (22:35pm) on the website
of haaretz, the prestigious israeli newspaper.
but micah halpern, syndicated columnist, terrorism expert, middle
east analyst, and author of the new book, thugs: how history’s most
notorious despots transformed the world through terror, tyranny, and
mass murder, says that ahmadinejad must never be allowed to visit the
sacred site.
“since the islamic revolution, iran has sponsored more terror than
any other country in the world. and here is the president of the
world’s biggest terrorism-sponsoring country requesting a visit to
ground zero, the ultimate symbol of terrorism? what a mockery!”
adds halpern, “the pr people who advise ahmadinejad are brilliant to
come up with this idea.
but a sponsor of terror - a public, bold sponsor of terror - should
never be allowed permission to visit this sacred site!”
not only does halpern reject the visit to ground zero, but also
ahmadinejad’s entire trip to the usa to speak at the u.n. general
assembly on september 25, with other “thug” leaders from around the
world including hugo chavez.
“some of the most evil world leaders alive today will be arriving in
new york in the next two weeks. why are these despots even allowed
entry into the united states? by allowing these thugs to be a part of
a public, international, renowned forum, we are legitimizing their
actions and deeds. the usa should never have given them entry visas”
the un general assembly has maintained a prominent forum for pressing
issues on the international political agenda for the past six
decades, bringing together world leaders for discussion and debates
that greatly shape global policies. meetings have taken place at the
united nations headquarters in new york, though as halpern points
out, at one time the un moved the general assembly meetings to europe
in a gesture of solidarity when yasser arafat was denied entry into
the us.
adds halpern: “the us and the un have a problematic relationship. one
of the very tense aspects of that relationship is that all world
leaders are supposed to be permitted entry to the us in order to
address the united nations. the un believes that all voices including
evil voices need be represented. they think that by casting the
widest net, more good can evolve, that negotiations and improvements
can occur. but the us has never accepted that principle. as a freedom- 
loving country, by attending and allowing despotic leaders into our
borders, we give credibility to these despots.”
micah d. halpern is a frequent analyst on network television and
radio in the areas of terror, the middle east and muslim
fundamentalism. halpern, a syndicated columnist, is also a well known
social and political commentator, educator, and historian. he
lectures frequently on issues relating to terror, foreign affairs,
israel and the middle east, as well as wine history, and popular
culture. he is also author of several books, including what you need
to know about: terror, and his latest thugs: how history’s most

health insurance employment growing twice as fast as

health insurance industry employment outpacing providers and all- 
industry growth rates
by ross eisenbrey
economist paul krugman and many others have suggested that the health
insurance industry has a lot to do with the excessive cost of u.s.
health care. as krugman describes the industry, an important part of
its business model is collecting premiums while denying deserving
claims and seeking out reasons to exclude patients from coverage they
need. it takes a lot of extra employees to do this socially
questionable work, and the industry’s employment has grown like a
weed over the past 10 years.
from august 1997 to august 2007, employment in the health insurance
industry grew an astounding 52%, from 293,000 to 444,000.1 during the
same period, employment among physicians, nurses, and others who
provide health services or work to support them grew half as fast, by
26%, from 10,387,000 to 13,042,000. employment in the economy as a
whole grew even more slowly, by only 12% over the same 10-year period
(see figure). the ratio of health insurance industry employees to
health service providers grew from 28 insurance employees per 1,000
provider employers, to 34 per 1,000.

marx wanted to âorganize the myriad lilliputians and arm them with
poisoned arrows.â
“we were not aware that civilisation was a thin and precarious crust
erected by the personality and will of a very few, and only
maintained by rules and conventions skilfully put across and
guilefully preserved.”
“how can i adopt a creed which, preferring the mud to the fish,
exalts the boorish proletariat above the bourgeois and the
intelligentsia who, with whatever faults, are the quality in life and
surely carry the seeds of all human advancement?”
“i do not mean that russian communism alters, or even seeks to alter,
human nature, that it makes jews less avaricious or russians less
extravagant than they were before.”
“[t]he class war will find me on the side of the educated bourgeoisie.”
etc.

the online site where i found a text of bartleby has a footnote that
  (needlessly) describes the estimable john jacob astor in these terms:
  “a poor german immigrant to the united states, astor (1763-1848) was
  immensely successful in fur trading and real estate, becoming the
  richest man of his time. however, his name was synonymous with the
  worst abuses of big business: monopoly, worker exploitation, and
  political corruption.”

ah, but now it’s just synonymous with a stop on the 6 train.

in short, political liberalism tends to privatize, expanding the space
  for freedom (of the negative sort, freedom from government regulation,
  the only kind of freedom that americans recognize as freedom) –
  sexual and religious, as well as political and economic, freedoms –
  in the private sector and contracting the scope of the public sector
  that provides citizens with goods and services as a matter of their
  rights.  the american citizen has few social duties but also few
  social rights, the opposite of the cuban or iranian citizen who has
  many social duties but also many social rights.

this model does not have room for scandinavian social democracy,
which allows a lot of scope for private freedoms and civil liberties.
it’s like you’ve taken esping-andersen’s famous three-part model -
liberal, corporatist, and social democratic - and lopped off the
social democratic taxon.
and “secular”? the u.s.? is there any country in the northern
hemisphere where religion is such a part of public life? we have a
president who takes direction from god, a porn strike force in the
justice department, and a populace that claims it’s more likely to
vote for a queer than an atheist. look at the current absurd
controversy over john mccain’s religion. where else could that happen?

verification, perception september 19th, 2007   (0)

a delicious paragraph from the nyt’s account of the blackwater affair:
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/world/middleeast/19blackwater.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1

the iraqis’ accounts have not been verified, but the anger in their
  telling served to reinforce the feeling among iraqis here that
  private security companies care little for iraqi lives. in a war
  where perceptions are paramount, the effect is poisonous.

a professor could turn this little paragraph into an entire seminar
on ideology.
