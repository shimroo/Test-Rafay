about us


founded in 1993, second chance companions is a 501(c)(3) non-profit pet organization dedicated to helping animals in sw washington and the portland metro area.
we are a humane, no-kill organization staffed entirely by dedicated volunteers.
although we do not run an independent shelter, we care for, adopt out, and spay & neuter as many animals as possible. in addition, we educate the community and are always seeking volunteers and resources that help us to accomplish our mission.
second chance companions has rescued thousands of animals over the last 30 years. through our low cost spay & neuter program, we have altered several hundred pets. over the years, our volunteers have donated many thousands of hours of their time to care for unwanted animals.
