this fall, join gogol bordello for an unforgettable experience on their scream of my blood film tour!
each stop on the tour features a screening of scream of my blood: a gogol bordello story. after the screening, gogol’s bordello’s eugene hütz and sergey ryabtsev will engage in a q&a session about the film, followed by a spirited live performance.

tickets are available now in the tour section of the website. 
about the film:
scream of my blood: a gogol bordello story is an intimate, career-spanning portrait of ukrainian immigrant and punk legend eugene hütz. the film chronicles hütz’s journey from his childhood in ukraine, his rise to fame with the iconic punk band gogol bordello, and his defiant return to ukraine in the wake of the russian invasion. this isn’t just a documentary; it’s a raw, unfiltered look at the life of a man who turned his struggles into a universal anthem of resistance and freedom.

directors: nate pommer, eric weinrib
producers: nate pommer, beverly chase
editors: nate pommer, chris iversen, paula salhany
