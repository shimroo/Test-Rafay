what people are saying...


                dave,
                just wanted to let you know i would highly recommend omegabill dental to any biller & omegaprax dental to any progressive dental office. 
                history speaks for itself....over the last 22 years i have been associated with damar software and the products have continued to improve & 
                add features all of which streamline operations for my company saving time and money. any time a problem arose or the necessity for new 
                functionality, damar always came through in a timely fashion which is greatly appreciated by a small business owner...never did i have to 
                create a support ticket and wait my turn.
            

                thank you again for always working so hard to make my business and life easier to manage!
                warm regards,
                mike bayer
