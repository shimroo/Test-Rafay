3 ideas for using pantones 2025 color of the year mocha mousse

the earthy brown hue gives off cozy vibes.

goodbye, “brat green.” pantone’s 2025 color of the year dredges up a different summer hit – the rich brown hue an echo of sabrina carpenter’s blockbuster “espresso.”

what once dominated the airwaves will now saturate our sight lines, with pantone’s selection of mocha mousse, a hue that the global color authority says appeals to a desire for comfort and evokes the delectable quality of cacao, chocolate and coffee.



pantone has chosen mocha mousse as its 2025 color of the year. (pantone color institute)

“underpinned by our desire for everyday pleasures, [mocha mousse] expresses a level of thoughtful indulgence,” said leatrice eiseman, executive director of the pantone color institute. she went on to call the shade “sophisticated and lush, yet at the same time an unpretentious classic” and noted that it presents a “tasteful touch of glamour” while it “envelops us with its sensorial warmth.”

the color institute also pointed to the need for harmony as inspiration for its color pick. for the 2025 color of the year, “we look to a color that reaches into our desire for comfort and wellness, and the indulgence of simple pleasures that we can gift and share with others,” said laurie pressman, vice president of the pantone color institute.



pantone is selling limited-edition merch featuring the color of the year. (pantone color institute)


indeed, the pantone color institute is selling limited-edition branded merch featuring its 2025 pick, including coffee mugs, keychains and notebooks. pantone also has an array of brand partners touting mocha mousse in home décor, makeup and apparel. makeup membership service ipsy is offering a collection of limited-edition products in the shade. society6, an artist-driven e-commerce retailer, also has a mocha mousse collection, available on a variety of products that include art prints, phone cases and more.




this is the 26th year that pantone has been declaring a color of the year. back in 1999, the institute declared cerulean blue its 2000 color of the year. for 2024, it chose the pastel neutral peach fuzz. other recent picks include 2023’s viva magenta and 2022’s very peri. 

consider these ideas for upcoming campaigns featuring mocha mousse.

1. employee appreciation gifts
lean into the coziness of the shade with soft blankets or fuzzy socks.




2. fitness studios
help boutique gyms and other fitness studios build up an apparel line with fleece hoodies in earthy brown hues.




3. company stores
add a cotton cap, perhaps with an embroidered or faux leather patch, to give employees ample options to rep their company.
