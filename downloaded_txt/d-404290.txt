	 dc is the land of the outsider...
	 
    


so i've been meaning to share with everyone that there are sooooo many people from out of the area here in dc.like for example:every day i see at least one california plate (!) and two michigan plates.i know what some of you are going to say...it's because i've just moved from ca and that my sister is in mi going to school and that's why i "see" them everywhere. no, i've always been a driver that looks at plates. i can't help it, i'm always glancing down. i'm not truly distracted while i drive...but i always want to know where people are from. and friends can attest that i'd always spot the virginia tags while driving in california. there are a lot more of those plates in ca than you might think...and i should clarify that the one ca plate that i see every day does not include hugh's clunker. yes...he still hasn't registered because here on the e. coast they require yearly inspections...and we both know that it won't pass as is.i just wanted to share this realization with you all in facebookland.  hope you enjoyed my ravings.  :dp.s.  the worst drivers are those that have maryland tags...  i'm just sayin'...  i have been through a lot of states...;)gotta love the moron plate.  soooo suiting.

	 in case you care...
	 
    


well i knew it was bound to happen...before the end of july i'll be living in columbia city again.i have tried to avoid it but can't.  i don't want to but i have to do it.  there's nothing fucking there.  it's a town people live in while they go elsewhere to work, play, fuck around, do anything but live there.  now i'm going back.somebody offer a sacrifice to whatever god or god or dog or dog there may be (that's for dyslexics that read this and hope they understand me) so i can get the hell out of here!! (indiana that is.)

	 what the frick what the frock where the hell is everybody in this godforsaken place???
	 
    


come on mi amigos...where the hell is everybody??what happened to the spirit of community??hell i even had an email from amyjo this last week (cause i sent her a junk email) and that just does not happen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!so here's what i suggest: as the summer is starting and all the members are getting out there to do summer things, just remember that ol' juan bodley here is stuck in a rut.  (i will be in the midst of remodeling a house that i will move into in july/august; rlb may know it because it's my grandfather's old house next to the well shop in columbia city.  yes i have to return (for now) to that fucking hellhole...the premise is only to make it better, not (unfortunately) knock it down and start over.)   so while you're out checking out the ladies/gents/crossdressers (boz) take a few shots for me, let me see the world.cause you know there's only a few choice women there in cc, and they're money hungry bitches, so the only hussies crossing my threshold would (probably) be meth whores who break in and mormon women i invite in and chain to the garage wall...

when you think of a hard working tool bitch, just remember that we do lots of things.just remember to clean your pipe first.(i'm also excited because this coming thursday we've got a dealer's open house to attend (myself and steve, aka the boss of the tool bitch) and this one gives out good stuff.  last year they gave away a 32" lcd tv.  think happy thoughts for the tool bitch!!!  and more free pens!!!)
