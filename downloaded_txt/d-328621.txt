body armor information




 do 
          you need body armor?
you'd be surprised 
          who 
          needs body armor...

what 
            is your life worth?  
            ...or peace of mind?  what is it worth to know that you can survive 
            even a surprise criminal attack? consider that criminals prefer to 
            strike when circumstances put you in the most vulnerable position. 
            you are at a double disadvantage:



when you are 
              the target of a criminal attack it may very well be at the time 
              and place chosen by the criminal – to maximize their advantage.


even worse, 
              law-abiding citizens and police operate under strict ethical and 
              legal constraints to using deadly force. while morally correct, 
              tactically this puts you at a huge disadvantage. 



by criminal design 
            and legal constraints, you are often forced to react in catch-up mode. 
            

we 
          put the odds back in your favor.



“... 
                an order of magnitude advantage”
– 
                boston on surviving... javelin 
                press




 
            even if you are “only” in a situation where you are threatened, 
            the confidence that comes from knowing you are protected can be decisive. 
            tactically and psychologically, body armor gives you a huge advantage, 
            because you know your armour can give you a second chance.
 




it's 
                kind of like poker...
one 
                vest and one gun,
                beats no vest and two guns!




think about it 
            this way – would you rather enter a confrontation with just 
            a $600 pistol – or a $300 pistol, and a $300 vest?

 
why 'bullet proof' vests should be comfortable and concealed...

 while the extensive 
            coverage, and turtle-shell feeling of tactical armor is reassuring, convenience and concealability is often more 
            critical because dangerous situations don’t always announce themselves 
            ahead of time.
your protection 
            needs to be on before it’s really needed, because the best vest 
            for you is the one you’re actually wearing when shot!
if an armed criminal 
            notices your body armor, they can easily target, or threaten, your 
            head, hip or groin area. you have just wasted part of the advantage 
            of wearing body armor (of course you also reduced your target area 
            by ~50%!)
thus keeping your 
            armor camouflaged is critical. the military (see tactical armor) can accomplish this with camouflage patterns, but urban environments 
            require a concealable vest under clothes, or hidden 
            shields.
