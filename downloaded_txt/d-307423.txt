‚Äúthanks so much for the advice to get my clock working. ¬†i‚Äôve learned quite a bit and gained a tremendous amount of satisfaction building my own clock.‚Äù‚Äìpeter k.

‚Äúi would recommend this kit to anyone with an interest in building their own clock. ¬†your attention to detail is impressive. ¬†i received an education on how clocks work through building this clock as well as a tremendous sense of accomplishment.‚Äù-matthew f.

‚Äúmy dad made your ascent clock. when i was a child he made many clocks, and he and a friend use to collect antique clocks. anyway when i come to visit him on the weekends i love to watch your ascent clock run and hear the slow relaxing ticking. he told me that he learned more about how clocks work building your clock than all the other clocks he has made.‚Äù‚Äì daniel a.
