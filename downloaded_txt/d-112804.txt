 announcing the 2022-2023 ndbc national rankings
congratulations to lisa huber & colby deantoniis on capturing #1 bowler of the year!!
additional applause to all the bowlers who earned #2 - #20! it takes years of hard work and dedication to claim a spot on this list. thank you all for your continued
        support of this wonderful sport! stay safe and duckpin strong!!!
the oscar, emmy, davis cup, cy young award, heisman trophy, and the americaâs cup all acknowledge the best! so, too, the ndbc national trophy is the duckpin bowlerâs way of recognizing their best . . . their #1 duckpinners!!! since 1928, the highest achievement in duckpin bowling has been to be named the top ranked bowler. each year for many decades, one male and one female bowler have been ranked as #1. to reach this pinnacle bowlers must demonstrate the outstanding duckpin bowling skills which culminate their years of practice and hard work.
annually for almost a century, the national duckpin bowling congress has honored each of the #1 bowlers. they are currently awarded a hand-crafted, custom-created,
        blown glass trophy in recognition of their achievement. the names of these two bowlers are added to, and become a permanent part of, the national trophy display.
men's top 20  women's top 20
