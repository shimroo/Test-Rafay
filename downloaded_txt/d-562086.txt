"my strength, flexibility, balance and overall fitness have improved. it has helped my running (my runner friends ask me what i'm doing to get faster). yoga has improved my ability to let go of stress, to sleep better, to understand my body and to be calmer and more mindful. it truly is moving meditation."— betty






















"as a result of regular practice, i have increased discipline, mental focus and patience. i’ve learned to listen/read my body signals and i heal faster from injuries because i’ve strengthened joints (tendons and ligaments), gained muscle balance and heat tolerance." — lisa






















“i am 76 years old and an avid golfer. i have been going to yoga classes 2-3 times a week for last fifteen years. i can definitely attest that yoga quest has been a very positive addition to my life. i would highly recommend this studio for anyone that wants to improve their physical and mental well-being. “— carl
