brooklyn acupuncture and traditional chinese medicine for women’s health
our fast-paced western lifestyles pull our lives out of balance. traditional chinese medicine principles and treatments offer us a way to regain and maintain our balance, while living our lives to the fullest. in my practice, i find that small changes to peoples’ lives bring the biggest results in the long run. using acupuncture and herbs, diet, exercise, ergonomics, and more, i help people live healthier lives.
i am a general practitioner with a wide range of clinical experience in women’s health – including pms, painful periods, infertility, ivf, pregnancy, pre-labor treatment, post-partum, perimenopause, hormonal acne –  and digestive disorders, sport’s injuries, repetitive stress injuries, migraines, men’s health, stop smoking, weight loss support, neck and back pain, stress management and more.
for more information about how traditional chinese medicine can help you, please visit the contact page and drop me a line.
i look forward to hearing from you.
be well!

testimonialsafter just one acupuncture treatment and some herbs, my "problem" was almost completely alleviated!  what's more, it seemed to have improved some other areas that i thought were completely unrelated such as less anxiety and a more robust libido!

thanks laura, for your miracle works!
