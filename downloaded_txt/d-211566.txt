important announcement: one world telecommunications is closing
it is with a heavy heart that we announce that one world telecommunications will permanently close february 28, 2025.
since 1994, we have proudly served our local community. the passing of don short, our company's founder, has profoundly impacted our operations and team. his vision, dedication, and leadership shaped one world telecommunications into what it is today, and his absence leaves a void that cannot be filled.
thank you
we sincerely thank our loyal customers, employees, and partners for 30 years of support. your trust and patronage have meant the world to us. it has been an honor to serve you and be a part of your lives and businesses.

cline computers in richland will be taking over our services. this includes email, dns, and web hosting services.
