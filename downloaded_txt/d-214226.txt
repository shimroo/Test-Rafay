playstation 5 sold 4.5m units in less than two months
february 16th, 2021, 23:59 posted by: wraggsterthe playstation 5 sold 4.5 million units in the holiday quarter, despite supply shortages making the hardware difficult to find.
while sony interactive entertainment had already said that the ps5 launch set a new record, sony corp.'s third quarter results offered the first official sales figure.
the new console hit 4.5 million units less than two months after its launch, on november 13, 2020. the playstation 4 also sold 1.4 million units during the quarter.
hardware performance helped to drive sony's game and network services division to â¥883 billion ($8.4 billion) in revenue, up 25% over the same quarter last year.
the division made an operating profit of â¥80 billion ($762 million), an increase of 27% year-on-year.
sony interactive entertainment's operating income was hampered by the cost of production of the ps5. according to sony, "strategic price points for ps5 hardware...were set lower than the manufacturing costs."
even with a new console launch, the majority of sie's revenue still came from software, which helped to balance the impact of selling the ps5 at a loss.
the division earned â¥433 billion in revenue from digital software -- an increase of 42% over the prior year. within that, only â¥51 billion was made from physical game sales, with the remainder coming from digital downloads (â¥176 billion) and add-on content (â¥256 billion).

having launched on november 12, insomniac's game had shifted these copies by december 31, 2020, sony said in its earnings call.
spider-man: miles morales was the ps5's biggest launch game in the uk, though sales didn't quite reach the height of 2018's marvel's spider-man in the country. the title debuted at no.3 in the uk charts, with 71% of its sales going to ps5. sales for the title were boosted around christmas, with a 45% rise that helped it climb to no.6.

ps5's dualsense controller also faces drift issues
february 16th, 2021, 23:01 posted by: wraggsterplaystation 5's controller, the dualsense, is allegedly suffering from the same drift issues that have been widely reported in the nintendo switch's joy-con.
players reported stick drift issues online as early as ten days after their purchase of sony's console, kotaku reported. the issue sees the dualsense controller registering movement even when it's not being used, which you can see in this video posted on reddit by a destiny 2 player.
sony's customer support told kotaku that controller drift is covered by the console's warranty, but you have to pay for the shipping fees yourself if you want to send the controller to a repair center.
gamesindustry.biz reached out to sony for comment.

first ps5 drift class action lawsuit filed against sony
february 15th, 2021, 23:22 posted by: wraggsterlaw firm chimicles schwartz kriner & donaldson-smith llp filed a class action lawsuit against sony regarding the playstation 5's dualsense controller drift.
the lawsuit was filed on february 12 in the us district court for the southern district of new york, on behalf of plaintiff lmarc turner and "similarly situated consumers."
the lawsuit, a copy of which was sent to gamesindustry.biz, argued that the dualsense controller is "defective" as it suffers from a drift defect, a problem that sees it recording input even when the player is not using it.
the issue "compromises the dualsense controller's core functionality," the document continued, adding that sony has been made aware of the issues through online consumer complaints. the lawsuit mentioned the case of a player encountering drift issues as early as ten days after their purchase, directly quoting the kotaku report that unearthed the drifting issues last week.

game details efforts to prevent ps5 scalpers
january 21st, 2021, 22:31 posted by: wraggstergame has offered more insight into the systems it has in place to prevent scalpers using bots to snap up new playstation 5 stock.
a statement released to vgc assured that the uk retailer is only selling one ps5 unit per customer and has checks and processes to ensure no one is purchasing multiple consoles.
"playstation 5 [continues] to be in very high demand and that demand far outweighs current supply," the spokesperson said. "we have strong measures in place to help ensure that our 'one per customer' statement is maintained to allow for as many individual customers to successfully purchase as possible.
"all pre-orders are subject to automatic checks, and order updates -- such as cancellations following these checks -- take place after a customer will have received a valid order confirmation email.
"at the present time, these orders are still pre-orders and as such no payments have yet been taken from customers. payments will commence once our order checks have been completed."

theflow announces wip 'grand theft auto: san andreas' port for the ps vita
january 19th, 2021, 21:33 posted by: wraggstersony might have forgotten that it has a gaming handheld called the ps vita but the homebrew scene hasn't. one of the latest works from the scene comes from theflow, who also recently disclosed an exploit on the ps4's firmware 7.55. via a recent tweet, the modder announced that he managed to port the androidâs version of grand theft auto: san andreas to the ps vita by writing a .so (shared object) loader and replacing shaders.

theflow mentioned that this port wasn't as difficult as it might sound and got the game to run "at a good framerate", although it is still a work-in-progress with "lots to optimize".

ps4 firmware 7.55 exploit revealed by theflow
january 18th, 2021, 23:28 posted by: wraggsteran exploit for the ps4's firmware 7.55 was revealed today by hacking scene member theflow. however, it was actually reported back in june 2020 and disclosed only today as theflow worked with sony's hackerone bounty program to patch this vulnerability. the reported exploit was marked as resolved in october. theflow also did similar disclosures with previous exploits he found and helped fix.

the hackerone page notes that this vulnerability can cause a "fully chained remote attack" when used with a webkit exploit, steal/manipulate user data and even dump and run pirated games. as such, it could be used together with the webkit exploit from last december to jailbreak ps4 systems on firmware 7.55. however, no relevant files have been made publicly available regarding the fw 7.55 exploit with today's disclosure.

[1-11-2021] a playable psp remake of the original ‘tomb raider’ has been discovered
january 11th, 2021, 20:31 posted by: shryguevia review geek


despite being fairly antiquated by todayâs standards, the original tomb raider was  groundbreaking at the time. the pc/playstation action game broke molds  with its mix of 3d platforming, exploration, and combat, and protagonist  lara croft is now a media icon. ten years after her 1996 pc debut, a  glammed-up remake for the playstation portable was planned, but never  released.


 now an alpha version of that game, titled tomb raider: 10th anniversary, has been discovered by super-fans at tomb-of-ash.com.  the psp rom of the cancelled game can be played on a pc with a  download, a patch, and a standard controller. itâs pretty basic, with  empty levels devoid of enemies and dialogue, but players can side-jump  around peru, greece, and croft manner to take a look at the gameâs  updated visuals.


tomb raider: 10th anniversary was scrapped as publisher  eidos moved the franchise from the original developer core design to  crystal dynamics, which released a a reboot game in 2006 (tomb raider legend) and a more comprehensive remake of the original (simply called âanniversaryâ) in 2007. core design was closed a few years later.  the work on the cancelled game was at one point put towards an untitled indiana jones project (ironic, because tomb raider is very much inspired by those movies), before being tossed completely.


 this resurfaced game is a footnote in the history of the series, and  as a remaster of the original, isnât particularly noteworthy aside from  being made by the original developers. the original tomb raider and its two sequels are still available and playable on pc.


head over to tomb-of-ash to download and try the incomplete build of the psp tomb raider remake. leave your thoughts on it via comments below.

polish competition watchdog investigating cyberpunk 2077
january 11th, 2021, 18:09 posted by: wraggstercyberpunk 2077 developer cd projekt red is being investigated by poland's office of competition and consumer protection (uokik).

the news was initially reported by polish business newspaper dziennik gazeta prawna, with uokik's spokesperson małgorzata cieloch saying that the organisation approached cd projekt red to understand the issues with the game and what actions had been taken to fix them.

"we will check how the manufacturer is working on the introduction of amendments or solution to difficulties preventing the game [to work] on different consoles, but also how it intends to act in relation to the persons who filed complaints and are dissatisfied with [their] purchase due to the inability to play games on owned equipment despite previous assurances [that it would]," they continued (translation via google translate).

[release] sonic cd for ps vita
january 8th, 2021, 13:38 posted by: wraggstervia [release] sonic cd for ps vita | gbatemp.net - the independent video game community

following the full disassembly of sonic cd from the amazing work of rubberduckycooly, i am releasing a port of sonic cd running natively on ps vita.

the porting is pixel-perfect and it basically runs on an internal resolution of 480x240 upscaled by 2x. this is an unofficial port, meaning that i forked the original source code and modified it to make it running on ps vita. i am already in contact with the original author to integrate my changes on his repo.

please follow the instructions on the release page to make it work. the vpk itself does not contain any copyrighted assets. it's not 100% perfect but it's fluid enough to be fully playable.

sony reportedly discontinues all ps4 pro and most ps4 slim models production in japan
january 8th, 2021, 13:36 posted by: wraggsternow that a new generation of consoles has arrived, the old ones have to make way and sony is apparently fast-tracking this process. as reported by japanese publication gamewatch, production of "most of the ps4 slim (cuh-2000 series) and all ps4 pro (cuh-7000 series) models" has been discontinued in japan. the only model that will still be produced is the standard ps4 jet black 500gb slim model. this can be seen from the japanese playstation website where only the ps4 slim can be seen under the "main unit lineup", even if both slim and pro models show up on the ps4 page (however, i could not get the link to the "main unit lineup" to work myself).

the gamewatch report notes that this discontinuation will allow the company to focus on the production of ps5 units which experienced shortages. this discontinuation news apparently applies only to japan for now, with no news regarding whether western markets will follow suit.
