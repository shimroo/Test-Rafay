salt 
    spring island in british columbia is the jewel of the southern gulf islands. it is nestled up against the east side 
    of vancouver island. take a look at the maps of salt spring 
    island to see where it is located. salt spring island is about half way between nanaimo and victoria, the capital 
    city of bc. the city of vancouver on the mainland of bc is to the north. 


there 
    are over ten thousand human residents on salt spring island, several thousand sheep and a sizeable deer population. from time to time, a bear 
     is spotted, usually on the south end of the island, and there are also occasional reports of a cougar 
     being seen, sometimes even close to ganges. it is believed that bears and cougars swim across sansum narrows from vancouver island. 
    leave them alone and they will leave you alone, but don't attract them by 
    leaving food or garbage out for them to find! there is far less chance of 
    spotting them on salt spring island than most other places in bc, but keep 
    an eye on children. don't trip over the deer, though!
nearby galiano island almost as long, but has less area and is sparsely populated
    with only about a thousand permanent residents. galiano, mayne and pender islands
    (north & south) are closer to vancouver and the mainland than salt spring island.
    prevost island is located between salt spring and active pass, which separates galiano
    and mayne islands. there are also scores of smaller islands throughout the southern gulf 
    islands. to the south of bc's gulf islands are the san juan islands in washington state.
    they are very similar to the southern gulf islands.

vancouver 
    island is bigger than some countries. it lies off the west coast of british columbia
    and stretches for some 450 km or so along the coast  about a third the length of the
    entire province. victoria, the capital of bc, is at the southern tip of vancouver island.
    duncan, nanaimo, courtenay and campbell river, all along the eastern side of vancouver
    island, are the only other sizeable communities on vancouver island except for port
    alberni off to the west of nanaimo. ucluelet, tofino and long beach are "must visit"
    places on the west side of vancouver island. bring your surfboard and your wet suit!
salt spring island has long been known as a very special place in bc. for the population,
    there are a very large number of artists, sculptors and musicians living here. the
    community got together and raised funds to build art spring, a brand new community hall.
    many well known musicians, both local and from afar, have performed here 
    already. even the pubs have a pretty good showing of local talent performing there.
regularly scheduled bus service 
    commenced on salt spring island on january 7 2008.
for your stay on salt spring island, give cusheon lake  resort a call.
    it's a very special place, right on the shore of cusheon lake, about half way between
    ganges and fulford harbour.
