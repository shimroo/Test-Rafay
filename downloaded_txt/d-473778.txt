hacking linux exposed
















 






secure your linux network by thinking like an attacker.

in hacking linux exposed, second edition we are able to cover linux hacking in more detail than ever before. we are able to show you where linux may differ from other unix-like systems and give you linux-specific countermeasures that you can implement immediately. in the hard-hitting style of hacking exposed, hacking linux exposed, second edition once again dives into the actual attacks used by the enemy. look no further for the actual exploitation techniques used to surreptitiously gain access to linux systems.





hacking linux exposed, second edition covers the myriad ways a malicious hacker will attack your linux system, and the rationale behind such behaviour. while the bad guys are well versed in such techniques, this book serves to educate the home user as well as the overworked and underpaid system administrator who is not only responsible for the operation of mission-critical linux servers, but who must vigilantly secure them on a daily basis.
