every being or
situation
around us is a reflection of some piece of us, from either this life or another.


attracting or
maintaining
a good love life is process, not product. we have to keep trying.


we have a
tremendous
amount of free will choice in life and we can change the future.


i’ve seen lines
in my own hand change in 24 hours.


no one has
the power
to make us happy or miserable. we respond the way we choose to respond.


we should take
our spiritual
work seriously, but not take ourselves seriously.
