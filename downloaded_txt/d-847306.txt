a course in wood turning - online reprint
wood turning has had a definite place in
                  the commercial world for a great many years. it is
                  used in various forms in making furniture and
                  furniture parts, building trim, tool parts, toys,
                  athletic paraphernalia and many other useful and
                  beautiful articles in common use.
this book was written in 1919 as a
                  school text book to be used in shop classes, great way
                  to learn the basics.











 carpentry

                    for boys by j.s. zerme, m.e. - online reprint
a 1914 book which treats, in a most
                practical and fascinating manner all subjects pertaining
                to the "king of trades"; showing the care and use of
                tools; drawing; designing; and the laying out of work.
                the principles involved in the building of various kinds
                of structures, and the rudiments of architecture. it
                contains over two hundred and fifty illustrations made
                especially for this work, and includes also a complete
                glossary of the technical terms used in the art. the
                most comprehensive volume on this subject ever published
                for boys.
                note: by "boys" he refers to apprentices. 











the steel square and its uses - online reprint
there is nothing of more importance to a
                  young man who is learning the business of
                  house-joinery and carpentry, than that he should make
                  himself thoroughly conversant with the capabilities of
                  the tools he employs. it may be that, in some of the
                  rules shown in this work, the result could be attained
                  much readier with other aids than the square; but the
                  progressive mechanic will not rest satisfied with one
                  method of performing operations when others are within
                  his reach.
