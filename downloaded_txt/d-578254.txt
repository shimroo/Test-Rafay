the motor industry association of new zealand (inc) represents vehicle manufacturers, often referred to as oem’s (original equipment manufacturer’s) operating in new zealand through their local official distribution companies (i.e. distributors).  the new vehicle distributors import light and heavy vehicles, on-road and off-road motorcycles, atvs and rovs (quads and side by sides).
member companies of the mia have been approved by waka kotahi (new zealand transport agency) to undertake entry certification of the vehicles they import and distribute.
the mia is the voice of the new motor vehicle industry, set up to provide a unified point of view and drive progress on issues that concern the sector, with current priorities being low emission (electric and fuel cell) vehicles, vehicle safety, emissions, fuel economy, consumer standards and codes of practice.
