the hindu kush himalaya mountain range spans eight countries and stretches 3,500km across asia. it is
                    vital for the food, water and power security of up to two billion people and is a habitat for
                    countless irreplaceable species. it is also acutely fragile—and absolutely frontline to the impacts
                    of the triple planetary crisis. the international centre for integrated mountain development, a
                    regional intergovernmental organization established in 1983, is working to make this critical region
                    greener, more inclusive and climate resilient.
