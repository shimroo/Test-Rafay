key tag service 


since 1946, the key tag service has been protecting your keys and supporting our essential programs for amputees.
how do key tags work?

 attach a confidentially coded war amps key tag to your key ring. it is registered only to your name and address. 
 if you lose your keys, the finder can call the toll-free number on the back of the tag or drop them in any mailbox in canada.
 the war amps will return your keys to you by courier, free of charge. 

to date, the war amps has returned more than 1.5 million sets of lost keys to their owners. with the high replacement cost of keys and remote devices, this service is more important than ever!

your support makes a difference
your support ensures amputees have the artificial limbs and resources they need for everyday activities and learning to live with an amputation. the peer connections they form through the child amputee (champ) program foster a positive mindset and are an invaluable source of emotional support for the whole family. you also provide all amputees with a strong organization that advocates for their needs.






                “michaela has everyday legs that she wears to school and for playing sports, as well as water legs to keep her safe on wet, slippery surfaces. her artificial limbs are costly and need to be replaced often as she grows. without war amps donors, we wouldn’t be able to provide her with the limbs she needs for daily life. we would like to say thank you to everyone who donates to the war amps, because without you, michaela wouldn’t be able to live the life she does today.”
                michael and lyndsay, champ michaela’s parents













our role in the national council of veteran associations in canada (ncva) 
since 1918, the war amps has fought to protect the rights of amputee veterans and address the difficulties they face. today, we continue to use nearly 100 years of expertise to assist modern-day war amputees, as well as traditional amputee
                veterans, and to champion their rights.

for many years, the war amps has worked in close collaboration with ncva to ensure the position and concerns of seriously disabled veterans and more particularly veteran amputees are identified and recognized in the ncva legislative agenda
                for submission to the government/veterans affairs canada/department of national defence.
