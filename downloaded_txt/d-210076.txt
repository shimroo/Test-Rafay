welcome!

on behalf of the ohio prosecuting attorneys association let  me welcome you to our website.â  here you  will find information about the role of prosecuting attorneys and our  association. 

                        the prosecutor’s role in the  criminal justice system is often misunderstood.â   ohio’s  88 elected county prosecutors are committed to justice.â  the prosecutors i know aren’t motivated by  “winning” or trying to send everyone to prison for as long as possible. they  are motivated by their responsibility to enforce the law, to make their  communities safe and to fairly administer justice. and fairness and justice is  what matters most of all.â  prosecutors  live this every day.

                        part of our role is to have a  voice in public policy debates affecting the criminal justice system. to that  end, ohio’s  prosecutors serve an important function reviewing and advocating for  legislation with one goal in mind â the safety and security of our communities. 

                        ohio’s prosecutors are active in community  and civic affairs.â  from speaking to  school children about the dangers of drugs to serving on numerous committees  and commissions, ohio’s  elected prosecutors and their assistants serve in vital roles.

                        as legal counsel to a variety of  county elected officials, offices and agencies your county prosecutor assists  in ensuring efficient and responsible county government.â  

                        i’m proud to be a prosecutor and  honored to serve as president of the ohio prosecuting attorneys  association.â  please take your time and  look around.â  hopefully you will find  information here that is educational and informative about your county  prosecutor.â

 top  6 scams to watch out for in 2024 and beyond!

this  article is not exactly as the author has written; some parts have been left out  or paraphrased.

                            1. check  "cooking” scam
                            in  2023, there was a surge of thieves stealing checks from postal boxes, mailboxes,  and mail carriers, and then  washing the checks with chemicals, leaving only the signature. the thief would  then change the payee and amount of the check allowing them to cash the check,  usually for thousands of dollars.
now in  2024, the thieves have discovered an easier way to steal. in check cooking,  thieves take a digital picture of a stolen check and then use commercially  available software to alter it. if you still choose to write paper checks, use  the following cautions:
â¢ drop  it off at the post office, instead of a mailbox.
â¢ continually  monitor your bank account and immediately report suspicious transactions.

2.  voiceprint scams
this is  where ai technology is used. thieves capture a recording of your voice and use  a software program to generate an imitation “deepfake” version that can be used  to impersonate you. they call your bank and request money be sent elsewhere. to  prevent this from happening, aarp recommends you:
â¢ don’t  answer the phone, unless you know the person calling you, and even then make  sure you know who you are talking to.

3. delayed-action  sweepstakes scam 
sweepstakes scams have been around for a long time. in the past, scammers ask  victims to send money
for  taxes before the award can be delivered. now,
the  scammers are asking for banking information and social security number,  explaining they will file with the irs for you. surprise, you’re now a victim  of identity theft. scammers will start making small deductions from your bank  accounts to see if you notice, then move to larger deductions. they also use  your information to obtain credit cards and lines of credit in your name that  can give them a bigger pay day down the road. if you get one of these calls,  remember:
â¢ if it  seems too good to be true, it probably is!
â¢ if  you get a call from someone claiming that you’ve won a huge prize, the safest  bet is to just hang up. and never, ever provide any personal information.
â 
4. virtual  celebrity scam  
fans  have become accustomed to constant virtual intimacy with celebrities through  social media. if you’re on facebook or instagram, and someone pretending to be  celine dion or her manager reaches out to you, it is
                          
                          more  than likely an imposter. for example, if it’s a fake manager, they may say that  celine loves your comments and would love to talk to you. here’s her private  account, but after you connect to it, the talk gradually turns to how her  fortune is tied up and she could use a $50,000 loan from you. if you get a  direct message from someone claiming to be a famous performer or superstar  athlete, or someone representing them, be very, very skeptical. it’s almost  certain to be a scam!                           
5. multi-stage  grandparent scam
  this  well know scam is still around, but more sophisticated. scammers set up call  centers with young people posing as grandchildren who have been jailed after a  car accident. they are paid for every grandparent they connect with and give a  case number to, instructing the grandparent to provide that number to the  defense attorney or local prosecutor when they talk to them. when the  grandparent calls back, the scammers say, “oh, do you have the case number?” it  is a psychological trick to see whether the grandparent is compliant and will  follow instructions to send thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.

6. paris  olympics scams
criminals  try to find ways to exploit big events that are in the news. with the paris  games coming up this summer, more than likely we will begin to see the revival  of the fake emergency scam, which bears similarities to the grandparent scam.  it could work something like this: a scammer hacks someone’s email account, and  shortly after, all of that person’s contacts will receive the same  messageâsomething to the effect of, “hey guys, i’m over in paris and my wallet  was stolen! can anyone please help me out by sending gift cards or a venmo  deposit?”â  olympic officials are also  warning ticket seekers to avoid bogus ticketing sites and scam emails  purporting to be from paris2024.org (the official website for the games) or the  olympic committee.
