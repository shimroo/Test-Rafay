independent medical exams (ime)



independent medical evaluations (imes) are essential in claims management, yet they are often overlooked as an early intervention strategy. to ensure transparency and support timely, cost-effective resolution, it is crucial to partner with an ime provider offering broad geographic coverage, a diverse range of medical specialists, and stringent quality standards.








peer reviews



peer reviews are especially useful when the relationship between injury and treatment is unclear, or in auto claims where services may be costly and policy limits are of concern for the individual. we conduct comprehensive reviews of treatment records, interview the injured party, and engage in phone consultations with all treating providers.








functional capacity exams (fce)



functional capacity evaluations (fces) assess whether an injured employee is fit for work, the level of work they can safely perform, and whether workplace modifications are necessary. they help prevent further injuries, resolve disputes regarding the injury’s severity, and provide detailed information about the injury’s impact.








independent review organization (iro)



given our nationwide coverage and jurisdictional knowledge, we're equipped to address the requirements of group health clients across the country.expert reviewers, drawn from across more than 150 specialties, review medical necessity, experimental or investigational treatments — as well as medical plan language and policy applications.
