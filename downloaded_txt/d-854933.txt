rosary kits for groups, retreats & summer camps
we have some great options for adults, youth and kids groups. cord rosaries with wood beads are usually best for groups due to the ease and speed of assembly; they are also among the strongest rosaries available.

customer testimonial
(one of the hundreds of happy notes we receive each year)
		received angelic crown chapletjust wanted to say a sincere thank you for this beautiful aid to prayer.  it meets my need exactly.  also, since i know a little about jewelry-making (and was too lazy to make this myself), i want to compliment the person who did the handwork on this chaplet.  someone was very very careful in their work, and this piece will plainly go through *many* years of use before it needs it's first repair.thank you again.  your handwork is already lending nourishment to my own daily ministry.linda-alma
