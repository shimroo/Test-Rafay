natural nutrition for healthy pets
burns has always believed in the positive impact a healthy diet can have on our beloved pets. since we were founded by veterinary surgeon john burns in 1993, we’ve only ever used a selection of real ingredients, like tasty chicken, brown rice and veggies, to create simple and wholesome recipes that pets love. over 30 years later, we’ve won numerous awards, sold over 3 billion bowls of wholesome pet food to date and helped generations of pets live the healthiest and happiest lives possible. together with assisi pet care, we still follow that same simple philosophy, to create healthy and wholesome recipes that pets love, and to put pets, people, and the planet at the heart of everything we do.
