	 dancing with the stars-finals
    


emmitt smith has done the unthinkable- he's brought back hammer pants! his freestyle routine to "you can't touch this," by the legendary mc hammer was more than just a performance, it was a statement. mario lopez's freestyle performance; couldn't touch emmitt's. i'll give mario props; his freestyle performance was stellar. but it was predictable. everyone expected him to do a breakdancing move in his routine, but no one expected emmitt to break out mc hammer-like moves, make hammer pants stylish or do the bump and the typewriter as his final performance.mario has dimples, but he hasn't made the impact on this competition that emmitt has. his football pro status has allowed him to show the football world that ballroom dancing is not a wimpy pastime. i think because of him, many football fans have fallen in love with ballroom dancing.

	 dancing with the stars-week 9
    


i didn't think joey lawrence had a chance of winning the competition. i knew emmitt smith and mario lopez would be in the finals. my motto is "emmitt to win it."it's interesting to see the dancers' unaired confessionals on the dancing with the star's web site. check it out: http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/

	 dancing with the stars-week 9
    


i missed last night's episode because i was working. hey, it was election night! where else would a journalist be but at her newspaper? i did record the episode, and look forward to watching it tonight before the results show.but i did take a sneak peek at the dancing with the stars web site today. judging from the activity on the message board, the heat is definitely on.

monique coleman's out. i'm not surprised. however, i am in awe that mario lopez was in the bottom two. i would hope that the audience would vote not just on one week's performance and consider a couple's performance during the overall competition.

i've predicted it before and i'll remind you once again: emmitt will win it. he moves like a graceful lion.on another note, there's something creepy about joey lawrence's dancing technique. i can't put my finger on it, but there's something about his facial expression that doesn't sit well with me.after jerry got booted off last week, i was too devastated to write about it. i got to see a softer side of jerry during this competition. go figure!this week, my vote goes to emmitt.
