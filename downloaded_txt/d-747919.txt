a message from jefferson county clerk bobbie holsclaw

as your jefferson county clerk, it is my mission to provide every citizen with vip service by bringing value, integrity, and stellar performance to every interaction or business transaction we conduct. from our day-to-day work renewing vehicle registrations to providing free, fair, and secure voting on election day and everything in between, our valuable team members show that the vital services their local government provides can be done efficiently, conveniently, and with a positive approach.
historically, the county clerk serves as the âkeeper of the record.â we have records of every marriage, every deed, and every mortgage in jefferson county going back to the 1700s. the office of county clerk remains true to its original purpose, but also provides many more services to the community than ever before. as part of keeping accurate records, we work to modernize our systems, and continue to make more and more public records accessible over the internet. the office is also looking out for you and fighting against deed and mortgage fraud attempts through clerkalertâa free online notification system that notifies property owners about records filed in their name or business name.
the county clerk's office also manages records related to motor vehicles, like titles and registrations. that effort too has been modernized, and now, customers don't even have to visit a branch in person to renew their registration tags. while customers preferring a personal interaction can visit one of our 8 branch locations around jefferson county, they can also skip the line and renew by mail, phone, online, or using one of our drop boxes!
the record of democracyâvotingâis also handled by the clerk's office. that too is easier than ever following new bipartisan legislation that updated kentucky's voting laws. now, there are several ways you can make your voice heard: through mail-in or in-person absentee balloting, or by heading to the polls on election day. holding fair, free, and secure elections is my responsibility, and one i take very seriously. we work hard to keep voting free from error and to ensure every vote counts.
here at the jefferson county clerk's office, we strive to provide the community with vital services, all with a smile. if you have any concerns, questions, or feedback, please do not hesitate to fill out a comment card or give us a call. i believe that goals do not get accomplished singlehandedly; by working together and collaborating with others, we are able to give every citizen our signature vip service!
