official tourism site  town and county of plymouth








see and experience all that plymouth county has to offer
plymouth county offers cranberry farms, beautiful nature walks and more. within the county is plymouth, ma, the home of plymouth rock, a universal symbol of america. it is where the mayflower came ashore 400 years ago, bringing with it english pilgrims who helped found the nation. the town and county of plymouth boasts some of the best whale watching, dining, shopping, and cultural activities in a quaint new england setting, much of it nestled along the seashore. it is a history lover‚Äôs paradise, a family friendly atmosphere, and easy walking as you take in breathtaking sunrises.



















talk to the rock
plymouth rock is known the world over as the rock the mayflower pilgrims stepped on in 1620 to disembark from their shallop onto land. historians have argued since it was reported, in 1741, whether this is fact or fiction. plymouth historian jim baker says it could be true. between the weather and the ice cold water, it may have saved the pilgrims from wading to shore. regardless of whether it is a true story or not, plymouth rock has become a foundational american symbol of religious freedom and civil liberty. it is also a symbol of immigration, the american spirit, and survival.
