honea path invites 
				you...

to discover south carolinas' best 
				kept secret


~


honea path is fast becoming 
					one of the most sought after 

bedroom communities in south 
					carolina.

					~ ~ ~

					 

we pride ourselves 
					on our friendly town and the knowledge that, as secret's 
					go... we have one of the best bedroom communities in  
					all of south carolina. the merchants in our area 
					are united together to support each other and our 
					community.

our community 
					efforts are outstanding, as is the excellence of our 
					schools... the honea path merchants are focused on the promotion and support of small and 
					medium size businesses which are equally important to honea 
					path's prosperity and success.  please check out our
					
					business directory and review the diversity of over one 
					hundred and fifty local businesses within the honea path 
					community.

					honea path has 
					attracted numerous small businesses that supply an unusually 
					vast array of goods and services... such as restaurants, 
					shopping centers, antique stores, business services, 
					artisans, real estate, building and construction and so on. 
					economic diversity is one key to honea path's continued 
					growth and success.


					several small businesses have recently been attracted to 
					downtown honea path and there are plans to enact a major 
					renovation to the main street district and we 
					have many fine restaurants around town to satisfy your taste 
					buds.


honea path is 
					consciously retaining and improving that which is unique 
					to our heritage... so as not to become like so many other 
					"generic" suburban communities that have just sprouted up one 
					subdivision, one strip mall, and one fast food restaurant 
					after another.

the local merchants welcome 
					you to honea path
