john carpenter is the only real estate agent i will ever use. a genuinely great person and the best real estate agent in nwa. john is great at what he does and, after a short time searching, he found us exactly what we were looking for- a new subdivision, in a great school district, where we were able to build our first home. that would never have been possible without john. the support and knowledge he brings to your home buying experience is unmatched. he was with us 100% of the way - from the...

john came to us highly recommended and he did not disappoint. he is very knowledgeable. in addition to showing us many houses in person, he communicated with us constantly via email, text messages, phone calls. in other words, he was always there for us weekdays, weekends, evenings)! even after we purchased our house he still helps us with minor and major issues that come up in our new home.

john helped my wife and i find our beautiful home back in the fall of 2015. we were looking at a new construction home (something john specializes in), and he made the process so easy. he was so knowledgeable and helpful! he truly cares about his clients, and will make sure they are always taken care of!

john and lauren went above and beyond in helping me sell my house. they made the entire process smooth and effortless. i would recommend them to anyone, as they made the house selling experience actually fun!

tomorrow will be two weeks since we closed on our home! the first week was just nonstop rain and this week has been record highs for this time of year! there are so many people that we want to thank for being there for us over the last year, but i want to specifically thank one of my best friends for being the very best realtor we could have asked for. it has not been easy since we started looking at houses a year ago and then sold our home last august. we had another house lined up in hindsvill...
