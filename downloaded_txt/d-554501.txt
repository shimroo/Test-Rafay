peacemealpeacemeals were instituted at trinity in the early 90's especially for those in our community with hiv. back then, hiv was  a very scary thing, and those with hiv were often ostracized. many of  our guests were in need of comfort, support and a good time. flash forward 30 years and the needs have changed. peacemeal now focuses on those who might be experiencing a sense of isolation: the  elderly, homeless adults and youths, or anyone who would benefit from  sharing a meal with others in a safe and non-judgmental space. and you  don't have to be experiencing problems to to join in the festivities.  all are welcome!trinity and our sister church st. phillips new hope on the first sunday of the month. we provide not only a meal but also loving, non-judgmental fellowship.

music
 







music
 




























rejoice in the lord, o you righteous;it is good for the just to sing praises.  sing to him a new song. psalm 33the musical world has been greatly affected by covid-19, especially the act of singing. recent guidelines have recommended singers be distanced by at least 27 feet. therefore this makes congregational singing and choirs virtually impossible. singing has been such a vital part of our worship lives as we lift our voices singing praises. for the time being, we have assembled small groups in the church to record anthems and hymns for use in our services. with new technology, we produced our first virtual choir recording for the 20th anniversary celebration of the re-dedication of trinity church in october. we will continue to use music in our worship in a safe and responsible way. the day will come when all can lift their voices in song to worship the almighty and it will be a glorious day.
