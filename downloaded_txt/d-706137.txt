welcome
our vision at mental health providers of western queens is to be an active resource in our community. this is a considerable challenge in western queens where forty nine percent of the population are immigrants from many countries, interspersed with residents from earlier migrations. this gives reverse meaning to the term “global village” in the sense that little parts of the world have assembled in our community. the norms of this “new village” are still unformed and local social service providers, mental health systems, and the school system are called on to help. at mental health providers we work to be a resource in this “new village”, where many ethnic groups have assembled often bringing with them trauma and loss.
many of our professional staff are drawn or developed from this same immigrant population. thus, cumulatively we have mental health professionals who speak nine languages. they help to bridge the gap between “there” and “here”. they extend the “village” and help clients feel more at home and receptive to services.
