what is libertarianism?
as a part of a new political philosophy, the roots of libertarianism can be traced back throughout the whole history and ideology, when it was just a mere idea of a political philosophy. today, it has received its full form as he accepted political philosophy and movement. it is based on an idea of the role the government has in a free society. basically, it means that each individual should be given some sort of freedom in order to direct their own lives. the world we live in today seems to be against it because it is too complex for the individual to do so. the concept of a free person has become obsolete. libertarianism is here to challenge this and show the other side of the coin. this is a way how people can say no to the attempt of the government to reshape the citizens.
