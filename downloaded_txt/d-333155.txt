hudson valley ruins by tom rinaldi & rob yasinsac





hudson valley ruins
hudson
valley ruins provides a record of
historic and distinctive architecture threatened by 
 development,
vandals,
and time and exposure to the elements. 
      

 we hope this website will be a
catalyst
for efforts to save the neglected historic structures of the 
 hudson
valley
region of new york state. through education and public-awareness, 
 the
buildings
contained herein may yet see another day.
      

       if we can't save the
mansions,
churches, factories, and mills, then at least we have preserved them on
film. 
 along the way you will also find examples of buildings
that have been restored. 
      
let tom rinaldi or rob yasinsac be
      your guide.

here amid the beautiful foolishness of things"
