the psychology of hazing




    learn more
  












 


our mission is to provide methods of prevention and intervention in hazing; to explain the psychology of hazing in high school, college, the military, and the workplace.

  

what is hazing?hazing is often about group dynamics, power and proving one’s worthiness. hazing is often part of initiation rituals, however hazing may continue after the formal initiation period. groups sometimes use hazing to mark special occasions, such as birthdays. in general, hazing is integrated into the culture of the group.



where does hazing occur?hazing occurs in middle school and high schools, as well as in colleges, the military and on the job. it occurs all over the united states and throughout the world. hazing occurs in locations that are poorly supervised, or completely unsupervised by authorities.



who is involved in hazing? all kinds of people are hazed, and all kinds of people haze others. hazing is not a function of race, or socioeconomic class. hazing occurs among people of all educational levels.

 

when does hazing happen?hazing occurs throughout the year, though there is often an increase at the beginning of the fall and spring semester and at the beginning of all athletic seasons.



why do people haze?there are many complex psychological reasons, however most people who have been hazed believe they have a right and duty to do unto others what was done to them. check out “the blueprint of hazing” to understand why hazing has continued since ancient times.

female deaths
more female students are dying due to hazing. victims are not only dying on the couches of fraternity houses. students of all ethnicity are dying due to negligence-physical pain and psychological suffering. young women, asian, afro-american and others are dead due to the hazing traditions in their sororities.



 











legal loopholes
greek organizations are renaming hazing rituals and elongating the hazing process, in order to skirt the legal definitions used by colleges and states. for example, they will initiate new members in a shorter period of time, but continue to haze them even after they have been identified as “full members.” in this way, the groups claim that the rituals were not hazing, and/or not illegal according to the letter of the law.



 











sexualized hazing
hazing continues to incorporate sexualized events. from a psychological perspective, using sexualized hazing is the quickest method of humiliating a student. it immediately demonstrates the hierarchy and makes the victim feel completely helpless.

hazing is a dangerous, but deeply-embedded part of fraternity life. following the tragic hazing deaths of students like penn state's tim piazza, states are finally beginning to change their laws against it. communities and college campuses across the country are now questioning how and why hazing still exists, especially when its damaging implications span well beyond the frat house.
