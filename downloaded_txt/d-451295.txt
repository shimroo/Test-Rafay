we have switched from sonny's conveyor and x458 over to motor city and log chain.  you could literally build an x458 sonny's conveyor with all of the spare parts we have.  amounts of parts listed below.  i would prefer to sell all of these items together so that we can ship in one single crate.  estimated costs of everything (including about 80% of original chain/roller cost based on 250k car count life) is around $16,000. if you have a sonnys conveyor, you won't find a better deal.  all of this stuff is brand new (excluding used chain and rollers).  pictures include the major pieces (it only allows 10 pictures to the post).  if you need pictures of those, i can find a way to send them.  any questions, ask away.90ft of x458 chain and rollers (approx 40,000 car washed on this).heco (sonnys part #10009010) and charlynn motor, plus plate, sungear, hose assembly and bolt kitone trap door entrance assembly (small metal roller wheel and plates)entrance strap plate (1)entrance door rubber hinge (1)entrance rubber pad noise reducer (1)fork kick plate with taper locks (2)2in roller up caps (7)roller up cylinder bracket (1)roller up air cylinder (6)entrance drum bearings timken (4)entrance carriage (1)roller up forks (3)entrance slide tubes (pair)entrance slide shafts (pair)air take up manifold (1)1.5in and 1.25in collars for multiple areas (a bunch)fork hangers with bearings attached (4)extra fork bearings (6)entrance air shock tensioners (5)air roller up fork pivot arm (1)entrance drum for x458 chain (1)conveyor entrance angle weldable (pair)brand new x458 10ft section (4)brand new x458 rollers (4)sprocket for x458 chain (2) with taper locks (5)
