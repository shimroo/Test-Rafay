weather: all weather decisions are at the discretion of the ncsc council. decisions regarding game and practice cancellations are made based upon field conditions (not actual weather) with consideration to the safety of the players involved. if lightning is visible or thunder is audible from the practice/playing field, all activities are to be stopped and players and spectators are to leave the field until 30 minutes following the last visible lightning strike or audible thunder.

league information:
the in-house recreation league is designed to allow players to increase their soccer skills while learning to play the game. all players will play approximately eight games in the season. this allows for the fun of the game while participating in a little competition as well. practices begin in the end of march and the first games will begin in april.
team and coach requests
we are not able to accept requests for players to be assigned to specific coaches or to play with specific players. we understand that getting kids to practice and games can be challenging. during registration, we allow parents to specify which practice nights work within their schedule. we do honor coaches team requests (coaches and assistant coaches who request to work together). 
practice days
each team will practice once per week. please complete the registration form carefully. teams are assigned based on practice availability and cannot be changed once they are made.
coaching
new to coaching? not sure if you have what it takes? we are always looking for coaches and are willing to train and mentor new coaches. we encourage parents who are interested in coaching to volunteer. if you have volunteered and want some guidance and assistance, please let us know and we will connect you with a coach mentor.  contact ncsccoachmentor@gmail.com for more information.
