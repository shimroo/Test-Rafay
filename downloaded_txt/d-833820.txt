nothing beats the musical style and sound of a variety big band!
consider  shades of blue for your wedding reception, private or corporate function, dance, concert, or other special event.
***********************************************************
you're excited about your special event -- maybe your special day to be remembered for a lifetime.  you've imagined what it will be like and you've begun the tedious and sometimes hard work of planning for a flawless event.  there are many pieces that must come together as you prepare for a special and unique experience for your guests or audience.
when it comes to entertainment, the cd spinning of a dj or a looping songlist on an ipod just won't do.  an essential ingredient of outstanding events will be missing -- the shear energy and dynamic value of live music.  but don't settle for just any live music.  a genre band means you're likely to make some people happy and most people not.  and small ensembles often sound the same regardless of the song era being played.
consider a big band!  nothing beats the musical style and sound of a variety big band!  perhaps that's why big bands have been on the american music scene for over seventy years.  expect unparalleled musical entertainment of various styles from various eras, great ensemble sounds, live energy, and wow!-power. make your event a party people will remember!
and no big band delivers this any better than the shades of blue orchestra.  excellent music, great dance-ability, outstanding vocals, and stylish!  with shades of blue, no one goes away saying they did not hear something they liked.  and that makes for a successful, memorable event.
featuring the outstanding vocal stylings of tony liberto and the liberto sisters,  shades of blue is that very special ingredient that will make your next event an audience favorite!
