kato fastening systems
the original inventor and manufacturer of the bi-directional tangless® screw thread insert.








kato tangless® inserts
tangless coilthread inserts are a helically-coiled, bi-directional, wire design; that install using a drive notch located at either end of the coil insert instead of a tang located at one end of the inserts. after installing a tanged inserts you have to go back and break off the tang, this process is eliminated with tangless inserts. in blind hole applications the tang must be retrieved, this process is also eliminated with tangless inserts.
