delaware is with her 
posted: nov. 8, 2016
hillary clinton carried delaware, as the democrats swept 
					all of the statewide races on election day. upstate was with 
					her, but downstate was not. typical delaware -- new castle 
					county goes blue, while kent county and sussex county go 
					red.

four things 
posted: nov. 3, 2016
there are four things to know about the election in 
					delaware. four offices on the statewide ballot. four 
					governors in a row for the democrats if they elect john 
					carney. four ex-lieutenant governors on track to make 
					history. four key races for the state senate.

political tricks and treats  
posted: oct. 31, 2016
the thing about halloween and elections is they are both 
					good for an october surprise. certainly the presidential 
					race has proven it, but the delaware campaign season? not so 
					much. this has not always been the situation, though.

glass ceiling politics 
posted: oct. 27, 2016
over the last 60 years, there have only been 10 women who 
					have made it into statewide office in delaware, but the time 
					looks right for two more to get there on election day. not 
					to mention the prospects for a woman to collect the state's 
					three electoral votes.

judge robinson is going, but is anyone coming? 
posted: oct. 25, 2016; updated: oct. 26, 2016 
the slowdown in the u.s. senate over judicial 
					confirmations could be hitting home here in delaware 
					shortly, because the federal district court is going to need 
					someone to replace sue robinson, who has been a judge there 
					for 25 years.

binge-watching the debates  
posted: oct. 20, 2016
never have such contrasting words been spoken, as the 
					candidates here in delaware for governor and congressperson 
					debated during the same evening as the presidential 
					candidates did. it was a back-to-back-to-back debate 
					marathon.

jefferson-jackson and three weeks to go 
posted: oct. 18, 2016 
when an election year has been so sulfurous it seems like 
					the body politic could use an exorcism, who you gonna call? 
					at the annual jefferson-jackson gathering, the delaware 
					democrats turned to elijah cummings, the maryland 
					congressman, and garth brooks.
