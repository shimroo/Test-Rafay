we are hiway.








































welcome to hiway.



we are hiway pentecostal church [hiway] - a church located in the central core of barrie, ontario. we are a vibrant, multi-cultural community of people who are all on different walks of life. our goal? to do life together, and more importantly grow into the person christ has intended us to be. come as you are and never leave the same.

why come to church?because we care about you. we want to do life together, and build community. we want to celebrate the wins together, and be there to support each other when life hits hard. and ultimately, help you discover how much god loves and cares for you.








            what can i expect?
          









our sunday experience happens every sunday at 10am. it’s typically 60-75 minutes in length and includes a time of worship, prayer, and a message brought from our lead pastor or a guest speaker. our goal is to make you feel welcomed and help you connect with god and be a part of a community. 








            what about my kids?
          









we believe in having a strong emphasis on the next generation of the church. every sunday, we have a special program for kids jk-grade 5. another emphasis we believe in is the safety of our children. because of this, we have a process to check-in your child for our hiway kids program. you’ll want to get to church at 9:50am to get signed in before the program begins. 








            what we believe?
          









hiway is affiliated with pentecostal assemblies of canada [paoc]. find out more here.
