we stand behind our cedar log homes















at moosehead cedar log homes, we don’t take your decision to choose one of our log homes lightly. we understand that you are not just constructing another house—you’re investing in your future.



for most of our clients, this is a “forever” home, and we believe that such an investment deserves more than the 10- or 20-year warranty offered by many of our competitors.



that’s why we proudly offer a limited lifetime warranty, reflecting our commitment to stand behind the quality of our materials and craftsmanship for as long as you own your cedar log home. 



and don’t worry — there’s no need to sift through pages of fine print and legal jargon. our warranty is our written promise to you: simple and straightforward. it’s a single page that plainly details our commitment to stand behind each moosehead-produced wood component used in your home’s construction, from the cedar logs to the spruce timbers. any non-wood elements included in your package— roofing, windows, doors, and more—are supplied by trusted industry leaders, such as andersen and perma-chink, who independently offer their own generous product warranties. if you ever need to place a warranty claim with one of these partners, we can assist with the process. we are confident that moosehead’s quality cedar logs and building materials, along with your proper care and maintenance, are the foundation for a log home that will perform to the highest standards and provide you with peace of mind for a lifetime.
