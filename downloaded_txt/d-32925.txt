we created this site back in 1997 in memorium
                          of the great rapper / actor / poet / human being tupac
                          amaru shakur.
current giveaway competition:
currently, we don't offer a giveaway competition.
the last contest ended on september 14. five copies of the tupac songbook 'the tupac shakur
collection' have been given away. the correct answer to the question 'which instrument did 2pac play? would have been piano.
