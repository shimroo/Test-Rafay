description

after selecting a build.xml and clicking "run ant..." eclipse hangs.  by going 
to the task manager, you can see that ntvdm.exe is eating around 99% of the cpu 
cycles continuously.  to continue with "run ant", ntvdm.exe must be manually 
terminated.

more info:
then when a task is selected and run, sometimes an error message comes back, "a 
problem occurred executing the ant file.  reason: cannot use classic compiler, 
as it is not available  a common solution is to set the environmental variable 
java_home to your jdk directory".  this should not show up as java_home is set 
to a valid directory.

then when trying to close eclipse, an error message comes up, "problems 
occurred while trying to save the state of the workbench."  details: "problems 
occurred during save."

could you provide more information like build number, vm, machine, os, etc?

from the newsgroup:

after replacing ant 1.4.1 with ant 1.5 beta1 the problem was gone.
so this is really a problem of ant in combination with jdk 1.4.0 and 
windows xp.

but this leads to the question when ant 1.5 will be integrated into 
eclipse? ;-)

ullrich.

doesn't seem like we can do much about this.
re-visit once ant 1.5 is no longer in beta.

reopening for investigation now that ant 1.5 is released.

micah, would you be able to check the next integration build (oct 29th) now 
that eclipse has been upgraded to ant 1.5.1?

please verify that the problem was the combination of 1.4.1 and a 1.4.0 vm.

verified that there is no problem running ant 1.5.1 with jdk1.4.0 on xp.  can't actually duplicate the problem on ant 1.4.1 because of bug 26061.
