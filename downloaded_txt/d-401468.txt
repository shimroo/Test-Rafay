welcome to the website of the roman catholic
diocese of palm beach!










february 14, 2025




                    bishop's column
                    



bymost reverend gerald m. barbarito


one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all
at this time, we offer our prayers for our migrant brothers and sisters who may be experiencing fear and isolation. we offer our prayers for our nation in regard to true immigration reform. we offer prayers for our president and leaders within this nation to implement such reform. we offer prayers for unjust nations from which people are fleeing due to situations which are in need of reform. prayer is always our greatest resource, and it is continually god’s grace that makes a difference.



whether you are searching for information about the diocese, parishes, and schools or about the roman catholic church in general, i hope that our diocesan website will be of help to you.
the diocese of palm beach is comprised of five counties in southeastern florida: palm beach, martin, st. lucie, indian river, and okeechobee. from sebastian to boca raton and from palm beach to pahokee, the 241,100 catholics of the diocese of palm beach span the economic and cultural spectrum of the area and contribute to a vibrant faith experience in our 50 parishes, 3 missions, and 1 hispanic pastoral center.  
whether you are a full-time resident, a part-time winter resident, or a tourist visiting our area, i pray that you will enjoy your time in the diocese of palm beach, and as you tour our website.
may mary, our lady queen of the apostles, patroness of the diocese, guide us in the footsteps of her son, jesus christ.  
sincerely yours in christ,
most reverend gerald m. barbarito
