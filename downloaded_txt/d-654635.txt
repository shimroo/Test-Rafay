      the mountain meadows 
      association (mma) is a 
non-profit, volunteer organization that works to 
      identify, remember, and  honor those killed in the mountain meadows 
      massacre of 1857. our goal is to protect and preserve the graves of 
      the victims, and the surrounding mountain meadows area, and to remember those who 
      were killed in deference to the wishes of the descendant families.
       


 
                            in june 2011, the mountain meadows site was 
                            designated as a 
 national historic landmark









membership is open to 
                            everyone! our members are from both sides of the 
                            event, and have come together with forgiveness, 
                            fellowship, and understanding. 

                            we are the original mountain meadows massacre 
      organization; by far the largest, and longest established organization in 
      existence today. 







genealogy


we welcome descendants, historians, and 
      anyone with an interest in the history of the massacre and/or the 
      preservation of the mountain meadows site.
      
the majority of our membership is comprised of 
      descendants of the victims.
