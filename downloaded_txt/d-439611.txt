welcome to mose’s tartar sauce website, your ultimate source for the finest tartar sauce – made with tradition and quality in mind. developed with over 50 year experience.
we make a very unique tasting tartar sauce. no trans fats, no preservatives—only the finest ingredients possible.
our family uses this tartar sauce on fish, shrimp, scallops and frog legs. we use it as a dip for raw vegetables, potato chips, french fries, batterfried cheese curds, onion rings and mushrooms. it is good on baked potatoes, great as a sandwich spread and even as a condiment on pot roast, chicken, turkey and ham. it is so good that some of our customers eat it right out of the jar! our tartar sauce is not just for fish anymore!
