who we are
the beki community is known for its open heart and open mind–from community-prepared kiddush lunches on saturdays, to the specific welcome we offer to lgbtq+ jews and interfaith families. we believe that everyone belongs.









tikun olam - social action
work with us to repair what is broken in our world (tikun olam), as we continue our lifelong learning and the application of jewish values and principles in our lives.










ritual
beki combines an open, accepting environment with a traditional approach to worship and kashrut (keeping kosher).  beki members organize and lead most services and activities.









kids love beki...
…and the beki community loves kids! children and teens fill our engaging shabbat and holiday programs, our vibrant religious school, our fun-packed, active kadima and award-winning usy chapters.
