stiffies underwear





stiffies underwearas the name implies, stiffies underwear is a fitted boxer brief for blokes, with an internal side pockets (or "erection direction pockets") in which you place the penis.this gives the wearer greater comfort especially when playing sport, and disguises potentially embarrassing erections by keeping it tucked into the side pocket when aroused.inspirationstiffies came to andrew once day when he experienced immense discomfort during goodbye hug with an ex-girlfriend. he doesn't know whether the girl noticed but he was extremely embarrassed nonetheless.although he had been inventing since childhood it was the first time he had an idea for a clothing product: "it was one of those one-off moments," he says.he developed the stiffies concept and eventually found a manufacturer in china, who produced some 2500 units, which andrew has been selling at markets and through his website.how does it work?his invention of underwear for blokes is designed to disguise a potentially embarrassing erection. stiffies utilise a contoured pocket that is designed like "a push up bra for the penis", with left or right dressing options.the wearer simply directs his penis to the contoured pocket on the left or right when he puts on the underwear. thus, should an embarrassing erection materialise in the course of the day, the penis will be less noticeable, as it rises on the side rather than directly in front.andrew admits the underwear is not foolproof but works 60 to 70 per cent of the time.the stiffies underwear is made from standard underwear material - 92 per cent cotton and eight per cent spandex.further informationinterestingly enough, he's received some positive feedback from women who've admitted to the inventor that "bulgy male genitals is not a good look." he's also received encouraging responses from sportsmen who claim the pocket keeps them comfortable whilst at play.andrew acknowledges there are other concepts around for underwear designs with inner pockets, however the difference with stiffies is the inner pocket, which are "erection direction pockets", primarily designed to hide embarrassing erections. however, he makes a point of understating the erection direction concept when selling his underwear at the markets, claiming that aussie males are "scared by the whole thing and can't see the humour in it."he only reveals the full concept once customers show interest in the point of difference between his and other underwear products on the market.
