water conservation



water is an essential for life, and its availability should never be taken for granted, regardless of how abundant the supply. since long island has but one water source, its preservation and conservation is of the highest importance. we must protect and ensure our future generations are afforded the luxuries we have today. there are many ways to conserve water around your home, but what you do to reduce the usage of your irrigation system, the single largest consumer of water around the home, will have the most meaningful impact.

emerging contaminants



the roslyn water district has taken a proactive and aggressive stance in dealing with emerging contaminants such as 1,4-dioxane and pfoa(s). while we await for the state's final determination on their proposed maximum contaminant level at 1 part-per-billion and 10 parts-per-trillion, the district has already commenced the required pilot studies needed prior to treatment implementation. we are fortunate that all current water sample test results have come back with levels below the proposed new standards, we are dedicated to removing these contaminants from our drinking water which is why we are pursuing the construction of the necessary treatment systems.
