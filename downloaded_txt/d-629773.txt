horse head â€” a new web project about a gender-fluid-extra-dimensional alien’s visit to earth. horse head provides a surreal look at human evolution, fame, and the nature of love. weekly 60-second episodes happening now!



next to heaven â€”back in september of 2006, i launched next to heaven with this staccato mission statement, â€œi download movies from archive.org. i watch the movies. i write and record new audio. i re-cut the video to the new audio. every wednesday there will be a new movie.” and so it was for 52 straight weeks. in january 2011, i started releasing season 2, another 52-week effort.  during both seasons i learned a lot about storytelling, saw scores of amazing public domain films, and garnered a bit of love in the form of awards, film festival appearances, and favorable press.



hopper video launched in october of 2005, and was among the worldâ€™s first â€œvideoblogs.â€   unlike many videobloggers of the time, i rarely talked to a camera; most of the videos were mini-documentaries and visual oddities.  click above for the best of old hopper video, and new videos!
