testimonials






don’t just take our word, see what partners, parents, and clients have to say.

















“the odc has a very special place in my heart as i have seen many people do well because of odc. i would love to start with my daughter, rebecca, who benefitted from odc’s employment services for many years in bemidji, eventually leading her to a job at bemidji state university. ”






– dave & cindy peterson, international falls
















before i was a part of odc i had another job but unfortunately it had gone out of business. i would occasionally struggle to get along with new coworkers and make lasting work connections. i have worked for odc since 2011, i enjoy helping with powder coating. the schedule has been flexible and i get to work with a wide range of people. because of odc i have been able to make new friends and really enjoy going to work every day to see those friends and the odc staff!






- richard kast - bemidji
















odc supported me in my job. i learned the skills i needed to be independently employed. i know i can still call odc if i need anything.
