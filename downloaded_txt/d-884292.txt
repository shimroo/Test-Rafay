helping physicians drive positive outcomes and practice growth since 1993founded in 1993 by john c. anderson, amerx health care has been long-known for our top-rated amerigel® line of topical skin and wound care products.  over the years, we have continued to innovate, and now offer physicians a comprehensive suite of wound care products including helix3® bioactive collagen, amerx® wound care kits & dressings, and the extremit-ease® compression garment.
enjoy the quality and convenience of working with an established company that has delivered proven results for over 25 years.  our high-quality products address today’s skin and wound care challenges – providing healthcare facilities and private practice physicians the tools for success while helping patients live healthier lives.
start growing your practice today!
join the thousands of physicians who have chosen to dispense amerx health care products from their practice to increase patient compliance and satisfaction while increasing the practice’s bottom line.
today’s patients place a high value on convenience and face-to face time with their provider. increasing the number of patients seen each day only leads to unsatisfied patients and over worked staff. by expanding your practice’s offerings through in-office dispensing, you can improve patient compliance, increase per patient value (ppv) and spend more time with each patient.  contact us today and ask how the amerx team can support your dispensing program!
