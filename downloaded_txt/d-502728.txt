      please... have a good look around, there are many areas 
      to discover. i hope you find something of interest on my site and that you 
      get as much pleasure  discovering the items here as i did assembling them
over the years, i've enjoyed my travels around the 
      internet and this site contains some of the funnier and interesting stuff 
      i have found and  some of my own unique content.

      there are whole sections on photography, my motorcycles 
      (with hints and tips on restoration), pages of jokes and risqué cartoons, 
      pages for travellers and visitors to london, space related links... lots 
      to find and explore :)
over the next month or two i intend to add a lot more 
      content and re-vamp some of the sub pages with new and fun content... come 
      back often!
