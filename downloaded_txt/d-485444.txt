the start of something big!!!!!!!





hey folks, ever wonder about the glamorous lifestyle of an airline pilot.  i am here to tell you its not all its cracked up to be.  but its not all bad either.  my first blog and it is coming to you from wichita ks on a layover.  we got to the hotel tonight about 730pm and the van leaves tomorrow morning at 7am.  hows that for glamour.  a lot more to follow as i get up and running.  thanks for stopping by.  the gear jerker.
