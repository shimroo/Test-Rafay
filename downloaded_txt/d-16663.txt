as
    our name implies, how to have good sex, inc. is an organization dedicated to sex
      education, specifically sexual pleasure.
    it is our belief that "pleasure is a mixture of physical sensations and emotions:
    savoring a delicious meal, playing tennis, or taking a walk on a beautiful day. sensual
    and sexual pleasure result from an interaction between physical sensations and your
    thoughts, feelings, and attitudes. the particular combination of ingredients that evoke
    pleasure is uniquely "your own" (heiman & lopiccolo, 1988).
      experiencing sexual pleasure is the process of giving and/or receiving sensual and sexual pleasure.within this
      sex education site you can
      read thousands of sex tips for free. our sex tips,
      range from providing information on: how to last longer, which sexual positions
      are best for virgins, how to use sex toys, ways to increase your sexual pleasure,
      and ideas for internet dating.   in addition to answering your
      sex questions, we provide users with an
      online sex toys
      shop, free email accounts (yourname@
      howtohavegoodsex.com),
      live how to have good sex seminars and
      a weekly newsletter dedicated to sexual
      pleasuring techniques.
warning:  we do
      not pretend to be able to teach you how to have great sex. what we promise
      is to teach you how to have good sex.  with the right tips, trick and
      ideas anyone (that is willing to practice) can have good sex. great sex is
      a combination of technique, practice and chemistry.  ultimately, you
      will never learn how to have great sex just by surfing the web.  
      great sex, as any sexpert will tell you, requires a willingness to
      experiment, communication and of course, lots of practice!  it is
      unrealistic to think that the first time you ask a man (or woman) out on a
      date, participate in oral sex, or use sex toys that everything will go
      smoothly.  great sex is about learning how to relax enough to enjoy
      the moment. sometimes sex is funny, sad or erotic. as you read these tips,
      remember, great sex requires time, commitment and honesty. 
      ultimately it is only you who knows what feels good, thus, it is up to you
      to teach your partner about your likes and dislikes. lastly, having good
      sex requires you to not only respond to your own needs, but your partners
      needs as well.
if you have any desires to
      learn about specific sexual positions or other topics within the field of human sexuality education,
      please contact us at alex@howtohavegoodsex.com
      and we will do our best to meet your individualized needs.

				our philosophy sex is like dancing, it 
				changes every time. it depends on culture, atmosphere and mood. 
				sometimes it is done alone, with a partner or in a group. it can 
				be fast and hard or slow and soft. sex is a combination of 
				non-verbal negotiation and verbal cues: a scream, a twitch of 
				the toes, or a flush of the face. there is no one 'right' way to 
				move, only what feels good to all those involved. 
				     the purpose of this site is to share information. thus, if 
				you have any ideas, thoughts or information that you believe 
				others might benefit from, please e-mail your tip to
				
				alex@howtohavegoodsex.com and i  will be sure to include it 
				on either our weekly newsletter or here on the actual website.
