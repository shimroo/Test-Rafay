as a credit union member, you can expect to have a much more rewarding and meaningful experience. because credit unions are member-owned and not-for-profit, they are more attuned to the needs of their members and are not driven by investors or their bottom line. credit union members own a piece of the institution, and the revenue created through operations gets returned to members in the form of better rates, technology enhancements and more.  more about us   simple & convenient
