recording studios



gone are the days when the thought of recording in a huge and expensive recording studio was something unimaginable. many created studios underground, and the activity was more like amateurism. until one day, the representatives of the world of music decided to combine all the small recording studios into one big empire.

popular artists, our favorite songs. everyone and everyone has associations with one or another song. in the life of each of us there is at least one song tied with personal memories. but where and when were these songs recorded? who or what caused the birth of these songs? and most importantly: in what environment was the recording? today we will walk through the largest and most famous production centers and recording studios of all time.


we will start, perhaps, with one of the very first recordplant studios, which has not lost its relevance. gary kelgen and chris stone announce the opening of three studios, in new york, a year later in los angeles and in 1972 in california. it all started in 1968. the first recordplant recording studio in america is opened in new york city. the studio was doomed to success, because the first project was to record a new album, at that time, the famous jimi hendrix-a.


general



"electric ladyland" with its scandalously famous cover. later the studio is visited by the famous john lenon and paul mccartney. such growth in popularity could not leave everyone indifferent, because the studios, which opened after 1968, simply could not withstand the competition from recordplant. in 1978, the studio burned to the ground, with all the equipment in it, fortunately no one was injured. but by that time the studio had achieved great success, and the fire did not become an obstacle to the second opening of the studio, in the same place in 1980. then things went only up the hill. in 1987, the studio in new york city is successfully sold and closed, the same fate awaits the studio in california in 2008. in 1999, the studio reconstructs and improves one of its four studio rooms, which had no analogues, with a budget of 1.5 million dollars. in 1994 and 2000, recordplant deserved to be called the studio of the year by tec (technical excellence & creativity). today there is only a studio in los angeles. michael jackson, justin timberlake, beyonce, rihannaâ€¦ the list of famous songs and performers can go on for a very long time.






another "dream studio" is located at abbey road 3, london, united kingdom. abbey road studios received its name of the same name in november 1931, founded by gramophone company. abbey road studios became world famous in the 1960s, when the studio was equipped with the latest, at that time. like any doomed studio, abbey road studios visited the beatles in 1964, where they recorded their second album beatles for sale. the building where the studio is located was originally an apartment building with eight rooms. in 1931, sir edward elgar opened the studio for the first time with the participation of the london symphony orchestra. in 1958, abbey road studios was unofficially declared a "rock music center". the studio is visited by such rock performers as: cliff richard and the shadows, oasis, pink floyd, radiohead, duran duran, and the time machine (2007).
very interesting option was added to the official website of abbey road studios. now everyone can watch in real time the "zebra" on which the beatles went to shoot the cover of the legendary cd.


hansa tonstudio - sounds proud! originally, the studio is located in the heart of berlin (germany). among english musicians the studio was known as "hansa studio by the wall" because it was located near the berlin wall. founded in 1964 by brothers peter and thomas meisel, the studio did not stay near the berlin wall long. in 1972, hansa moved to its current location. the famous studio became famous after british musician and producer brian eno helped david bowie to record here a song called "heroes". here they recorded their singles depeche mode, iggy pop, and u2 with their famous album achtung baby.

at the end of the story about creating songs, thematic video from justin timberlake:





i would like to note: the studio is first of all an atmosphere of creativity. if you are an artist, the decision to come to the studio is not born at a certain scheduled time or under certain circumstances. if you are an artist, you know by hearsay that inspiration has no time frame, location, or shade of mood. if you are an artist, you know when you are ready. and the first thing you shouldn't have to ask yourself at these moments is a studio where nothing will distract you from your inspiration, but rather an opportunity to create.
