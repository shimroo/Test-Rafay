roasted oysters

print pdf of recipe here.recipe courtesy of scott phillips on get your grill onon the stove top, saute a couple of finely chopped shallots and three cloves of minced garlic in a two tablespoons of butter. cook until soft.shuck a dozen large oysters and place in a cast iron skillet or other grill-safe vessel. a layer of crumpled aluminum foil in the bottom of your skillet will keep the oysters from rattling around.cook on a hot grill until done. your cooking time will vary depending on how heavy your skillet is. in my cast iron skillet it took about 7-10 minutes. in a light weight, disposable aluminum roasting pan, maybe 5-6 minutes.when your oysters come off the grill, top each with a little of the sauteed shallot and garlic butter. squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the top and salt and pepper to taste. serve hot.a few words of caution may be in order. on the difficulty scale, both of these recipes get around a 1.25 out of 5. if you can read simple directions and are comfortable around hot grills, you will be fine. just be careful when shucking the oysters. the natural inclination is to hold the oyster in one hand and go at it with an oyster knife held in the other. this is a good way to jab said oyster knife into the meaty part of your hand. having done this once, i can’t recommend this technique.instead, place a folded towel on a cutting board and place the oyster on it, hinge side up. this way, you can support the oyster without too much risk of gouging your hand. insert the tip of the knife into the hinge. push the knife inward into the hinge and twist. the oyster should open right up.labels: get your grill on, roasted oysters
