 patriot names 1600-1776 
~ norse heritage & christian faith ~

  the early americans were the ultimate patriots! 
  my decades of research with scholars in over 40 languages (for the  
'best exotic baby names' book) revealed the unknown era of early america from 1600 to 1776. this specific group of people had fascinating names combined from words found in bible verses (their only book), like godleap and goforth, and, their traditional germanic/viking names, like robert and roger, (the anglo-saxon language is english from angland).
  the patriot names book contains passages from over 50 diaries (and narratives) that set the record straight about what really happened in the beginning! most people only know about the 1800s, and know nothing near truth about the astonishing lives of these christian vikings - whom forged the greatest country on earth! 

224 pages
  (8.5" x 5.5")
  6 color pages with maps!
65 engravings (>200 years old),
 names were hebrew or germanic:
    172 bible verses - source of hebrew names,
    ancestral nordic/germanic/english names.

'point of view' giant statue
chief guyasuta & george washington,
their historic meeting in pittsburgh, in 1770.

quote by chief guyasuta(about meeting washington in 1753):
  it was on that day, when the white mans blood, mixed with the streams of our forest, that i first beheld this chief [gw]: i called to my young men and said, mark yon tall and daring warrior? he is not of the red-coat tribe [british]--he hath an indians wisdom, and his warriors fight as we dohimself is alone exposed. quick, let your aim be certain, and he dies.
  our rifles were levelled, rifles which, but for him, knew not how to misstwas all in vain, a power mightier far than we, shielded him from harm. he can not die in battle.

2) hezekiah (porter), 1665, connecticut. his wife was named hannah and her father arrived on the ship [the] planter (in 1634) when he was 16 yrs old as a servant, as many desperate white children did back then; on board were twenty indentured servants under 16, four were only 12 years old.

 diary passage:
(contains passages from 50 diaries)
from the diary of lieutenant rudolph (bentinck) written in 1756:

  "... 1,500 french and indians sallied out upon us, with a horrid howling, like a wild beast"... they [the british] lined up in traditional military formation "to recieve the enemy, whom we could not yet see through the thickness of the underwood"... the british force opened fire at first sighting, seeming to repel them back into the woods "but instead of that, they [the indians] crept on all fours, till they had almost surrounded us, when all at once, we received a very hot fire, without seeing the enemy, and within a few minutes, all the officers and above half the men were killed or wounded,"

early americans gave guns to the noble indian 
for almost 200 years to hunt for furs, a profitable business for both.

  the indians were very spiritual, and superior warriors. the early americans bonded with them and became their students.

the motto of the first us military 'rangers', the first commandos, was:"to make indians of our white men."
