radiology floor, ucsf medical center: a review





i have been to this place several times now. so often did i go before my diagnosis, in fact, that i told one of the techs that they needed to get a punch card for frequent visitors. when you use every type of machine on the floor, you get a sandwich or a hat or something. he seemed to actually find that suggestion pretty funny, so either he has a pretty weak sense of humor, i was on drugs, or most patients are really, really not very funny. i had multiple visits to the ct scanner for guided biopsies, a full body pet/ct combo, two mris, several x-rays, and a testicular ultrasound.some thoughts about the radiology floor:once, i was marooned in the hallway while a machine was in use. this wasn't a problem, really. the transport guy let me know what was up and i didn't have to wait that long, but while i was there i was passed by at least three or four people, some doctors, some not, who didn't even look at me as they veered around my bed. not that everyone, everywhere in the hospital needs to be chatting me up, but i was bored and slightly annoyed so i started greeting everyone who passed who wasn't obviously doing something else, you know, to show them i was a human being, not just a bed in their hallway. all said a polite hello, sort of like they would to a talking bed robot programmed to randomly greet passers-by, and walked on.on the mri experience: sounds like going to a rock concert, only you find out after you're in that band was too high to go on, but it was the future so they had robot replacements, only the robot replacements were also too high but had no job security so they had to play anyway. earplugs a must.once, i asked the mri tech how the machine worked, because i was curious if the weird rhythmic sounds were only a byproduct of the machine working or if it was somehow related to the scanning directly, like it measured sound vibrations passing through the body or whatnot. dude either didn't really know or thought i was high because all he could tell me was it worked on water molecules with magnets. thanks. in his defense, that time i was *definitely* on drugs and the mri process is actually incomprehensible unless you are really, really up on your physics.one thing you will learn about radiology if you ever go there is that it is always cold. apparently this helps the machines work better, but seriously it is not warm. i would advise you to take the heated blankets they offer, but i won't, because when you get there and are lying on the machine, maybe in nothing but a flimsy backless hospital gown and pants (not backless), you will already be so cold you will not refuse.so, radiology. they seem good at their jobs, have heated blankets, and are generally pleasant, though you are more like a sample in a petri dish here than anywhere else i've been in the hospital. always bring a book when you go down, just in case. if you definitely don't want people to ask you about what you're reading, i recommend taking peter brown's biography of saint augustine, which is actually very good. if you do want people to ask, i have no clue.radiology: four spinning protons at thermodynamic equilibrium out of five.

stuff i do with my daughter: watch a movie





daughter #1 has just started watching the occasional movie. so far, she has watched the rescuers (1977) and the rescuers down under (1990). she has watched these two movies a combined total of five times, if i count correctly (three and two, respectively). i thought it would be interesting to interview her after a viewing, mostly because i'm curious how much of it she actually understood. the results are transcribed below.

so yesterday we watched a movie together. do you remember what that movie was called?
rescuers down under!

did you like it?
yeah.

did you like it a lot, or just a little?
a lot.

if you had to give the movie a number, where one was "i only liked it a little bit or i didn't like it," and 5 was "i liked it the most," what number would you give it?
six.

six?
i mean, ten.

you liked it that much. you've seen it before, but i only saw it that one time. i'm having a little trouble remembering the story. can you remind papa, because he's a little forgetful, what the story was about?
[holding out a paper half-covered with parallel lines] now, you can make the lines into something.

ok, i'll make the lines into something, and maybe while i do that you can tell me...
you can use green.

what was rescuers down under about?
i don't know.

did anything happen in it?
i didn't need this green. i needed *this*  green!

i remember there was something about a bird. was there a bird in the movie?
yeah.

who was the bird?
the bird was named baracuna. she was the bald eagle. she was penny's closest friend.
[en: there was a golden eagle named "marahute." she was befriended by cody, a young australian boy with the ability to talk to animals. penny was an orphan girl, the protagonist of the rescuers.]

was penny a boy or a girl?
no! i mean cody. cody was a boy.

was there anybody else who wanted the eagle?
the mean old witch.
[en: the poacher, mcleach, was trying to hunt the eagle.]

what did the mean old witch do?
trap the eagle.

trap the eagle? just the eagle?
no! even cody!

but did the witch get to keep the eagle?
no! bernard and bianca and one other mouse saved them.

how did they save them?
i don't know. by cutting all ... the trap ... and the old mean witch didn't know how to fix it.

were there any other birds besides the eagle?
mmm...  yes. remember this picture?

i love that picture.
we didn't finish that picture!

were there any other birds in the movie?
let's finish it right now! let's finish it *now* papa.

were there any other birds in the movie?
another bird.

what color was the other bird?
it was red and orange.
[en: the "other bird" is actually an albatross. which is white. i'm not sure where red and orange come from.]

red and orange? really?
yes.

was there any dancing in the movie?
that red and orange bird danced playing the guitar very funny. remember seeing that?

i do remember, it was a very silly dance.  were there any other animals in the movie?
mousie, and...
[en: take your pick of australian animals - kangaroo, koala, platypus, wombat, kookaburra - they pretty much all appear at some point. mcleach has a pet goanna, a wild boar helps out at a key moment, and there are at least two scary scenes with crocodiles.]

what was your favorite part? what did you like the most?
i don't know. i like very dark purple. that dark. i like it even darker. see how dark it is?

yes, i do see that. did anything happen with bernard and bianca?
bernard and bianca got trapped.

who trapped them?
the mean old witch.

why did bernard and bianca come to help cody?
ummm...  because, they didn't want her to be in trouble again.
 
[en: i think she is still thinking of penny, the girl from the rescuers.]

was the "mean old witch" alone, or was there a helper?
yes. there was a dragon!
[en: a goanna, named joanna]

was it big?
veeery, very big.
[en: perhaps 3 feet long. smaller than cody, at any rate]

what did it like to eat?
grass and stuff.

[en: there were at least two scenes in which joanna was trying to eat eggs. the movie was not very clear about what kind of lizard she was, but it was pretty clear she liked to eat eggs.]

fin.

 a couple of possible lessons can be drawn from this:
(1). sometimes, you can enjoy something more, the less you actually understand it. certainly that appears to be daughter #1's and my experience. i hate the rescuers down under. if i never see it again, it will be too soon. the story is nonsensical, the characters are all basically forgettable caricatures, the music is pretty much crap compared to later disney films, etc. yet i guarantee you that if we ask #1 if she wants to watch a movie, rescuers down under will be her first choice. she remembers a couple of key scenes (escaping from the trap, dancing bird), roughly who is good and who is bad (though she can't clearly distinguish cody and penny), but that's all she needs to know: she likes the movie. a lot. ten out of five. 

(2). some people will tell you that children love to watch and re-watch movies because it's comforting for them, because they like the predictability of knowing what comes next and this is psychologically reassuring. maybe. another possibility: they just want to watch it again because they still don't quite get what just happened.

ask a medievalist #1





caveat emptor i did absolutely no research for this whatsoever.q:  if you were going to choose a medieval name for minor miner, what would it be?a:  ha!  your first mistake was asking a question of an historian.  as you may have guessed, the answer is somewhat complicated.  it would depend on where i was living, and what period we are talking about.  you might already be aware that the name "adolf" has dropped out of usage among most people, for reasons that do not need elaborating.  in the medieval world, similar changes occurred due to the influence of current events, popular culture and prestige.  politics might play a role.  for example, despite the fact that there was no substantial immigration from the continent to england, within 150 years of the norman conquest (1066), the english peasantry had largely adopted the names of their conquerors.  popular culture might also have been important.  i have heard that the name "ganelon", because it was given to the villain of the song of roland, dropped out of common usage as the poem gained in popularity.  you can also see the spread of names like "roland" and "lancelot" among the italians, for example, as evidence that the chansons de geste and arthurian romances definitely captivated contemporary audiences.finally, because religious sentiment was such an important part of medieval european culture generally, religious sentiment and shifting standards of piety might also influence the choice of names.  the popularity of local saints' names (fructuosus) tended to decline during the later middle ages, as the names of more 'universal' saints (john, james, mary, et al.) began to become more popular.  names like francis might also become popular if someone who had that name turned out to be an important or famous saint.i guess the short answer would be that i don't know.  the slightly longer answer is that a lot of names currently floating around were also in use in the middle ages, so in the end it probably wouldn't sound all that strange.

what is the point of putting on headphones if you're only going to crank the volume so loud you can be heard across the room?
