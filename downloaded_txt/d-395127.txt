			reviews        

 




“elaine was knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. she was easy to work with, and worked very hard to navigate the many issues that came up with the selling of an older home. the sale of the house was delayed due to a septic system that needed repair. the company hired to do the job took over eight months to do the job, causing the loss of the sale, and costing a huge amount of money. in addition, the home roof had to be repaired, and the electrical system failed inspection. all of this, and the additional pressure of a difficult tenant living in the house, created an enormous amount of pressure on the sellers. elaine’s knowledge and patience helped us navigate the eventual sale. we could not have done it without her. she is great!”





										mark gates									









elaine has provided quick response to questions/needs of both tenants and owners. she does not pressure the potential client/client, and takes the “how would i like to be treated” approach.





										koolmoney 3131									









mrs. voncannon is very knowledgeable about the local market as well as the home buying and selling process – two of my experiences using her services. she is responsive to questions and dedicated to matching your needs with the right resources. i will continue to recommend her to those i know for their real estate needs!





										keisha m.									









i have known elaine for 20 years and have used her to buy 2 homes. i never thought to ask anyone else to help me with my most important purchases. knowing very little about the process, i couldn’t have been in better hands throughout. whether you’re buying or selling, i highly recommend using elaine, as she always gets the closing done.





										merridith e.									









i have used the services of elaine von cannon for over 15 years in both residential and commercial real estate transactions. her attention to every detail and tireless efforts in each transaction were above and beyond all expectations. i will continue to use her in all future real estate activities as i can always depend on her to make sure everything will be taken care of in every step of the way from start to finish with the utmost of professionalism and honesty.
