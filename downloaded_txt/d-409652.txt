have
you been looking for that different cross stitch pattern to do for your
"masterpiece"? 
we
have received licensing rights from many
artists/photographers/designers from
around the world to change over their works of art into cross stitch
patterns
and sell them to the public. we also sell to retail stores. if you are
a retail
store and would like to carry our patterns please email
us. 
our
patterns are done at 28 count detail to get the pattern as close to the
original artwork as possible. these can be stitched at any count you
wish. the
only difference will be the finished size. 
we've
decided to do up a newsletter to inform everyone about the latest
additions to
our website etc.  if you would like to be informed of what is
going on,  please go to  mailing
list
to be added to our mailing list.  please note, we do not give out or sell the
email
addresses which are given to us. 
  







we
have have an ezboard message board and chat room. come and
see who else is stitching up one of these patterns and meet new people
with the same interests as you!
