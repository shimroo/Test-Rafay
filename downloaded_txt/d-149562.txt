							house						


						for those for whom the tumultuous life of the big cities is not suitable. by the seaside, in the countryside or on the outskirts of towns, people live in houses in generally peaceful places. but this often means having to travel far enough to find what you want.					













 




							flat						


						living in a flat is synonymous with living in the city. this means that you are close to shops and work, which reduces the use of the car for long journeys and therefore also reduces travel time. it also brings you closer to places of culture and entertainment. 					













 




							interior design						


						you have your accommodation, but now you have to make it feel like home. paint for the walls and ceiling, work to change the size of the rooms, furnishings, etc. all these elements will help you find your home, but you still have to choose them carefully.

how to invest in property in england? 



buying a property in england can be summed up in three stages: search and offer, sale and the final touch.find a suitable property and make an offer, usually through your estate agent. the offer does not legally commit you to buy, except in scotland where offers are binding. once your offer has been accepted, you can organize an enquiry.  there are generally two types of enquiry:a building survey, which will cost you around £500 to £1,000. a report on buying a house, which will be cheaper at around £300 to £500.there are no fixed costs for surveys. you can negotiate.legal transfer of ownership (conveyancing) is the next step. for this, you will need a lawyer or a licensed conveyancer. again, there is no fixed fee structure, so negotiate and clarify whether vat and/or disbursements are included in the initial quotation.  a “draft contract” will be drawn up by the seller’s solicitor, containing the price, information on the seller’s title deeds, etc.your notary will check this draft and negotiate with the seller’s notary. the searches, surveys and surveys undertaken on your behalf will include a search with the local authorities to check that the property is not subject to any plans.  this part of the transfer procedure takes a minimum of two weeks, but it is not uncommon for it to take two or three months.once you and your lawyer are satisfied, you sign the final contracts. this contract is legally binding for both parties – the sale must be concluded. at this stage, you give a non-refundable deposit of 10%.a transfer contract documenting the transfer of title will then be prepared and signed by both parties. between the signing of the contract and the date of completion, the necessary arrangements are made with the land registry office.  payments are then made and the deeds are handed over to you.
