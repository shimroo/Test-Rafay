jose brizuela came out quickly and on time, and he fixed my garage door really quickly, too. it’s been working well since then. he also took the time to answer my questions about programming/resetting a garage door clicker. very helpful, and i appreciated his time.

i just want to share my experience with carlos j from r&s overhead after a recent unfortunate incident at my dad’s shop. the professionalism and support we received were beyond exceptional, and i wholeheartedly recommend carlos to all business owners.

when a vehicle crashed through the steel gate of my dad’s shop late at night, carlos was the beacon of hope we needed. despite the late hour and the distance, he arrived promptly and got to work immediately. carlos didn’t just assess the damage; he also provided invaluable emotional support, guiding my dad through the chaos and helping him understand his options.

what truly sets carlos apart is his willingness to go above and beyond his job duties. he didn’t stop at assessment; he rolled up his sleeves and assisted my dad in moving heavy, damaged machinery out of the way. this level of dedication and proactive help was truly remarkable and made a world of difference during a stressful time.

carlos’s professionalism, compassion, and exceptional work ethic make him a standout professional in his field. for any business owner seeking reliable, dedicated, and supportive assistance, carlos at r&s overhead is the one to call. he turned a distressing situation into a manageable one and left us profoundly grateful for his expertise. thank you so much, carlos!

marcellus and victor just came out to our building at jackson st on a friday. they did a fine job rebuilding our incoming garage gate. it runs like new! very thorough install! thanks guys! your team is great.

i highly recommend r&s. i have been a customer for the past 20 years and my parents for decades. i recently called them when my garage door stopped working after a power outage. i called them that morning, they told me there was a technician in the area and they had my problem fixed by noon. excellent customer service!
