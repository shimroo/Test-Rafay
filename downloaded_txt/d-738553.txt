 what our customers are saying

 







  faqs

     what makes holes in swiss cheese?

  




  gas is produced by the cultures from milk during the cheesemaking process. as it ages, the gas tries to “escape” the body of the cheese and creates the holes.



   where do your deli meats come from?

  




  we select amish-made meats like bologna and summer sausage to complement our cheeses.



   do i need to keep cheese refrigerated?

  




  yes and no. hard cheeses’ flavors are enhanced when served at room temperature, not colder temperatures, so don’t refrigerate them. however, soft cheese should be refrigerated.



   what makes broad run cheesehouse different from other cheesemakers in the area?

  




  we also offer wines made on-site as well as a gift shop.



   can i order cheese, meat and wine combination packages?

  




  yes, you can call or order these online. we ship all over the united states. we do not recommend shipping in very warm conditions, as that may affect the freshness of the cheese.
