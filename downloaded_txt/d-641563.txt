why you put money down when buying a new or used car.





     the bottom line is the more you pay up front, the less you pay long-term. make sense? let me know if you have any questions, whether you are owning a car through me now, never, or simply starting your fact-finding mission.

2014 toyota 4runner first drive & review 





          the 2014 toyota 4runner is one of the last remaining old school suv's. 
in other words, it still is a traditional body on frame vehicle. that 
means it is rigid and very strong but also heavy and thirsty. in another
 tflcar first drive review roman and nathan test drive the newly 
refreshed 2014 toyota 4runner in jackson hole, wyoming to see if an old 
style suv can succeed in a brave new world.

buying a car? do this first: check your credit. 








         it makes sense to utilize free credit scores. the fair credit reporting act (fcra) requires each of the nationwide credit reporting companies — equifax, experian, and transunion — to provide you with a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. any dealership will need to run your report before financing your loan, but you can find out if there are any errors on your report before getting too deep into the process. this can save you time and money.

any questions? whethere you buy a new or used car from me is not important, but getting your questions answered is important. let me know.

rock it out today!

what is the biggest car buying mistake you ever made?





          i can think back to my younger days when i was in a hurry to buy a car. i made a few mistakes, paid too much, and ended up with a jet black nissan 300zx sports car in time for a snowy wisconsin winter. looking back, the mistake was not too bad. i enjoyed the car, paid it off over time, and did not mind driving five miles per hour during snow storms with my rear wheel drive rocket of a car. zoom, zoom, and zoom!!!

what car buying mistakes have you made? do you agree or disagree with the list below?
