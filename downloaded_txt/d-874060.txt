pedagoguery software has been producing intuitive, unique, and useful software programs since 1988.
while our early programs were for the apple // (grafeq, tickedy-boo, z80 cp/m turbo enhancer, vector nector)
and ibm pc-compatibles (sin ’n conics), our current software products
are for macintosh and windows computers.
