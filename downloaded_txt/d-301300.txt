t-shirt sizingsm 18.5â³. md 20â³. lg 21.5â³. xl 23â³. (flat measurements; double for circumference)


we recently found a bin of unsold, original straight boys kissing makes me hot t-shirts from twenty years ago!
oops.
they're professionally screen-printed, 100% cotton, unisex, fruit of the loom.
(the material might be a little thicker than you're used to; people were tougher back then.)
the shirts are priced at just $20 each.
needless to say, supplies are limited. once they're gone, they're gone.
don't miss your chance or you'll have to settle for these weird etsy knockoffs instead. haha.
