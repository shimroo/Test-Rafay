3d animation

☶

family


          i want to create 3d animations without any humans or living beings. for example, i want to make a car animation where only the moving car, a city, a street, and some lights are visible. another example would be a soda bottle animation showing how it opens and closes.
is it allowed to create such animations without any living beings, and can i sell them?
i appreciate any response i receive. please also mention the source of your information when you repy. that is very important to me.

my love is still married to a woman who cheated on him

☶

adult
family


          i met him and he told me he is still married. they got married quickly, both moslems, he went for financially reasons and a job to another island and he received a call from her aunt telling him she is pregnant from another man (moslem i assume) my boyfriend did not take care of the issue, he just left to a job and basically never dealt with divorce. he said it’s been 1.5 years. what do we have to do to divorce him? how difficult will it be and is it right that the court will have them live

college loan

☶

islam
secular


          salam everyone, so basically i have this scholarship where they want me to take a small loan out to pay for my college however once i’m done they pay the loan and everything back so i won’t be paying it. reason is because they get a very very small interest rate when they do. making it close to what i used. is it still haram and shouldn’t do it because i’m not paying nothing and technically it’s still just a scholarship paying for my tuition? barakallah

is it haram to run away from parents?

☶

          salam alaikum,
i have been seriously considering leaving home and finding a place to live without informing my parents.
for years, i have endured so much while living under their roof. i had always hoped for a better relationship with them, but i lost that hope a long time ago and stopped fighting for it.

is eye contact haram?

☶

islam


          there is a boy i really like, and he likes me too, but the problem is we can’t be together due to islamic reasons. is there a halal way to get together? he is always looking at me, and i can’t control it when i stare at him because he’s a beautiful boy, mashallah. should i admit my feelings to him even though he knows i like him or should i just ignore it. i’ve liked him for almost 2 years now.
