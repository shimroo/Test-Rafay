m.a.c.h.™ 5.0 











controlled f.o.r.c.e. is the developer and sole source provider of the mechanical advantage control holds (m.a.c.h.™) 5.0 system. the m.a.c.h. system is a series of five techniques that use positioning, movement, body momentum, and resistance to control a subject. because the system emphasizes mechanical advantage over pressure points or pain compliance, the techniques work on any subject regardless of size, strength, skill, psychological state, or level of intoxication or chemical influence.
