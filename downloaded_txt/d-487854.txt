every hotel, resort or savoy signature experience is a commitment to quality.
we put our name in everything we do especially because it is how people remember us from the start – the first and legendary savoy, the very beginning of our century-old hospitality tradition.
 savoy’s long lasting legacy offers a growing portfolio of unique hotels and resorts. each one has its own distinctive value propositions, concepts and audiences where every experience re­flects our identity and our welcoming spirit.
