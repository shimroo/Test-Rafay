						"thank you so much for an incredible and awesome yom tov. words can't summarize our shoresh experience ... my daughter was glowing on simchat torah and enjoyed every minute of dancing with her daddy ... the food was awesome, the spacious campground and country air were relaxing and invigorating."					









						"shoresh has been a lifeline for us ... shoresh is so much more than roots; it is the past, the present, and the future for pride, knowledge, and love of our jewishness. without shoresh we would not have our roots fastened as tightly to who we are."
