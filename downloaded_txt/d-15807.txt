"we are not called to be popular, we are called to be effective."
—carman












record-breaker
carman holds the world record for having the largest audience to see a single christian artist. he set the record for the largest concert at texas stadium with more than 71,000 fans and led more than 80,000 fans in worship in chattanooga, tennessee.














trailblazer
among his many awards, carman received the house of hope of humanitarian award for his positive influence in the lives of american youth in 2006, other noted recipients of this award include ronald & nancy reagan and billy graham. the gospel music association honored carman with induction into the gma gospel music hall of fame in 2018. billboard named carman “contemporary christian artist of the year” in 1992 and 1995, and in 1993, his album, addicted to jesus, earned the distinction of contemporary christian album of the year. carman was grammy-nominated multiple times as the best pop contemporary gospel artist. his recording, “a long time ago in a land called bethlehem” was nominated for “album of the year” by the recording academy in 1986.








soul winner
in 1985, the release of his first #1 song, “the champion,” solidified his place in music history and defined his soul-winning career as one of endurance, grit, dedication, and pure talent. anyone who knew carman knows that he counted only this as his greatest lifetime achievement – winning millions of souls to christ.
