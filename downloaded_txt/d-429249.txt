                                            ‘countdown to salzburg e-scrap show; asian conference returns’

                                            ‘battery recyclers need investment support’                                        

der artikel thematisiert die großen herausforderungen, vor denen das batterierecycling in europa und weltweit steht. ein zentrales problem ist die unsicherheit und komplexität der regulatorischen rahmenbedingungen, die von land zu land variieren und investitionen in recyclinginfrastrukturen erschweren. gleichzeitig schwächt sich das wachstum im bereich der autobatterien ab, was zu einem mangel an recycelbarem material und überkapazitäten führt. die konkurrenz, insbesondere aus asien, verstärkt den druck auf europäische unternehmen. china dominiert den globalen recyclingmarkt, insbesondere durch seine führende position in der verarbeitung der sogenannten schwarzmasse und der metallrückgewinnung. in diesem kontext wird diskutiert, wie europa seine versorgungssicherheit langfristig sichern kann, während investitionen vermehrt in die usa fließen.
