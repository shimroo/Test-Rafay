retire 
								early lifestyle is a content based 
								website that appeals to a different kind of 
								person - the person who prizes their 
								
independence, values their  
								time, and who doesn't want to mindlessly 
								follow the crowd.



















billy and akaisha's 
						inspirational message to their readers is to live life 
						on their own terms and pursue their passions and 
						desires, rather than being held back by societal norms 
						and expectations. they encourage people to take control 
						of their financial future, so that they can live a life 
						of freedom and fulfillment. they also emphasize the 
						importance of living a balanced life, with a focus on 
						health, relationships, and personal growth. overall, 
						their message is one of living life intentionally and 
						embracing adventure, while striving to find joy, 
						purpose, and happiness. - james h.
