current edition of the manual on uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways



current edition of the mutcd

the manual on  uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways—the mutcd—defines  the standards used by road managers nationwide to install and maintain traffic  control devices on all streets, highways, pedestrian and bicycle facilities,  and site roadways open to public travel. the mutcd is published by the federal  highway administration (fhwa) under 23 code of federal regulations (cfr), part 655, subpart f.
the  mutcd, which has been administered by the fhwa since 1971, is a compilation of  national standards for all traffic control devices, including road markings,  highway signs, and traffic signals. it is updated periodically to accommodate  the nation's changing transportation needs and address new safety technologies,  traffic control tools, and traffic management techniques.
on december  19, 2023, a final rule adopting the 11th edition of the mutcd was published in  the federal register with an effective date of january 18, 2024. states  must adopt the 11th edition of the national mutcd as their legal state standard  for traffic control devices within two years from the effective date. the federal  register notice, which provides detailed discussion of the final  dispositions of major changes from the 2009 edition, can be viewed at https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-27178.
fhwa does  not print copies of the mutcd. the pdf version of the 11th edition of the mutcd is  the most current edition of the official fhwa publication.
