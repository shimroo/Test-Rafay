welcome to doctor who online - the biggest, most-popular, and longest-running doctor who 
	fan site on the internet.



what is doctor who online?

doctor who online  


is a fan site dedicated to bringing you all the latest 
	from the world of doctor who, providing news, merchandise information, 
	reviews, competitions, features, forums and more...

how long has the site been running?
we've been running a doctor who site since 1996, when we were originally 
	known as 'doctor who: the regenerative website' (a bit of a 
	mouthful, we know). it wasn't until 2000 when we had a chance meeting with 
	tom baker, where he actually suggested the name 'doctor who online'. 
	who argues with the doctor, right?

is it true dwo is a 100% spoiler-free site?
it is true! we pride ourselves on the fact that we stay away from spoilers, 
	or anything that gives away plot details that the bbc haven't officially 
	confirmed themselves. you 
	will also find that our popular online forum is 
	100% spoiler-free too.


	how many visitors does dwo get?
- 35,000+ daily visitors
	- 50,000+ forum members
	- 130,000+ twitter followers
	- 10,000+ weekly dwo whocast podcast listeners

we hope that you enjoy this site as our team constantly strive to 
	provide our visitors with a unique, enjoyable and interactive experience. if 
	you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us on the address
