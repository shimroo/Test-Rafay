 welcome to my website
today is friday,
february 07, 2025

update: february 07, 2025: 1992 barcelona olympic games official report, 4 volumes, available for shipping in february, order and pay now!!


i am a retired health & physical education teacher (bs., mat., ph.d/abd.) and an olympic games and sport historian.
my services as an independent researcher, writer & consultant are available for short or long term contracts for up to one year.
i also provide appraisals in this field for books, posters and memorabilia.
for students i provide proof-reading and editing for master's theses and doctoral dissertations.

harvey abrams-books is my antiquarian book business founded in 1979 while i was a ph.d. student at penn state university.
my website first appeared online in 1996 and has gone through several versions at different hosting sites.

covid-19 caused a major disruption in my life so i am dreadfully behind schedule and i am still trying to "catch up."

i am the founder and president of the international institute for sport history (iisoh) library & museum
being developed in pennsylvania. this non-profit corporation seeks to build a comprehensive collection of sports literature
in order to preserve for posterity the history of all sports, in all languages, from ancient to modern eras.
my antiquarian book business will remain open, and separate, from the iisoh at the request of the board of directors.
i split my time between central pennsylvania and vienna, austria.

this entire website is being rebuilt and is not up-to-date yet, sorry!
my focus has been on building the website at www.sportlibrary.org.

limited inventory is available for sale now.
the expansion of my inventory and sales that were planned for late 2020
have been delayed due to the covid-19 pandemic until 2025!

  international olympic academy
  ioa
  greece
    anniversaries
  20 - 40 - 60



 ioa was founded in 1961
  20th anniversary was in 1981
  40th anniversary since 1981
  60th anniversary in 2021


  in 1981 i was a member of the united states delegation
  selected to attend the international olympic academy in greece.
  it was the 20th anniversary of the ioa which was founded in 1961,
  so it was a very special celebration. 
  but it was also the first olympic function following the
  1980 moscow olympic games, thus it was a diplomatic nightmare
  because the usa had led a boycott of those games. 
  it was the year that chariots of fire, a movie about the
  1924 olympic games, won an academy award as "best film." 

my family, cousins/relatives that owned a department store chain in new england, donated complete sets of uniforms for our delegation. however the parcels were delivered by an employee to the wrong airport in new york. our delegation flew from kennedy airport to athens but the uniforms were delivered to laguardia airport, lol. even though the uniforms made it on the next flight to athens the greek customs officers refused to give them to me because i did not have a receipt. those uniforms are still sitting in some warehouse in athens.


in honor of that event i have created several pages to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1981 ioa, the year i attended, which would be the 60th anniversary (hence "20-40-60").

 i am gathering our history from as many sources as possible and list 
  the usa delegation (6 people) as well as all the participants at the academy in 1981.
