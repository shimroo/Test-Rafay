client success stories





we often build custom portfolios for clients with concentrated positions of low tax basis stock which balance diversification with tax minimization




after a client’s death, we cared for his daughter’s financial needs until she was an adult. 




by placing pre-ipo stock in a new hampshire trust with fiduciary trust of new england, a client reduced their tax liability.




we have helped private foundations and other charitable entities convert to donor-advised funds to reduce administrative burdens and increase flexibility.




we enabled a family member to access additional care through our wealth planning process, which provided a funding plan as well as assistance identifying care options. 




our wealth planning process helped our client examine the financial and living tradeoffs of retirement living options, so they could make a well-informed decision.
