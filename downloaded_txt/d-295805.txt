earthbound
              misfit is the story of jerry foster, a pioneer in the field of
              news helicopter pilots. what began a routine flying job reporting
              traffic for a local tv station, soon became much more, as jerry
              began reporting news stories as well. his former training as a
              paramedic for the ames project (for which he was chief pilot), and
              his association with several law enforcement agencies, also
              allowed him the opportunity to help with rescues and recoveries.
              very often, instead of just reporting the story, jerry foster was
              the story. the book also covers jerrys early life, and the
              demons that followed him for years, as well as his life after 20
              years in the tv business. it covers his fall from grace, and his
              years of reclusiveness, before venturing out into the world of
              facebook and discovering that he was still loved by many.

"it
          aint braggin if youve done it!"



jerry
          foster at his authors @the teague book signing on saturday, march 8,
          2014. 


the name
          jerry foster is a familiar name and face to those who lived in the
          valley in the 1980s. foster was
          one of the first pilots to regularly report the news, traffic and
          weather while also piloting a gyro plane or helicopter.
his skills as a helicopter pilot allowed him to work closely
          with law enforcement with search-and-rescue missions.
his involvement in several rescues made him part of the story,
          giving him lots of positive attention from viewers but also a lot of
          critics.






news
          ratings were good and management knew a ratings maker when they saw
          one. traditional journalist saw
          a challenge to traditional news reporting.
while the faa did not care for mr. fosters high-flying style
          and set out to ground him. elementary
          school kids wanted him to visit their school, because he would land in
          his helicopter!






pilots
          have their swagger and anyone who makes it to sixty and beyond knows
          it was not always easy and not without getting a few bumps and scraps
          along the way. jerry foster admitted he is a hot dog.
in his memoir, earthbound misfit: jerry foster, with dee
          dees, he shares his story, bumps, scrapes and all.
 
judging
          by the audience at velma teague on saturday, he is loved and admired,
          still, by many. some of the attendees saw jerry when he came to their
          schools in the 80's!






he
          just does things with a helicopter that a man in his right mind just
          wouldn't do. 


but he
          does it so well hes perfectly safe.



senator
          barry goldwater  1988.

          machamer is getting her book signed by jerry foster.
foster said on saturday, march 8, 2014 during his book signing
          that one of his most positive memories are of his many visits to
          elementary schools and the kids. one
          of many school visits he made was to jennifer machmers class.

bob vache, 45, sports director
            of ktar radio
            and television
            was killed early saturday morning, january
            17 in
            a one car automobile
            accident
            at 26th street
            and washington
            in phoenix.
a native
            of phoenix - educated at tolleson
            high school and
            phoenix college
            - "vash" began
            his illustrious
            career in' 1942.
            he joined
            the staff of ktar
            in 1953
            where he broadcast
            sports programs
            and
            play by play descriptions until being named
            program director of channel
            12 (ktar) tv in 1957. coupling
            sports broadcasting
            with his
            executive duties, vache
            continued
            as the voice
            of arizona
            state and
            university of arizona
            broadcasts.
a desire
            to return to
            full-time sports reporting
            culminated in 1962
            when bob returned
            to his
            first
            love-sports.
in the
            8 years
            which followed,
            vache
            was named arizona's outstanding
            sports broadcaster an
            unprecedented five
            times by
            the
            national association of sportswriters
            and broadcasters. when
            the phoenix suns national basketball
            association franchise was
            granted
            in phoenix, bob was logically assigned as the
            "voice
            of the suns"
            on ktar radio
            and tv.
a pilot with the army
            air corps in world war
            ii, bob
            remained in the air
            force reserve
            after his discharge rising to the
            rank of
            lt. colonel with
            the
            302nd
            air rescue squadron.
he is
            survived by
            his wife, bettie
            and their
            two children, marilyn
            18 and son
            tommy 13.
the following is a portion of bill
            stull's newscast on channel 12
            which was broadcast the night
            following bob's death.
". . .
            a sportsman, a gentleman
            and a friend. as a thorough and dedicated craftsman bob set
            standards that the
            rest
            of us
            will never live up to.
            few men in broadcasting have
            earned
            the respect which
            we felt
            for him. he
            was, in every sense
            of the word, a professional. bob vache
            was indeed
            a sportsman, a true
            gentleman and an irreplaceable friend.
            the words fit
            bob
            vache. the hard part, and the still
            unbelievable part,
            -the
            word was."
may
            we all add our
            endorsement to bill's words.

 paul
              taylor  
2013 rit innovation hall of fame
 


 
paul taylor quite literally changed the life experiences of
              deaf and hard of hearing people. paul saw an opportunity to
              combine western union teletypewriters with modems to create the
              first telecommunications devices for the deaf, known as tdds or
              ttys. but he didn't stop there. he then helped to create a network
              of these devices, as well as using them to launch local telephone
              wake-up services for the deaf and the nation's first telephone
              relay system for the deaf, which he expanded to a statewide
              system. rit was fortunate to welcome paul as chair of the
              engineering support team at the national technical institute for
              the deaf in 1975. he remained on our faculty for 30 years,
              continuing to innovate and advocate in telecommunications for the
              deaf.

bob
              schieffer to receive walter cronkite award


 
phoenix,
              ariz. (may 21, 2013)  bob schieffer, the award-winning cbs news
              correspondent and longtime anchor of face the nation, will
              be the 2013 recipient of the walter cronkite award for excellence
              in journalism, arizona state university announced today.


schieffer
              will accept the 30th annual award, given by the walter
              cronkite school of journalism and mass communication, at a
              luncheon ceremony oct. 29 at the sheraton phoenix downtown hotel.


walter
              cronkite is who i wanted to be when i was a young reporter,
              schieffer said. he is who i still want to be so winning an
              award with walters name on it means as much to me as any
              recognition i have ever received.


cbs
              news president david rhodes said "there's nobody better than
              bob in this business, and nobody better to work with, too."


schieffer
              is the network's chief washington correspondent and also serves as
              anchor and moderator of face the nation, cbs news' sunday
              public affairs broadcast. he contributes regularly to the cbs
              evening news, where he served as interim anchor in 2005 and
              2006.


with
              56 years of reporting experience, schieffer may be the most
              experienced broadcast reporter in washington. he has spent the
              past 44years reporting on politics and government for cbs, serving
              as the networks chief washington correspondent since 1982 and
              moderator of face the nation since 1991. he is one of the
              few journalists to have covered all four majorbeats in the
              nations capital  the white house, the pentagon, the state
              department and capitol hill. 


schieffer
              has moderated three presidential debates  in 2004, 2008 and
              2012  and has covered every presidential campaign and been a
              reporter or anchor at every democratic and republican national
              convention since 1972. 


a
              native of austin, texas, who grew up in fort worth, schieffer is a
              graduate of texas christian university and served three years in
              the u.s. air force. he began his journalism career as a reporter
              at the fort worth star-telegram, where in 1965 he became the first
              reporter from a texas newspaper to report from vietnam. 


after
              returning from the war, he became news anchor at wbap-tv fort
              worth/dallas and then joined cbs news in 1969. he served as the
              networks pentagon correspondent from 1970 to 1974 and its white
              house correspondent from 1974 to 1979. 


he
              began anchoring the cbs weekend newscasts in 1973 and continued
              anchoring for the next 23 years. 


following
              dan rathers departure in 2005, schieffer became anchor of the
              weekday evening news, where he served for two years until
              thearrival of katie couric. he then returned to the nations
              capital and as moderator of face
              the nation.


in
              2005, tcu named its journalism school the schieffer school of
              journalism in his honor. 


earlier
              this year schieffer was inducted into the academy of television
              arts hall of fame and was also given the distinguished service
              award from the national association of broadcasters, an award that
              has gone previously to former president ronald reagan and oprah
              winfrey, among others. schieffer is also a member of the
              broadcasting & cable hall of fame and the recipient of
              numerous awards, including seven emmy awards, one of which was for
              lifetime achievement, and two sigma delta chi awards. the national
              press foundation named him broadcaster of the year in 2002, and in
              2003, the radio-television news directors association presented
              him with the paul white award, which also recognizes lifetime
              contributions to electronic journalism.


he
              also is the recipient of the leonard zeidenberg first amendment
              award from the radio television news directors association and was
              named a "living legend" by the library of congress.
              other awards include the international radio and television
              society foundation award and the american news women's club helen
              thomas award for excellence in journalism.

              is the author of four books. the new york times bestsellers
              this just in: what i couldnt tell you on tv and "bob

              favorite stories from the first 50 years of the award-winning news
              broadcast and "the acting president."


schieffer
              epitomizes great broadcast journalism in the best tradition of
              walter cronkite, said cronkite dean christopher callahan.
              were thrilled to present him with this award and to have him
              share with our students some of what he has learned over a long
              and sterling career.

              cronkite award recipients include tv anchors brian williams, diane
              sawyer and tom brokaw, newspaper journalists ben bradlee, helen
              thomas and bob woodward and media executives katharine graham, al
              neuharth and bill paley.cronkite personally presented the award
              during its first quarter-century. the cbs news anchor died in

              walter cronkite school of journalism and mass communication, named
              in cronkites honor in 1984, prepares the next generation of
              journalists in both the time-honored fundamentals embraced by
              cronkite and the multimedia skills necessary to thrive as
              journalists in the digital age.

              in a $71 million state-of-the-art media complex in downtown
              phoenix, the school has been featured in both the new york times
              and the times of london as a leader in 21st century journalism
              education. it is the home of the carnegie-knight news 21
              initiative, the donald w. reynolds national center for business
              journalism, cronkite news service, cronkite newswatch and the new
              media innovation lab.

      an
      interest in teletype machines and a friend at the glendale
      police museum, started ed sharpe on an interesting quest.

      at left ed sharpe archivist for smecc
      and at right - dan kallberg curator of the glendale police museum located
      in the lobby of glendale pd)
years
      back, ed sharpe archivist for the southwest
      museum of engineering, communications and computation had been
      discussing police communications with dan kallberg, a retired police
      officer and the curator of the glendale
      police museum. at that time it was located in the fop hall east of the
      glendale public safety building. dan had mentioned that the glendale
      police department had used a teletype machine in the 1960s.

time
      passed....
time
      went on and ed ended up with a group of teletypes he was using to build a
      history display on telecommunications for the deaf. remembering back to
      his conversation with dan, ed was curious as to what model teletype the
      glendale pd had used. dan showed ed a photograph or an officer sitting in
      front of a teletype model 28 ksr, a 5 level baudot machine.
smecc
      likes to put things out at other museums for display so plans were made to
      loan the police museum a teletype just like the one in the photo. ed was
      curious as to who the officer was and suggested that they try to find him
      and pose him with the teletype unit at the museum sort of a before and
      after photo!
 
dan
      kallberg told ed the officers name was sal
      vetrano, and that the photo had been taken in the new (at that time!!)
      police station. (torn down and the civic center stands on that ground
      now!) sal
      had joined the glendale police department in 1953 as a reserve officer,
      then went on as a full time officer in 1956. sal stayed on until 1970 when
      he left the department.. dan states "when sal was an officer he
      was the one responsible for starting up the pd's photo lab, maintaining
      and controlling the records section of the pd and running the front desk
      and assisting citizens when they came in to the police dept. sal ran the
      teletype machine which was connected to california, nevada, oregon, and
      arizona." 

armed
      with that information sharpe was able to start searching sal out on the
      internet and based on age ad some vague hints on prior locale found sal
      living in leakey texas and running vinny's pizzeria at over 82 years of
      age!
sal
      will come to pose for a 'current' photo with a teletype when he comes to
      arizona to visit his children he tells us.
the
      teletype is all in place in the museum for you to visit and dan kallberg
      the curator states
"the
      teletype machine although slow by today's standards it was a fast was of
      obtaining critical information about felony crimes that had just occurred
      within the four corners area. the teletype also freed up the telephone
      line at the police dept. for other incoming calls for service. thanks to
      the efforts of ed sharpe the glendale police museum was able to obtain
      this teletype machine for display. with ed's help we were able to preserve
      a small piece of history and put it on display so everyone could enjoy
      ."

 comments (0) john silva, who for nearly 25 years was ktla-los angeles chief engineer, died wednesday night at age 92. sam rubin today on ktla morning news offered up a touching remembrance of silva, a former navy radar operator who was responsible for such innovations as the news helicopter (first introduced in 1958, silva called it the telecopter), live news trucks and mountaintop antennas. he also engineered the first live rose parade broadcast. its not an exaggeration to say that every television station in the world uses some form of one of john silvas ideas, rubin says. heres the segment, complete with great old footage (beware the

the

       harald  friis  
(a scarce pamphlet published in 1957 by j. r.
      pierce -   c- from the arthur karp collection at smecc)





harald trap friis


 



the wisdom of harald friis
with notes and comments
by his disciple, john pierce
 

"is wisdom wisdom only to the wise? how can we tell
          wisdom from unwisdom? if deeds are important, then harald friis's
          deeds show he must be wise, and many who have worked for him will
          testify that he is. he prepared these few notes for a conference at
          seaview in september 1957. i have discussed them with him and added
          comments, sometimes in his words and sometimes in mine. what i have
          added is indented." - john

first in arizona to
      report live from an effective hi-speed, maneuverable news platform,
      jerry foster set records and  got news to us.  sky-12  used a
      newly developed tayburn microwave platform that is reputed to be a
      spin-off of military technology. at the  station end there was an autotracking
      antenna system that would  follow jerry around the  valley (and
      beyond) as he sped about, this system would 'follow' him and was the secret of what made the
      tayburn system so good.
in arizona,  kool channel 10 claims
      a first too.  there had been an experimental  point to point test
      incorporating  relay transmissions  that grant them a claim to a
      'first live from a helicopter',  but these were limited as  they
      relied on a person holding a microwave  transmitter out the 
      window of the helicopter pointed down to a fixed  microwave 
      receiver at the ground... then cabled over to the remote truck that 
      would retransmit the signal  to the station then to the transmitter
      site to go out over the airwaves to your house. 
we also can  add that  bill
      close and  channel 10 news and engineering crew gloated over pulling 
      this  first off...  just in a very short  time before the 
      sky-12 tayburn system was deployed. 
did it  work? yes, a signal 
      was sent... so... was kool first?  yes, first signal -  but alas
      not as practical airborne  news platform. was it usable? sorta!
      if  everything was connected,  aimed properly and you had 
      time to set it all up... an airborne news report could be set to the
      station
jerry foster is finishing up  his
      book "earth bound misfit" that will be released at he end
      of summer.
many questions will be answered and 
      facts explored by jerry's book.  we at smecc will be putting together
      not only  more  info on the tayburn system from the engineering
      aspects. 
controversial at
      times? indeed! whether you loved or hated him,  pilot/reporter jerry
      foster helped transform the helicopter industry into what it is today.
      enjoy this video segment as foster breaks his silence in a no
      holds barred interview on "flying with chopper rose" and takes
      us on another wild ride down memory lane.

a flash from the past! -  ed sharpe
        archivist  for smecc and jerry foster retired kpnx sky-12 pilot and
        reporter examine  the tayburn tnr-202a airborne news relay system
        omni-directional antenna mount  from the original sky 12 helicopter
        over 30 years ago... the dark metal portion  mounted to the landing
        skid on the bottom of the helicopter and the light colored portion would
        deploy the omni antenna downwards when the craft was in flight... and
        hopefully also raise it before landing! in addition,  the skid
        mount held the pa, a 2 gigahertz  power amplifier rated at 13 watts. - 
        a twin to this assembly was mounted on the other skid with a deployable
        omni-directional antenna  for receiving. looking at the  news
        ad of the sky 12 helicopter below you can see 2 omni-directional 
        antennas and the close up inset photo shows the unit that ed and jerry
        are examining.
in the inset photo and line drawing below, you will notice two
        can-like  items on  the skid mount. these are forward and 
        rear facing 2 gigahertz directional horn antennas. these were used to
        achieve higher gain back to the tayburn auto tracking receive site
        antenna.

            moment is  tv and cable as we have a tiny about of material to
            start with.

            we  want it  for the display here.  we are also
            interested in  magazine and newspaper clippings  related,  
            written memories or tapes.  ... anything.


 


for starters... need
            information on the following... here are  some keywords..

fcc
                  opens door for azcmf and radio phoenix to proceed with
                  construction permit, dismisses all objections to azcmf
                  application filing.


 


almost
                  1,500 days after azcmf filed its application for a
                  construction application for a new full power fm station, on
                  october 18, the fcc ruled in favor of azcmf and
                  radio phoenix on every point of objection that was raised
                  by american educational broadcasting (aeb).  essentially,
                  aeb was complaining the the fcc dismissed its application and
                  let ours proceed.  peter doyle, chief of the media
                  bureau, sent a letter
                  to aeb in which he found that it  had
                  failed to follow fcc procedures, had failed to properly appeal
                  the dismissal of the aeb application which had been filed on
                  top of our application, and finally, noted that even if aeb
                  had done everything in a correct fashion, that it still would
                  have been out because after two attempts, it could not correct
                  its faulty engineering.

 
aeb
                is an affiliate of educational media foundation, the largest
                religious broadcaster in the united states.  emf has an annual
                income of $88 million a year.  the legal staff at azcmf
                took on this goliath and beat it back.  the ruling from the
                fcc opens the door to the issuance of a construction permit by
                the fcc, which will allow us to begin fundraising and planning
                for a full power fm station.
 
aeb
                and emf still have many appeals they can file to continue to
                block azcmf from going on the air.  however, the issuance
                of this letter dismissing their claims is a major step forward
                in bringing real community radio to greater phoenix. more

a look back at ronald reagan's speech to ge execs
                  at the dawn of the computer age


celebrating the centennial
              ronald reagan & ge

frontiers of progress
on may 2, 1961, ronald reagan delivered a memorable speech at
              the ge computer departments frontiers of progress sales
              meeting in apache junction, arizona. his eloquent words about
              computing and ges role in the industrys brief history came
              at an optimistic time in america and at the dawn of the automation
              age.less than a decade later, (in 1970) ge would sell its computer
              division to honeywell for $200 million. still, the 1950s and
              1960 was an exciting era of innovation in the nascent world of
              computer technology, and reagans speech personified that
              excitement and sense of promise. for rest of article.........http://reagan.geblogs.com/frontiers-of-progress/

in memoriam...james m. early
      

 
jim was a friend of the museum and a
      mentor to me during the formation of it back in the days it occupied some
      shared space with computer exchange inc. in the old industrial part on
      desert cove in phoenix arizona.
 jim wrote several articles and
      spent extensive time editing on  volume #2 and #3 of "vintage
      electrics. 
his background at bell laboratories
      proved invaluable when  we cataloged some of the more obscure
      artifacts in the  k. d. smith collection. k. d. was his first supervisor
      at bell laboratories.
his words always possessed wisdom and
      humor, jim we will miss hearing you...

j.c.
      bose at the royal institution, london, 1897
just one
      hundred years ago, j.c. bose described to the royal institution in london
      his research carried out in calcutta at millimeter wavelengths. he used
      waveguides, horn antennas, dielectric lenses, various polarizers and even
      semiconductors at frequencies as high as 60 ghz; much of his original
      equipment is still in existence, now at the bose institute in calcutta.
      some concepts from his original 1897 papers have been incorporated into a
      new 1.3-mm multi-beam receiver now in use on the nrao 12 meter telescope.

think about it...
        one thing all of us should consider; vintage electrical technology daily hits the land fills across america. only  if we make a dedicated effort, will the artifacts and literature of our technological history be preserved. it is up to all of us who know the history of an item to make sure that it will be kept secure for future scientists and engineers to study. we can not rely on the actions of our heirs to accomplish it, as they may not understand the implication that an artifact had on the development of a technology. it is up to you and me in the present life to accomplish this.

        the museum is seeking items that would be  of interest to the people who indulge themselves in research at our facility, as well as those younger folks who come just to find out how an old telephone or radio works. please do not dispose of anything before contacting us! -eas

the purpose of life is not to be happy.  it is to be
      useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some
      difference that you have lived and lived well.  -ralph waldo emerson





"all men dream, but not equally. those who dream by
      night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it
      was vanity. but dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act
      their dream with open eyes to make it possible." -t.e. lawrence






   
   
   




 
 





              
      bio ed sharpe
 
 
 



- ed sharpe
always has been passionate about technology, even as a young boy. "when i
was a kid, as my compatriots were out throwing dirt clods at each other, i was
building radios," says the 50-year-old archivist of the southwest museum of
engineering, communications and computation.



 



- as a
child, sharpe soaked up as much information as he could about technology,
spending hours with adults who were knowledgeable about the field. retirees,
in particular, proved to be incredible resources.



"they
were the best because they had time on their hands," sharpe says, "and
you could go by after school and pester those poor guys and they'd teach you
anything you wanted to learn."



 



- education
of the public on the history of technology is important.



"by
understanding where we came from, we have a better understanding of how to go
forward," sharpe says.



 



- the
southwest museum of engineering, communications and computation, in glen­dale,
occupies 2,000 square feet of the coury house, include a cross-sectional history
on rca products such as radios and electron microscopes; a rural electrification
display that shows how american farms became electrified; an office-automation
display with phone switchboards and dictaphone machines, military
communications, radar and countermeasures; and an early computer display that
has some of the first computers.
 



 



- originally
a smaller-scale museum  was part, of
computer exchange inc., a phoenix business sharpe once owned. 



 



"every
day artifacts that depict the history of engineering and science hit the
landfill," he says. "we need to preserve our technological
heritage."



 



-
the
museum is located at 5802 w. palmaire ave., glendale. admission is free, and
tours are provided  by appointment tuesday through saturday.
 
 - sharpe  is a member of 
the national academy of television arts and sciences (natas),  society of
broadcast engineers (sbe), independent feature project (ifp) (ifp/phx),
investigative reporters and editors (ire), institute of electrical and
electronics engineers (ieee), society of professional journalists (spj),
national press photographers association (nppa), southwest museum of
engineering, communications and computation (smecc) and other
associations.
