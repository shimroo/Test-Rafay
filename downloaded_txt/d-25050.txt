democracy
the racial turnout gap

since the supreme court gutted the voting rights act, dozens of states have enacted laws making it harder to vote, especially for people of color. the result: a growing racial turnout gap. but congress has the power to guarantee all americans’ access to the ballot.



              protect voting rights
              
















join the fight for democracy
we can change the system when we work together. let’s make sure all our voices count.
