    this is the website of paul m kienitz. itâs not about my personal life,
    or about anything i want to sell you â itâs just some things i hoped might
    be useful or amusing contributions to the world. iâve refocused the
    site navigation to concentrate on the more up-to-date
    material. pick a topic:

            that i took during the big solar storm of spring 2024.)
        





paul tries to understand
            science is a collection of articles i have written about general
            science, as an aid to education. not your education, so much
            as my own. if i get to the point where i can write a coherent
            explanation of a bit of science, i feel that i have managed to learn
            something about it. iâd be thrilled if someone else manages to
            learn something too.

            

            the newest ones are rocket
            efficiency and consider the
            roundworm. i have other topics in progress.

            

            on a less serious note for which i donât have another category: as
            the kind of nerd who gets interested in questions about obscure fields
            of knowledge, one question that i became interested in was the
            origin and history of that word... this resulted in me laying out
            a historical timeline of the
            word ânerdâ.

            





writings about the future! yep,
            the place where weâre going to spend the rest of our lives. as
            a wise man once said, future events such as these will affect you in
            the future. these writings were originally part of a blog, but
            i kept tweaking and revising them, and also that blog was not getting
            the readership that this site is, so i gave them a permanent home
            here. the science! section was an outgrowth of this.

            

            the most recent 
            article is will
            there ever be a material to replace steel?







            i once met a man who unexpectedly turned out to be a rocket company
            founder. that planted a seed, and now, years later, inspired by the
            rapid advances in the late 2010s in the field of commercial spaceflight,
            i have added a major new section to this
            website. it takes in-depth looks at a number of new modern rockets
            and spacecraft, and while i was at it, also the existing rockets which
            remain in service. iâve been gradually adding material to this
            since 2017.

            

            the original emphasis was on new space private commercial ventures,
            but it turned out that as of 2017 most of these had yet to actually
            fly anything, so most of the rockets that actually worked were the
            older government-sponsored models. since then an increasing
            number of the private ventures have made successful flights, and
            itâs now starting to become what iâd originally envisioned. but
            there are still a lot of companies which are hoping and struggling
            with little chance of ever making any profit, as the industry tends
            to attract people who, like that guy i met, have big dreams of being
            disruptive innovators but lack sufficient appreciation of how
            difficult flying to space really is. read it all here:
            rockets of today.

            

            each rocketâs page now has a comments section where you can add your
            thoughts. 

            






            i play the dilettante in a lot of areas here, but there is one field
            where i have true professional expertise, and that is software
            development. but that doesnât mean that i donât goof around
            with programming sometimes as if i were still an amateur.

            

            i have coded in a lot of different languages and operating systems
            over the years... assembly language on an ancient ibm mainframe,
            fortran on a bizarre 36-bit honeywell, snobol on a dec-20,
            rexx on an amiga... i even learned teco once. (ah, the
            memories. will anyone wax nostalgic someday about good old
            .net?) maybe i should learn rust next.

            

            but the very first âlargeâ coding project i cut my teeth on was
            a text adventure game co-written with a friend... and as of 2023,
            that game is back, and runs in your browser through the magic of
            wasm! here it is â the game of
            lugi! it was a silly game, but i put
            a lot of myself into it.

            

            another game playable online is this creative-writing thing which we
            used to play online on the b-movie message board. i converted the
            format from forum threads to a database app. if you like thinking
            of fun ideas for nonexistent movies, hereâs an outlet for some fun
            creativity: the movie pitch game!


            back in those good old days of the 20th century, i also wrote a
            bunch of freeware and shareware for the amiga. the good bits are on
            this page: amiga software by paul
            kienitz, where anyone who still uses one of those can download
            any or all of it, including source code. it includes amiga versions
            of the info-zip
            groupâs zip and unzip
            tools, since i was a contributor to that group, and maintained the
            amiga port, along with contributing to the common code. my most
            popular amiga program was q-blue,
            which was shareware but is now free. a few of these amiga projects
            have recently been revived to fix old issues, and migrated to github for
            preservation.

            

            lately iâve stuck a small toe back into the open source world. my
            first little project on github was not legacy code, but
            a
            javascript library called spare, which
            is a very easy way to add ajax to your website content without
            requiring any serverside support. itâs used on my other site,
            cape jeer. this is still
            evolving as i broaden capabilities and respond to the changing browser
            ecosystem.

            






            iâve been drawn to nature photography since i got my first camera at
            somewhere around age eight, and by now, i think i might be starting
            to get kind of good at it. my original
            online gallery has pictures spanning the years i shot with film
            â basically, the last quarter of the twentieth century. this
            gallery has not been updated since 2002.

            

            of these older photographs, the ones that have generated the most
            public interest are those of the
            oakland hills fire of 1991. i have sometimes granted
            reproduction rights for some of the images from this series at
            no cost. higher resolution scans are available. if
            interested, write.

            

            i havenât yet made a gallery of newer dslr pictures. but hereâs
            something: lately iâve concentrated mostly on birds, often not even
            bringing any wide angle lens when i go out, and i have started
            to turn more and more into something like a birder. and what
            iâve made of that is a page that lists all the
            species iâve seen and all the local species i expect to see by
            taxonomy, with links to pictures on those kinds of birds that
            i have managed to photograph so far. so some of the shots are
            blurry messes, because that was the best i could do with a less
            commonly seen bird.

            

            gear: my earlier film shooting was done with a classic k1000, then i
            got a beater oly om-2 which i used throughout the nineties. i
            finally got a dslr in 2007 â a pentax k10d. i now have a pentax
            k-3 with five lenses, including a 300mm f/4 and 1.4x teleconverter
            for birds. i also got a discounted pentax q. mounting
            that to the 300mm on a tripod gives really serious reach, but
            with a picture quality which is pretty much only suitable for
            video. if the pentax gear wears out, iâm now very unsure of
            what system to put any further money into. kind of wish iâd
            gone with my second choice, nikon.

            

            during the previous decade i put together, but did not publicize,
            a compendium of what i knew about all the modern lenses made for
            the pentax k-mount. i wouldnât put a ton of stock in it as
            a resource, but here it is for
            anyone who might find some value in it.

            

            â oh, that aurora shot you canât get back
            to? here. and
            here are
            three
others.

            






            when among fellow fans of cheesy crap cinema at places like
            the
            b-movie message board, one thing many of us would do is write
            reviews to share with each other. here
            are some of mine, covering some unforgettable film treasures
            such as richard kellyâs southland tales or the mexican classic
            santo vs the
            martians. and i occasionally slip in a classy indie
            film or even an a picture, but those are the exception.

            

            many people in this space create their own movie review
            websites. (my personal favorite of the bunch is
            and
            you call yourself a scientist!?, in which real life scientist
            lyz kingsley looks at movies containing mad science.) i
            eventually made my own... and to make it practical i decided to
            specialize. so i focused it on a topic which at that time
            had a lot of marginal and dubious specimens in it: superhero
            movies. i had no idea that in the decade to come, they would
            overwhelm the summer blockbuster scene, and even less that by
            doing so they would actually raise the average quality of such
            blockbusters by a significant amount. by 2016, as the mcu
            became the most talked-about subject in the movie industry,
            i was losing interest in the whole topic, and gradually stopped
            writing new reviews, even for movies i had seen. but i did
            review a hundred movies, good and bad, and they can all be found
            at my other website: cape
            jeer. which now supports comments for readers who have
            something to say about a reviewed film.

            

            iâm glad to say i did find some real stinkers in there... but you
            may wonder why someone put that much time into such a silly-ass
            project. honestly, i wonder myself.

            

            at some point, a couple of film promoters started sending me
            screener discs for review. but these werenât for superhero
            adventures, or for enjoyable cheese... it was mostly for
            documentaries. a lot of them had to do with topical issues
            current at the time, so i collected the reviews on a page for
            current events movies.

            




            sorry, thatâs not me â the well known fiddle player is
            a
            different paul kienitz who lives in wisconsin. i have been known to pick
            a mandolin from time to time, and write a tune or two, but i wouldnât pass myself
            off as a legit musician in any genre.
        






            i was thinking about making a page to organize all the outdated
            detritus that used to occupy this home page, but then i stumbled
            on a better option: a preserved copy of this page as it was
            twenty years ago, back when the domain was gning.org, before it
            was redesigned to be less garish and facetious. after fixing
            some internal urls, most of it is working just as it did then,
            except that there are many external links which are no longer
            valid. here it is, in all its web-1.0 glory:
            the twentieth anniversary edition!


            the most popular and widely read page there, for some reason, is
            48 reasons not to get a boob
            job. the most entertaining are probably these quizzes:

            
which science fiction writer are you?
which classical composer are you?
which house paint are you?
which office supply are you?
are you a republican?


            that first quiz ended up being passed around among actual science
            fiction writers.

            
            you may notice that the distinctive font i use for the banner and
            topics is already present in that old page, though only within a single
            image. this page explains where
            it came from and how i finally made a proper .otf version of it.
