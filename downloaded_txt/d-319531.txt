what is insider trading? 



			many investors have heard the term insider trading and usually associate it with illegal conduct. 
			in fact, however, the term  includes both legal and illegal conduct. the legal version is when corporate insiders (officers, directors, and beneficiary owners)  buy and sell stock in their own companies. when corporate insiders trade in their own securities, they must report their trades to the sec. 
			

			illegal insider trading generally refers to insider buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in possession of material, nonpublic information about the security. insider trading violations may also include "tipping" such information, securities trading by the person "tipped," and securities trading by those who misappropriate such information. see insider trading definition for more details.

insider buying activities remain muted since the stock market recovery in march of 2009. 
	          in august of 2011, however, the market was down 20% and insiders once again rushed into the market to buy shares. 

 


      conclusion:
in this study, we have shown that insider trading exhibits a seasonal pattern.  
            in the absence of stock market turmoil, more insiders will buy their company stocks in may, august, and november than in other months of the year. the relationship between insider trading activities and the stock market can be revealed when the trading activities are scaled to the seasonal patterns. we have shown that more insider buyers will come out and buy shares when the stock market comes down. 
            in fact, it is shown above that the more the market drops, the more insider buyers it attracts. 


 


why monitor insider trading? 



			never before has monitoring insider trading become so easy. insiders (corporate officers, directors, and beneficiary owners) are now required to report to
			the securities and exchange commission (sec) within two business days after they trade stocks of their own companies.
			we report this vital insider buying and selling  information to the public in  daily, weekly, monthly, and real-time reports.
			
	 insider trading analysis guru george muzea wrote a book called
			the vital few vs the trivial many: invest with the insiders, not the masses. 
			 (see link in page insider trading resources).
			he called corporate insiders "the vital few" and investor masses "the trivial many".
			by following the vital few, he made big profits in the stock market for himself and for his corporate clients.
			most insiders including ceos, cfos make a living on a moderate salary 
			(see management salary). 
			sale stock at a profit is an important source of income for many of them. 
			
 note that insider stock trading activity should not be used as a simple technical indicator when deciding to buy or sell  a stock.
			however, insider buying and selling activity is a good starting point to further investigate a company,
			either by analyzing the fundamental data of the company or by studying other
			insider   trading related matters such as the stock trading history of the insider,
			the type of insider (officer or beneficiary owner) etc.
