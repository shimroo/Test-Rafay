	 a new edition of the bottomless bottle of beer by gypsy scholar is now published!
    


the newly redacted, and now richly illustrated novella, the bottomless bottle of
beer, has finally arrived. the author, jeffery hodges, has further enriched the
novella’s literary style, while noted illustrator terrance lindell has provided
some 50 illustrations to enhance the story’s atmosphere. a further somewhat
gothic touch is provided by the young (future) cartoonist en-uk hwang, who
offers the novella’s front cover as a rather creepy window into the realm of uncanny darkness. the tale told is a faustian one, that of trading one’s soul
for some aspect of the infinite, usually knowledge, but in this case beer, lots
and lots of beer. all you can drink. in fact, more than you can drink. you want
to stop. but stopping’s not so simple when there’s a contract involved. it’s
time to “lawyer up.” but can a human lawyer be found who can face off against a
demon lawyer? buy the book and find out what happens.you’ll also be in for
a wild ride along the way!more details are available at amazon books.

	 another analysis
    


 an english professor writing an hour-long comment on hi ren offers helpful insights on the various personalities that pop up to critique each other's views. (sorry that this is so badly written; short of time)i noticed during ren's monologue, near the bottom of his summing up of his realization that life is not an endless battle between good and evil, but an eternal dance, a never-ending swinging of a pendulum from dark to light and light to dark, and as he spoke these words, his head and shoulders swayed from the light of a lamp, through the dark that followed, then back through the lamplight of the lamp, then the darkness, then light, darkness, light, darkness, and so on and on . . .jeffery hodgesps i hope this is a link to the other professor's literary analysis:what everyone has missed in "hi ren": a literary analysis - youtube

	 ren speaks about his song hi-ren
    


https://renmakesmusic.lnk.to/hirenthe musician ren talks about his song:
creating this song wasn't easy, but i'm so proud of how it turned out. 

want to say a big thank you for everyones support over the years. during the years trapped inside with chronic health problems the main thing that kept me going was a belief that one day i would come out the other side, and be able to achieve success through music. i don’t have a label, and sometimes pushing these things as hard as i want becomes a massive challenge, and i find myself frustrated that there aren’t enough hours in the day to push it as far as i want to. i would love to ask a favour to anyone who has ever enjoyed my music over the years, and it will only take a few minutes of your day.it would  mean the world to me if you shared ‘hi ren’ as much as you can, over social media platforms, with friends, over email. together, and with your help i can hopefully reach people all over the world, and get one step closer to the dream i always had! thank you so much for the support so far!

ren

 i wrote this religious poem about a month ago.no one feels deathno one feels death, but jesus,who reckons my every stroke,the forty minus oneof which the rabbis spoke.no one seeks death, but jesus,who counters every blowand bears our every sorrowbecause he loves us so.but how in the hell do we know? (this query is not part of the poem.)

	 it knocked some sense into this hee-yar boy's haid!
    


about a week ago, i fell out of bed. i don't know i did it, but the feat must have been a magnificent acrobatic one, for i met the floor in a full frontal position -- as though i'd been dropped from heaven face-first into the arms a lovely lass, except that i'd hit the floor instead. my wife jumped out of bed in alarm. i groaned, "that really hurt." i had a bump on  my head and something like a scratch on the bump and stuff that felt like blood on the scratch, and something like a crust forming on the blood. kind of like that old song that starts out with a hole in the bottom of the sea. from there, it's to infinity, and beyond!and oddly enough, for about week from that accident, my parkinson's symptoms were gone!i called it "my little miracle."but it went away."thanks a lot, god. the lord giveth, and the lord taketh away. indian-giver be the name of the lord."

	 a klein word on christianity
    


the writer ezra klein offers an essay on christianity in the nyt international on april 3rd, 2022:"christianity . . . is a religion that insists on the dignity of all people and centers the poor and the marginalized. . . . what i, as an outsider to christianity, have always found most beautiful about it is how strange it is. here is a worldview built on a foundation of universal sin and insufficiency, an equality that bleeds out of the recognition that we are all broken, rather than that we must all be great. i've always envied the practice of confession, not least for its recognition that there will always be more to confess and so there must always be more opportunities to be forgiven."

quite a confession for a confessing jew to make of christianity's institution of confession.

	 fictionalism
    


scott herschovitz wrote in a recent nyt issue (may 3, 2022) of an interesting question posed by his four-year-old son: "is god real?"his father turned the question back on the lad:
"what do you think?"he replied: "i think that for real god is pretend and for pretend god is real."
his father asks for explanation, and the son says: "god isn't real, but when we pretend, he is."this is called "fictionalism," herschovitz tells us (assuming that he has understood his son), and it means that the statement "dumbledore teaches at hogwarts" is true because in that fictional world, dumbledore does teach at hogwarts.similarly, the statement "i teach at harvard" is true because in my fictional world, i do teach at harvard. so from now on, i'll introduce myself as follows: "pleased to meet you. i'm jeffery hodges, and i'm a harvard professor."the onus is on them to realize that i'm speaking of the fictional world, a world in which i excel in many fields.

	 wittgenstein: silence and confession
    


the nyt international edition recently (april 13, 2022) ran a somewhat garbled piece (cf. paragraph eight) on ludwig wittgenstein, who experienced his writing as a burden, and "sexuality as a burden, too, writing "frankly (and frequently) about his masturbation (or lack thereof), an activity he associated with not getting enough exercise. sometimes commentary on work and sex would run together: "--will i find the redemptive thought? will it come to me??!!--yesterday & today i masturbated."elsewhere, wittegenstein said, "whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.i suggest: "whereof one need not speak, thereof ought one adopt the prudence of silence."

	 divide and put difference (revision):
    


the verb bāḏal (בָּדַל, pronunciation, baw-dal') occurs in both (baw-dal') genesis 1:4 and leviticus 10:10.genesis 1:4. and god saw the light, that it was good: and god divided (בָּדַל) the light from the darkness.

leviticus 10:10.  and that ye may put difference (וּֽלֲהַבְדִּיל) (בְדִּיל)between holy (קֹדֶשׁ) and common (חֹל), and 

between impure (טָמֵא) and pure (טָהוֹר);

regular readers here at gypsy scholar will be familiar with my position that leviticus 10:10 is an example of semitic parallelism and literary chiasm combined, something like an "x" inscribed within a rectangle (or square).

note the context given in genesis 1:1-3, namely, that god's initial act was to create the heavens and the  earth. the earth at this point was formless and empty, a very odd statement, hard to grasp. also, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the spirit of god was hovering over the waters.

this is the state of things at the initial moment of creation. the text merely describes a moment of anticipation. nothing of substance has yet happened. at most, there is the slight trembling motion of hovering. god then acts to divide the light from the darkness. why did he do this first? was the darkness considered 'bad'? apparently. the light was good. the darkness was not. these two must first be divided. we can post here:heavens/earthlight/darkness

i'm making a scholarly inference here that these two opposing pairs reveal the correct way for arranging creation.

about me

name:  horace jeffery hodges 
location:  seoul, south korea 
i am a retired professor. i last taught at ewha womans university, mostly composition, research writing, and cultural issues, but also the occasional graduate seminar on gnosticism and johannine theology and the occasional undergraduate course on european history.

my doctorate is in history (u.c. berkeley), with emphasis on religion and science. my thesis is on john's gospel and gnosticism.

i'm also an award-winning writer, and i recommend my novella, the bottomless bottle of beer,  to anyone interested. 

i'm originally from the arkansas ozarks, but my academic career -- funded through doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships (e.g., fulbright, naumann, lady davis) -- has taken me through texas, california, switzerland, germany, australia, and israel and has landed me in seoul, south korea. i've also traveled to mexico, visited much of europe, including moscow, and touched down briefly in a few east asian countries.

hence: "gypsy scholar."
