                hello and welcome to teaching
                heart.  
                if you are looking for teaching ideas,
                printables, inspiration, links, lessons, units,
                activity sheets, and so much more - you are at
                the right place...  i have designed this
                site as a learning tool for myself and as a
                helping tool for other teachers who love teaching
                children as much as i do. i am very grateful to
                the sharing and caring teachers i have met
                online. i hope this site gives back to all
                sharing teachers with a teaching heart.
enjoy!

proud to be a #1
