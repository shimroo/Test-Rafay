                  i was staying at a local hotel for nearly a week with my son and tried many local restaurants.  this one was by our favorite.  we ended up eating there multiple times,  lunch and dinner.  the menu is extensive and everything was great.  the food was good,  always came out hot and the price is great.  they have daily lunch specials which are a really good deal and taste great.  it looks more like a sports bar than a restaurant,  but trust me,  the food is great herereview by - yelp
