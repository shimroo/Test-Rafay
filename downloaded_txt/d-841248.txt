lions share is known for 

                  bringing hollywood to the potomac, based on president & 

                  founder andrea sims' ability to leverage a diversified and 

                  extensive professional and personal network to draw "a-list," 

                  hollywood celebrities to washington, dc area events. she 

                  further brings exponential value to her clients by 

                  strategically attracting national and international network 

                  and syndicated media coverage. 
among our key areas of 

                  expertise are the following:




                  defining, negotiating, publicizing, and implementing 

                  fundraising events to generate major income acquisition 

                  for corporate and non-profit entities, while providing 

                  attendees five-star event experiences.




                  developing, publicizing, and producing results through pr, media 
					coverage, and digital marketing resulting in client 

                  satisfaction and new exciting careers.  we are the 
					experts!  




                  creating, publicizing, and producing high-profile film, 

                  television, art, and cuisine festivals. 


in andrea sims' own words, 

                  lions share helps its clients with everything from soup to 

                  nuts!" we partner with many clients on all aspects of their 

                  events from coordinating logistics to securing participation 

                  by celebrities and dignitaries and attracting local, national, 

                  and international media.
on the other hand, a client 

                  may already have an event planning partner, but may need to 

                  get the right participants  such as celebrities, 

                  industry-specific leaders, or sponsors - on board. in this 

                  instance, lions share is the perfect addition to the existing 

                  partnership. 
similarly, if you need 

                  someone to generate media interest exposure, lions share can 

                  work that piece of the puzzle to ensure that your event is 

                  appropriately and optimally publicized.

					are a for-profit company, non-profit organization, 
					or a new book author/artist just starting out and needing 
					representation...we can help you!
