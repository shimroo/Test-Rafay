learn why pvc is the right choice for your roof select a benefit to learn moreflexibilitya highly flexible composition makes pvc well suited for complex roofs with curves and contours, allowing for easier installation and protecting areas vulnerable to water intrusion and wind uplift.chemical resistance pvc provides exceptional resistance to chemical attack, animal fats and grease. it is also resistant to most common corroding agents including inorganic acids, alkalis and salts, including those a roof might encounter from acid rain, bird droppings, tree sap and industrial pollutants. weldability heat-weldable seams provide greater seam strength compared with taped seams, for long-term leak protection. the weldability of our proprietary duro-last formulation makes them the easiest membranes to weld — with near-perfect seaming quality — greatly reducing callbacks and long-term maintenance challenges. energy efficiency the highly reflective and emissive nature of white pvc membranes saves energy in all climates, reducing both cooling costs and the urban heat island effect. high roi pvc roofs provide excellent return on your investment with long-term performance, lower energy costs and minimal maintenance. they are durable and serviceable, with a longer lifespan than roofs made of other materials. with their lightweight composition, they can often be installed over an existing roof without requiring tear-off. weather resistance pvc delivers excellent long-term weathering and uv resistance. duro-last pvc membranes stand up to ponding water and continually wet or damp conditions. all duro-last pvc roofing membranes are ul and fm approved and meet or exceed major national wind code requirements, as well as florida, miami-dade and other required regional approvals throughout the united states and canada.   fire resistance pvc is inherently fire resistant. it can self-extinguish and resist the spread of flame. even when the flame source remains applied to the assembly, our specially formulated duro-last pvc membranes exhibit enhanced fire protection when tested in accordance with astm class a e108.  














pvc + peace of mind 



polyvinyl chloride (pvc) is an excellent choice as a single-ply roofing membrane material for flat or low-sloped roof surfaces. pvc roofing systems are typically composed of two layers of pvc film and a fabric scrim that provides strength and durability. we stand firmly behind the superiority and proven performance of pvc roofing and have taken that a step further, committing to deliver the “world’s best roof®”.duro‑last’s proprietary pvc formulation provides exceptional flexibility, reflectivity, premium uv resistance and flame retardance. our technologically advanced pvc extruder allows us to manufacture pvc membranes to our exacting standards and our unique custom-fabrication process enables us to produce every roof to precise specifications. and our anti-wicking scrim is the strongest reinforcement scrim available in the market. we knit it in-house with a density of either 18 by 14, 18 by 9 or 9 by 9 polyester threads per inch, providing superior resistance to punctures and tears.every aspect of our manufacturing process is calibrated to produce world-class pvc roofing membranes designed for lasting performance and peace of mind.
