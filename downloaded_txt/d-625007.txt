color, motion, texture and material all play a role in the uplifting and nostalgic emotional power of david rosenberg’s art. he routinely bridges abstraction with figuration, conceptualization with repurposing. through these creations he elevates the audiences’ mood while also leading them down a winding path to ask themselves what the artist says about the past, present and future.
