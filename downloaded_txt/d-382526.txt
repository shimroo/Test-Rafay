create your own customized home search for las vegas






as the internet gets more sophisticated, online consumers are getting much more focused in their search for property. but many sites don't include customized links to the features that are most important to home buyers, and only allow them to do a search by generic criteria like size, price range or city.

that's why we have created customized search links for the las vegas real estate market on our site for some of the most popularly requested amenities like rv/boat parking, homes with casitas or guest houses, homes with pools, homes in specific neighborhoods and single story ranch style homes. in addition, our dynamic search engine allows visitors to search by multiple school zones, for foreclosures or short sales, in gated communities, by age, number of garages, etc.

check out just a few of our customized searches below!


las vegas homes with pools
las vegas homes with casitas
las vegas homes with rv parking
las vegas single story homes 
las vegas homes by zip codes 
las vegas luxury homes


you can also define your search criteria in great detail by going to http://www.greatlasvegashomes.com/idx/. 



in addition, there are some amenities that are not available in the public online databases that can only be set up by real estate agents in the official las vegas mls system. if you want a specialized search for unique needs like handicap accessibility, horse properties, downstairs master bedrooms, basements, etc., please feel free to reach out to us and we will personally look up properties for you and send them to your email with all available photos.



you can either email us at sold@greatlasvegashomes.com or call 702-985-7654. we have more than 30 years of experience in the local las vegas market, and are happy to assist you to find the perfect property!

how can multigenerational buyers find homes with casitas online?






 

statistics show that today 20% to 25% of american families are caring for an aging parent or have an adult child living with them. that's up about 60% from 1990's statistics.

 

especially in the vegas valley, with its rapidly growing retirement population, requirements for a home with a casita are becoming more and more frequent. so las vegas new home developers are building all new floor plans with casitas, guest houses or dual master options to accommodate this burgeoning housing trend.

 

the problem: more than 80% of buyers use the internet to browse prospective properties. but it can be hard to search by casitas or guest houses online to find the right floor plan. that's why we've set up dedicated pages on our web site to help people purchasing homes in las vegas or henderson, nevada locate specific properties with casitas or guest houses.

 

to view all the resale homes in the las vegas valley offering casitas or guest houses, go to:

 

las vegas homes with casitas 

 

as of today, there are 205 homes on the market with casitas in a variety of price ranges from $120k to $30m. (the $30m property is wayne newton's former ranch. check it out - it's fun just to view the photos!)


if you know what area you want to live in, we also have resale homes with casitas listed by neighborhood for the 18 communities that most often have that option available, including anthem, summerlin, centennial hills, rhodes ranch, mountains edge, tuscany village and lake las vegas. 

 

if you are more interested in a brand new home with a casita, just give us a call at 702-985-7654 or email sold@greatlasvegashomes.com and we can send you all the new homes in your price range along with the floor plans. there are 22 new home floor plans currently available with casita options, ranging from $295k to $3m.

 

we also have special customized searches on our site for other frequent requests, including: homes with rv parking, one story ranch style homes, homes with pools, homes by school zone and homes by zip code. to find your dream home with all the amenities you want, go to:

 

customized las vegas home searches

 

we hope you find these customized searches helpful, and we look forward to helping all our clients with special needs find just the right home for their families!

post your local las vegas business on our site! 




we have started a new section on our web site for local las
vegas, henderson, north las vegas and boulder city businesses! 



as a local
business owner, we would be pleased to post an "about us" page for
your business or service on our site to be used as a permanent resource for
our current customers and future home buyers and sellers who live in the valley. (we are just getting started with this,
but we hope to grow it into a large informative directory by the end of the
year.)



just write a short "about us" article and send it
to us along with the url of your web site. 
(i will use a screen shot of your site as the photo for your page unless
you care to provide your own photo.) here is a page we posted for raysco carpet
cleaners to use as an example:



http://www.greatlasvegashomes.com/carpet-cleaning.php



this is free advertising for your business! all we ask in
return is that you post a search button on the homepage of your
web site and link it to the las vegas mls search at: 



http://www.greatlasvegashomes.com/idx/.  









it is our hope is that this mutual promotional exchange will bring
both of us more business in the future and become a go to source for residents of the las vegas valley!

contact diann@greatlasvegashomes.com for more details.
