empathy  |  education  |  experience



the pillars of our practice








            empathy
          









we know you! this practice has focused on patients with tm joint pathology and it’s sequelae for decades. for this reason, we understand the frustration and hopelessness many individuals feel. we are here to listen and to help. dr. shah had reconstructive facial surgery as a college student. this has uniquely positioned him as an ally for patients on their road to recovery.








            education
          









proper patient care relies on proper medical, dental and surgical training. dr. shah’s comprehensive formal education allows a global approach to diagnosis and treatment. continuing education and teaching has always been a hallmark of this practice. dr. shah follows in this tradition by lecturing, hosting teaching seminars, writing and doing research.








            experience
          









all we treat is tm joint pathology and it’s sequelae. being “hyper-specialized” has allowed dr. shah to refine diagnostic and surgical techniques. ultimately, this decreases complications and improves results. the more one practices the better one gets.


















collaboration



for dr. brian shah, collaboration with a patient’s entire medical team is a cornerstone of delivering exceptional care. whether working alongside primary care physicians, dentists, orthodontists, neurologists, or ent specialists, dr. shah emphasizes the importance of a coordinated approach to treatment. by integrating insights and expertise from various healthcare professionals, dr. shah ensures that each aspect of a patient’s health is considered, leading to more comprehensive and effective outcomes. this multidisciplinary collaboration not only enhances the precision of his surgical interventions but also fosters a holistic approach to patient care, ultimately contributing to better overall results and improved patient satisfaction.
