“i have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. accident has cast them amid certain surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not. they are strangers in their birthplace. sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he feels he mysteriously belongs. here is the home he sought, and he will settle among scenes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth. here at last he finds rest.” – w. somerset maugham the moon and sixpence
