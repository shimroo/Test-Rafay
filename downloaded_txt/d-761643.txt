minute of support for baltimore yearly meeting (bym) & other plaintiffs in lawsuit against the department of homeland security (dhs)sandy spring monthly meeting of the religious society of friends, a member of baltimore yearly meeting, is united in offering its support to bym and other quaker organizations that have filed a legal challenge to the new federal policy that would reverse long standing legal protections and allow federal agents to enter into houses of worship and other “sensitive locations,” such as schools and hospitals, to enforce federal immigration laws. this new federal policy violates quakers' deeply held beliefs in "that of god" within all people and freedom for all people to gather in worship, as protected by the first amendment of the u.s. constitution. sandy spring meeting hereby authorizes its clerks (in consultation with trustees) to take other steps, such as joining in the lawsuit as a named plaintiff or preparing a friend of the court brief in support of the lawsuit, as way opens.
