about taxback


every year, thousands of people overpay tax on their earnings. a fear of the ‘taxman’ has left millions of euros of overpaid tax unclaimed – money that belongs back in workers’ pockets. we’re on a mission to help workers like you to understand your financial entitlements so you can stay tax compliant and still avail of every benefit you’re owed, no matter where you are in the world.
there are several reasons why you may be due a tax refund,  including if you worked abroad, were made redundant or only worked part of the tax year. speak to a member of our tax team today and find out just how much you could be owed!
