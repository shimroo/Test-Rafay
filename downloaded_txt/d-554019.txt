                                  our captain delray and first mate edwin were stellar. they made our trip outstanding. delray is very knowledgeable and took lots of time letting everyone touch feed and even kiss the rays. he and edwin  found starfish for everyone to see and explained all about both animals the trip was so much fun. we saw other guide groups at both sites and they did not have half the experience we had. captain marvin’s is the best choice for sure

                                  this was quite an adventure. we were able to see and hold the starfish. i've never experienced that before. learning the proper way to hold them was quite interesting. i didn't want to go snorkling because i was uncomfortable in the water as it got darker.

                                  wonderful tour - would highly recommend. we went on the sting ray city/starfish point tour that left early in the am. our guides were excellent - extremely helpful, attentive, patient and invested in making sure we all had a great time. i hope i have their names right because they deserve shout outs - captain james, jaylen and romero. one of the people in my group is not a swimmer and we told the team and they kept an eye out. our total group was small - i think probably around 13 or 14 or so - so the guide to guest ratio was great. we saw a ton of stingrays and fed them and took many videos and photos (although romero took photos too which we had the option of purchasing at the end of the tour. glad we did - they were excellent photos). we were so happy we thought of going on another tour with capt. marvin’s the next day but ran out of time. next time!

                                  we had a fantastic time with captain marvin’s teams when we went to see stingray city with 2 snorkel stops. it was a truly unforgettable experience. we got to touch, hold, kiss, and feed the stingrays which was amazing! the snorkeling was really fun as well seeing a lot of fish, a sea turtle, stingray, and an eel. richard, kevin, and polo were absolutely wonderful guides for our trip- helpful, polite, and informative. we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this company to anyone.

                                  our captain and crew were the best. the captain said his name was surgeree (sp - he went by sugar bear). they did their best to keep the trip light and fun! the captain got in the water withe the lone child on board to make sure he was safe and d to let the parents snorkle if they wanted to.while snorkeling we saw many fish, a couple of stingrays (outside of "stingray city") as well as a turtle and much vibrant coral. i highly recommend this excursion in the cayman islands!

our crew will dive for conch in season and you are welcome to help them. they will even clean up some shells so each family unit who wishes can take one back home with them (supply limited). the rest of the year, you will have extra snorkeling (or starfish) stop instead of the conch dive.

do i need to know how to swim? it is recommended that you know how to swim if you intend to do any snorkeling. we have a lifebuoy that you may use to hang on to during the snorkel stops so you can see the fish and coral if you are not comfortable swimming.
how deep is the water? the water at the stingray city sandbar is 3-4 feet deep. we anchor the boat nearby in about 5-6 feet of water so we don't run it aground, and you then make your way over to the shallower area where you will stand in the sand while the stingrays swim around you. the snorkel stops are in 8-10 feet of water.
are there changing rooms at stingray city? we recommend that you wear your swimsuit under a cover-up or shorts/t-shirt as the only place to change clothes at stingray city is in the head on the boat.
do you offer travel agent discounts? we offer card-carrying travel agents a discount on our tours. please let us know when you are making a reservation, and bring your iata card with you for check-in.
what is the maximum number of people allowed on your tours? we have several boats ranging from 34-60 feet in length, with capacities from 20-45 people. the average number of people on a tour is 25. 
how early can we make a reservation? you may make your reservation at any time now for a future date; during the busy season (november to may) we urge you to make your reservation at least two weeks in advance as trips tend to fill up.
do you offer scuba diving? no, we do not do any scuba diving but we recommend divetech locally (www.divetech.com).
do you offer fishing trips that you can pay per person rather than chartering the boat? no, we do not offer shared fishing charters.
do you have any recommendations for a family with limited snorkeling experience? we strongly recommend that you know how to swim before taking a snorkeling trip, but our crew are experienced at teaching beginners how to snorkel. just ask them when you get to the boat.
do you pay when you book or when you arrive? if you book online, you will be charged upon completion of your reservation. if you book by phone or in person, you will be charged when you check in with us on the day of your tour. however, we will need a credit card to hold your reservation either way.
what is your cancellation policy? if your cruise ship cannot stop here on its scheduled day, or arrives too late for you to take our tour, you will not be charged. if you need to cancel your reservation for personal reasons, please do so at least 72 hours in advance to avoid being charged. if your ship arrives on time and you do not show up for your tour, you will be charged. if the weather is such that our captain cancels our boat trip, you will not be charged, but we do not cancel for rain only.
how long is the tour? we have two-stop (2.5 to 2.75 hours), three-stop (3 hours) and beach lunch (5 hours) tours. these times are dock-to-dock; add 15-20 minutes for transportation each way.
where would we book this excursion? you may book online by filling out the reservation form on our web site, or you may phone our office using one of the phone numbers on our 'contact' page.
is there a better time of day to see the stingrays? the stingrays are hungry morning, noon and night. the ones who have eaten in the morning will go off to their afternoon hangout, and others will take their place throughout the day.
is there a season for fishing? what's the best month to catch fish? fishing is great in cayman year-round.
how much time do we get to spend at each stop on the stingray/snorkel tour? the stingray, starfish and snorkeling tour is approximately 40 min per stop giving you a bit more time per stop.
can we stay on the boat? yes, you may stay on the boat at any of the stops.
do you offer life jackets for kids? we provide snorkel vests and life jackets for everyone ages 4 and over. if you are bringing children under age 4 with you, please bring a flotation device for them.
how far is the pier from your location? our private dock is about a 4-minute drive from our main location on seven mile beach, and it's about a 15-minute drive from our location across from the cruise ship terminals.
can you accommodate a person in a wheelchair? yes, on most of our tours we are able to accommodate a person in a wheelchair provided it is collapsible.
what happens if our ship is late or doesn't stop in grand cayman due to the weather, etc.? will we get a refund? if your ship arrives too late for your tour with us, or is not able to stop at all, you will not be charged. however, in most cases, we will have been made aware in advance that your ship will be arriving late, and we will do our best to make adjustments to the timing so that you can still take your tour with us. please check in at our office in the waterfront centre as soon as you are able to get off the ship to see what we have been able to arrange for you. if you have booked through a tour agency and have paid them in advance, you will need to deal with them directly to receive a refund.
