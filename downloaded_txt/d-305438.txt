i've made some corrections to the site code; some minor functions are still missing, but as of this update, the site seems to be working more or less as it should, and i'll start concentrating on adding more content.
also: it turns out i had forgotten to include the file responsible for saving portfolio image ratings. go rate my portfolio images!2016-02-22: portfolioelvisa caricature for caricaturama showdown 30002015-04-24: journali bought some comics!i received a package today! for the first time in a long while, i've ordered comics from yesasia and amazon, including åsa ekström's new book about culture clashes and misadventures in japan. now all i need to do is to learn these stupid languages.2014-12-23: site newssite redesigni decided to switch to a new layout before everything was ready, partly to force myself to finally get it done, and partly to stress myself out for no good reason. come back in a week or so, and i'll have much more content up. you should probably be celebrating christmas now anyway.2014-04-26: portfolioexample layoutan unused layout for a project2014-04-26: portfolioexample layout 2an unused layout for a project2014-03-18: portfoliojudi dencha caricature for caricaturama showdown 30002013-11-01: portfoliocrow girl2013-05-23: portfoliopig robotmy friend anna likes pigs and robots.2012-12-01: portfolionothing personalcards for the board game nothing personal2012-11-01: portfoliobig mary2012-09-28: portfoliobette davisa caricature for caricaturama showdown 3000

2024-10-11: link blogcan astrologers truly gain insights about people from entire astrological charts?“we tested and analyzed the ability of 152 astrologers to accurately match people to their natal charts.the 152 astrologers largely believed that they were capable of doing this task with accuracy well above chance.

whereas a random guesser would, on average, only correctly answer 2.4 questions out of 12, astrologers with the least experience thought they had correctly answered 5 charts after completing the study tasks, and those with the most astrology expertise believed they had gotten 10 right. 
despite their high-degree of confidence in their performance, astrologers as a group performed no better than chance - that is, their distribution of results closely resembled what you'd see if they had all been guessing at random, and the number of charts they matched correctly, on average, was not statistically significantly different than random guessing either. 

not a single astrologer got more than 5 out of 12 answers correct - even though, after completing the task, more than half of astrologers believed they had gotten more than 5 answers correct. 


more experience with astrology had no statistically significant association with better performance, and the astrologers with the most experience didn't do any better than the rest. 


despite astrologers' belief that they were performing well on the task, there was little agreement among astrologers about which natal chart belonged to each study subject.
