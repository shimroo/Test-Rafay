february 2025





the last time hollins university took part in a horse show jordan atwell-purcell (on right) won her intermediate over fences class at the 
                         holiday tournament of champions invitational in blacksburg, virginia on december 7th.  head coach sherri west (on left) and the rest of the hollins team will be right back at virginia 
                         tech's alphin-stuart livestock arena for a pair of zone 4, region 2 hunter seat shows over the february 15/16 weekend.  the defending region 2 champion trails a university of 
                         lynchburg team that won all four fall shows but is only 22 points ahead with five shows still to go.  while zone 4, region 2 is starting back up many ihsa regions are concluding their 
                         regular seasons this weekend.  
                    



in 2024-25 the ihsa is made up of 37 geographic regions.  over the february 14/15/16 weekend only ten of the 37 regions do not have some kind of show be it english or western.  this is 
                         likely the busiest weekend of the entire ihsa season, with close team races in many places ultimately being decided.  among those known to us included hunter seat team races in zone 4, 
                         region 4; zone 5, region 3 and zone 6, region 2 where the top teams hold no more than a ten point lead on at least one school hoping for an eleventh hour rally.
