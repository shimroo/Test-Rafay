        celebrating thirty years | 1995–2025 
      






























ty herndon has lived a life and career of extreme highs and lows and celebrates a critical milestone in country music as his record-breaking debut single “what mattered most” turns thirty in 2025.between 1995 and 2002, herndon charted 17 singles, including his three number ones and seventeen top 10 hits, such as “i want my goodbye back,” “loved too much,” “a man holding on,” and “hands of a working man.” he topped the charts in 1996 with the single “living in a moment” and again in 1998 with “it must be love.”ty remained relevant and active throughout the next decade, releasing as greatest hits collection as well as the albums "right about now," "lies i told myself" and the grammy-nominated "journey on." 



ty continued to break new ground throughout the next decade, releasing a greatest hits collection, as well as the albums "right about now," "lies i told myself" and the grammy-nominated "journey on." in 2015 he became the first major male country music artist to come out as gay and released the critically acclaimed albums "house on fire" and "got it covered" and launching the annual concert for love & acceptance.ty made a triumphant comeback beginning in 2020 with the release of “orphans of god,” a duet with kristin chenoweth that peaked at number one on the itunes charts. that was quickly followed by the release of jacob and jacob (deluxe edition) in 2022 and 2023 respectively, for the first time bringing his full journey from darkness to light and back again to his music. the album touched on highly personal themes ranging from addiction, recovery, and mental fitness to lost love, self-discovery and personal freedom. 



it spawned the country radio hits “till you get there” and “dents on a chevy,” a duet with terri clark that spent 7 weeks atop the independent country radio charts, becoming the number one independent country single of 2023.grammy-nominated and dove award winning, ty’s voice is stronger than ever, and he’s using it to make a difference. in 2020, he created the foundation for love & acceptance to further his work on behalf of mental health, addiction and trauma recovery, and building a more inclusive country music community.
















from the nineties to now
















“it’s hard to believe that thirty years have flown by since the release of “what mattered most.” it’s an honor to get on stage each night and perform it alongside so many of my hits from then to now. it’s been quite a ride, and i ain’t planning on slowing down anytime soon!”
