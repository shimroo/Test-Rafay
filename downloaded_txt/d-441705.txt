cost-focused design

                significantly cut manufacturing costs through the world's most powerful product simplification
                and "should cost" application.

design for assembly (dfa) software:
one half of the dfma arsenal, dfa is an essential tool utilized by designers and engineers in the product development process. this innovative software focuses on simplifying product structures, directly leading to substantial cost savings by reducing part counts and labor-intensive assembly steps. dfa also accelerates product development time, as it minimizes the need for time-consuming design iterations and extensive prototyping.

design for manufacturing (dfm) software:
dfm, the other essential component of dfma software, generates accurate should-cost estimates for manufactured parts, helps you evaluate supplier quotations, and assists in competitor benchmarking. it provides real-time results based on the significant cost drivers for the manufacturing process, material and part geometry of a proposed design.
