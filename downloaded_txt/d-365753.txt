dear gano entrepreneurs,
a very warm welcome to our global convention celebrating the 28th anniversary of gano excel. firstly, i would like to extend a note of thank you to everyone for becoming a part of this celebration and gracing it with your presence. trust me, all this would not have been possible without all your support. as i reviewed my last addresses before the peak of the pandemic era, it struck me how far we have come during a historic period in which we faced unprecedented disruption that was considered to be the toughest in our history.
what a year 2020 has been and the pandemic has changed the realities of our world where we have all been impacted some way or another. the thing i love most about our members is that, during the difficult times of 2020, all of you never stopped moving forward as a team. this is an achievement worth celebrating.
after going through a tough period, we are joining hands again to celebrate our global convention with a tagline "great as one" representing what is best in the network marketing industry. i thank all of you for your truly monumental effort.at the same time let us pay tribute to some of those who paid the ultimate price for the pandemic and my thoughts and prayers go out to their families and to those worked closely with them. they will always be part of our gano excel family.
over the past years, we have demonstrated our strength as an organization and made it clear that when it comes to gano excel, the whole is greater than some of the parts. i have to admit that our 28 years of journey is not an easy one. but we have come very far indeed and today, we are here  celebrating our 28 years of great business growth and prosperity. and for that, i would like to pay  tribute to all our leaders and members for their continuous support since the early days of our business. without all your support gano excel would not have grown at the pace it did over the last 28 years. the products and corporate initiatives introduced in the past were critical to take the company to a new level of maturity.
the wave of opportunity that lies ahead is still new and exciting. however, the gains can only be reaped if we adapt to the changes as we had done before, and collectively rise to overcome any barriers that could hold us back from achieving our objectives of "bringing health and wealth to every family globally". we will always continue to work hand-in-hand to make gano excel more conducive, innovative and resilient.
i take this opportunity to accord my appreciation for making this global convention a reality. once again, thank you for being here and enjoy your stay in malaysia.
thank you.mr. leow soon sengfounder & president of gano excel
