 satellite technology has been available for many years and is an ideal medium for simultaneously disseminating information to many users, linking remote geographical locations, and providing connectivity to wide coverage areas. via radio transmission, impressive data rates can be obtained using high capacity transponder channels. as the demand from businesses for broadband data services increases, satellite communication is well positioned to address this need. dsl and isdn fulfill much of the demand in a cost-effective manner, but these services are not available throughout all of north america and the world. a small satellite antenna or vsat (very small aperture terminal)can be placed virtually anywhere to provide high-speed connectivity for remote offices, teleworkers and users. satellite dsl and satellite tv are popular choices for today's consumer. proof of their tremendous growth lies in a trend that is literally sweeping across the planet. have you noticed? satellite dishes are dotting the landscape everywhere!


 if you want internet on a yacht for work, pleasure, or actual boating-related information, you are on the right place. thanks to the new mobile satellite internet systems, most any size yacht can now get fairly fast internet almost anywhere. and thanks to improving nonmarine mobile technologies, namely wifi and cellular data, more and more nearshore boaters can get online reasonably well using just the devices and services they already take on the road. but for the areas in between, both in terms of location and budget, online strategies remain a confusing plethora of conventional and marine-specific possibilities.

              software that is available to make internet phone calls, you are
              bypassing the phone company (and its charges) entirely.
