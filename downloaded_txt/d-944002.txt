welcome to the gap!



this is a fascinating, exciting, and tender
love story of a beautiful virginia mountain girl and a handsome young mining
engineer from the east. the drama depicts the story of the great boom in
southwest virginia when the discovery of coal and iron ore forced the lusty,
proud mountain people into making many drastic changes in their way of life. the
burst of the industrial revolution was upon them. 

the homespun wit and humor of these mountain
folk is intermingled with stark tragedy, suspense, very often violence and their
final acceptance of their inevitable destiny. all are portrayed in this musical
drama to bring it to a happy ending. a superb evening of family entertainment.
			

the drama, interwoven with beautiful, haunting
folk music, some of it original, is performed live before a magnificent 72-foot
panoramic painting of the valley known as lonesome cove. 
special thanks to our sponsors for making this season happen: big stone gap, cumberland gap national park, pro-art association, bike beat mountain bikes, culinary reviewer, great outdoors camping supplies, campanda rv rentals, atco campsite catering.
