   collecting g.i. joe figures and accessories is a 
   great hobby and one which i thoroughly enjoy.  g.i. joe 
   was one of my favorite toys when i was a kid.  i remember 
   many days when my cousin and i would bring out all of our 
   joes and equipment and create many adventures with the 
   imagination that most children have.  we had a blast playing 
   with joe.  friday night sleep-overs and saturday afternoons 
   usually involved at least one joe adventure.  eventually, 
   as i grew older, joe and his fellow troopers were stored 
   away in footlockers and my adventure team headquarters as 
   my life led me in other directions ... high school ... girls ... 
   college ... girls ... job ... marriage (one girl).
   















   the target 1991 duke
   






   in 1991 while strolling through the toy aisle of a santa maria, ca target 
   store, i stumbled across the new g.i. joe hall of fame duke 
   figure in desert camouflage fatigues and i was hooked again.  that single 
   figure with the photos of the old gi joe on the box fired up a ton of 
   emotion.  those great memories of my youth came 
   flooding back into my mind.  it was great to have joe back in the 
   military theme and back in the 12" size.  i grabbed him right away 
   and almost immediately went searching for all my old friends 
   who had been packed away for so long.  unlike many of my other toys, i had 
   kept all my gi joes 
   and their equipment from my childhood for years.  i still have them 
   all today and they are now proudly displayed.  of course, now they 
   have many more friends and are even better equipped.  my collection now 
   includes a number of different action figures from vintage joe and vintage 
   adventure team to newer classic collection, masterpiece, timeless 
   collection, the new adventures of g.i. joe, as  well as many additional 
   action figure items.  
   


   with the help (financial approval) of my wife we have continued 
   to build a nice vintage collection (easily my favorite of any gi joe line 
   ever produced). she has been and continues to be a great supporter of my 
   g.i. joe hobby and will always grab a joe if she sees one and think nothing 
   of laying down the cash...within reasonable limits of course.  today, we 
   have accumulated a fairly moderate sized collection of over 1300 figures, 
   which includes nearly 200 vintage painted hair and adventure team figures, 
   140+ newer carded sets, 110 vehicles, and hundreds of various vintage and 
   newer gi joe collectibles and toys.
   












   if you are interested in selling your vintage g.i. joes or accessories, 
   feel free to contact me using the email link below.  i have purchased 
   several collections over the past few years and am always anxious to add 
   more troops to the platoon.  i am interested in complete collections or 
   single items.  take a look at the platoon photos 
   section to see the kind of items that interest me and that are in my 
   collection today.
   


   the easiest way to describe what you have is to send photos.  photos 
   help give me an idea of not only what you have, but also help me assess
   the condition of the items.  i will respond by asking specific questions 
   regarding condition such as whether or not the figures have stress cracks 
   and to what extent; clothing condition (stains, rips, missing buttons and 
   snaps); melt marks, broken or repaired items; etc.  if you have an idea as 
   to the price you hope to get for the items, let me know that as well and 
   we will see if we can come to an agreement.

memories

            for me, memories is what g.i. joe collecting is really all about.  
            that is why i and many others go to such insane lengths to find 
            more joes to add to our collections.  g.i. joe reminds me of times 
            when my world, at least, was a little simpler.  the 1960s and 1970s
            were a less chaotic time despite the political problems of the 
            period. i lived in a very small town in upstate new york along 
            the border with vermont and access to g.i. joe and his 
            accessories was very limited if not nearly non-existent.  only two
            stores in town carried gi joe and that was usually just the 
            figures, not the accessories.  i remember one time when my uncle 
            visited from syracuse and brought me a heavy weapons set.  i 
            thought that was just great and i still have that set today.  just
            wish i hadn't thrown away the box.
            










            for a long time during my early childhood, the only thing i wanted 
            at christmas was g.i. joe.  one christmas my aunt searched the 
            entire state of new york and probably most of the remainder of the 
            country looking for the adventure team 
            headquarters.  she eventually called hasbro directly.  hasbro 
            actually found two of them in their warehouse and shipped them to 
            her just barely in time for christmas.  one for me and one for my 
            cousin.  my christmas was complete!  my late aunt was terriffic!
            her husband, my uncle (see how that works?), was a real american 
            hero, a gi joe assigned to the 45th infantry division.  he was 
            killed in action in 1944 by a german mortar attack at the battle 
            of monte casino in italy.  having no children of her own, my aunt 
            spoiled me and my other siblings.  all of my childhood g.i. 
            joes were gifts from her and that is why they have such a special
            place in my heart.






            sometimes, the collections can be quite large like this one
            which filled our chevy suburban truck.
            










            today, as i look at the first two painted hair g.i. joes i ever 
            received now proudly displayed, i can tell you exactly where i was 
            and how excited i felt when i received them.  those are the kind 
            of childhood memories that are priceless to me.  g.i. joe is not 
            an investment in the future and a quick money maker as many people 
            have let it become.  for me, it is an investment in the past.  
            g.i. joe is a recapturing of pleasant memories from a great 
            childhood.












   here is a picture of me (on the left) and a neighborhood friend of mine 
   back in the early 1970s playing with g.i. joe.  that seems like so 
   long ago now.  the joes, from left to right, are action sailor (in 
   white diving suit), adventure team aa adventurer (who incidentally, 
   came with a foreign soldiers of the world japanese soldier shirt), 
   action soldier, adventure team land adventurer, and adventure team 
   talking commander on the irwin motorcycle.  they are all still in 
   my collection today.  the footlocker was a marx stoney smith 
   version that my aunt probably purchased through the sears christmas 
   catalog. 
   it was made from cardboard and i still have it in my collection today.  
   the footlocker was filled with several knock-off cheap plastic accessories 
   (machine guns, mp-45, rifles, belts).  these appeared to be produced 
   with similar hasbro molds, but were instead molded in a soft olive 
   drab colored plastic.
   









   here is another picture of me from january 1969 taken by my aunt 
   at her house.  look!  it's a mint hasbro #7000 jeep with trailer, 
   searchlight, and the projectile gun (somewhere around there).  i remember 
   turning off all the lights and driving this thing down the hallway of 
   my home with the searchlight blazing away.  this 
   was such a cool vehicle for g.i. joe.  i dragged this thing around 
   everywhere i went.  it saw some pretty heavy use, but never abuse.  
   just well used in the battlefields of my backyard.  what was i 
   thinking when i threw that box away!?  if i had only known then what 
   i know now.  i would have purchased (i mean had mom purchase) every 
   joe i could get my hands on for $4.99.  never in a million years 
   would i believe i would have to pay the kind of prices i do these 
   days just to add another joe to my collection.  it is insane!
   
















   my wife is very supportive of my joe collecting.  she jokingly tells 
   everyone that it keeps me out of the bars, but in truth, she just 
   understands how gi joe helps me connect with my past and my now deceased 
   aunt.  we only get to a few collector's club conventions, but do hit 
   quite a few toy and collectible shows.  she is just great.

   

   shown on the left here are my wife and i at the 2002 convention 
   in norfolk, va.  this was the night of the traditional dinner 
   and i am shown (with a great deal more gray in my hair than previous photos)
   after winning the coveted mystery figure provided at each table every 
   year (usually a prototype figure donated by hasbro).  this one was a 
   prototype of the navy seal.
  







   today, gi joe occupies a room with some additional display 
   cases scattered throughout our home.  my collection could probably be 
   described as medium in terms of size.  many are much larger and have 
   more valuable pieces.  i try to pick up what i can afford.  
   sometimes i stumble into something and get lucky.
   













   my site

   feel free to browse around and check out the 
   platoon photos section featuring 
   some of the figures, vehicles and accessories that make up my 
   collection including vintage joe related toys, games, coloring books, 
   etc.  this section also includes pictures of some of the more rare gi 
   joe items...including some items that i own as well as some that i do 
   not.  it is here that you can visit my 
   joe room. the  
   new recruits page will show 
   you some of the latest hasbro or other interesting action figures, 
   vehicles and accessories that have been added to my  
   collection.  i simply don't have enough hours in the day to post 
   pictures of them all, but this gives you an idea of my collection.  you 
   can also find the beachhead on facebook.
   






   take a look at the base exchange to see 
   my extra vintage joe and other items for sale and trade.  
   it is in no way a complete list and has really turned into a want list 
   more than a sell list.  i am not a toy dealer so i cannot sell you 
   figures that you're missing or desiring 'cause they're certainly not 
   coming out of my collection.  however, email me if you are looking for 
   something in particular.  i may have seen it on toy shelves or know 
   someone who can get it.  the exchange also includes many of my items that 
   are currently up for auction on ebay.  simple click on the link there to 
   see all of my current auctions.  the items are not always gi joe related. 
   i have a few joe items for auction from time to time as i pick up extras in 
   other collections.  you can also read my 
   philosophy 
   and policy 
   regarding the auctions i have on ebay.
   













   i usually do a limited recon of my local stores on a bi-weekly basis 
   when 12" figures are marketed, less now following the discontinuance 
   of the 12" gi joe.  there are several stores in the surrounding 
   communities of my area including five wal-marts, eight targets, one k-mart, 
   and three toys r us stores.  
   if there are hot g.i. joes or other military related action figures 
   coming out soon, then i will attempt to check the stores on a more 
   regular basis. 
   







   overall, i keep my eyes open as much as i can, which is difficult given the 
   number of stores, the travel distance, and the amount of time i have to 
   spend doing this.  keep an eye on my recon 
   reports.  even if you do not live in my 
   area (washington, dc), i have found that reports of new stock hitting the 
   shelves in other areas gives me a good indication of when i should start 
   looking.  maybe the same will work for you.  i would also suggest you 
   check out the alt.toys.gi-joe newsgroup also known as the sandbox. 
   here you will find posts from people who have found the latest releases 
   and where they were found.  it is a great group of collectors and many 
   people there will simply get an item for you for cost plus shipping if you 
   cannot find it on the shelves in your area.
   







   the operations schedule 
   will give you an idea of the current shipping schedules for all new 
   g.i. joe and military action figure releases.  this information comes 
   directly from magazine and club listings.  i do not release exclusive 
   gi joe collector's club news until it hits the streets through other 
   means.  if you want access to this information, join the club.  check 
   out the g.i. joe collectors 
   club for great news and information on new g.i. joe items and 
   conventions.  if you are not currently a member, you should really 
   consider joining.  it's the only way to find out the latest in g.i. joe 
   before anyone else!  enter your club membership information.  club 
   membership gives you a monthly color comic book style club newsletter 
   with all the latest news.  
   


   if you want to see a list of all vintage gi joe products that came out 
   for the action soldier, sailor, marine, and pilot series plus the 
   adventure team, take a look at my list 
   of 
   sets & series.  some of the hasbro numbers have picture files 
   associated with them so you can see what unopened packages looked like 
   and contained.  i also have a list of all 
   
   40th anniversary figure sets.
   





   have you ever wondered what some of the early hasbro 
   paperwork and advertising looked 
   like?  i have several examples of these items which include equipment 
   set instruction sheets, 
   comic book advertising including andy 
   & george, recent  toy store exclusives 
   advertising and more.  you will also find 
   g.i. joe sound files and some of those famous g.i. 
   joe tv commercials and other videos.
   














   i have included a 
   list of g.i. joe related books, 
   magazines and newsletters that have been published.  some are 
   still available while others are out of print.  these provide 
   information on the history of g.i. joe as well as current information 
   on new releases, convention information, and much more.  if you know 
   of something that is not on my list, please email me with the 
   information and i will include it.
   








   stop by the beachhead's 
   maintenance depot.  the maintenance depot 
   shows how to take some of those cool older soldiers of the world uniforms 
   and make some useful, good looking outfits for g.i. joe.  there are 
   pictures and descriptions of removing velcro and adding snaps as well 
   as making useful helmets that fit and adding rifle and helmet straps.  
   check here for hints on removing stains from figures and clothes.
   


   the communications links will show you 
   a list of some of my favorite links to other gi joe related sites, 
   toy store links, and auction links.  go here to find a nice shortcut 
   to places like hasbro and more.  i am not real big on links.  i 
   feel they really clutter up the webpage and besides, you can find them 
   on about a thousand other joe related pages.  i have traded links with 
   a small handful of other sites and will provide links to sites if i 
   feel they are helpful to the collector like hasbro, the gi joe 
   collector's club, and others.
   







   today's soldiers will give you a detailed list of the current 
   line of gi joes listed by year and category.  this includes classic 
   collection, timeless collection, convention figures, hall of fame, 
   40th anniversary, and every other new line introduced.  these lists 
   include the product number and even some variation information.  i 
   encourage visitors to provide me with product numbers associated with 
   figures listed on this page when those product numbers are missing.  
   









   i didn't buy every figure, but would still like to record every figure's 
   product number (not assortment number) usually listed to the left of the 
   assortment number on the very bottom of the proof of purchase.  for 
   example, 81869 is the product number in 81869/81071 asst..  this 
   should also be the number on the bottom right side of the upc bar code.
   






reassignments depicts new material that i 
   have added to the beachhead.  this includes most website changes.  all 
   of the details will be on the pages mentioned, but this page will let 
   visitors know that there have been updates on a given page.  if new 
   store recons or hot news have been added, reassignments will mention 
   this, but the news itself will be found on the respective pages.  see the 
   photo below.
   











   enjoy the beachhead and let me know what you think or if you have 
   any ideas on how to improve it.  i am always open to new ideas and 
   information.  if you have a similar site that helps the collecting 
   community, then please feel free to contact me and perhaps we 
   can exchange links!







disclaimer
   okay, now for the small print also known as the disclaimer...let me 
   first say that this is not how i make a living.  this is not my j-o-b  
   (i'm actually a rocket scientist...no foolin').  i'm a collector, not
   not a dealer.  i operate this site to 
   further my own enjoyment of collecting as well as to help other 
   collectors in their enjoyment.  with that said, i am the first to admit 
   that this site is not error free.  i continually update this website by 
   replacing a lot of information on a regular basis in my "spare time" so 
   something is bound to be missed now and then.  sometimes a picture won't 
   match a description or there may be a broken link.  please let me know if 
   you see incorrect information like this and i will change it, or if you 
   simply want to shoot the breeze, send me an email and i'll get back to you 
   as soon as i can.  my only request - mention gi joe in the subject 
   heading.  unexpected email to me without a subject goes into the delete 
   file due to virus protection concerns.  sometimes your email will fall 
   into my spam folder.
   


   many have expressed their appreciation of this site and i am, of course,  
   happy to receive such comments. it's always great to hear from fellow 
   collectors even if the comments are critical of the site's format.  for 
   those who do not like this site, i can live with that too and you are 
   certainly more than welcome to tell me what you don't like or what 
   could be improved...just keep it clean and professional please.  there 
   are many joe sites, so i am sure you can find one that suites your 
   fancy if mine does not.
   


have questions on value or rarity?
   feel free to send me an email if you have a question regarding the rarity or 
   value of an item you have.  i will do my best to answer your question.  
   remember, value really depends upon a number of factors including what 
   someone else is willing to pay.  condition and completeness are important. i
   receive a lot of questions every week and i'm more than happy to help if 
   i can.  if you own a business (antique store, auction house, etc), i 
   respectfully request that you do your own on-line or book research to 
   determine value and rarity.  although i'm very willing to help fellow 
   collectors and those finding their childhood toys who wonder what they have,
   i'm not really in this hobby to make professional business owners 
   money...unless you plan to pay a consultant fee.  :o)
   


   thanks!  and remember..."
   only g.i. joe is g.i. 
   joe!"
