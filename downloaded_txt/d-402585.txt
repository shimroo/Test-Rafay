the manager and entire flamingo staff put students, teachers, school staff members, and our families first! the amount of time and care that goes into every trip is top-notch and remarkable. planning trips used to be time consuming and a hassle, but now it truly is pretty much stress free! due to covid-19, our big end of the year trip was cancelled. flamingo was on top of getting our refunds immediately!  our families received 100% refunds without hesitation.  i truly have never worked with a company that cares for students and teachers more than flamingo! we are excited to get our trips up and running because we know that flamingo educational tours always puts students first. they truly treat us like family. jeaninebroward county flamingo educational tours is hands down the best educational travel company.  they have always provided our school with amazing trips, top-notch guides, and support at a cost that is incredibly reasonable.  they are constantly working with us and putting the student and school first.  this year we threw them the biggest curveball ever when we had to cancel our patrol trip to washington dc with 3 days’ notice due to the covid-19 pandemic.  despite the short notice and huge lift of this, flaming educational tours came through.  they were able to get everything; i mean everything including airfare refunded (which we thought was going to be impossible.  additionally, they kept nothing for themselves.  i was able to give my families 100% of their money back.  in a time where my families were losing jobs and struggling financially, i was able to refund all the money they had sent in.  we had also planned trips to st. augustine, legoland, and sea world, all of which had to be cancelled.  100% refunded as well.  flamingo educational tours always puts students first.  from their payment structures and trip plans to how they work with the schools, flamingo treats their schools like family.  i would not let my school travel with anyone else.  i know that our students, teachers, and families are in the best hands when we plan and travel with flaming educational tours.  jennifer gpalm beach county principal superb as always!!

i highly recommend flamingo educational tours for any school who wishes to use them. please let them know that my reference encouraged you to give them a try. 
my role as bookkeeper and budget keeper has manifested over the years into a very intense and complicated job and working with professionals who assist me to use my time and talents to meet the needs of our student population and   teachers to create an enhanced learning experience is truly humbling and makes my work so much more intriguing and satisfying.
