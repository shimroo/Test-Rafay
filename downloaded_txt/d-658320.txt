    sex and/or porn addiction?


 by david essel
•
june 3, 2024

even though i’ve been in this industry counseling people on sex, addiction, and porn addiction for 45 years, we have never seen the increase of these two addictions, and they can be quite different, that we’ve seen over the past five years.                                                                                                            porn addiction hijacks the brain, and it makes it very difficult to stay in any type of a committed relationship, because individuals become so used to the constant variety and changing of the different fetishes as well as body types and experiences that the internet offers up even for free!                                                                                                            sex addiction, when we’re talking about an individual that must have multiple partners, or someone that even forces their partner to have sex more than maybe the partner wants, it can be a completely different ball game in regard to treatment and recovery.                                                                                                            and that’s because of the emotional involvement that many people get into when they have a sex addiction with real people, where that doesn’t happen as frequently if someone is addicted to porn, they may like certain porn actors or actresses, but they don’t create an emotional bond.                                                                                                            but as i mentioned above, porn, addiction is nothing to take simple or easy, i have multiple clients right now in their late 20s that started their porn addiction at the age of 10 and even though they have wonderful partners they can’t have sex on a regular basis because they cannot keep an erection due to their craving for variety versus just being with one person.                                                                                                            every addiction, we treat in a very similar way which might sound surprising, even our new book on permanent alcohol and life recovery, we use most of that information in that book with people who are addicted to sex or porn or food or social media or video games… i think you get the idea so many addictions when we get into treatment are treated in a very similar fashion.                                                                                                            first we find the origin of the addiction, which means when did it start, why did it start, how did it start, and how long has it been going on?                                                                                                            and we treat the whole person not just the addiction part of it, because we want the whole person to gain that self-confidence back and self-love, which we lose when we’re involved with any addiction whatsoever.                                                                                                            if you’re struggling with porn or sex addiction, go ahead and look at our permanent addiction, recovery page, study deeply study this page and that should give you some good ideas and how we approach all addictions.                                                                                                            in 2024, the top addictions that we are working with of course are sex and porn, food, alcohol, pot and social media addiction.                                                                                                            the addictions continue to rise in this country and until we get to the origin, which we do our practice, and then add solution steps, so people will not cross addict, or relapse, we have answers for everything.                                                                                                            here is a quote from a woman that i worked with several years ago who never thought she’d be able to break her sex and porn addiction as she was struggling with both.                                                                                                             "david shared with me information that was so deep, i had no idea the difference between the porn addiction i had or the addiction i had with phone sex, or with men in general.                                                                                                            it was a way for me to escape reality, my work demands a lot of hours, and i was using my sex and porn addiction as a way to give myself a break, sort of like a reward for all the hours i worked. however, it almost cost me my job as i started showing up late on a regular basis because i wanted to get one more orgasm at home before i left for work .”                                                                                                            she is now free of both addictions and has been for over 15 years after going through our program. i know you’ll find the same success regardless of what type of sex or porn addiction you’re struggling with right now. never give up! i will be by your side showing you the way, to complete freedom.                                                                                                                         learn more here                                              https://www.davidessel.com/permanent-alcohol-addiction-recovery                                                                                                            david essel
