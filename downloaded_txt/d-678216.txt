san diego miata club








welcome!

owning and driving a miata is one of life’s great pleasures…won’t you come join the fun?











the san diego miata club (sdmc) was founded in 1996 by eleven enthusiastic miata owners. that enthusiasm has spread to hundreds of members over two decades. our club packs the hamburger factory in poway every month for general membership meetings, but the real fun lies in the numerous driving events, car shows, and parades that the club enjoys.
you have not experienced san diego county like you will with sdmc – top down, wind in your hair, and a smile on your face!! in addition to the driving fun and socializing, club members can also enjoy discounts from numerous vendors (including participating mazda dealerships) and special events sponsored by mazda and other vendors. so, what are you waiting for? do you want to experience the magic before you join? come by and join us during one of our meetings or events. you won’t be disappointed!
