in response to covid-19, we are providing telehealth services, also called, among others, teletherapy, telespeech, telepractice, teleconferencing, and tele-education (depending on the service delivery model), to ensure uninterrupted care during this time. these services will be available as long as the safer-at-home order is in place.  we want to thank all our staff, clients, and families who are participating and made this very important transition in such a short time. the response to teletherapy from clients and families has been great, and we are thankful to be able to provide a meaningful service in your homes which effectively promote you or your child’s speech-language growth during this difficult time.
as we continue to monitor the evolving situation related to covid-19 (coronavirus), our top priority remains the health and safety of our children, families, and staff. thank you for understanding as the situation has been changing rapidly. we appreciate your support as we work together to ensure the health and safety of our children, families and staff.

speech therapy is a partnership
we are a los angeles speech therapy clinic that places an emphasis on treating the whole patient. to help achieve this aim, we believe in including the parent, guardian, or primary caregiver in treatment. by having a primary caregiver attend a session or be part of a session, we form a “treatment partnership” which enhances the speech therapy experience.more
