our research group observes the universe on large scales to find clues about how it began.  we detect light emitted at different stages in the evolution of the cosmos to make 3d maps that reach from the big bang to the present day.  we specialize in developing new hardware and software techniques to detect this ancient light, which comes to us in the form of radio waves and millimeter waves.
