my

goal -
to provide 

cajun and zydeco dance instruction and eventually a dance venue that has the 

dancer's interest at heart.  being a dancers myself, i have a keen 

understanding of what is important to the dancing public;  smooth wooden 

floors, cool breezes, cold refreshment, and of course- excellent live 

entertainment!
