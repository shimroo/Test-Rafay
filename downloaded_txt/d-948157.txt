about cim 



cim was formed only 31 years after canada was founded – the result of individuals in the mining industry seeking a vehicle for lobbying for safety laws and workers’ protection, as well as a method of ensuring the communication of ideas.cim has eleven societies that are instrumental in helping industry professionals develop their knowledge and expertise in the canadian minerals, metals, materials and petroleum sectors. being a member of metsoc is being a member of cim and all the benefits provided by cim and its various other societies that make up our cim family.
