lake hopatcong yacht club



lake hopatcong, new jersey














welcome to lhyc!



founded in 1905, the lake hopatcong yacht club is one of the oldest continuously operated sailing clubs in the country.  the club features an active sailing program, including fleet racing and junior sailing lessons, as well as a very active social calendar, and dining on a beautiful veranda looking out on lake hopatcong.  the club was founded as a family-oriented club, and remains so to this day.  for members only, the club features a beautiful “adirondack style” clubhouse built in 1910, which is on the national register of historic places.  the bar and indoor dining areas were completely refurbished in 2020 in keeping with the original style.  for sailors, the club has 4 active fleets.  the waterfront features two hoists and two ramps, allowing for “roll up” launching.
