making marriage easier
arlene pellicane

a joyous summons to love (and like) your spouse for a lifetime.
many people today are pessimistic about marriage. it's hard. it will end in divorce. if you marry, you exchange romance for responsibility. yet research tells us the happiest people on the planet are those in healthy marriages.
