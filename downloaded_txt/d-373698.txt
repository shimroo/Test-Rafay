how to train a dragon.



today i saw the new 3d movie how to train a dragon. i was quite impressed with the movie, which i find very much the equal of finding nemo, but while the 3d effects were cool, i really didn't pay much attention after the first fifteen minutes. so 3d was rather a waste.i particularly loved how things all seemed to dove-tail at the end of the movie. it suddenly struck me (and just the right moment, from the director's perspective) that the different types of dragons were perfectly suited to the characters associated with them. lovely detail. i really should read the book to see if it's included there. and i adored the main character, hiccup.if i'm going to compare it to finding nemo, however, i'd say that while i find dragons much more entertaining as subject matter than clownfish, this new movie is a little less desirable in the plot than finding nemo. one finds at the end of finding nemo that the father comes to understand his son, and the son understands his father. but here, the father understands the son, the son understands himself, and the whole culture changes to accommodate them. less meaningful, if you know what i mean, but more fun.

asking parents



while i'm on this genealogy kick, hun and i have found it useful to consult our family members for additional clues. hun's father sent us a chart he had composed rather than verbally trying to explain everything. we called hun's mother tonight, and from memory she listed over 100 people. it was rather astounding how many names, multiple marriages, and family stories she can remember. of course, most of her information only goes back to her grandparents and their descendents. (there were a lot of descendents.) she also gave us the names (and relational positions) of a couple of people who can give us even more detail.after such an exhaustive list, i'm tempted to contact my mother for her assistance. if she remembers a tithe of what her father told us growing up, she could be extraordinarily helpful. it's the aftereffects of contact that i'm leery of. it's to be debated. i have to be particularly careful since there are people i'm close with who want nothing to do with her. and mom can be particularly ... abrasive ... when you get her going.at any rate, i have a dearth of information about her patrilineal forbears without consulting her. i really need her for her mother's side, though. we shall see.

genealogy



i've been watching a new show called "who do you think you are?" wherein several celebrities trace their family histories. and it made me a little nostalgic for my genealogical background. grandparents on both sides of my family were very interested in our family history, and they passed a lot of that down to me.but the oddest thing happened. while i was looking for the obituary of my maternal grandfather, i ran across something i did not expect to find. an obituary for my great-aunt mary. who passed away three days ago. the funeral is on monday, not that i can go, and it is surpassingly odd that this is how i found out.

cooking and looking



i love having saturdays off... today, i made banana muffins, did a load of laundry, got rid of some stuff at goodwill, shopped at a thrift store, made croutons, and studied my sunday school lesson. it was lovely!hun is finally learning that in order for me to be able to do chores properly, he needs to get out of my hair - preferrable out of the apartment - and not come back for several hours.

clean car, clean sweep



don't you just love the look of a freshly cleaned house? everything is finally put in order - no more random piles moved from room to room... i need that. i'm getting so tired of being behind on everything. if i wash the dishes, there's always something left over. if i wash the laundry, there's always a couple of socks that i missed. that kind of thing.i've been doing a lot of baking recently, since hun and i are moving from cheerios for breakfast to yummy homemade muffins. i just use bags and bags of flour. and make a lot of dirty dishes. (a bowl for mashing the bananas in, a fork for mashing the bananas, a bowl for storing the chopped pecans, a bowl for the dry ingredients, a bowl for mixing it all together, a spoon for stirring, a spatula for getting stuff off the spoon, a muffin pan used twice because i make a double batch, a cooling rack, a cutting board laid across the sink to make more space...) it's very worthwhile, but very tiring at the same time.anyway, we finally had a string of gorgeous days here in tejas, so i decided it was time we washed the car on thursday. i actually have a bucketfull of car washing stuff that i picked up from a free pile back while i was in college and have never used. the only problems are that we are technically not supposed to wash our car in the condo parking lot and that i don't have a water hose. the caretaker lady didn't seem to care when she saw me starting, so the first problem was easily solved. the second problem i had to get more creative with.i have a small bucket, but in order to rinse the car, i needed a larger supply of water. so i got one of our plastic totes and took buckets of water out -- i think maybe five trips? anyway, after i got all that done and after i cleaned the inside as best i could without a vacuum, hun finally agreed to help me. he washed, and i rinsed. and then he dried. and then i scrubbed the tires, and he rinsed. and the end result is a beautiful shiny car! finally, something that is completely finished. it's a relief to know that i don't have to go back and do it again immediately after i finished it. (unlike dishes.)

cool day at work



just as i was leaving work today, i got a big surprise. a lady pulled up to the drive-thru with an animal in her lap (and a large dog in the backseat). my coworker greeted her and asked about the animal, "is that a rabbit?"actually, it was a kangaroo.what in the world is a baby kangaroo (and an albino one, at that) doing in a bank drive-thru in texas? this lady was bottle raising it for a wildlife preserve. cool, huh?and you thought i was going to talk about the massive winter storm sweeping through the southeast. pfegh.

good for me



i've been doing a really great job this year at putting some effort into the meals i prepare. for example, instead of just munching on dry cereal for breakfast, i've been eating homemade banana muffins. yum! i'm going to have to start expanding into cinnamon or corn muffins soon, though, or this could get monotonous. :) we've also been eating a lot of italian soup or tacos (and believe me, hun is ecstatic to see the demise of hamburger helper). last night, i made meatloaf, too. so good for me!i'm really trying this year not to just fall back on old standbys - or better yet, to make new standbys that aren't so lazy. so far i'm doing a good job, but i really have to work to keep it up. i really need to get better about washing the dishes afterward, though.

minnie the moocher.



hun and i have this policy with our friends - come over any time. if the door is unlocked and we know you're coming, just walk in. if we don't know you're coming, give a knock or something so we don't crap ourselves. and if the door is locked, give us a sec to put some clothes on. ;) most friends don't take advantage of the extensiveness of this policy. they make plans with us for next week, next month, or a special occasion. they call to confirm. but not minnie.if we're lucky, minnie will usually give us about 20 minutes notice. since she gets off work before i do, if she wants to come over, she's usually there before i am, playing cards or grading. she used to invite herself over for dinner until i finally told her that, yes, she's welcome to come over, but if you expect me to prepare for you, you need to give me some advance warning. like, before i buy groceries for the week. a few days later, i come home from work, and she suggests a plan wherein we feed her every tuesday after she gets out of mass, and she feeds us every thursday when we're watching project runway at her apartment. okay - at least that's a plan.last week, she fell asleep, and i ended up cooking on thursday night, too. when she came over yesterday (skipping mass), i got annoyed with her and was very rude, which i regret.i understand some of where this hyperattachment to us comes from, or at least i think i do. she's just started living on her own in the past few months, and she lives alone. most of her day is spent working or sleeping, and she needs someone she can hang out with. i get that part. and i do like hanging out with minnie, but she's a very forceful personality, and she's never content to just sit and read a book. when she comes over, i end up feeling steamrolled by the time she leaves.i also end up feeling like she needs us to take care of her, which can be rather draining. i'm concerned at how much money she spends -- for example, she makes twice as much as i do, but she's repeatedly told us in the past week that she's worried about making it to her next paycheck. i'm concerned about her health, because i've seen her pantry. et cetera.i don't know exactly what i want from this situation, though. on the one hand, minnie is my friend, and i honestly do like spending time with her. but i really need some space -- or perhaps the better word would be maturity -- in our relationship. i'd like to pass an evening when neither one of us tries to sit on the other, tickle the other, or anything like that. i'd like an adult meal, with adult conversation, that ends at a respectable hour.
