wisconsin’s latest issues










ridglan farms

in dane county, outside of mount horeb a for profit facility keeps over 4,000 beagles locked in cages, under 24/7 fluorescent light, to be sold for unnecessary, painful, cruel, animal testing.











gassing the geese

the city of madison uses taxpayer money to exterminate the geese they consider a nuisance who live in the park system.  we want the city of madison to embrace non lethal practices in geese management











wisconsin's unnecessary decimation of wolf populations

wisconsin state agencies are deciding the permissible amount of wolves to kill annually.  special interest groups are pushing for extreme levels of population culling.  wolves are necessary for an ecological balance protecting against economic and health human negative impacts.
