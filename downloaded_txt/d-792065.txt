 for the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly
      becomes beautiful. for the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. for the person who hates, the true becomes false and the false becomes true.
      that is what hate does. you cannot see right. the symbol of objectivity is lost. hate destroys the very structure of the personality of the hater. mlk 1957
