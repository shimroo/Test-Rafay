human reaction to mold presence


special attention needs to be given and analysis performed when
                higher than normal levels of airborne black mold spores, presence
                of toxic mold gas in the form of odor or serious levels
                of toxic mold growth are present. high levels of mold
                will often result in allergic reaction by persons exposed
                to them. such reactions when present, with  mold infestation
                or  mold contamination will require a thorough investigation.  
when your inspection is critically important (health, legal,
                major property transfer, etc.) you must have a competent  study
                and analysis employing the most advanced indoor air quality
                technologies for investigating airborne biologicals  with a complete report.


in situ investigation and 
                    subsequent study


you must  know with the highest level of detail what
                mold you are dealing with and where the mold may be  growing.  allergenic, toxigenic or pathogenic
                fungal mold  growth is often hidden
                in the home.  testing for such a 
                presence provides you with a answer to an unexplained
                recently acquired allergy or condition and the potential
                for 
                 and possible risks in the future. such testing 
                will determine if there is a  presence of  hidden mold. ** the presence of some  black mold
                may require genus and specie testing to exclude
                allergenic, toxic and potentially pathogenic molds including
                members of the stachybotrys or excluding the high interest in the genus aspergillus and relevant species - the simple mold kit
                samples are meaningless without proper use (unknown
                to the user,  most kits are used incorrectly giving
                false  positive and false negative indications) in
                conducting a qualified scientific sampling and
                study of the areas in question-they tend to raise more unanswerable
                questions resulting in more confusion.  these kits have
                little to no value in testing for mold since there is mold
                everywhere and will always be found. see # 12, supra (above). it is not just the mold but its relevancy and risk to human health that is of importance -see # 17. every
                fungal presence is not a mold and there are bioflora and many
                other presentations that clearly pose no  risk to humans.
                common home, mold, environmental inspectors or certified industrial hygienists do not have the required qualifications for the required investigations. this requires the expertise of a scientist so trained. our qualifications are unmatched and exceed all commonly available for these and other high order medical and forensic purposes.
where critical levels of mold contamination are  identified,
                our mycologist report  will provide recommendations
                for remediation  and abatement that includes a free estimate if and when remediation  or abatement is required.  we sell
                you no repairs or remediation. see our indoor environmental   services   menu  for additional
                information.

                  the
                science and practice of fungal  mold  investigation

mold investigation and  testing requires nothing less than  a experienced
                and lawfully qualified investigator so trained using the most advanced testing  protocols, methods and  investigation technologies for inspection of the presence of these biologicals be employed.  such a formally trained scientist and related   analyst is required to conduct a complete and  thorough
                investigation. our scientists meet and exceed all qualifications
                for doing this type of research. our work will go to
                the dna level when required. ( about our scientists ).
your  home, apartment, condo, office, property,
                or work place can be inspected for the presence
                of both visible and hidden mold , related or other 
                problems and dangers. if there is a notable mold presence  sampling is
                required to determine the level of risk present. such
                an inspection is critical if there is a possibility that
                health (human and/or animal)  has been
                affected, impaired or at risk.  we are referred by
                select physicians, allergists and immunologists for
                such purposes.
