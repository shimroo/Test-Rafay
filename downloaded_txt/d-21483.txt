from
from
outer space
foxnews.com
reports
that dr. richard b. hoover, an astrobiologist at nasa, believes that he
has found the fossils of bacteria in meteorites. in other words, he
claims to have found traces of life from outer space.














































not surprisingly, his claim is controversial; many scientists do not
accept that dr. hoover has come to the correct conclusion from what he
has observed. therefore, he has invited over 5,000 scientists to review
his work and to publish their comments.

from reading comprehension
worksheet:
where monsters can grow
beware
of the monsters

who dwell in the mind,

who grow in the shelter

of shadows they find.
beware
of the demons

who hide from the light,

who only survive

when our spirits lose sight.
those
creatures can thrive

where our knowledge is low;

they fill in the spaces

of what we don’t know.
beware
of the monsters

that cause us to hate,

to strike out in anger

when we can’t relate.
worksheet with complete poem
********************
thank
you sincerely
thanks for the start to the
lives that we’ve had.
thanks for the
nights that you went without rest.
so many memories,
most happy, some sad;
if you
weren’t perfect, you still passed the test,
holding our hands,
holding back all the fears.
thank you
sincerely for all of those years.

so many hours that
you worked to provide
multiplied by all
the days that we grew,
when we behaved
and the times we defied,
never a doubt we
could still count on you,
making our
laughter and drying our tears.
thank you
sincerely for all of those years.

thanks for the
rules that we wished were not there.
thanks for the
wisdom we sometimes denied.
all the attention
and all of the care,
all the
forgiveness and all of the pride,
pointing out
faults but then calling out cheers.
thank you
sincerely for all of those years.

 from memories


memories from childhood stay with us forever,










































taking us where we have been and will go,










































pieces of life that live on and will never










































let us forget we were young long ago.











































sometimes i wander back into those shadows,










































quietly being who i used to be,










































bringing to life all the joys and the sorrows,










































days that can’t die while they still live in me.











































holidays linger and happy times glisten;










































i can see everyone active and well.










































i can still hear them if only i listen,










































feeling each motion and breathing each smell.











































life has such treasures that time’s always stealing;










































nothing can ever entirely stay.










































while you are young, you can capture each feeling;










































make all the memories you can every day.

from
      half-truths
beware
of those who use the truth to deceive. when someone tells you something
that is true, but leaves out important information that should be
included, he can create a false impression.
for
example, someone might say, “i just won a hundred dollars on
the
lottery. it was great. i took that dollar ticket back to the store and
turned it in for one hundred dollars!” 
this
guy’s a winner, right? maybe, maybe not. we then discover
that he
bought two hundred tickets, and only one was a winner. he’s
really a big loser!
he
didn’t say anything that was false, but he deliberately
omitted
important information. that’s called a half-truth.
half-truths
are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest.

candidates in political campaigns
