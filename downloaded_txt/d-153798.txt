ray bradbury’s contribution to the literary landscape and our collective imagination made him one of the best-known writers of our time. as a master storyteller, champion of creative freedom, space-age visionary, and guardian of the human heart, he has been embraced by millions across many generations and all walks of life.
—
to dive into ray bradbury’s world is to experience the complex, wondrous, and often troubling layers of human existence, as well as the possibilities beyond the limits of a small rocky planet called earth. in fact, his work has literally traveled out of this world — a digitized copy of the martian chronicles reached the red planet in 2008, aboard nasa’s phoenix mars lander.
“the thing that makes me happy is that i know that on mars, two hundred years from now, my books are going to be read. they’ll be up on dead mars with no atmosphere. and late at night, with a flashlight, some little boy is going to peek under the covers and read the martian chronicles on mars.”
enjoy peeling back each remarkable layer of bradbury’s life, as well as his treasured prose — words that grip as each landscape, conflict, and character emerges from the written page.
