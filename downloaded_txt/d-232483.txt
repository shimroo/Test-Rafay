california child & spousal support calculator
***see below for our free top eleven tips!***
we are a company located in california that provides child and spousal support calculations using the dissomaster™ program. we specialize only in california child and spousal support calculations. the dissomaster™ program has been used in california for over two decades and is widely used by california family law professionals throughout the entire state. all our reports are emailed directly to you in pdf format, usually within hours.
our goal is to work with you to determine if your support payments are what they should be now. we don’t just enter your data into a program, we carefully examine your information and even run different scenarios to make sure that your support is best for your circumstances. we go over your report and try to find things that you may not be aware of or forgot that will make your support payment a better fit for your budget. time and many other things will change the amount of your support payments, and they may be greater or lower than your last court order.
your support payments could be off by several hundred dollars a month, maybe even more. most of our clients save thousands of dollars each year by using our services. the only way to know if your support payment is correct is to run a current dissomaster™ report. see what some of our actual clients save each month here on our client savings page.
by using our services you are not getting a “guesstimate” of what your support should be. you are getting the same calculation that the judge will most likely run. we feel you are entitled to get the same child support amount the court would order, so we use the dissomaster™ program which is the program used most often by california family law professionals.

we can include spousal support in your report
if you have spousal support involved in your case the dissomaster™ program will also calculate the amount of guideline spousal support that may be ordered by the judge. your report can include just spousal support, or include both child and spousal support for the same price.
while many circumstances may affect your final spousal support judgment, the place to start is with the guideline spousal support amount which the dissomaster™ will easily calculate for you. when cases also involve child support the dissomaster™ program will calculate the correct guideline spousal support as well as the child support amount.
“my support payments were thousands of dollars off for years because they weren’t calculated correctly.”
your child support could be off by a substantial amount money if you don’t keep track of what your child support payments should be. if your income, expenses or visitation schedule change, you might need to modify your child support.
and if it’s been a few years since your child support was last modified, you might want to check and see if your child support payments are what they should be based on your current circumstances.
if you are a parent that pays or receives child support, you need to know what your support payments should be before you go to court or file papers. especially if you are going to court for the first time.
you need someone that will take the time to carefully look at your situation and calculate your support payments accurately. we are able to do that for you.
why should i use your service?
because we have the experience to help you determine the child support that is best for your budget. we do this every day and are readily available to assist you. we understand that this is a stressful time for you and your family.
that is why we want to provide a quick, easy and secure way for you to find out what your child support payments should be today. we use the dissomaster™ program to calculate your support payments. we feel you have the right to get a support calculation that is going to be the same as the judge will get in court.
we take the time to carefully go over your situation and calculate your support payments accurately and promptly. we will put ourselves in your shoes and go over your information to make sure that you get a calculation that is best for you.
once you get your report we understand that you may want to make some changes. most of our customers request revised reports, and usually more than one. when you order from us you get up to 10 revisions at no additional charge, unlike some companies that will only give a very limited number or maybe even no revisions unless you pay again.
maybe you can even avoid going to court!
in some cases you may be able to work out an agreement with the other parent and avoid the stress of going to court. working with the other parent you may come to an agreement that is satisfactory that you will be able to submit to the court. often there is no need to even appear in court. by submitting the correct paperwork and documents, you can have a judge sign your agreement and make it a court order. by working with the other parent, you can come to an agreement on your terms and time frame, and still make it a legally binding agreement.
by using our services, you will have the information you need when working with the other parent. you will know which items affect your support amount and make it a better solution for your situation. you may even be able to avoid going to court if you and the other parent can reach an agreement based on your dissomaster™ report.
know what your support is before you get to court
when you are thinking of going back to court to have your support modified, or you have been served with papers, you need to know what your child and spousal support should be before you get into the courtroom. by using our service you will know in advance of going to court or hiring an attorney what your child support payments should be.
we have been in court where the judge was going to make an order that was not in our favor. but because we knew what the support should be, we were able to present the reasons and the dissomaster™ printout and get the support we knew was correct. you need to know what your support should be before you get to the court. once the judge makes a ruling it is too late. if the support amount is not in the range you expect you will need to present your reasons why the support should be a different amount and why so that you can get the correct support amount ordered.
why use the dissomaster™ program?
because the dissomaster™ is the program california family law professionals use to calculate your support amount. the dissomaster™ program was designed by attorneys to follow the guidelines set out in the california family law code. the dissomaster™ program has been used in the state of california for over two decades to make child and spousal support calculations. the dissomaster™ program is the program used most frequently by family law professionals to determine child and spousal support payments.
