what people are saying



“benta's is a long established business that my family has known of for years so when my father passed after a long illness, my sister and decided that this would be the best place to handle the arrangements. my father passed during a holiday weekend (july 4th) so we had to wait until the next day to start final arrangements but the funeral director that was assigned to us chontel harris was great. we told her our budget and she was understanding telling us the options without additional pressure to add extras. she explained the process in detail from that day to the day of the funeral; communication was easy and prompt. in the end my sister and i were satisfied with the service provided by benta's funeral home”— elleanora b.bloomfield, nj



“dean wilson - what an incredible human being. from the moment we met, he made my family and i feel at ease. this is a difficult, confusing, and very overwhelming process, but dean made it all feel so effortless. benta was recommended to us by the pastor of our lady of lourdes church and i have zero regrets. dean went the extra mile for us, making a stop at my mother's building during the funeral procession to leave flowers at the front steps. incredible. a simple gesture that will forever stay embedded in my memory and our hearts. i know the other reviews make this place seem like a nightmare and it worried me at first, too. dean and his team at benta made all those fears vanish. they took great attention to all the details, even the smallest ones were not overlooked. mom looked dashing in her casket. there was never any pressure from dean to buy the most expensive casket or include the additional limo expense. he catered mom's service to our needs both financial and sentimental. i would 100% recommend benta to family and friends.”— johnathan j.new york, ny



i just recently loss both my mom and sister within 5 days of each other.  they both lived in nyc and i live in fl.  i didn’t even know where to begin since i have never planned a funeral.  i found benta’s funeral home via a web search and was impressed by their reviews in particular that of mr. dean wilson.  i then called benta’s and asked to speak to mr. wilson.  he was a godsend!!! this man worked endless hours to get things done.  he accommodated all of my requests and never said no.  he kept me informed every step of the way and his demeanor was that of empathy.  both my mom and sister were buried within a week which impressed me given all the deaths going on in nyc due to covid 19.  all i know is that mr. wilson managed all the funeral arrangements for me so i could grieve my mom and sister!!  with all that said, mr. wilson, may god bless and watch over you always!!! i don’t have the words to thank you for all you have done for my family!! please be careful and stay safe!!!- david rodrigueznew york, ny



i've been to several services here over the past decade. each one was to the family's specifications. it's a beautiful, clean facility with a calm and peaceful atmosphere. the staff seems friendly and accommodating.- saroya fannielnew york, ny



amazing , amazing , amazing from the beginning until the end of planning my mom home going service. we had the pleasure on being assisted by funeral director sylvia. she was amazing , me and my siblings are grateful and satisfied her professionalism and patience was outstanding. this was a difficult time for us of course but i must say i'm totally happy we made the decision to allow benta's funeral home handle our mom funeral arrangements. by the way my mom jean edwards looked beautiful like a sleeping angel.thank you- terrylynn edmondsonnew york, ny



i just buried my mom on this saturday and benta's was so caring and professional during all my encounters with them. our funeral director was mr. young. he was on point with everything we needed. he extended time for others than my family members to view my mom's body. when i spoke with him about the way i wanted my mom to look, he listened carefully and made sure my wishes were carried out. my mom looked beautiful, just like she was sleeping. i couldn't even cry when i saw her. i give benta's thanks for all they have done to make sure i was completely satisfied. they are pricey, but i believe you get what you pay for.- diane simmonsnew york, ny



i wanted to share that the staff at benta's were exceptional in the planning of my mother's homegoing services last month, june 2021. dean wilson was our funeral director. his calm, reassuring and professional demeanor placed our family at ease during the planning process. his excellent customer service made what is a very emotional time, more comforting as we had to discuss necessary details. our services consisted of two parts, the first was the actual funeral which took place here in new york at benta's and the second portion was the burial in south carolina. mr. wilson handled all the necessary arrangements concerning the transfer of the body from nyc to sc. the homegoing services were beautiful. my mother looked like the queen she was. benta's did a wonderful job on the day of the funeral. they are worthy of their reputation. thank you mr. wilson and the staff at benta's for helping us during this time of grief.- larnie uptown richardsonnew york, ny



i was prepared for a stressful process in planning my mother's funeral. thanks to lisa and the benta's team, that was far from the case. they made the process so smooth and understandable. lisa explained things so that i was never overwhelmed in making decisions. my mom had been ill and i was afraid that she would not look good but again i was wrong. my mom looked amazing. for the wake, people were able to leave video/audio messages for my family. also, the funeral home has a service where they put your program online and provide a private, unique url that you can share. this was great for those friends and family who were unable to make it to the services.  everything they did helped to ease the most stressful and emotional time of my life. i will be forever thankful.- robin. b.bronx, ny



“our family had never experienced the loss of a close relative and we were very new to the funeral process. the sudden loss of our mother took an emotional toll on us and we had to quickly navigate our options to ensure that her wishes were fulfilled after her passing. some people had suggested the more popular chain funeral homes in our neighborhood but our pastor suggested that we reach out to benta's as they are a family owned establishment and work well with the community. he was right! the funeral director, dean wilson, took his time to guide us through the entire process, allowing us to grieve at our own pace without the pressure of having to make unnecessary expenses. his attention to every detail and careful planning made our mother's funeral services feel like a celebration of her life, exactly as she would have wanted it. friends and family that attended the services mentioned how well organized and coordinated everything was. we are so grateful for mr. wilson and all of the benta's staff”- ciara a.new york, ny



my dad passed away three years ago, and benta’s funeral home made the arrangements so easy. their representatives are very friendly and compassionate. they made sure that “no stone was left unturned” making our other tasks easier to complete. they are fast and accommodating. thank you benta’s funeral home for all that you do.- es izzynew york, ny



i have trusted them with my mom in 2005 and again 2021 with my father. i wouldn't go anywhere else.- diamond speightsnew york, ny



amazing work! amazing service! my mother looked amazing! her wake and home going were amazing! chontel harris and jason benta... amazing. i have never made a better choice in my life and i am forever thankful that i entrusted them with my mom’s final arrangements. my siblings and i received so many compliments. though i can’t bring my mom back, it means the world to me that benta’s funeral home allowed myself and my family to send my mom off with a beautiful grand celebration of life. i hope i don’t have to use them any time soon, but they will be my go to from now on.- monalesa diamondnew york, ny



i recently buried my mother on 8/23/17 and utilized benta's. as usual, they did a wonderful job with everything. i say as usual because my family has consistently used bentas over the years. because of their dedication and service, they are known to me as my family's funeral business of choice. they did an excellent job in both the preparation of my mother, and the overall service. i want to say thank you so very much for exceptional service and dedication to ensuring the highest quality of service during such difficult times.- michelle o.new york, ny



i had the pleasure of using bentas funeral home for the passing of our mom. my mother looked like an angel when they completed the work on her. dean wilson is a godsend and made the process seamless. he offered so much great advice. i can tell he loves his job. they took loving care in handling my mom as well as the funeral details.- tonia pricenew york, ny



chontel harris is superb in all that she does. i had the pleasure of using benta's for my mother's funeral/memorial in november. benta's was amazing in every step of the way. every staff member was knowledgeable and the facility is immaculate.- latarsha smithnew york, ny
