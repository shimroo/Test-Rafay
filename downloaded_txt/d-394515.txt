our mission is to serve our guests the very freshest seafood at affordable prices. come and enjoy! family-owned for over 41 years. located in or & wa.








the mcgrath family’s love for fishing and harvesting seafood resulted in the opening of mcgrath’s fish house over 41 years ago. great recipes were developed, including our award-winning clam chowder, making each and every item on our menu memorable. almost every fish and seafood available from northwest waters including fresh alder plank salmon, halibut, razor clams, and oysters are available on our menu. the wood-fired broiler gives our seafood, steaks and chicken, a very special and unique flavor.




our authentic beer-battered fish & chip recipe, straight from england, gives a taste like none other. we have a large variety of fresh salads featuring seafood, chicken, or fruits and vegetables. the pasta, especially those made with a rich garlic cream sauce, is truly fantastic. most of our desserts are homemade and simply delicious. we invite you to come and enjoy all our tasty food served by our well-trained and friendly staff.
