brenda mckinney was so present throughout the duration of this course, and her responses were so encouraging and thought provoking, they inspired me to work harder and give more energy to this course than i would have otherwise. she motivated me to take this course seriously, and it exponentially helped my ability to learn in this online format.

                    
                    course: gratitude: a powerful classroom tool
                    with brenda mckinney





i didn't have any real expectations for this class besides completing the assignments and being done. what i learned was that gratitude is a positive emotion that stimulates ourselves to be happy with the world we have around us. i learned that even though we are grateful overall, gratitude practice helps see the glass half full, and to embrace it for what it is.

                    course: gratitude: a powerful classroom tool
                    with brenda mckinney





brenda mckinney provides many resources to each of us in response to what we are needing and wanting, so that we are able to put our learning to use within our classrooms. she truly practices what this class has taught us about supporting students' growth mindset! 
~dia bernabe
                    
                    course: mindset: the new psychology of success
                    with brenda mckinney





brenda mckinney went beyond simple suggestions and gave feedback on a very personal level.  she shared personal experiences that made her relatable to us as teachers.  the videos gave a deeper understanding of being grateful.

                    course: gratitude: a powerful classroom tool
                    with brenda mckinney





this has been the most fascinating, eye-opening, thought-provoking course i've taken to date. i loved the author's writing, and so appreciated your thoughtful, helpful, timely responses to my assignments. i will encourage all of my co-workers to take this course, and i will hang onto and refer to this book often
~roberta mccollum
                    
                    course: why willpower matters: improve health, happiness, & productivity
                    with brenda mckinney





i have taught for many years, and i have been one of those teachers who tried engagement strategies and failed. this class taught me how to improve my teaching,  have the whole class and staff working together, engaged, and achieving success both in the classroom and in their lives outside of school. it provided me with the solutions to be successful if i keep trying.
~anonymous
                    
                    course: engaging students of poverty: practical strategies that raise
                    with brenda mckinney





this course couldn’t have come at a better time.  i expected the course to focus mostly on my students or my job, but the effects and benefits have been much more personal. one of the greatest gifts this course brought me was in re-establishing a daily habit of meditation, and an ongoing awareness of mindfulness off the cushion. i noticed the results after a couple of months when my job didn’t seem to “stress me out” anymore. i don’t think it was my job that changed, but my relationship to it. this caused me to accept a full-time position working in my current school, and i even found myself saying “i kinda love my job!” my focus shifted from the negative to the positive - and with gratitude, i developed a much healthier relationship to my work. 
~erin white
                    
                    course: mindfulness: a path to wholeness
                    with brenda mckinney





mary johnson does a wonderful job leading her courses.  she is quick to respond to assignments. i love her positive approach to guiding us through the course.
~sarah jaffe




enjoyed taking my second class with mary a. johnson this year! appreciated the support and timely feedback!
~deonna boneva-akes
                    
                    course: classroom instruction that works for ell
                    with mary ann johnson





my instructor was very helpful. i enjoyed this class and learned a tremendous amount!
~michelle armstrong

a small victory in math class
january 22, 2025
        teaching at the middle school level is, in an understated nutshell, challenging. the successes are often few and far between, and the students seem to move on so quickly that it seems that as soon as you get to know a group of students, they have moved on to high school. add into the equation that i…
