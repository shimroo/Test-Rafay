we encourage every member of lighthouse to get to know their church family by volunteering to work together in the ministry of helps. all helps ministry workers must be active members of the church for three months before being eligible to participate in a helps ministry, having received jesus as lord and savior, baptized with the holy spirit, and baptized in water.

we encourage every member of lighthouse to put their hands to the plow and get involved. the ministry of helps includes media, cleaning, hospitality, and more.








            women's bible studies
          










the women’s bible studies group has a desire to grow in relationship with god through his word as well as in relationship with each other by sharing our time, perspectives, and personal applications for each study.  join us as we uncover the history, attributes, behaviors and assignments of women in the bible in a small, intimate, interactive, and transforming way.








            next generation
          










next generation is built around a simple concept: we always win. children and youth who are ages  months to 12 years old are welcome to learn how to fight the “good fight of faith” and learn about their covenant with god through a relationship with jesus in an age-appropriate way.
