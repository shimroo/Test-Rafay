all about me



since this is the most viewed page on the entire blog, i figured i'd best fill it out!  let's see...."my halo started to slip, but my horns caught it" pretty much sums me up.  really.  as do all my other taglines.  i'm a weird mom to two teenage boys living in the south.  danny is 16, and joe is 15.  those of you who have been reading me since way back when, and those of you who know me in real life know that these are not their real names.  now that my kids are teens, i am really trying to keep all our names off the net for privacy reasons. despite how my house looks, i spend an awful lot of time on housework.  my favorite chores by far are dishes (love seventh generation's natural dish liquids and  method's dish soaps), and laundry (i've been known to even make my own laundry detergent from time to time). i recently re-discovered my love of travel.  i travel whenever time and money allow, especially to see my favorite bands perform!  i love music of all kinds, but consider myself a rocker chick at heart. also: hopeless romantic. daydreamer. zealous vintage dish collector. classic car fanatic. voracious reader. unashamed tv, movie, pop culture, entertainment & celebrity gossip addict. fledgling writer. web designer. sometime artist. (recent) fitness fanatic. love rollerskating/roller derby. my favorite things in the world are covered porches, sweet tea, the moon and stars, thunderstorms, the smell of rain, and the smell of freshly cut grass.  and in the colder months?  cocoa and comfort food.-------------------------but wait!  there's more!just thought i'd touch a bit more on some of what was said above: i'm a huge fan of historical romance and paranormal romance.  some of my favorite authors are:  hannah howell, diana gabaldon, julie garwood, catherine coulter, charlaine harris, and amanda quick.  though not a romance writer, i love gregory maguire and joe hill as well. i try to watch one movie every night if i have time.  i love all types of movies.  i have a fondness for just about any and all horror films....even the worst.  i love anything with johnny depp!!  i also love chick flicks, children's movies, and teen movies.  and i am not the least bit ashamed of it! these are just a few that i love and could watch over and over. i watch a lot of tv, too.  but i'm a bit fickle and my favorite tv shows change on a very frequent basis. my current favorite places on the web (excluding all my daily blog reads, of course!) are:  d listed, celebrity smack, bloody-disgusting, swim at your own risk, makeuseof.com, i can has cheezburger?, daily blog tips, samhain publishing weblog, jackson rathbone online, and music savvy mom. as far as music goes i like a little of everything, but metal and punk are my favorites.  i also love covers, cover bands and tribute bands.  a true child of the 80s, i'd be lying if i said i didn't also love the best and worst of the hairbands and 80s metal.  as i mentioned at the top, i love concerts, too.  you can see a list of the bands i've seen live here.  always in heavy rotation on the mp3 player:  ramones.  type o negative.  danzig.  johnny cash.  nine inch nails.  tool.  white stripes. ministry.  80s metal and hair bands. just a little fun fact:  this post (transferred from my old blog) is currently the #1 google search result for 'gwar groupies'.  and you'd better believe i am proud of that!
