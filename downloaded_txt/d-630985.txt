thanks for visiting the locked hair blog exchange






this post will remain at the top of the blog exchange.  please scroll down.







my name is maryee and i am the moderator of the blog exchange.    my hair has been sisterlocked since 11-28-03 and the "sisterhood" has been growing by the day.  most of the blogs are that of women who have their hair sisterlocked, simply because the idea came from a discussion we had december 2005 in lockitup, which is a yahoo group that discusses primarily sisterlocks.       sisterlocks is just one way in which locks can be created.  the locked hair blog exchange is more about embracing any kind of naturally locked hair for people of color.  we do have a few brothers who blog about their locs, but could use a few more who are willing to share.


women and men are being inspired to get back to their natural selves and be free from chemical bondage.  that's a good thing.  the blogs have been a source of inspiration and encouragement for any and everyone at what ever stage they are in their locking journey.    many who want to read about personal stories find the exchange a great place to start because most of the bloggers update regularly.  you'll read about good days and bad days, but mostly good days.  you'll see lots of photos and some who are really passionate, will share "how-tos".

so for the sake of clarity, the blog exchange is for anyone (male or female) who has their hair in a locked state and you blog about your hair, it's maintenance or have lots of photos of your hair in a blog or online photo album is invited to join.  you'll learn about the bloggers personal/professional lives among other things which makes for entertaining reading.  be careful though, cause blog surfing and blogging can get a bit addictive.  ask most of the avid bloggers.

the guidelines are here, so check it out if you are interested.  you won't spend much time here, because the purpose of the blog exchange is for you to visit the blogs/albums below.  this is just a central location.    add the exchange to your favorites or blogroll it and if you have a blog and are not a member yet, go ahead and link the exchange.   and by all means, show the bloggers some love by commenting on their blog posts.  they'd sure appreciate it.  also, if you are new to the blogging community, please check out this post for some suggestions on how to get started.  wishing you all the best in your quest for freedom and online support in your natural journey.

the locked hair blog exchange consists of about 200 blogs of folks who want to share their locked hair journeys with the world.   i'm thankful for them sharing a part of themselves with each of us.  we continue to inspire others as we've been inspired, too. 
maryee

lhbe members: please only make one blog post for your blog.  you can update your original post often, changing pictures, but do not post new messages/pictures elsewhere in the exchange about you or updates to your blog. take care of that in your original post.  if you have something you'd like to share with the exchange not related to your blog or have questions about posting, email me first at maryeepc at gmail .com  if you post more than one time, the new one will be removed or the two merged with your original blog post.

thanks for your help in keeping the locked hair blog exchange orderly.  having only one blog post per blogger makes it easy for me to moderate and take care of the exchange and have a somewhat normal life.   the feedback i receive offline about how the exchange is helping ladies make their decision to lock is very positive! thanks for sharing your wonderful journeys!


keep it natural and keep it locked up!



i wanted to leave this post up top so those of you who are inspired by the locked hair blog exchange can leave comments. if you stumbled upon the exchange either by googling it or it was referred to you by a natural hair on-line group or person and you've found it to not only be inspirational, but motivational for you to either get locked (no matter what the method), or blog about your locking journey, then we want to hear from you. please leave your comments here in this post. this goes for the lhbe members as well. don't be shy!

msfullroller's braidlocks









update: my braidlocks have made the amazing transformation from skinny braids into small locs and they've gotten a little length too! :-)  on august 23,2013, they reached the 5 year milestone!  big thanks to maryee for inviting me to the locked hair blog exchange to share my braidlock journey. for about 8 months, i researched through this blog looking for information and inspiration to lock my hair.  pouring through  many fotki albums and blogs listed here gave me lots of info on the many ways to start and maintain locs. as an avid diyer, i was determined to put in my own small locs and on august 23, 2008 i my braidlocks were born. join me as i share my observations on this on this journey back to...me at http://ceraisis.net

so unbelievably happy with life, right now!







i'm at that point where i've let go of all the pointless drama and the people who created it and surrounded myself with positive people who make me laugh so hard that i forget 

any bad and focus solely on the good. life is too short to be anything but happy! x

people are always...





people are always...: people are always looking for someone better than themselves, i think this is why confusion and heartbreak comes into play in relationships. you want him to be all the things you are not, you want her to be gorgeous so you won't feel so ugly.
but when people you mate with who know that they are better than you:financially, emotionally, physically, they will never assume a position of humility with you as long as you are searching for 'completeness"...they know that they are the prize and that you have more to lose by not having them in your life.

when you disclose you neediness, then the game begins..how much they can hurt you, weaken you, toy with your emotions becomes the routine. love yourself first, i mean totally..so that you dont get taken for a ride...don't let anyone dangle a carrot over your head, you are better than that!

sisterlocks to braidlocks





   





i have been natural since 11-06. i was sisterlocked on 7/13 and  7/14/07 maintained them with nappylocks tool, took my step-sisterlocks down in 11-07 and redid my whole head with braidlocks on 12-5-07. being a firm believer in do it yourself (diy), i felt i made the right decision with taking my sisterlocks down i don’t regret a thing, not even the amount of money i spent to get my sisterlocks done.

dreadlocks hair care!



































dreadlocks





www.healingherbsbyrene.com



dreadlocks are a natural way of wearing your hair that was made world-famous by bob marley and the rastafarians in jamaica. for black women the advantages of dreadlocks are considerable:
once formed, dreadlocks are way less work than most other ways for a black woman to maintain her hair.
it is completely natural: no dangerous chemicals needed.
it is a way to show pride in being black.

most black women, at least in america, either put dangerous chemicals in their hair to straighten it or they wear wigs or weaves – hair that is not naturally theirs. so dreadlocks are one way to wear one’s own hair in a natural way.some companies do not like you coming to work in dreadlocks, but most will accept them if they look nice.you need a special kind of shampoo to wash dreadlocks. most shampoos have stuff that will stay in your hair after you wash it. combing and brushing will get rid of it, but with dreadlocks you never comb or brush, so it will just build up in your hair and cause trouble.the reason dreadlocks get that gray look is because of the wax that is used to help form and maintain them. you can do it without the wax but it is harder.see also: dreading methods include: natural/neglect - just stop combingtwist and rip-twist hair separate pull repeatbackcomb-comb the hair backwards towards the scalptwist and neglect-great for african hair just twist then let it do its thingcrochet-use a crochet hook to weave hairs togethernatural-the natural methods is technically the best method for everyone's hair and causes 0 damage to the hair. just let your hair do what it wants to do when you feel lil dreads starting to form begin separating them accordingly.advantages: this completely natural people nothing to it just letting it grow for itself.disadvantages:well its natural but the only real problem would be the shape of the dreads and the size they will come out as. if you separate them the way you want then you could end up with great looking ones or messy but beautiful ones. also this method is not for the people afraid to look a lil messy.2strand twist- two strand twist seem to have become oddly popular in the dread community due to multiple artist getting them done. its just two even groups of hairs twisted repeatedly into coils. no real damage is done in this method. (works best on african hair)advantages:its extremely simple to do barely any damage and if you want salon looking dreads i guess this would be for you.disadvantages:until they mature a little sometimes gel will be needed.twist and rip- its similar to the 2 twist method but very different. with this method you will yet again gather the hair into two equal strands then twist them together then pull them down the middle to the scalp. this creates knots forming the dread. you would keep going down the dread till you get to the tip. its one of the most recommend ways to create dreadsadvantages: very simple like the 2twist method and very little damage done. dreads become very nice through this method. can be done on any hair texture.disadvantages: it does cause a certain amount of damage. but not as much as backcombing.backcombing- this method suggested by dread companies because of how you will look before they mature a little aka sonic the hedgehog although this is how my dreads were formed i wouldn't suggest doing it. it causes stress against the hair follicles. with this method you section the hair off into blocks then take a section and comb towards the scalp with a metal comb the hair will begin bunching up at the scalp slowly forming the dread.advantages: extremely simple to do anyone with a metal comb can do it. can be done with any hair texture.disadvantages: will cause you to look like sonic for a couple of days or weeks. damages the hair more than the first methods will. also can be extremely painful if you have help.worst for your hair-crocheting-latch hook-sadly this evil method is pushed upon people looking to get dreads done without getting the facts first. crocheting will make your hair in to "perfect" looking dreads but will utterly damage it its weaving the hair together.advantages: well if you are one of those extremely impatient people i guess this is right for you it will give you instant looking dreads.disadvantages:this is one of the worst ways to form them. you are sticking a metal pin in and out your hair and often breaking the inner hairs. this causes so much weakness in the dreads and breakage at the root. especially when to "maintain" these dreads you are to continually stick them. this reach for perfection is ridiculous and not natural.interlocking is the most pushed thing in salons for beginning and maintaining locks. its the interloping of hair till the lock together. they twist the lock and pull it through the roots of the hair. this is quite damaging for the hair as the roots are often over tightened and weak to the point of falling off.advantages: they look slightly good for a period of time.disadvantages they will eventually fall out. this method is pushed on people cause salons make you think dreads have to be perfect and the only way to do this (to them) is constant locking. also cause they get paid by the hour (around 80 to 100) to do this easy yet slow method. this method puts uneven stress upon the lock and roots. this can make the dread look uneven and eventually fall off the head onto your pillow most likely,once you have done it too much there is no way to really help you recover.felting-the second worst way to begin dreads these create instant dreads but at a extremely high cost.advantages: instant dreads thats it there's nothing else good about this.disadvantages: so many where should i start well they literally break your hairs to stick them together. this the rough insane version of crocheting . if you choose to do this your hair will most likely fall out or break off this method just causes that much permanent damage. maintenance- with dreads not much is needed to keep them in shape you are suppose to let them do their thing.keeping them clean: a residue free shampoo or soap is needed for this. residues slow down the dreading process and slowly adds gunk into your hair. i personally my black soap shampoo you don't have to continuously wash your hair but it has to be clean. overwashing your hair can cause it to dry out fast washing either twice a week or every two weeks is just fine your hair will not smell bad. to dry them i would first let them air dry a bit then use a blow dryer. when they are still new be careful while washing. as a way to deeply cleanse them a baking soda wash followed by organic (apple cider or vinegar) rinse will be perfect to make sure you get all the residue out your hair. tightening roots dont mess with them theres no need they tighten themselves but if you really feel the need to you could root rub. which means basically rubbing the root of the hair against the scalp in a clockwise motion. i wouldn't do this cause it tends to weaken the roots and over tightening them is not good for the dreads. just let them do their thing.tightening the dreads there are many ways to attempt to tighten them sea salt(which dries black hair out) lemon juice rinses(which also dry your hair) to name a couple.beads might help to tighten loos dread sections. really the thing that will help you the most is to just let them do it themselves. wax- never buy this dread wax is one of the worst buys you can ever make. its for one non-water soluble meaning what ever you do its most likely wont come out if you use it. the only real ways to get out is either boiling your dreads, using industrial glue remover, repeated high temperature washings or just getting rid of them. all wax is is glue dread companies sell it cause they just want your money and they really don't care about your dreads. dont buy anything from them. if you really need a wax substitute use straight up aloe vera oil from the plant. if someone from a salon or whatever tells you that you need wax ignore them cause they are ignorant, wax kills.update: washing well we don't have to wash as often as others do so i recommend once a week or once every two weeks

family ties





...yesterday i went to another family reunion meeting (every other year we have a reunion in a different state). for the last 1.5 yrs, family in illinois have been meeting to plan for our july event. unfortunately, there's always tension, arguments, drama over some of the smallest things, but the issues flow from problems of years' past. hurt feelings of what was said time ago. and lack of interest in dealing with the gorilla in the room head on. but things came to a head yesterday. our normal 2-3 hour meeting extended into a 6 hr venting session. voices were raised. tears flowed. apologies were said. and hugs were given. and though i thought at one point this reunion would truly be the last that we'd be able to host together, we came full circle (as family should) and at least began to heal old wounds. emotionally, i was drained afterwards, but content in knowing that hopefully we can create some better memories with the time we have left. you said it right, marilyn. the only thing really important in this life are those you call family. and since nothing is promised us, we need to be mindful of how we spend our time together.

pioneers of the journey

before there was "bloggin" to share locked journeys, there were two ladies whom i give credit for setting the stage about how to document the process, specifically sisterlocks.  if you haven't visited the websites (not blogs) of pat hunley or sandy, please do.  you'll find all the richness of sharing a journey, since the two of them were documenting their journeys long before the community had such on line support.  thank you pat and sandy for being a true inspiration to many of us who are now a part of the wonderful and growing community of locked sisters and brothers.
