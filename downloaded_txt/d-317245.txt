why carrot ink?
print what you love and still enjoy big savings with carrot ink's remanufactured and compatible ink and toner cartridges. we believe you don't have to pay a premium for quality printer ink, that's why we offer a cheaper and smarter alternative to expensive branded ink and toner. since 1998, we have built our business on three simple principles: cheap prices, high quality products, and superior customer service.
cheap prices
since day one, we have offered the cheapest prices on cartridges for inkjet printers and laser printers. remanufactured cartridges are recycled cartridges that are professionally refurbished. compatible cartridges are brand-new generic cartridges not made by a brand-name manufacturer. our cartridges are much cheaper to develop and produce compared to oem. we simply pass on the savings to you. in fact, you can save up to 75% off. now that's a steal!
high-quality products
our ink and toner cartridges are made by state-of-the art facilities that follow strict quality standards. we use only a premium blend of proprietary ink and toner that will always give you crisp, sharp, and fade-resistant prints. results are at par with, or even better than, what you get from branded cartridges. they are also eco-friendly. we are so proud to put our name on our products that if for any reason you aren't fully satisfied, you can use our no-questions-asked 1-year money back guarantee.
superior customer service
it is our goal to make it easier, faster, and cheaper for you to find the printer cartridge you need so you can spend more time doing what really matters: creating beautiful prints or professional-quality documents. our friendly customer service reps are always available if you need assistance on any of our products and services. give us a call or chat with us, we’d love to talk with you!
