julie pochrona printer, photography professor, and fine artist, julie pochron cultivates special relationships with her clients and their bodies of work. fiercely intentional about color and always provoked to produce work that is of the highest quality and utmost expression of an artist's project scope, julie has cultivated an important role in the exhibition printing environment since 1995.originally producing client work by renting studio space, darkrooms, and equipment time in the early days of her printing career, julie eventually purchased her own darkroom equipment and signed a lease in dumbo in 1999. once dumbo grew out of its early days as an artist haven, pochron relocated the studio to red hook in 2009. having re-built the red hook studio in 2013 after its submergence in five feet of water upon superstorm sandy’s breach of red hook’s shoreline, pochron’s uniquely subjective eye and passion continues to have a hand in contemporary photography. now, pochron’s newest exploration of color comes in the form of inkjet pigment printing.creating studio environments where she can work with clients in a relaxed and comfortable dynamic has always been pochron's hallmark. she is as meticulous with bringing forth the best expression of a client’s work as she is in crafting an environment that also expresses who she is as a person, professional, and artist. one understands this clearly when they are greeted by her two pigs, dog, cat, a cup of coffee, and something delicious baked by julie herself. when the machines are running, one also feels the pulse of her focus.a graduate of pratt institute school of art & design, julie has been a faculty-member since 1998. she lives in dutchess county, new york with her two potbelly pigs skylar & pygmy, her pups fugu & maki, her cat udon and likes to escape to the beaches of mexico as often as she can.
