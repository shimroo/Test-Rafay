my points












at this incredibly difficult time, bering air would like to express our deepest gratitude for the overwhelming support we have received. the tragic accident that occurred on february 6, 2025, has shaken us all to our core. this has been an unprecedented event for both our team and our customers, and we are truly heartbroken by the loss.
it is crucial for us to share with you that the decision to resume flying so soon is not taken lightly. as the sole provider of essential air travel in our region, we are deeply aware of the critical needs of the traveling public—whether for medical appointments, accessing life-saving medications, or other urgent travel needs. we feel a deep responsibility to continue serving these needs, even as we cope with the profound impact of this tragedy.
we ask for your understanding and patience as we work to restart our operations, support our community, and rebuild in the wake of this loss. this will be a challenging journey, and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure the safety and well-being of those who rely on us.
our hearts are with all those affected by this heartbreaking event, and we extend our most sincere condolences, thoughts, and prayers to everyone involved. we will continue to honor and remember those we’ve lost, and we remain steadfast in our dedication to serving the public with the utmost care and compassion.
to support those with loved ones on board, we have set up a toll-free friends and family information line, staffed with specialists who can provide updates and emotional support. you can reach them at 888-637-9429, or locally at 267-936-0837.
thank you for your support and understanding.
