support depot’s flood recovery




in september, devastating floods forced depot’s music studios and gallery to close, damaging equipment and disrupting important creative programmes.
we need your help to recover and ensure depot remains a hub for artists, musicians and our local community. your support will help us restore our creative spaces and allow us to continue to provide a safe space and a springboard for creatives.
every donation, big or small, directly helps us rebuild and thrive.
