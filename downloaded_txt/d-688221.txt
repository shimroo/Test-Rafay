“it was a great experience, especially for the youth. for all of them it was their first time going on a mission trip. the team enjoyed connecting with the community at large through the outreach portion of the program. it was a wonderful experience for all of them.”

carline d. served in savannah, georgia


“it was great! it was a truly remarkable experience. we had the opportunity to connect very well with the community.”

nikki k. served in pikeville, kentucky


“i couldn't have asked for a better trip for my students. the pre-trip training guides were great. it helped change the group's dynamic from okay to amazing.”

christopher g. served in rincon, puerto rico


“it was a positive experience that stretched our kids out of their more comfortable places and exposed them to a new culture, a new area of the world, and a wider expression of the church.”

jeremy m. served among the navajo nation in arizona


“we had an outstanding week! we were able to connect with the community at every opportunity we had. it was amazing how much interaction we were able to experience. the work projects were just right for our team. since we aren't very familiar with construction work, our "people over projects" work was fantastic!”

jennifer s. served in rincon, puerto rico

best mission trips: 18 short term mission opportunities
         join experience mission in 2025 on a faith-based serve and learning trip for youth and adult groups! serve and grow together on one of these 18 short-term mission opportunities. 



what good comes from a short term mission trip?
         it may be surprising that we think everyone should ask this question, but the honest truth is serving others on missionary trips in an unhealthy way can do more harm than good. 



yearning for peace in the holy land
         choosing one side and shouting down the other is what maintains silence in the presence of injustice and allows oppression to continue unchecked. silencing voices will never create a path towards a just peace and reconciliation in the holy land. 



best spring break mission trips in 2025: a complete guide
         at experience mission, we think spring break is the perfect time to unplug from academics and commit to learning to love and serve others like jesus.
