why fish the coquille river


the coquille river and bay in bandon oregon complete a picture of beauty and serenity. views are typically of blue herons, egrets, geese, osprey, and deer as the land on both sides of the river is rich with green pastures. a day of fishing on the coquille river will provide everyone with memories for a lifetime.

the coquille river is unique in the fact that the river changes direction four times a day with the tidal influence
you will troll with the tide from the bay up to the first 13 miles of the river.
there are fewer boats on the coquille putting less pressure on the fish which makes the salmon bite more aggressive

the coquille river offers chinook (king) salmon fresh out of the ocean from mid-august through october, these salmon typically weigh between 18 to 30 pounds with many whoppers from 30 to 45 pounds. the coho (silver) salmon start showing up at the beginning of september through november, they range from 8 to 15 pounds and put up a great fight.
coquille river fishing at bandon
coquille river striped bass:  though these aggressive fighters are here year-round, the really big ones start coming in from the ocean in june and stay through october when they head back out to the ocean.  big striper run around 30 – 35 inches and when they attack a topwater bait it makes your heart skip a beat.  the best fishing is usually early mornings before sunrise into the early morning and late evenings starting before dusk and into late evening hours.
coquille river fall chinook fishery: august thru the end of october we fish the coquille river located just north of bandon near the famous bandon dunes golf course. we fish the tidal-influenced water trolling for nice fall salmon and coho or silvers.
crabbing trips are a great family adventure.  we will crab in the bay which offers us access to lots of dungeness crab without the worry of ocean waves. trips are for two hours and we can take up to five people, this is a good trip for all ages over 4 years old.
coos bay oregon fishing
coos bay fall chinook:  we fish from the tidal waters and up the main rivers of coos bay july through november for kings and coho or silvers. a pleasant fishery with room to fish, lots of fish caught here and they provide the fight of a lifetime.
