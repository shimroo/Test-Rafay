welcome to a free & valuable resource to assist law school applicants, students, & graduates.

the defining feature of this site is the tls forums which historically has been focused primarily on law school applicants with discussion forums such as the law school admissions forum, the lsat prep forum, the personal statement forum, and the choosing a law school forum. however, over the years the forums for law school students and graduates have become quite popular as well especially the bar prep forum, the legal employment forum, and the forum for law school students. a couple of other noteworthy forums are the law school graduates only forum (verification of graduate status required) and the tls lounge (registration required).
