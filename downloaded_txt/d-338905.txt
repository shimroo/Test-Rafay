messing with the word of god

examples of changing the word

we are
                      accused of being king james only.
                      would you rather be accused of being westcott and hort
                        only?
                      all other translations are westcott and hort
                        only except for paraphrased junk 
                      like the living bible and the message.

are you aware
                      that all modern

































                        english "bibles" post 1885 are deliberately
                        corrupted
                      by unbelieving "scholars" who rejected
                      salvation by the blood of jesus?
their names
                        are westcott and hort (w&h).

                      did you know that the "scholars" did
                        not believe in any perfect word of god
                        including their own?
                      "i reject the word infallibility!" -
                      westcott to hort
                      are you following these men who believe there is 
                        no perfect word of god?

why and when i began to study
                          the bible translation issue
                      my journey on this topic began when i received a
                      snail-mail invitation 
                      to a bible study at a law firm in spartanburg sc
                      in1991
                      i read the verse at the top of the invitation and
                      immediately said to myself 
                       god never said that!
                      all modern bibles have the same corrupt text, not
                      just the niv.
                      i examined



























                        the niv first due to the 1991 bible study
                      invitation
any verse that begins with the words "i
                        myself" is a lie
it was luke 1:3 in
                        the niv

                      did you know there are
two sets of "originals"?  
                      they are different and contradictory; how can both
                      be the word of god?

                      chart to enlarge it.

did you know
                      that the english revision of 1885 can not be a
                      better translation since it is not a
                        translation of the same thing?

 did

































                      you know that the 1885 text used was based on the
                      vaticanus



































                        and sinaiticus text
                      both of which subsequently have been proven to be frauds?

did you know the
                      "scholars" lied to the english revision committee
                      1881-1885
                       and secretly
substituted an entirely different underlying
                          text rather than make modest
                      improvements
                      as they promised to the public and the authorities
                      before they began?


at the time of the release of
                        the revised "bible" and afterwards for many
                        years no one (with one
                          notable exception) outside the committee
                        and even inside the committee realized what
                        westcott and hort had actually done.  even
                        solid believers in the word of god (example c i
                        scofield) made an uninformed reference to the
                        "revised version" in the forward of his 1917
                        edition of the king james scofield 
                        reference bible.  however, there are still
                        liars that imply that scofield incorporated the
                        revised text in his 1917 edition when all he did
                        was mention its existence in the preface. the
                        statements about scofield were made as criticism
                        because the critics despise the doctrine of dispensationalism
                        (said doctrine being a clear feature of the
                        bible and scofield commentary). 

                        the one notable immediate exception was dean
                        burgon's utter destruction of the revised
                        "bible" of 1881-1885 in his book the

































                          revision revised.   here are
                        some quotes from
                          burgon's book.


did you know
                      that the "scholars" are lying about the
                        oldest manuscripts?

did you know
                      that the king james textual evidence has 5210





































                        manuscripts?
                      the 1885 text has only 45 manuscripts.

did you know
                        that the bible is not preserved through
                        "scholarship" but by the spirit in believers?
believers via
                      the spirit in them reject false "bibles" and
                      receive true bible texts.
in this manner
                      the true word is
                        preserved and the false is denied.
the bible is not
                      preserved by scholars, but by believers via the
                      holy spirit.

did you know
                      that the entire "seminary" (aka cemetery
                        1900-2024) laodecian community 
                      fell for the 1885 lies because they believed more
                      in scholarship/science than they do the word of
                      god?   
                      they follow men, not god!
                      they did not want to appear to reject
                      "scholarship/science"
                      and they feared men and followed






































                        the $$$. 

did you know god
                      said the english bible would
                        be purified 7 times and the king james is number
                        7?
here are the 7

why? because
                      they want an ecumenical "bible".
are you in
                      agreement with them?

are you a

god is sovereign
                        over all things "bible"

did you know the
                      1885 "scholars" believed


































                        the text of the king james bible was "vile" and
                        "villanous"?
                      so much for saying they simply wanted an
                      easy-to-read "bible".
                       
                      did you know that they changed  study
                        to show thyself approved unto god to be do




































                        your best?  
our




































                        best is "filthy rags."

                      did you know that "scholars"




































                        changed the verse that says the words of god are
                        preserved forever?

                      did you know these "scholars"

































                        removed verses that teach the deity of jesus?

                      did you know that the "scholars" of the 1885
                      "bible" were unbelievers? 
                      they were lost.
and the laodecian
                        church follows them?

                            parenthetical diversion
 
two days ago in the ingles
                        grocery parking lot a woman with whom, along
                        with others (4 in total), we formerly had bible
                        studies, said to me - "you are a false prophet
                        because you said the rapture would come in
                        2022."   after some thought and before
                        she left the parking lot, i yelled across the
                        lot to her, "you are totally ignorant!"  
                        teresa and i had agreed some time ago to stop
                        fellowship with the woman and so we had
                        uninvited her to the bible study.  the
                        reason for withdrawing her invitation was she
                        had no interest whatsoever in what the bible was
                        actually saying and talked constantly about
                        three tv "teachers" who did nothing but
                        constantly misuse the bible to justify pet
                        "political" projects of their own.  
                        the three tv musketeers seemed to me to be
                        working for someone else of which i did not
                        approve.  they were being managed in my
                        view and were not independent bible students.
                        evidence for such manipulation
                          of "bible teachers" is easy to detect and
                        i have had
                          personal experience with some of the
                          manipulated (as far back as 1993).
























                        

                        by the way, i had a similar conversation in 2005
                        with a reader who did not want any discussion of
                        a possible
                          time for the second coming. 
























                        

                        the main point here is that there are no
























                          more prophets during this age and the bible
                          says so.  everyone, who is not brain
                        dead, is now aware that the signs of the second
                        coming have been prevalent for many
                        years.   since prophets are no more
                        (for you pentecostals: tongues are no more
                        either ), no informed bible expositor would ever
                        say they are a prophet, least of all me. 
                        there are denominations that use the title
                        prophet for some staffers and it is a disgusting
                        non-biblical practice.  correlation of
                        current trends and bible verses is not
                        prophecy.  observing facts on the ground is
                        not bible prophecy. even as far back as
                        9-11-2001 (the cause of my opening this
                        website), it was becoming clear that the 2nd
                        coming was nearing. the ever increasing wars in
                        the middle-east are a direct consequence of our
                        deep state and israel (not terrorists)
                        creating the 9-11 events.  furthermore, it
                        is clearly shown here that "no
























                          man knows the day and hour"  is
                        clearly a reference to a post-millennial
























                          event not the rapture and not the second
                          coming.

if you are not born
                      again or you do not know, go here,
                    because you could spend eternity in the lake of
                    fire.  if you are not born again, you will at
                    least go through the tribulation and be guillotined
                    for your new faith.  about salvation, there are

if you are bound up in a
                charismatic church, read this verse:
howbeit







































































































































































































                  when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide
                  you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself;
                  but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and
                  he will shew you things to come. john 16:13
consequently the holy spirit's
                purpose is not to get you to focus on him.  so, if
                that is what you are doing, you are not following the
                bible.  i met a man in dunkin donuts recently and
                he said "the only problem i have with my new church is
                that the preacher does not talk about the spirit
                enough."
                sounds like his preacher is on track at least on this
                subject.  the man is a former catholic and probably
                does not realize that the "spirit" emphasis (pentecostalism)
                is designed to bring protestants back in line with
                catholicism.  the catholic doctrine believes the
                spirit makes you worthy of salvation.  see the
                confusion?  a woman in a local church here said "i
                can not listen to russell because he does not speak in
                tongues."

              word lord is the 49th word
              in the verse.
              the expression here of his
                    name is the 49th
              appearance in the bible.

                        spiritual perfection.

in case you missed this
                  verse, it appears again in proverbs 16:25

 
it seems right if i
                        do this and that i must be saved.  are you
                        positive you are born again or are you simply
                        practicing religion?  going to church,
                        doing good works, being religious do not save
                        you.   you must be born again and there is
                        nothing you can add to the finished work of
                        jesus christ.  

  
in fact, trying to add
                    to the work jesus christ accomplished by dying on
                    the cross is an insult to god.  here are verses to assure you
                      that what jesus did for those who believe is
                      forever.

 

these things have i written unto you that

 what are we to do about the things coming on the earth?
                nothing but
                    wait on the lord.   seek
              peace.
now live peaceably with all men, seek
                  peace with all men, obey those in authority, pray for
                  all leaders, be harmless as a dove, and believe the
                  lord.   let each man be persuaded in his own
                  mind of the truth of god.

now faith is the substance of
              things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.through faith we understand that
              the worlds were framed by the word of god, so that things
              which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

since the bible says that the authorities that exist are
              ordained by god, then, we should always obey those in
              authority in our nation.  the bible says we should
              live quietly and peaceably with all men.  we are to
              be guided into the patient waiting for our lord. we are
              "strangers and pilgrims" in this world, just passing
              through.  life is "just a vapour and vanishes away."
               because of these things, this website has nothing to
              do with politics whatsoever.  let those in charge do
              what they will.  all things are in the lord's hands.
               this website is merely an observer, a study of
              events and developments in the light of scripture.
               the only actions we hope you make are to get right
              with the lord before it is too late.  it is not our
              role to transform society, influence politics, or make the
              world or any of its inhabitants conform to our beliefs.
               this is a matter for the individual to decide -
              whether or not he believes the bible as truth.  if no
              one believes what i say here, i will have done my job
              which is to share my own experience of faith.  if you
              read the bible, you find that jesus is coming back...
               will you be ready???   

   
god bless you and may the sobering
                  reality of god's mercy be your sole source of satisfaction .
               when i say this, it is not some religious platitude.
               the depth of this wish is beyond my ability to
              express in words. 
   
from personal experience, i
              can honestly say there is no substitute for a personal
              study of the word of god.   the word of god performs all the purposes
                    of god .  to neglect the word
              of god is to ignore the almighty himself.

              isaiah 55:11    so shall my word
              be that goeth forth out of my mouth
              : it shall not return unto me void
              , but it shall accomplish that which i
                  please , and it shall
                  prosper in the thing whereto i sent it . 

              this website is not about making "predictions."  this
              website is about watching the news to see how it fits into
              bible prophecy.  as the news develops, we get a
              clearer picture of what the bible is actually saying will
              transpire.  the objective, then, is a synthesis of
              current events and the bible.  an hypothesis may be
              put forward, but only if there is a scriptural basis for
              doing so.  an hypothesis might be wrong, but, the
              bible is never wrong.  i am
                nothing, my opinion means nothing; what the bible
              says is paramount. all hypotheses are left on the site
              (for the sake of honesty), even if they prove to be
              incorrect.  one objective of the site is to stir the
              reader to study the bible for himself.  if you see
              something we need to report, please let us know.  it
              is perfectly clear already that the bible is an amazing book of history told in advance
              .

now live peaceably with all men, seek
                  peace with all men, obey those in authority, pray for
                  all leaders, be harmless as a dove, and believe the
                  lord.   let each man be persuaded in his own
                  mind of the truth of god.

                  foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that

                              quotes from mere men  -   08-31-2003

(john calvin)
                                  " as he is
                                confronted by god [man] must crumple up
                                into utter nothingness ." 

                                  " in our body
                                and soul there is in the eyes of god
                                nothing but repulsive filth. " 

                                  " the more
                                outstanding a man is, the more he is
                                unceasingly goaded by his ambition - an
                                evil which sullies all his virtues so
                                that they lose all merit in the sight of
                                god.  each of us seeks his own, and
                                hence all our own thoughts, words, and
                                works (however well they appear) cannot
                                stand the test of divine judgment . "

                                  "our
                                understanding is so smitten with
                                blindness, our heart and its motions so
                                evil and corrupt, in fact our whole
                                nature so depraved, that we can do
                                nothing else but sin until he himself
                                creates in us a new will ."

sin is not

the issue is
                                not the ten commandments, but authority
                                and whose authority will be obeyed, our
                                own or the almighty's.  at the root
                                of "judgemania" is personal authority
                                run amuck.  endemic to our society
                                and education is the exaltation of our
                                own personal authority.  the reason
                                abortionists ("pro-choicers") and
                                opposers of capital punishment are
                                usually the same people is that both
                                positions allow them to retain their own
                                personal authority.  personal
                                authority is on the throne in this
                                country.  however, fighting against
                                these people is supporting their
                                argument.  once you enter the
                                arena, you will be perceived by them as
                                exercising your personal
                                authority.  you can never argue
                                with an unbeliever about
                                authority.  your arguing proves his
                                point.   it is better
                                to relent to proper authority than
                                demonstrate to the world that you are on
                                the throne.   even the
                                israelites were told to submit to the
                                king of babylon, a pagan.  see
