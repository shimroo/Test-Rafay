celebrating 23 years of
unforgettable beach weddings

founded in 2001 by gayle liteheart, weddings on a whim is dedicated to helping couples have easy florida beach weddings on the gulf coast. gayle was inspired to start the company when she discovered that florida allows couples from outside the state to get married with no waiting period, blood test, or witnesses required. this hassle-free process led her to coin the name “weddings on a whim.”
