“local flavors are as diverse as the monterey county landscape. from the rugged big sur coastline to the prairie lands of arroyo seco, every vineyard develops its own set of diverse flavors. it is our passion to discover these local flavors and produce unfined, unfiltered wines that reflect a sense of place. our meticulous, artisan approach preserves and enhances these local flavors from the finest monterey county vineyards.you’re invited to taste our award winning wines at our carmel valley tasting room.”
– annette hoff, winemaker
