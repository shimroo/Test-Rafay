just wanted to tell you how much i appreciated participating in pitch wars. no other place gives new writers like me one minute of time with those heavy hitters in the publishing world. it was great feedback.  






















[pitch wars] was such a great experience! thank you for organizing, facilitating and creating a community such as paragraph.
