tony and renée gebauer, potterswe make functional, affordable pottery in our destination sales gallery at 8126 kita road in fish creek, wi.  visitors will find two main bodies of work: pots made and fired on site in electric kilns, and pots made on site and fired in wood-fired kilns.our work focuses on traditional wheel-thrown forms:  mugs, cups, bowls, plates, pitchers, vases and many other shapes.   we believe that simple, attractive and well made items are the ones used most frequently as a part of daily life. following this philosophy, our pottery is reasonably priced, fired to stoneware temperatures for durability, and is food safe.we are closed for the season.  we will reopen in may, 2025.if you would like to make a purchase contact renee@trpottery.com
