	 inexpensive led lighting at djs pro audio and lighting!
	 
    


djs is continuing the effort to help everyone transition to earth friendly led lighting with prices that are very hard to pass up.  our current deals include a bright little led par can for as low as $59.99 and an led gobo projector that runs cool enough that you can make your own gobos using transparency film and your own printer (photo quality printers provide the best results).led par cans:the srl-djs6005 is a 196 1/4 led extra short par can that throws a wide swath of color with full rgb mixing using 7 channels of dmx.  there isn't a master fade or strobe feature on these cans.  their optimized to provide optimal color mixing and lots of light.  an excellent stage wash or wall wash fixture, but we're sure you can find other uses for it as well.  definitely the brightest rgb par can available in this price range, and a steal at $59.99.  click here for more information!led gobo projector:the ssdl-6131 archispot boasts a 5 watt solid state led that is both bright and energy efficient.  we've tested these projectors in the show room and got good results in the 20-30 foot range dark club lighting conditions, but in real world they work best in the 10-20 foot range. perfect for small hall use where the lighting is down low for dining or dancing (a wink wink to you wedding dj's out there).  because these projectors run so cool you can create your own gobos using transparency film and your own printer (photo quality printers work best for nice clean edged logos and text).  click here for more information!these deals won't last long.  we bought out entire shipments to get you these prices.  get them before their gone.click here to visit our website!--dj biffdjsupply.com

	 a led gobo projector for under $70!
	 
    


a gobo projector for under $70 that you can make your own gobos for is a bargain hard to pass up.  click here to check out our product page.  check out the advantages of going led with your gobo projects:pros:* ultra low power consumption* almost no heat [at 99% efficient very little heat is produced]* pure white light (previous model was not a pure white led).* print your own gobos using your own printer (1)* will project 35mm slides (no additional hardware required)* no need to cool down before packing* 50,000 hour life expectancy.cons:* 5 watt led has limited brightness* works best in relatively dim lighting environments.the 5 watt led  provides a good 20-30 feet of projection distance in a dim club or intimate dining environment.  it does not show up well in brightly light halls, but out shines most other bargain priced projectors (or anything near it's price).  although bright lighting will wash out the image, moderate color wash of the projection surface produces an attractive effect with little lost of image clarity.  pairs up nicely with any of our led uplighting kits. see our product page for the results we achieved in our pro lighting room [click here].this is not the projector for everyone, but if your projection needs are not exceptionally demanding this projector can save you hundreds of dollars in bulb changes and custom gobos.  over the life of this projector it could save more than a $1000.00 for small event and wedding dj's where every customer can have their own custom cobo that cost only a few dollars in ink and film costs (if not pennies if you print a dozen gobos per sheet).  compare that to our low price for steal gobos of $59.99 each and that's a huge savings.  and you can change gobos in minutes instead of waiting for everything to cool down.click here to check out our product page.(1) results will vary with the quality of printer and transparency film.  best results are achieved with a photo quality printer and transparency film that matches the printers ink/toner specifications.--dj biffdjsupply.com

	 adj/ american dj spectrum led moon flower effect!
	 
    


american djspectrum ledled moon flower effect!djs pro audio and lighting has grabbed a significant percentage of the initial shipment of this outstanding led fixture.  specially designed to get the most out of the high efficiency of led lighting the spectrum led produces a very bright moon flower effect with almost no power consumption (compared to conventional lighting).  it wasn't that long ago that led lighting was expensive and mostly too dim to be effective.  not any more!!!  these lights are priced well within the budget of most mobile dj's with effects that often costs much more using conventional light.   click the link below to read more on this wonderful new led fixture and even see a video of it in action.click here to find out more and/or get yours now!why buy led??in addition to the adj spectrum led, djs carries a variety of led lighting from several manufacturers.  we specialize in these fixtures because of their many benefits.   not to say that we are moving away from conventional dj lighting, but as a leader in all dj lighting solutions djs must stay on top of lighting's future.  led lighting will be a major player in how djs, clubs, businesses, and even home owners light their future.mobile dj:lighter than conventional lights (often less than 1/4 the weight).almost no heat so you can pack up right after turning them off.power consumption is so low that it will run off the same power as your dj equipment and not pop a breaker.no bulbs to replace.  most leds last 50,000 to 100,000 hours. that's on full time for 5 to 10 years.club owner:more effects for the money.  many led effects lights produce effects that are more complex than conventional fixtures costing much more.no moving parts.  most led fixtures use the programmability of the individual leds to produce the effects. this means no moving parts to wear out (very important considering how long the leds last).almost no heat.  lower your cooling costs by not running the high heat producing conventional lighting fixtures.very low power consumption.  lower you energy bill even further with one led light consuming as little as 10% the power of a conventional light of comparable brightness.never replace another bulb saving time and money.  with an expected life span of 50,000 to 100,000 hours (5 to 10 years if never turned off) you will never have to send an employee up a ladder to replace a blow bulb again.cost effective to replace some lights now!  with both the cost of replacement bulbs and power consumption to consider it is often cost effective to replace even some working conventional lights now.  as leds get even brighter the some lights will become nearly all lights very soon.--dj biffdjsupply.com

	 new led bulbs reviewed!
	 
    


eco par 38 and e14 jdr led lamps up for the dj supply review this week are 2 newer products we recently began carrying. the eco led par 38 lamp, and the eco e14 jdr led. both are replacement lamp solutions for those drab par cans, with traditional screw in bases, you’ve been hiding in your closet. these lamps can be screwed into any standard ceramic light socket that runs off 110v.first i’ll discuss the real world application i used with these 2 pieces. the venue i performed at new year’s eve, had tall ceilings with long draped linens streaming the walls. i set up four par 38 cans from eliminator on the floor http://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=66%5feliminatorpar38 and screwed in a red, blue, yellow, and green par 38 led lamp and pointed them straight up. at about 10 feet up the beam was about 6-7 feet wide no heat. as far as actual light and coverage was concerned, i set up a few adj p36 led rgb right beside my other cans. i found when comparing the same color in both pieces, that the led par 38 bulb came in just under the p36led as far as output. blue seemed to be brighter in the led par 38 bulb. the diffused lens on the led 38 obviously ate up some of its output, but on the other hand it had a wider beam spread, than the p36 led. i would use this bulb in a 4 par can chase with a stand like the ls-50 from adj or similar http://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=badjls%2d50&cat=30.now to put the e14 jdr led to the test. i used a simple eliminator octo bar e141 8 bank par chaser http://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=50%5feliminatoroctobar&cat=84. i used 2 reds 2 greens 2 blues, and 2 yellows. i hung the fixture facing downward in front of my rig hitting some dance floor, but also still remaining visible to the dancers on the floor. the glass on the front of this fixture is actually molded around all the diodes, this made for some nice eye candy for the guests at the event. this specialty bulb draws attention because it looks cool. i will also say that some of the colors appear brighter than the others. blue was a color that really stood out. on this lamp i found it is about half the brightness of a 50-watt reflector style bulb. the number one thing i noticed was not the effect of the lamp, but it was the guests staring at it. i would not use this bulb for color mixing, only as an accent or for eye candy. either bulb would look cool in my recessed light cans at home too.anyone who has a standard color bar http://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=50%5feliminatorcolorbar&cat=84 or octo bar should take a look at either bulb option.. no heat..no bulb color fade….ever have the color burn off you color bulb with a puff of smoke because of the heat?to sum up if you need an eye catcher to add a bit of color at 5-8 feet the e14 jdr led is the piece. if you need a little more bang then i would step up to the led par 38.finally for those who like to see it i will include some tech specs on these two pieces:e14 jdr led:-32 led diodes per fixture-approx. 50,000 hrs life-voltage: 110-power draw: 0.9-1.3 watts- low heat operationled par 38 lamp : -70 led diodes per fixture-approx. 50,000 hrs life-voltage: 110-power draw: 0.8 watts-low heat operationboth led bulbs are available in red, green, yellow, blue and white. applications include: recessed lighting fixtures, color projection on walls or other surfaces, truss warming, backlighting a glass or smoked semi-transparent surface, and anything else you can dream up.par 38 ledhttp://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=72%5fecoledpar38lamp&cat=52e14 jdr ledhttp://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=72%5feco%2dlede27jdr&cat=52dennisdjs commercial/dj supplydjsupply.com

omnisistem planet galaxy red laser!i know it is not a new piece, but it looks so darn cool in the show room, i had to post it.the planet galaxy has fifty six (56) 4.95 mw individual red laser diodes.it comes with remote which allows you to choose between all on, blinking, or sound to light. we have them hung sideways on our global square truss http://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=globaltrusssystem1&cat=89i called the manufacture and asked about hanging these sideways. he told me that he has several clubs that have hung them this way for a few years and they have not seen a problem. he continued to say that most likely it will shorten the life of the motor but how much he does not know.control: stand-alone sound activelaser power: 56 x 4.95mw redmounting base:15" x 9.75" x 3.75"sphere diameter: 11"height:12" (base to top of sphere)these pictures are taken with a camera that adjusts for low light, the beams appear flat, they are not…refer to the video for a more accurate reproduction.video:dsl/cable modem: http://www.djsupply.com/blogpics/planetgalaxy256.rmfor dial up: http://www.djsupply.com/blogpics/planetgalaxy56.rmcheck out the planet galaxy on our web site: http://www.djsupply.com/proddetail.asp?prod=64%5fomnisistemplanetgalaxy&cat=31--dj biffdjsupply.com

	 color serato scratch live discs are back!
	 
    


that's right, the red, blue, and gold serato scratch live records are back in stock. we have limited stock from a rather small initial press run. odds are good that they will continue pressing more colored discs, but keep them in limited quantity to keep demand high.there's a new color!  or, rather, a total lack of color. check out the new clear scratch discs.  wonder if they light up under black light??  we'll have to test one out in the shop and see.in the mean time, we have them in stock now! they make great christmas gifts for a final scratch dj, but don't forget to get them in matching pairs.click here to place your order!--dj biffdjsupply.com

	 cortex hdc-1000 now supports keyboards!
	 
    


the much asked for features of keyboard and vbr (variable bit rate)  support has just been added to the latest firmware update for the cortex hdc-1000. now you can use any pc compatible usb keyboard to search and select songs, change display modes, manipulate the menu, and even pitch bend. a much needed feature for those with deep song lists.additional suport for french and spanish has been added and the instant start response time has been brought down to 15 milliseconds. now instant start is, or at least pretty darn close.the hdc-1000 has come a long way in a very short time and you can expect even more features and performance improvements as they refine the controler to meet the demands of real world djs. if you don't have one now odds are good that you may want one in the near future. need more feature than this small control pannel is capable of providing? the soon to release hdc-3000 may be just what you are looking.click here to get one!--dj biffdjsupply.com

	 behringer b-control deejay is back in stock!
	 
    


we have a fresh stock of behringer bcd-2000 dj contolers (the b-control deejay). at $160 this is perhaps the cheapest way to get into the pc dj world and not be bound to the point and click of the mouse. with it's professional quality audio out you can even save on the need for an external sound card (you notebook users know how bad the internal sound cards can sound when amplified). using a standard midi usb interface it is compatible with many other popular dj software packages. a great way to ditch the mouse for those pc dj's who have had enough of the point and click hassles.what happened?? the behringerb-control deejay was pulled from the market for a short time due to a dispute over the software agreement of the supplied software. behringer has respolved the disagreement and has upgraded all of the existing packages to include the new software. we have not tested with the new software, but the b-control was very resonsive in our own tests before it was pulled from the market.click here for more information or to get one for yourself.--dj biffdjsupply.com

	 now carrying ev blue series microphones!
	 
    


ev / blue(two great name are now together!)ravencardinalev (electro voice) has acquired the ever popular "blue" recording microphone company and expanded their line to include two wonderful performance microphones. with the same quality and care put into their famous studio microphones, ev/blue now offers the raven and cardinal. both have the sound pressure tolerance needed to handle live sound environments and superb audio response specially suited for vocal response. unlike most live sound microphones, these microphones sport a large diaphragm giving them superior response and smoothness. both mics also have the frequency response pattern you come to expect from ev and blue.the raven - an extremely responsive dynamic microphone. at $149.99 it is perfect for dj's, karaoke, and anyone needing a fatter sounding microphone where phantom power is not available. karaoke professionals will specially love the sound this mic will provide and still work well with their existing equipment.the cardinal - a condenser mic designed for the more demanding environment of live performance yet still provide studio like clarity and responsiveness. the diaphragm is buried deep in the body greatly reducing it's feed back potential and cutting down on handling noise. at $199.99 this mic is a steal for those looking for the superior sound a condenser mic can provide. make sure your mixer can provide phantom power.click here to check out both mics!--dj biffdjsupply.com
