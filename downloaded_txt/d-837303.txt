classic cars on display at the murphy auto museum


the murphy auto museum is a non-profit museum that boasts a collection of over 50 cars displayed by many collectors from the tri-county area surrounding oxnard, california. it houses a wide variety of classic and special interest vehicles.many great cars in this area have been tucked and are seldom see the light of day and are, therefore, infrequently seen by the general public. when dan murphy retired from his neurosurgery practice in ventura, he set about to form a non-profit museum that would house these great cars.  dan murphy opened the museum on august 2, 2002.the museum is located in a 16000 sq. ft. building, including an "old car showroom" area.  thanks to the assistance of holley gene leffler, the museum now has an extensive vintage clothing display representing all decades from the 1890s to the 1970s.the museum is open every saturday and sunday from 10 am - 4 pm to serve locals and tourists. arrangements can be made at any time for private parties and tours for automotive clubs, assisted living centers, and school groups.vehicles on display1. 1903 curved dash oldsmobile2. 1915 ford model t3. 1927 ford model t pickup4. 1927 packard 343 7 passenger touring5. 1927 willys knight6. 1928 packard 443 dietrich 2/4 coupe7. 1929 buick doctor’s coupe8. 1929 ford model a station wagon9. 1929 packard 640 roadster10. 1930 packard 745 roadster11. 1932 plymouth coupe street rod12. 1934 packard v-12 club sedan13. 1936 cadillac v-12 convertible coupe14. 1936 mercedes 170 cabriolet15. 1937 packard super eight convertible sedan16. 1937 packard street rod17. 1937 packard twelve lebaron town car18. 1937 packard v-12 club sedan19. 1937 rolls royce phantom iii limousine - general montgomery's car20. 1941 packard 120 club coupe21. 1941 packard 160 club coupe22. 1941 packard 180 lebaron limousine23. 1948 ford woodie 24. 1948 packard custom 8 sedan25. 1949 rolls royce silver dawn26. 1951 bentley r type27. 1951 ford woodie28. 1951 packard patrician 400 sedan29. 1952 chevrolet suburban woodie 30. 1953 packard caribbean convertible31. 1954 packard convertible32. 1955 packard caribbean convertible33. 1956 lincoln continental mark ii34. 1956 packard caribbean 2 dr hardtop35. 1958 packard hawk36. 1959 cadillac convertible37. 1960 chevrolet corvette38. 1960 mercedes 300 sl roadster39. 1961 cadillac model 62 coupe40. 1964 1/2 ford mustang convertible41. 1964 mercedes 300 se convertible42. 1965 ford mustang convertible 43. 1966 cadillac convertible44. 1966 chevrolet corvette stingray 45. 1968 oldsmobile hurst silver46. 1969 chevrolet corvette coupe47. 1969 dodge charger r/t 48. 1969 mercedes 300 sel 6.349. 1970 oldsmobile hurst50. 1970 oldsmobile hurst white51. 1969 plymouth road runner52. 1970 chrysler 300 hurst edition hardtop 53. 1972 chevy truck54. 1974 vw karman ghia 55. 1986 drag boat56. 1996 chevrolet impala
