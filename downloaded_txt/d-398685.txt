technical publications


featured publication
recoma ht: rare earth magnets for high temperatures
in permanent magnet applications, the operating temperature is usually limited by the decrease of the coercive field with increasing temperature. to prevent irreversible losses, it is important to consider the shape of the demagnetization curve at opera­ting temperature.
