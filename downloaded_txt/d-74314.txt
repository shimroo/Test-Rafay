satisfied customers



























thought my old 6015 battery charger had bitten the dust, until i was able to get in touch with you. it was a pleasure being able find knowledgeable people willing to spend the time and patience in helping a customer refurbish a 25+ year old associated battery charger. with the help of your schematic and your recommendation of parts and repair procedures, the old charger works just like a new one. i really get a charge out of it.

i have used this battery charger for about two years so far and it is the best one i have ever bought. i am able to use it in any weather condition outside, and then take it back inside and it still works great. charging capability is unbeatable, going from a small lawn mower to a monster truck battery.

we have been using an associated battery charger for eight years now in our battery shop. this unit is in use 6 days a week for about 10 hours each day. i am pleased to tell you it has never failed.

in 1999, we purchased our first set of associated chargers…the units function year in and year out in a safe and reliable manner. their automatic functions perform as expected, and give us the confidence to leave them unattended during the charging process on vessels of great value. we have never had a charger do so much work for so many years.

it is a real pleasure to work with excellent american made equipment. i have been working on boats for many years. i like to invest in good tools, my 6029 battery tester has always performed perfectly, even after years of hard use. just wanted to share that with you. please keep making your products here in the usa.

i have a very old associated/hartman fc70 charger that still works and wonder why would anyone purchase anything else. it was handed down to me from my grandfather and from my best guess it's from the 60's.

i think you hit nail on head recommending the 6002b charger. i want to thank all involved in making me a believer that there is still great customer service. i ended up with a product that works for my application because you took the time to understand what i needed (and got the product to me in very timely manner) and were very professional throughout the process.thank you guys very much!!
