top shelf company with excellent aftercare service. the pricing for their hot tubs is higher than most other manufacturers for a reason. the quality that goes into the manufacturing, materials used and cutting edge smart technology, is well worth the premium paid. this is our second arctic spa tub. the first tub is now 12 years old and even though it has taken a few updating of wearable parts the cedar enclosure (sanded and restrained), the forger plastic base structure of the unit, internal insulation, piping and the spa body hot tub resin.looks like brand new. built to last!

we did our research and visited hot tub retailers in burlington, mississauga, oakville and hamilton before choosing arctic spas in burlington.
this is a canadian made product, and we chose the spa with the bc red cedar surround which is stunning!

first of all, i think these hot tubs are without peer, so you‚Äôre buying a great hot tub, particularly for the cold, unforgiving weather of central british columbia. i bought a tub in may but due entirely to issues at my end i didn‚Äôt take delivery until today, july 21.delivery and setup was by two fine young men, adam and frankie. these fellows were very professional, yet equally personable. they went out of their way to ensure things were done right and to my satisfaction.i recommend arctic spas, and specifically arctic spas kamloops, without reservation.

we recently purchased the kodiak arctic spa. our sales rep, eden kept us informed on the status of our spa and has been a great resource after the sale. the lounger is extremely comfortable and i find it easy to maintain a relaxed position without worrying about floating out of the seat. the spa boy app makes maintaining the correct chemistry a breeze. we couldn‚Äôt be happier with our new arctic spa!

i‚Äôve owned my arctic spa hot tub since 2001. because of the way arctic designs and insulates their hot tubs, the tub hardly runs in sub zero weather. i‚Äôve replaced the entire cover once and the cover ‚Äúskin‚Äù twice in 22 years. owning our arctic spa just got even better! working with wanda shepard yesterday i was able to solve an issue with the cover‚Äôs ‚Äúskin‚Äù. wanda‚Äôs customer service was awesome! her customer service is hands down the best of any business in colorado! we made a great choice 22 years ago when we purchased our arctic spa hot tub.

we purchased our artic spa from heavenly times over 10 years ago. buying this hot tub has been one of the best purchases we have made. my husband and i still use it 3 to 4 times a week. in this unpredictable world we live in, it is so nice to have the reassurance that every time we open the lid to our hot tub, the water will be hot, and we can just relax for at least 20 min.we have been extremely pleased with the spa itself, as well as with the service we have received.

i‚Äôve owned an arctic spa before, and when the time came to get another recently, it was the only spa company i investigated. i have had such great service, from sales to service to everything else imaginable. they treat their customers with respect and consideration, making it easy to love your hot tub and they company you work with in keeping it running perfectly. best tubs, best delivery folks, best technicians, best company in this realm. hands down!

we did a lot of research on hot tubs and artic hot tubs is by far the best quality hot tub you can buy. made in canada and it shows! they are well made, beautifully designed and supported by some of the best sales and service individuals i have ever met. they are truly a team and they have been right by our side during this entire process of being first time hot tub owners. we have the spaboy salt water system and we love it! very easy to use and so great on our skin!
