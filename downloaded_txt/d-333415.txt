got mud? we have solutions. call or email us
about erosion control products for those difficult areas.

here in maryland, the weather changes by the moment year round. installing mats anywhere your horse stands 
for long periods will do a great job protecting hooves and easing joint and back discomfort. you will see the 
difference. our best investment is in our horses and barns. so lets do what we love and get the best return 
on our dollars every time we ride or enjoy our horses. its priceless!

now is the time to put mats in your run-in sheds, wash stall, and of course your horses stall. your farrier will love
the improvement in hoof condition when they stomp flies on a rubber floor. our aisle kit will help reduce slipping and 
make your barn soooo quiet. mats will greatly reduce your bedding cost and labor time. and with all this moisture, ask us about 
special mats or grids for erosion control around the run in, water tank, hay feeder, etc. 

we have mats for every purpose. all kinds. straight edge, interlocking, mats with holes, roll stock, rubber pavers. we also handle stall systems, 
ventilation gates, burlingham sports jumps and accessories  the very best quality items for your barn at a reasonable price. mats for fitness,
crossfit, yoga, aerobics, karate, kids play areas, dog agility and obedience as well.

we would appreciate the opportunity to quote your project.
