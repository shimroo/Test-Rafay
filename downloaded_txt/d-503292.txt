helping pastors be more
                              effective 


                    no one has to tell you how challenging ministry can
                    be. pastors are preaching to people with short
                    attention spans, ministering in change-adverse
                    churches, while reaching out to gospel-resistant
                    communities.  yet, they still bear the
                    responsibility of preaching biblical messages,
                    leading those who attend their churches and reaching
                    new people. the challenge is great. the
                    opportunities are greater. 

                    freshministry exists to help pastors be more
                    effective by providing resources for many and
                    coaching services for a few.
