hour parking spaces on north main st. the numbers of cars allowed to be worked on is questioned by scott and shirley confirmed this as an issue with permitting and license renewals.                                                                                      pires also bought harborone bank at 820 north main st. which citizens bank is rumored to be leasing the property soon so the parking

parking bans for street parking are in force at this time.                                                                                      manny buginga from mjm construction was invited to speak

                              scott invited francine kaiser from westgate lanes to join us as a new prospective member.                                                                                      greg spoke regarding inviting rob may to attend regarding the form-based code. he presented concerns about montello mbta station approved for form-based code which will override current zoning. the congestion for traffic, concentrated housing, and public safety needs as well as the school system being strained was spoken about.                                                      fran from westgate lanes spoke regarding the homeless encampments, rubbish being left on the property from them and their abandonment of items, and in general commercial trucks dumping full loads on their property and on other properties in the westgate mall area. when police are contacted with plate numbers the station says the trucks are registered out of brockton so they cannot help. jay mclaughlin advised to have businesses file complaints at brockton district court with the same information to get these parties to have to come to court. win farwell and all agreed that the drug and mental health issues and free needle programs all contribute to the societal problems. police understaffing as well is an issue.                                                                                      pot shop taxes questioned by gale, win said there are city programs and school programs which are supported but he does not have exact figures. some shops owe money to the state for their licenses and the cannabis control commission regulations are not clear.                                                                                      win spoke about the fairgrounds property: zoning overlay district is being worked on, 1500 to 2000 upscale residences are being proposed. important: project development agreement will be required by the city so that all permitting is in conformance with the agreement.                                                                                      win also stated that our city has dedicated more than enough for social services, drug problems, and homeless issues. “make brockton better before you make it bigger,” stated win.  keep your eyes and ears open so we do not keep losing the battle. all agreed, well said.                                                                                      win as the usual informative source of government process is trying to make us aware of how things work. education concerns like mckinney-vento ruling on the federal level regarding major costs of education and transportation were mentioned as well.

                                                                  pires also bought harborone bank at 820 north main st. which citizens bank is rumored to be leasing the property soon so the parking

                              scott invited francine kaiser from westgate lanes to join us as a new prospective member.                                                                                      greg spoke regarding inviting rob may to attend regarding the form-based code. he presented concerns about montello mbta station approved for form-based code which will override current zoning. the congestion for traffic, concentrated housing, and public safety needs as well as the school system being strained was spoken about.                                                      fran from westgate lanes spoke regarding the homeless encampments, rubbish being left on the property from them and their abandonment of items, and in general commercial trucks dumping full loads on their property and on other properties in the westgate mall area. when police are contacted with plate numbers the station says the trucks are registered out of brockton so they cannot help. jay mclaughlin advised to have businesses file complaints at brockton district court with the same information to get these parties to have to come to court. win farwell and all agreed that the drug and mental health issues and free needle programs all contribute to the societal problems. police understaffing as well is an issue.                                                                                      pot shop taxes questioned by gale, win said there are city programs and school programs which are supported but he does not have exact figures. some shops owe money to the state for their licenses and the cannabis control commission regulations are not clear.                                                                                      win spoke about the fairgrounds property: zoning overlay district is being worked on, 1500 to 2000 upscale residences are being proposed. important: project development agreement will be required by the city so that all permitting is in conformance with the agreement.                                                                                      win also stated that our city has dedicated more than enough for social services, drug problems, and homeless issues. “make brockton better before you make it bigger,” stated win.  keep your eyes and ears open so we do not keep losing the battle. all agreed, well said.                                                                                      win as the usual informative source of government process is trying to make us aware of how things work. education concerns like mckinney-vento ruling on the federal level regarding major costs of education and transportation were mentioned as well.

he did mention the complicated process involved. greg mentioned councilor teixeira who owns mattress maker said his business is down 43% due to unhoused people using drugs and loitering in the area of school st. and montello st. many other businesses there are in the same situation. sgt. hallisey did attend a meeting on zoom which involved mbta and that no trespassing signs will be placed on mbta property. this may aid police to have some power to better the area. the used drug dirty needle subject brought up the brewster ambulance collecting and disposing via the brockton fire department number to report needle pickup at 508-583-2323. this info from capt. williams. court case affecting unhoused martin v. city of boise, idaho ruled unhoused people simply being on public property are not committing any crime. the legal outcomes at different levels of government are yet to be known. mass. law chapter 111 section 122 does require board of health to investigate public health issues. health hazards can lead to getting financial aid from the state. greg mentioned that social services in downtown area should be out in the streets directly offering help to the unhoused; he asked about the pilot program to request non-profits to donate to brockton to help with services already provided in lie of taxes. councilor win said under former late mayor william carpenter the only organization to donate was fr. bill's/mainspring out of all the non-profits. greg again brought up the police details being covered by retirees; derek and win said there would have to be union negotiation. shirley asack read proposed local ordinance to give police rights to enforce pedestrian and traffic issues for the safety of people and drivers. this will be the subject of a vote at brockton city council meeting monday december 11. stay tuned, maybe attend, watch meeting online to see outcome. win said winter is coming fast and for 55 snow plow routes in the city which formerly had 110 vendors there are only 72 pieces of snow equipment available at this time. expect significant delays in school and office openings if this does not get better coverage. dave lynch said there is significant liability and insurance cost which scares off new or former vendors. arpa grants for businesses who have suffered economically can be applied for; contact councilor jack lally for information.  brockton fairgrounds property for sale: city will get a study done to investigate whether it is beneficial for brockton to buy it or not...stay tuned.                                                                  it was a lively discussion, very amicable, and we all want better for brockton. to summarize:  brockton must be a clean and safe city both inside our facilities and outside on all property to promote economic development.

they have legal protection on public ways. police have no power to enforce the homeless being detrimental to our city; the aclu gives cards to the homeless to inform them of their rights. graffiti removal has no funding; formerly work express used to help clean it up. no more help from that group. police force down 25-30 members; adding 15 soon. state retirement rules for police need to be addressed for those who want to continue to serve. mary waldron suggested home rule petition from city council to appeal to state level. guest speakers were jim plouffe the building commissioner [heading building department, public property and zoning board of appeals] and william forte [well experienced with past municipalities, working to build the department, establish policy, coordinate "team" efforts, and involve citizens in the process] who now have joined efforts to merge the health and building departments to create the newly formed inspectional services department of brockton. as of now there are 6 sanitary inspectors, 2 code enforcement officers, 9 building/plumbing/wiring inspectors and office support staff.  of course fire inspection of rental property is part of the public safety effort.. clean city initiative meetings are held twice a month, recent training conferences have been attended, enforcement of flavored/menthol tobacco laws is being addressed, food expiration at local businesses is being addressed, illegal apartments are being sought out, illegal dumping as an issue might be addressed with grants for cameras. there are likely a couple hundred abandoned properties in the city which need attention at some point. residents and businesses may dispose of mattresses and box springs for $20 each at oak hill way. illegal dumping on private property can involve city cleanup but attaches liens on the said property. not fair but at least cleaned up; owners can take more initiative to monitor their own properties. all credited for attendance and efforts to care for brockton. scott dwyer made a motion to adjourn and was seconded at 7:18 pm.
