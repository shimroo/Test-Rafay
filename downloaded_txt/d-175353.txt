inclusion statement
the center for teaching and learning is committed to honoring and upholding the value of all persons while working to create environments in which all students can learn and all educators can teach. we recognize that historically this has not always been the case because of factors such as structural racism, sexism, xenophobia, and ableism. we aim to promote evidence-based equity strategies that recognize the assets that all learners, instructors, and tas bring to the learning environment. we advance marginalized voices through our programs and initiatives and embrace humility to continuously learn about the cultures, histories, stories, and identities of those with whom we engage.
