a spark – to think, learn, try, do. it lies within each ncs student and is ignited by her teachers, her peers, her community, and herself. in our carefully curated environment, she develops skills both inside and outside of the classroom in interdisciplinary and relational ways – preparing her at a high level not just for college, but for her life’s work.



we believe in the power of young women.













































































our core values








at ncs, our students are taught to believe in their individual power and learn to use it to actively engage in any pursuit with excellence, service, courage, and conscience.

service



















courage



















conscience




as an independent girls’ school for grades 4-12, we have deep respect for what young women can and will do.

ncs is a vibrant, special place full of purposeful activity and engagement of the body, mind, and soul. walk into any space at ncs and you’ll see it, feel it. our faculty and staff have the same spark as their students and work together to deliver an unparalleled educational experience by teaching in a deeply relational way.  
students both learn skills required for future success and also internalize how they will personally apply those skills in their lives, learning who they are and how they want to show up in the world.































..



ncs students graduate as curious, critical, and independent thinkers who communicate effectively while using their newfound power in responsible and collective ways. they have a strong sense of their identity that serves as a grounding anchor in an ever-evolving and complex world.  
 
this ability to remain true to themselves—combined with their inner spark—is a powerful force, uniquely developed at ncs.
