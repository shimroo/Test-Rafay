     excellent       based on 10 reviews                      simon milnes  29/09/2023    easy to place an order and fast service.            neil richards  10/02/2023    needed a mounting pole for a gill windsonic instrument at very short notice (late on a friday) and not only did r-p-r turn the order around really fast and get it out to me first thing tuesday morning they supplied a slightly longer custom pole for the same price. excellent service, easy to to talk to on the phone and super helpful. good quality product too. highly recommended.            stephen white  13/01/2023    have dealt with this company over the years and have found to be very helpful and go out of their way to fulfill your needs, their is site very easy to navigate to place order            andy green  02/08/2022    great customer service, i had trouble completing online checkout. a quick call & rpr team efficiently completed my order.            james selby  31/12/2021    kestrel products
an excellent company to deal with. i have used them on several occasions and the service has always been great, the delivery times are fast (bordering on exceptional!)            peter j armstrong  06/04/2018    friendly staff whether on the phone or meeting them in person. best place for kestrel wind meters for yachtsmen and others.  see picture of a kestrel monitoring wind levels at a windy caravan site.  they also have fixed wind and weather systems too for woods/forestry/cranes/festivals and other uses. richard paul russell ltd i would recommend for any wind speed monitoring kit and instrumentation.            scott mabin  06/04/2018    bought a kestrel 1000. arrived quickly, very happy with the service.            saint jorge  05/04/2018    excellent company to use for kestrel products
