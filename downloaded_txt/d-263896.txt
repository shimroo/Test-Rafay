                                        i appreciated your service almost more than the arrangement itself.  it was calming to know where it was in the process and to see it safely delivered.

                                        my daughter is a student at cornell and i wanted to surprise her with a flowering plant for her birthday. i don’t live in the area, and found michaleens online. they delivered a gardenia plant that was perfection. their customer service is exceptional. i highly recommend michaleens for all your floral needs. (i rarely submit reviews but i’m posting because they deserve 10 stars!)

                                        michaleen's exceeded our expectations for a memorial service celebrating a family friend. the piece was absolutely beautiful and accidentally the biggest at the funeral home! they got a good chuckle out of figuring out who outdid them, and were very appreciative to know their loved one was so loved by others. i will definitely be contacting them again if i have any floral needs in the area!

                                        staff and florist listened very well to a first-time, young customer's floral arrangement requests.  they designed a beautiful arrangement and taught him a few things throughout the process.  flowers were beautifully presented and happily received.  thank you!
