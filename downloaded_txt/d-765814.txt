            capital sourcing
          










there’s more to growing your business than increasing the bottom line.we work closely with businesses to ensure they’re funding their growth to meet short-term opportunities while maximizing their company’s long-term value.








            business valuation
          










there are many reasons a business owner may ask, “what’s my company worth?” to determine the correct value in every scenario, decosimo’s seasoned and credentialed valuation experts work closely with clients to understand “the essence” of their business. 








            strategic advisory
          










it’s never too early for a business owner to start thinking about maximizing value.whether improving operations, cleaning up the cap table, or growing through acquisition, owners need the right strategy and the right partner to maximize the value of their company.with more than 50 years of experience working with independent middle-market businesses, we bring the knowledge and understanding critical to helping companies align financial strategy with long-term goals. 








            decosimo capital
          










every capital raise is different. that’s why business owners need a partner who not only understands their needs but can ensure that flexible funds are available when they’re needed. along with our investor partners, we created decosimo capital as a ready source of financing for our clients.
