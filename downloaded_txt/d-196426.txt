surfing with the hydra tour 2025
touring with joe is always a pleasure and an honor. he is my favorite guitarist to jam with, and now we have another opportunity to take it to the stage. i feel as though we are both at the top of our game, and the show will be a powerful celebration of the coolest instrument in the world, the electric guitar!
