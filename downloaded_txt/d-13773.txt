stop talkingthe first new song in 10 years - out now














    stream | order ltd. 7” vinyl
  

 

from justin:as far as the song’s content is concerned, i think it speaks for itself. somewhat related, i will say that once i realized i was a middle aged mess, a couple thoughts simultaneously occurred to me:1. i still feel like an awkward teenager all the time.2. i’m pretty certain i have unresolved “issues” from childhood i’ve never looked into.3. i do not communicate the same way as the majority of the people i’m around on a daily basis and it drives them all cuckoo bananas.4. most of the recurring problems in my life have to do with… wait for it… me. hi, i’m the problem, it’s me. only not in a depressing way, but more of a revelatory way.hopefully that made some sense. and if you weren’t aware of it before, i’m long-winded as fuck. both via text and definitely in person. as my kid likes to say, “dad, you’re a lot.”
