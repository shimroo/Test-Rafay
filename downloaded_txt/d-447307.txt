we have recently used ambientlight for 360 tours of our luxury holiday lodges. the fact that i had been given his information on a recommendation speaks volumes in itself! on meeting carl i found him friendly & professional, with an obvious enthusiasm for the work he produces. the end result is fantastic and i would not hesitate to recommend his services to anyone.

hi there, i’m carl, your local virtual tour creator
 
based in suffolk, carl lamb of ambientlight has been creating interactive virtual tours since 2002.
early in 2012, after seeing the cutting edge work carl was producing, google called and asked if he’d like to be part of an exciting new project, bringing google street view inside local businesses. after a period of training and certification, carl became one of very few google professionals in the country able to add google street view inside local businesses and soon earned several awards from google for his street view tours.
carl now provides a variety of 360° imaging services, helping businesses win new customers with stunning interactive virtual tours.
