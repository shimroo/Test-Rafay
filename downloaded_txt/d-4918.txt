the mja acknowledges the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we live and work across australia. we recognise that aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples were the first healers, researchers and sharers of knowledge in australia. we recognise the ongoing impacts of colonisation and intergenerational trauma on aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples and are committed to using our position as australia’s leading medical journal to work with aboriginal and torres strait islander researchers, authors and health and medical professionals to share knowledge, build capacity, and translate research to improve health and wellbeing and to close the gap in health outcomes. we recognise the importance of self-determination and indigenous knowledges, and are committed to advancing aboriginal and torres strait islander health research leadership, governance, and participation through the work that we publish and our publishing practices.
