keys to identifying species.
miscellany: files misplaced when the old navigation bar was lost.
list of publications: jorge quiñónez compiled a list of recent publications  about rhipsalis.        
rhipsalis experts: a long time ago, we laboriously added outstanding rhipsalis academic research by   dr. alice 
          calvente and dr. nadja 
              korotkova  to this website, along with 
          many references from older sources. now a user can find just about 
          every historical name cross referenced to its currently accepted species 
          name with all the cited information. these researchers are today's experts on rhipsalis. the rest of us are pretenders.
