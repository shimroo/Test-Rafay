premium products that make a statement



at borgert, our beauty isn’t only skin deep—just look inside and see we use the finest ingredients available. we have the good fortune to be located in an area that is abundant in granite, making us the only manufacturer in the midwest using granite aggregates in our products.
granite is famous for its strength, hardness and eternity. building materials made with granite aggregates have a reputation for being virtually indestructible. that is why concrete pavers made with granite can provide a long term solution for anyone who wants their pavement to last a lifetime. what more peace of mind could you ask for?
