the sewanee pledge


plan to do something cool. we'll cover the rest.





sewanee provides funding for an approved summer internship or research fellowship, a semester-long study abroad opportunity at no additional tuition cost, and the ability to graduate with one major in four years. of course, you will have to do your part. if you meet sewanee’s academic and social expectations, these opportunities will be provided.




our promise to you
























programs of study


38 majors, 44 minors, 3 certificates & more





our small classes mean that your voice will be heard, your contribution will be expected, and your opinion will be listened to (and disagreed with, and challenged, and seen from a different perspective, and pushed in a new direction, and considered—and you know what? maybe we’re both right. see how it works?).




explore majors & minors
























campus life


welcome movers, shakers, dreamers, explorers, and soon-to-be lifelong friends.





we're a community where everyone has a place and there's a place for everyone. group study? we'll bring our notes. rock climbing? we're geared up and ready. jam session? sure, we'll play with you. whatever you want to do, at sewanee, you'll never have to go it alone. unless you need your space. then, we totally get it.
