justin bieber might be a daddy





while many of us are laughing at the newest allegations that justin bieber fathered a child there are some that are wondering if what 20-year-old mariah yeater is saying is true or not. she has went as far as going to the court and filing a suit claiming that justin bieber did in fact father her 3-month-son, tristyn anthony markhouse yeater.  according to ms. yeater the two got hot and heavy for 30 seconds on a shelf in a bathroom at the staple center after one of his concerts. ummmm, i'm not believing. 



she supposedly tried contacting his pr people when she found out later she was pregnant but no one ever called her back. it all sounds bogus to me, especially reading the court details. but the one thing that really makes me laugh....she was 19 and he was only 16 which would mean statutory rape for her if it does turn out this is his kid. she's trying to get justin bieber to take a paternity test to see if this really is his baby and then go after him for child support.

what's bieber say about it all, not too much but he did tweet: "so i'm going to ignore the rumors...and focus on what is real. love yall!


according to nydailynews his spokesperson matthew hiltzik has denied the allegations stating:
"it malicious, defamatory and demonstrably false.  we will vigorously pursue all available legal remedies to defend and protect justin against these allegations,” his statement, made previously to the daily news, added.

hopefully this will all end soon for bieber and he can focus on his wonderful fans and music. don't forget about his newest cd coming out later this month, "under the mistletoe'.

kate hudson: back in the states to take ryder to school











it seems that kate hudson had a relaxing but fun summer this year.  she spent a good majority of that with her son ryder and boyfriend, matt bellamy.  matt has been on tour with his band all over london and kate followed him around. according to magazines kate is actually happy hanging out at the moment and not jumping into any other movie roles for a while. i loved seeing the pictures of kate riding around town with her darling little boy ryder. most moms would never dare to ride a scooter.

rumor alert: britney spears & jamie lynn spears to duo wedding





the rumor according to all the gossip magazines in the stores are britney and her little sister, jamie lynn spears are to be having their weddings together on the same day. but if you go with what people magazine is reporting today that isn't happening.


people:
...soaking up the sun with boyfriend jason trawick during their recent hawaiian getaway, the pop star toured a wedding chapel at maui's grand wailea resort on thursday and, two days later, teared up while watching a wedding below their hotel room balcony.
as you can see, this happy couple don't want to make any comment on the future and it seems to be friends or people that know them that are talking. which just shows me that even if the rumor were true we'd never know until the wedding day. course in the meantime jamie lynn and casey aldridge seems to be reconnecting, of course this could be for the sake of their little girl or maybe a little time away did the two some good. who knows? one thing is for certain, maddie is a little cutie in her pigtails.

jamie lynn spears back with casey aldridge?






rumor has it that jamie lynn spears, little sister to britney spears, is getting back together with her baby daddy, casey aldridge. is this true? no one knows for sure, but one thing everyone is asking is "why?" 

casey and jamie were spotted at a lady gaga concert earlier this week. some believe they are trying to make it work out one last time for the sake of their little girl. what's your opinion? could this couple forgive and forget? i think it's possible.
