tebori



doug aka horihyo has been tattooing for 27 years and doing tebori for 13 years. he has trained under his sensei, ryugen from tokyo japan and is a member of the ryugendo family. when ryugen decided that doug was ready to tattoo tebori ryugen chose a name that he thought best suits his personality and style. it was a great honor for doug to be given the name horihyo, which translates to tattoo leopard (hori ‘tattoo’ and hyo ‘leopard’).



tebori (te ‘hand’ and bori ‘carve’) is the traditional method of tattooing by hand that has been practiced for over 400 years in japan. the tattoo instrument consists of a set of needles attached to an ebony, metal, or plastic handle called a sashibo. the needles used in tebori are the same stainless steel needles used in machine tattooing, and the different needle configurations are handmade by the artist.



though tebori may sound and look painful, clients find it is less painful than machine tattooing. the skin also heals quicker, as there is less inflammation and trauma to the skin than from work done with a machine.















when creating a tebori piece, horihyo will line the design by machine, and do the color and shading by hand.
