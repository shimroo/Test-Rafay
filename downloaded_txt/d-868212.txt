the  triple  h  net  history 


for over 48 years, the triple h net has awarded more than 990 worked-all-states certificates to radio operators in all 50 states and 17 dxcc countries.  however, there are over thirty other types of award certificates one can obtain for the various kinds of contacts made on the net, the majority of them capable of multiple endorsements.  the first net secretary, irwin mattes, wb8ssr (now a silent key), used to make each award by hand.  as more award possibilities were introduced in the middle 1980's, wb6fni (now w7ftt) was asked to make all extra award certificates.  when wb8ssr became a silent key, then all awards were generated by w7ftt using 'publisher' software and new ink-jet printers.  the number of issued awards and endorsements are at least 5575!

        the net operates 364 days/year on a frequency of 7.190 mhz, starting at 0700 z.  the first thirty minutes are dedicated to check-ins, with preference given first and foremost to dx stations.  the stateside check-ins are taken according to call districts that coincide with the day of the month. on new year's eve, there is the annual triple h net qso-party, held exclusively for net members (those who have earned was certificates on the triple h net).

        the net has a free and open qsl bureau, first operated by bernie chap, wb0eyt, now a silent key.  roger attwell, wa7cyy (later wn7m), of everett, wa assumed operating the bureau until his passing in 2019.  kathy fial, kg7ult (xyl of ron, ko7v) is now operating the new bureau.

        there are a number of official net control stations (ncs's) that maintain and control the nightly operations, even under and despite difficult band conditions.  ncs stations include mark nodine, kj6ms, ron fial, ko7v, john burgess, kc5k and glenn thurman, kn6z.  in addition, tom polhamus, ki7kxp mirrors the list for netlogger app users.

        there are many other stations that help as 'officially designated relays'.
