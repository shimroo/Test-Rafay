march 12, 2025 8:00 am - 3:30 pm

                            for many practitioners, endodontics is a forever unfolding mystery, especially when it comes to diagnosis and treatment options. patient expectations, pain, uncertainty of treatment outcomes and implant therapy often lead the clinician to make referrals outside of the endodontic specialty.
