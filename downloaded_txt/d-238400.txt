british bespoke tailoring
we’re well-known for taking a straightforward, no-nonsense approach to tailoring. we feel the formula for a good suit is pretty simple. it’s about a slim-cut silhouette and a soft comfortable make – a suit should be a pleasure to wear. if you’re new to quality tailoring, you may not be familiar with these terms. however, fine tailoring is an art and expression.
















about us
our team of cutters, tailors and makers have been honing their skills on london’s famous savile row for the last 35 years.
