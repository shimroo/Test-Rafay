your stories








jamie delude, oklahoma
"we just purchased our 2018 big easy last spring. our fascination with the big easy started around 10 years ago when they first came out. we looked at them during the tulsa boat show. we owned another bass boat and pontoon and we finally decided to turn two boats into one and we couldn't be happier. "
