taking a break
powerratings.com
      has been online since august 1997. over the years, we have made mathematical forecasts for
      tens of thousands of games in four sports. time to take a little break. we are passing on
      covering baseball for the 2024 season.

baseball forecasts require more record keeping and labor than any other sport. in
      addition to maintaining ratings for each mlb team, we must evaluate the pitching prowess
      on each team. obviously, a team is more likely to perform well with their #1 starter on
      the mound than their #5 guy. throw in rainouts and impromptu double header scheduling and
      baseball becomes a labor intensive sport to cover. time to take a little time off ... we
      will be back when footballs fly though the air in september.

not to worry. we will cover college basketball through the championship game and
      the nhl through the stanley cup finals.
