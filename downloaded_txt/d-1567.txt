                        just because i’m not on campus doesn’t mean i can’t be involved. … as i always say, i am on a mission to bring people together, and my time at odu has allowed for me to do just that.

                        at odu, learning doesn’t just take place in the classroom. it happens behind the camera, on stage, in the production room, or anywhere your major takes you. … i finally have 'my thing'.
