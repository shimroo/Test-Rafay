		jeffreyrunning.com is proudly promoting the newest sport to come to the 
		local running community - the double road race.  this is an exciting 
		race where you will compete in a 10k and after having a halftime where 
		you relax, rest and recover then you will finish with a 5k. if that is 
		too much for you, no worries, there is also a solo 5k as well as a 1 
		mile kid's run. 


		the first ever double road to be held in south florida will be on may 
		18th in ft. 
		lauderdale.

register now and use promo code "jon" to get a discount.


		don't miss out on the double road race!
