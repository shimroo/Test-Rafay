welcome from the executive dean

our mission is to better understand the complexity of life on earth from molecules to ecosystems. we push the boundaries of fundamental bioscience underpinning health, development and disease of humans, animals, plants and microbes. we apply these discoveries to global challenges including sustainable agriculture and ecosystems, healthy ageing and the prevention and treatment of infectious and non-infectious disease, as part of a collective effort to inspire the next generation of biological scientists and build global resilience for the future.
