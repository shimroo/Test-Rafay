				the covid-19 situation is still evolving. no matter the change, our first priority will always be the health and well being of our customers, staff, and partners. we are monitoring and adapting all health and safety recommendations as currently expressed by federal, state, and local authorities. we will be updating our procedures and policies as required for the health of our communities.
			

				as always, our master bed makers, warehouse, and support teams are still on the payroll, ready to provide safe, reliable service.

				and have learned again and again, working together, the american spirit will always prevail.
			

				these days a good nights' sleep is more important than ever and we're here to give you exactly that.

why rogers?


factory direct prices

                        we design and build the beds we make and only sell direct from our showrooms and website.
                        this eliminates middleman markups and allows us to sell for less.
                    


100 day trial

                        we at charles p. rogers are committed to ensuring your utmost comfort. our 100 day comfort trial is designed to give you the
                        peace of mind to adjust the comfort, exchange your mattress for another model of the same size, or return it for a refund, if
                        you're not completely satisfied.
                    


low monthly payments

                        a new bed or mattress is a big purchase, that's why we offer monthly payment plans.
                        take 12 months to pay, interest free. click here to see your lowest possible monthly
                        payment on a new bed or mattress.
