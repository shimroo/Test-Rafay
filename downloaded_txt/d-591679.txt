 freshwater institute

















introduction
our oceans are under pressure from the increasing demands of a growing population, resulting in sustainability challenges for our seafood supply.

 
advancing aquaculture & water quality
the conservation fund’s freshwater institute is addressing those challenges by advancing sustainable practices that create a robust aquaculture industry with a goal of reducing dependence on seafood imports and ensuring everyone has access to high-quality, safe and nutritious seafood. we spearhead pioneering research, technological innovations and industry collaborations, shaping solutions that minimize environmental impact and meet the evolving demands of consumers.
our work has included innovations for improving fish farm efficiency, productivity, and environmental performance. for example, we have innovated ai-based tools for farm management, identified faster-growing strains of commercial species, and created practices that improve quality and encourage consumers to eat more seafood. we’re also reducing environmental impacts in creative ways like creating marketable products from fish waste.






program highlights

over 35 years of applied research directly benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment
innovated fundamental technologies used in today’s growing land-based aquaculture industry
creating a sustainable seafood supply for the future









publications 
the freshwater institute specializes in the research and design of aquaculture systems technology, as well as solutions to water-quality constraints and impacts. we publish our findings for both science and industry.
