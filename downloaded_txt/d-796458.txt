the poppy war


“i have no doubt this will end up being the best fantasy debut of the year [...] i have absolutely no doubt that [kuang’s] name will be up there with the likes of robin hobb and n.k. jemisin.” -- booknesta library journal, paste magazine, vulture, bookbub, and entropy best books of 2018 pick!washington post "5 best science fiction and fantasy novel of 2018" pick!a bustle "30 best fiction books of 2018" pick!a brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of china’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of ken liu’s grace of kings and n.k. jemisin’s inheritance trilogy.when rin aced the keju—the empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from rooster province could pass without cheating; to rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. that she got into sinegard—the most elite military school in nikan—was even more surprising.but surprises aren’t always good.because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at sinegard. targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.for while the nikara empire is at peace, the federation of mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. the militarily advanced federation occupied nikan for decades after the first poppy war, and only barely lost the continent in the second. and while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a third poppy war is just a spark away . . .rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. but as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.











china in ten words


from one of china's most acclaimed writers, his first work of nonfiction to appear in english: a unique, intimate look at the chinese experience over the last several decades, told through personal stories and astute analysis that sharply illuminate the country's meteoric economic and social transformation.framed by ten phrases common in the chinese vernacular-"people," "leader," "reading," "writing," "lu xun" (one of the most influential chinese writers of the twentieth century), "disparity," "revolution," "grassroots," "copycat," and "bamboozle"-china in ten words reveals as never before the world's most populous yet oft-misunderstood nation. in "disparity," for example, yu hua illustrates the mind-boggling economic gaps that separate citizens of the country. in "copycat," he depicts the escalating trend of piracy and imitation as a creative new form of revolutionary action. and in "bamboozle," he describes the increasingly brazen practices of trickery, fraud, and chicanery that are, he suggests, becoming a way of life at every level of society.characterized by yu hua's trademark wit, insight, and courage, china in ten words is a refreshingly candid vision of the "chinese miracle" and all its consequences, from the singularly invaluable perspective of a writer living in china today.











american born chinese


original series now available on disney+a tour-de-force by new york times bestselling graphic novelist gene yang, american born chinese tells the story of three apparently unrelated characters: jin wang, who moves to a new neighborhood with his family only to discover that he's the only chinese-american student at his new school; the powerful monkey king, subject of one of the oldest and greatest chinese fables; and chin-kee, a personification of the ultimate negative chinese stereotype, who is ruining his cousin danny's life with his yearly visits. their lives and stories come together with an unexpected twist in this action-packed modern fable. american born chinese is an amazing ride, all the way up to the astonishing climax.american born chinese is the winner of the 2007 michael l. printz award, a 2006 national book award finalist for young people's literature, the winner of the 2007 eisner award for best graphic album: new, an eisner award nominee for best coloring, a 2007 bank street best children's book of the year, and a new york times bestseller.











the joy luck club


“the joy luck club is one of my favorite books. from the moment i first started reading it, i knew it was going to be incredible. for me, it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime reading experiences that you cherish forever. it inspired me as a writer and still remains hugely inspirational.” —kevin kwan, author of crazy rich asiansamy tan’s beloved, new york times bestselling tale of mothers and daughters, now the focus of a new documentary amy tan: unintended memoir on netflixfour mothers, four daughters, four families whose histories shift with the four winds depending on who's "saying" the stories. in 1949 four chinese women, recent immigrants to san francisco, begin meeting to eat dim sum, play mahjong, and talk. united in shared unspeakable loss and hope, they call themselves the joy luck club. rather than sink into tragedy, they choose to gather to raise their spirits and money. "to despair was to wish back for something already lost. or to prolong what was already unbearable." forty years later the stories and history continue.with wit and sensitivity, amy tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. as each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.











the nom wah cookbook


a recommended book from:bon appetit * the new york times book review * epicurious * plate * saveur * grub street * wired * the spruce eats * conde nast traveler * food & wine * heatedfor the last 100 years, nom wah tea parlor has been slinging some of the world's greatest dim sum from new york's chinatown. now owner wilson tang tells the story of how the restaurant came to be--and how to prepare their legendary dishes in your own home.nom wah tea parlor isn't simply the story of dumplings, though there are many folds to it. it isn't the story of bao, though there is much filling. it's not just the story of dim sum, although there are scores and scores of recipes. it's the story of a community of chinese immigrants who struggled, flourished, cooked, and ate with abandon in new york city. (who now struggle, flourish, cook, and eat with abandon in new york city.) it's a journey that begins in toishan, runs through hong kong, and ends up tucked into the corner of a street once called the bloody angle.in this book, nom wah's owner, wilson tang, takes us into the hardworking kitchen of nom wah and emerges with 75 easy-to-make recipes: from bao to vegetables, noodles to desserts, cakes, rice rolls, chef's specials, dumplings, and more.we're also introduced to characters like mei lum, the fifth-generation owner of porcelain shop wing on wo, and joanne kwong, the lawyer-turned-owner of pearl river mart. he paints a portrait of what chinatown in new york city is in 2020. as wilson, who quit a job in finance to take over the once-ailing family business, struggles with the dilemma of immigrant children--to jettison tradition or to cling to it--he also points to a new way: to savor tradition while moving forward. a book for har gow lovers and rice roll junkies, the nom wah cookbook portrays a culture at a crossroads.

a new collection of hilarious, intergenerational anecdotes full of absurd detail about everyday experiences of racism from the new york times bestselling authors of you'll never believe what happened to lacey, comedian amber ruffin and her sister lacey.families may not always see eye to eye; we get on each other's nerves, have different perspectives and lives--especially when we consider how we've grown up in different generations. but for the ruffin family and many others, there has been one constant that connects them: racism hasn't gone anywhere.from her raucous musical numbers to turning upsetting news into laughs as the host of the amber ruffin show or in her late night with seth meyers segments, amber is no stranger to finding the funny wherever she looks. with equal parts heart and humor, she and her sister lacey lamar shared some of the eye-opening and outrageous experiences lacey had faced in nebraska in their first book. now, the dynamic duo makes it clear--lacey isn't the only one in the family with ridiculous encounters to share! amber and lacey have many more uproarious stories, both from their own lives and the entire ruffin family.recounting the wildest tales of racism from their parents, their siblings, and amber's nieces and nephews, this intergenerational look at ludicrous (but all too believable) everyday racism as experienced across age, gender, and appearance will have you gasping with shock and laughter in turn. validating for anyone who has first-hand experience, and revealing for anyone who doesn't, amber and lacey's next book helps us all find the absurdity in the pervasive frustrations of racism. illuminating and packed with love and laughter, this is a must-read for just about everyone.











no right to an honest living


winner of the pulitzer prize in historya "sensitive, immersive, and exhaustive" portrait of black workers and white hypocrisy in nineteenth-century boston, from "a gifted practitioner of labor history and urban history" (tiya miles, national book award-winning author of all that she carried)impassioned antislavery rhetoric made antebellum boston famous as the nation's hub of radical abolitionism. in fact, however, the city was far from a beacon of equality. in no right to an honest living, historian jacqueline jones reveals how boston was the united states writ small: a place where the soaring rhetoric of egalitarianism was easy, but justice in the workplace was elusive. before, during, and after the civil war, white abolitionists and republicans refused to secure equal employment opportunity for black bostonians, condemning most of them to poverty. still, jones finds, some black entrepreneurs ingeniously created their own jobs and forged their own career paths. highlighting the everyday struggles of ordinary black workers, this book shows how injustice in the workplace prevented boston--and the united states--from securing true equality for all.











black folk


there have been countless books, articles, and televised reports in recent years about the almost mythic "white working class," a tide of commentary that has obscured the labor, and even the very existence, of entire groups of working people, including everyday black workers. in this brilliant corrective, black folk, acclaimed historian blair lm kelley restores the black working class to the center of the american story.spanning two hundred years--from one of kelley's earliest known ancestors, an enslaved blacksmith, to the essential workers of the covid-19 pandemic--black folk highlights the lives of the laundresses, pullman porters, domestic maids, and postal workers who established the black working class as a force in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. taking jobs white people didn't want and confined to segregated neighborhoods, black workers found community in intimate spaces, from stoops on city streets to the backyards of washerwomen, where multiple generations labored from dawn to dusk, talking and laughing in a space free of white supervision and largely beyond white knowledge. as millions of black people left the violence of the american south for the promise of a better life in the north and west, these networks of resistance and joy sustained early arrivals and newcomers alike and laid the groundwork for organizing for better jobs, better pay, and equal rights.as her narrative moves from georgia to philadelphia, florida to chicago, texas to oakland, kelley treats black workers not just as laborers, or members of a class, or activists, but as people whose daily experiences mattered--to themselves, to their communities, and to a nation that denied that basic fact. through affecting portraits of her great-grandfather, a sharecropper named solicitor, and her grandmother, brunell, who worked for more than a decade as a domestic maid, kelley captures, in intimate detail, how generation after generation of labor was required to improve, and at times maintain, her family's status. yet her family, like so many others, was always animated by a vision of a better future. the church yards, factory floors, railcars, and postal sorting facilities where black people worked were sites of possibility, and, as kelley suggests, amazon package processing centers, supermarkets, and nursing homes can be the same today. with the resurgence of labor activism in our own time, black folk presents a stirring history of our possible future.











stamped: racism, antiracism, and you


a timely, crucial, and empowering exploration of racism--and antiracism--in america

this is not a history book.
this is a book about the here and now. 
a book to help us better understand why we are where we are.
a book about race. 

the construct of race has always been used to gain and keep power, to create dynamics that separate and silence. this remarkable reimagining of dr. ibram x. kendi's national book award-winning stamped from the beginning reveals the history of racist ideas in america, and inspires hope for an antiracist future. it takes you on a race journey from then to now, shows you why we feel how we feel, and why the poison of racism lingers. it also proves that while racist ideas have always been easy to fabricate and distribute, they can also be discredited.

through a gripping, fast-paced, and energizing narrative written by beloved award-winner jason reynolds, this book shines a light on the many insidious forms of racist ideas--and on ways readers can identify and stamp out racist thoughts in their daily lives.

jasmine and chelsea are best friends on a mission--they're sick of the way women are treated even at their progressive nyc high school, so they decide to start a women's rights club. they post their work online--poems, essays, videos of chelsea performing her poetry, and jasmine's response to the racial microaggressions she experiences--and soon they go viral. but with such positive support, the club is also targeted by trolls. when things escalate in real life, the principal shuts the club down. not willing to be silenced, jasmine and chelsea will risk everything for their voices--and those of other young women--to be heard.
these two dynamic, creative young women stand up and speak out in a novel that features their compelling art and poetry along with powerful personal journeys that will inspire readers and budding poets, feminists, and activists.

i know why the caged bird sings


here is a book as joyous and painful, as mysterious and memorable, as childhood itself. i know why the caged bird sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. maya angelou’s debut memoir is a modern american classic beloved worldwide.
 
sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small southern town, maya and her brother, bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” at eight years old and back at her mother’s side in st. louis, maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. years later, in san francisco, maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“i met and fell in love with william shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.
 
poetic and powerful, i know why the caged bird sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.

“i know why the caged bird sings liberates the reader into life simply because maya angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.”—james baldwin











to kill a mockingbird


voted america's best-loved novel in pbs's the great american read
harper lee's pulitzer prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep south—and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred
one of the most cherished stories of all time, to kill a mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. a gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a south poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father—a crusading local lawyer—risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.











whatever happened to interracial love?


“from the first page you know you're in the hands of an exceptional writer… i adored this book.” —zadie smith
“sexy and radical and intimate.” —miranda july
named a best book of 2016 by vice, elle, nylon, publishers weekly and npr
named one of the most anticipated books of the fall by the huffington post, new york, the boston globe, lit hub, and the millions
 
now available in ecco’s art of the story series: a never-before-published collection of stories from a brilliant yet little known african american artist and filmmaker—a contemporary of revered writers including toni cade bambara, laurie colwin, ann beattie, amy hempel, and grace paley—whose prescient work has recently resurfaced to wide acclaim.
humorous, poignant, perceptive, and full of grace, kathleen collins’s stories masterfully blend the quotidian and the profound in a personal, intimate way, exploring deep, far-reaching issues—race, gender, family, and sexuality—that shape the ordinary moments in our lives.
in “the uncle,” a young girl who idolizes her handsome uncle and his beautiful wife makes a haunting discovery about their lives. in “only once,” a woman reminisces about her charming daredevil of a lover and his ultimate—and final—act of foolishness. collins’s work seamlessly integrates the african-american experience in her characters’ lives, creating rich, devastatingly familiar, full-bodied men, women, and children who transcend the symbolic, penetrating both the reader’s head and heart.
both contemporary and timeless, whatever happened to interracial love? is a major addition to the literary canon, and is sure to earn kathleen collins the widespread recognition she is long overdue.

“a profound impact on hurston’s literary legacy.”—new york times
“one of the greatest writers of our time.”—toni morrison
“zora neale hurston’s genius has once again produced a maestrapiece.”—alice walker
a major literary event: a newly published work from the author of the american classic their eyes were watching god, with a foreword from pulitzer prize-winning author alice walker, brilliantly illuminates the horror and injustices of slavery as it tells the true story of one of the last-known survivors of the atlantic slave trade—abducted from africa on the last "black cargo" ship to arrive in the united states.
in 1927, zora neale hurston went to plateau, alabama, just outside mobile, to interview eighty-six-year-old cudjo lewis. of the millions of men, women, and children transported from africa to america as slaves, cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation’s history. hurston was there to record cudjo’s firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the united states.
in 1931, hurston returned to plateau, the african-centric community three miles from mobile founded by cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with cudjo about the details of his life. during those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about cudjo’s past—memories from his childhood in africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by american slavers, the harrowing experience of the middle passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the clotilda, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the civil war.
based on those interviews, featuring cudjo’s unique vernacular, and written from hurston’s perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent american authors of the twentieth-century, barracoon masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it. offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.
