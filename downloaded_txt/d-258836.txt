projectbronco.com! a 78-79 ford bronco resource center












welcome to projectbronco.com!








the newest site on the
            web devoted solely to the  1978 & 1979 ford bronco! 
so why another bronco site? well to
            be honest, 99% of the websites devoted to the ford bronco seem to
            focus exclusively on the 1966-1977 broncos. the
            remaining 1% seem all inclusive and cover mostly the big broncos manufactured
            between 1980 and 1996. it seems that the rare 78 & 79 bronco has  been lost in popular ford nostalgia.
therefore, it is my intention to
            create a resource devoted exclusively to building, modifying, and
            restoring these rare fords that, in my opinion, were the best
            broncos ford ever built.
this site will cover in detail the
            full restoration of my 1979 bronco. i have owned this bronco since
            1987 and have been restoring it for the last three years. i have amassed
            a wealth of knowledge of what works and what doesn't when it comes
            to restoring these broncos, and i wish to share this knowledge with
            other bronco owners around the world.
