"we 
          recently purchased a home with jke, inc.  not only did we get a 
          quality home, we also had exceptional help from eddy and margi.  
          both were professional and courteous which made the whole stressful 
          experience of building a new home as pleasant as possible.  we 
          would definitely recommend jke, to anyone in the market for a new 
          home!"  ray and georgia blair









" we felt that eddy reamy and 
          his assistant, margi, were readily available for consultation when we 
          were building our house; advising us on such tings as some of the bold 
          wall treatments and colors that we chose.  we were extremely 
          pleased with the finished product of our dream home."  danny and
