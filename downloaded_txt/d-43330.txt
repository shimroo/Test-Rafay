          and choices and you can be in charge of your life and health!

is 
        it possible to feel better and really see your health improve?
when i suggest 
        a change in eating plans, clients are sometimes hesitant. after all, they've 
        been...in all likliehood...eating them same foods and drinking the same 
        beverages they grew up with and it's comfortable and familiar...so why 
        change?
 what does 
        food...or nutrition...have to do with how you feel? what you eat and consume, 
        in any fashion, potentially becomes a part of your body's cellular structure. 
        your body will make cells from what you feed it. so your food and nutrition 
        needs to be of the type that the body can use to create itself, again 
        and again. 
then in the 
        late 1980's when i was still in my 30's, i developed chronic fatigue and 
        what i believed to be crohn's disease. i did not see a medical doctor 
        for this condition as i was in denial and full of fear that what i had 
        happening with my body was cancer. that was my choice. at the time. i 
        felt miserable. i was constantly tired and just couldn't seem to generate 
        enough energy to get through the day. 
on top of 
        that, i had chronic bouts of diarrhea, oftentimes bloody and full of mucous. 
        sorry to be so graphic here but it is the truth. i kept this all to myself, 
        silenced by the dreaded fear. you get to learn all about me here. and 
        why not? nothing needs to be hidden any longer. the body is amazing, and 
        given time, proper nutrition, and faith it can and will heal itself. because 
        crohn's disease is also an inflammatory condition, i would have either 
        a low grade fever or flare ups of higher fever temperatures. plus, there 
        was a constant aching in my abdominal area.
it was hard 
        to live...hard to work...hard to be a mother...let alone to have the strength 
        to move through my daily life. i was in sad shape. every morsel of food 
        came exploding out of me. i could not eat any raw foods, at all. they 
        would basically come out whole. yet my inner strength was great. i knew 
        the body could heal itself. i did not give in or give up.
some time 
        before that time in my life, my friend asked me to go to a chiropractor's 
        meeting. there the doctor was sharing health information which included 
        a new evaluation process, called contact 
        reflex analysis (cra) which is a method of testing the body to determine 
        nutritional deficiencies and imbalances of the body. i knew then and there 
        that i would study this system and be the best healer i could be. 
what 
        is contact reflex analysis? 
cra is a 
        method of health evaluation that measures your body's bio-electric fields 
        through a form of very accurate muscle testing. for class information 
        please visit the founder's dr. versendaal's 
        web site. with the intelligence of the human body, and this technique, 
        we were able to determine my particular deficiencies and get started on 
        giving my body what it needed in the form of nutrients, and diet, so it 
        could heal itself. guess what happened? it took a while but the body did 
        heal. i am very grateful for having friends share good news with me, and 
        having the courage to move through healing in the way that i did.

can 
        the food you eat be slowly poisoning you?
up until 
        a hundred years ago, our ancestors ate a diet filled with whole foods. 
        most of their food was grown at home or by neighbors or small nearby general 
        stores. those earlier generations were much healtier and had far fewer 
        diseases than we do today. that's because they lived before the industrial 
        revolution. for great information on diet and wellness visit the weston 
        a. price website. i often refer my clients to this site.
since that 
        time our foods have been grown in fields fertilized by chemicals and what 
        is called sludge, and sprayed with pesticides and herbicides. then they 
        are harvested and taken to factories where they are packaged for our convenience 
        and consumption. often more chemical preservatives are added...for convenience...not 
        for nutrition. what about produce? unless the farm is local, many times 
        the food has to travel long distances to get to the store, held in storage 
        facilities, and then displayed in super cold bins to keep it looking fresh. 
        i have purchased such produce and the very next day it started to rot. 
        what a waste!
then, many 
        people take the food home and put it in microwave ovens to cook...but 
        that actually alters the food, depleting it of its life force, and enzymes. 
        that is when it started out raw in the first place. too many times microwave 
        cooking is for packaged foods previously prepared, frozen and ready to 
        zap. 
all of those 
        packaging and preservative processes make it easier for farmers and food 
        manufacturers to get our foods to us. they give our foods longer shelf 
        lives. and it makes it faster for us to eat and get on about our business.


 but 
        is processed food healthy for your body? ...no, absolutely not!


take 
        a closer look at what happens to foods at every step along the food chain...from 
        field to table and into your body.


chemicals 
          added to growing fields gradually deplete the soil of its once rich 
          source of nature's own vitamins and minerals...to the point now where 
          now most fields are exhausted and void of any natural nutrients so 
          our foods are too.
pesticides 
          that are sprayed on most crops are made up of small amounts biological 
          toxins that collect in your own body with no way out  and over the 
          years can cause untold physical problems.
processing 
          food in factories and packaging it in boxes and bags takes almost 
          all the nutrition and goodness out of the foods.
the storing 
          of foods in warehouses, grocery shelves and even refrigerators and freezers 
          help deplete your foods further yet!
then, 
          our habit of microwaving our foods is like putting the nail in the 
          coffin for our nutritional sustenance. ask yourself: do you really 
          want to put radiation your body just to save a little time??! 


conventional 
        medicine is also failing you because they only treat the symptom...not 
        the cause


while most 
        patients feel relief at having the symptoms supposedly disappear, their 
        internal organs are actually struggling to cope with the now hidden and 
        suppressed symptoms as well as with foreign chemical substances and the 
        many, many harsh side effects that come with those drugs. 
in fact, 
        most medical schools offer very little in the way of nutritional education 
        for our physcians. they prefer to rely on prescription medications and 
        surgery only. perhaps, that's why many doctors will tell you that the 
        food you eat is fine.
according 
        to news story on reuters health on feb. 8, 2008, entitled "accidental 
        drug-poisoning deaths on the rise in the us", they report the 
        following:




report 
              from the centers for disease control and prevention
"unintentional 
              deaths due to drug poisoning, primarily with prescription drugs,
increased by 68.3% between 1999 and 2004, and is
second only to motor vehicle crashes as a cause of death 
              from unintentional injury in the us, investigators at the centers 
              for disease control and prevention report."



Â 
it's 
        sad that we're reportedly more at risk trying to get healthy and seeking 
        medical treatment than we are for getting in an auto accident.
times 
        are changing...people are now eating more natural food and using alternative 
        health methods




more 
        and more people are becoming aware of how successful natural health methods 
        are. as a result, they are turning to successful complementary and alternative 
        health practitioners and nutritionists for solutions that address the 
        real cause of the problems. 
in 
        may 2004 through the national institute of health, the national center 
        for complementary and alternative medicine (nccam) and the national center 
        for health statistics (nchs, part of the centers for disease control and 
        prevention) released 
        a report that shows an increasing amount of interest and growth in 
        those areas.



what 
              is complementary and alternative medicine (cam)?
according 
              to this report: 
"cam 
              is a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, 
              and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional 
              medicine. 

complementary 
                medicine is used together with conventional medicine.
 
                and alternative medicine is used in place of conventional 
                medicine."




how 
      many people use cam?
in 
        the united states alone, over a third (36%) of adults are using 
        some form of cam. 
when 
         megavitamin therapy and prayer specifically for health reasons are 
        included in the definition of cam, that number rises to 62% 
        (see graph below). 
that's 
        almost two-thirds of adults who have at least tried some form 
        of alternative health treatment. 
who knew that 
      our government in the untied states keeps track of these statistics?! 



why 
        are people using cam?


 
        in the survey mentioned above people were asked to select from five reasons 
        to describe why they used cam. results show:

cam would 
          improve health when used in combination with conventional medical 
          treatments: 54.9%
cam would 
          be interesting to try: 50.1%
conventional 
          medical treatments would not help: 27.7%
a conventional 
          medical professional suggested trying cam: 25.8%
conventional 
          medical treatments are too expensive: 13.2% 
Â 





the 
            survey found that most people use cam along 
            with conventional medicine rather than in place of conventional 
            medicine.

Â  
        

statistics 
        aren't the only proof that people are changing




...here's 
              a real testimonial from a client who is a medical doctor
"when 
              i first heard about alternative choices healing center, i was prone 
              to fatigue. i also had a history of respiratory problems and allergies. 
              on top of that i had an irritation in my bladder and infertility 
              problems. 
since 
              my reflexes have been tested with contact 
              reflex analysis, my bladder is improved and much less painful. 
              it is stronger but not yet 100% back to normal. my digestion also 
              improved as i have less gas. over the past few months, i feel stronger 
              and my menstrual cycle is now more normal and painfree. 
through 
              the whole process i felt interested and patient. i was willing to 
              go along with the process and not too worried or anxious at all. 
              but i have found both cra and the standard 
              process supplements are a wonderful and powerful addition to 
              the armamentarium for healing. 
in 
              my opinion, they [cra and whole food supplements] need to become 
              more widespread, known and available to more people. i would gladly 
              refer my family and friends to dr. xianti hoo, ph.d."
