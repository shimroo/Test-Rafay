celebrating over 50 years of sales and servicethe donahue family welcomes you






in 1972 dick & lois donahue purchased the lehman gardens mums of minnesota and moved their family from st. james to faribault. with much hard work and dreams the family has built a successful family business.
in the early 1980's the business saw a need in the greenhouse industry for a good quality clematis grower. from there donahues' niche was found! donahue's is currently one of the largest clematis growers in the us. we are celebrating growing plants and our families for over 50 years in faribault.
