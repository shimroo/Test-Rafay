lucas was very helpful and a real gentleman. he was very attentive throughout the whole process. we are in the process of closing a sale on a boat and i would like to commend all of your staff. in particular, lucas, kyle and melissa. you and joe should be very proud of your staff!  please let them know we were giving them our compliments!

 

robert u.

they are tier one, hands down. bought 4 whalers from tony and have wintered and serviced all of them at hampton watercraft for decades. there is a reason i keep coming back...

 
michael b. 
i bought a pre-owned boat here. the process was easy and fast. the salesperson, cary, was attentive, friendly, and helpful. i was able to use the boat a few weekends before winterizing it and i love the boat. thank you!

 
dane n.
the boat looks great! i appreciate all of the attention you have given to me. your company operates with the highest professionalism and excellence in service. 

look forward to a being a customer for many years! 


 
glenn a.
from day one when my wife and i walked into your dealership to inquire about a tiara 43 ls, to this day it has been nothing short of an excellent experience. meeting with the owner is always comforting as well.

cary, your salesmen is the best i’ve seen, he is knowledgeable , caring, extremely attentive and just an all-around great person.



 
brian d.
the dealer was great. every aspect of the process was smooth and easy. they kept me informed every step of the way. as a first time boat buyer the dealer walked me through everything. everyone at this dealership that i came in contact were very helpful and made this such a great experience.  i can't thank them
enough. i truly don't have a single complaint. the boat is fantastic and my boat dealer was great. my salesman was a true gentleman and i appreciated his knowledge and insight throughout this whole process.  



 
joann s. 
this is our second boat purchased from hampton watercraft and salesman tom jones. he was an excellent professional.

excellent service provided by tom jones and excellent boat

.

 
mike a. 
you probably already know this but tom is the absolute best.  this is not my first boat purchase but i can say without a doubt my most confident.  knowing that i can call tom with any problems is huge and i am very happy with the decision i made to work with you guys!


 
arthur v.
my wife and i are just loving the new boat and as always super happy with our decision to buy are new tiara from your company. 
you should be very proud of your staff they are doing a great job for us! ronnie/ernie/jimmy/katie and all the dock hands have made our experience wonderful so far. 
my wife and i are proud to let everyone we speak to about our new boat and marina we keep her in that hwc is the best!!

 
joel w.
the 15 montauk is an awesome boat for a cruise, beach and fishing. easy to maneuver and clean and looks great.

dealer is awesome. salesman and owner were super great.

i would use this dealer again in a heartbeat. bw makes awesome little boats. legendary.


 
francine o.
this boat construction and styling is excellent.

we have bought 4 boston whalers from hampton watercraft and have been extremely pleased with the sales and service of this marine dealer.

they complete any service in every timely matter. products and materials used are of excellent  quality.


 
john f.
i  just want to say what a pleasure the two experiences have been buying a boat from hampton water craft. cary jones has made it a pleasure. looking forward to working with you guys again. we have been eyeing the tiara 43. we love our 43 fountain.

 
douglas b.
owning a boat should be a fun and pleasant experience, the people at hampton watercraft go out of their way to achieve that standard of service and care.

we took possession of our 325 conquest last season. as far as quality, performance, durability, comfort, residual value, range, and dependability, boston whaler has raised the bar on this great boat. this is my third bw upgrade in 20 years. i have loved my previous whalers as well. 

in addition to a great boat i highly recommend hampton watercraft as the dealer and service company. a special thanks to rick at their hampton bays shinnecock bay at smith creek marina. 


 
billy g. 
the best! purchased a fsbo boat in the local area. outstanding coordination and support with surveyor. excellent prices/service/and execution taking care of items from survey. took care of an item with manufacturer that other dealers would not have. finally, excellent reaction to boat transporter arriving early, accomplishing needed items to get the boat headed to florida. that's correct...i am not a long time customer...i am a first time customer from out of state. but i was treated with the service and coordination of a forever customer. i cannot say thank you enough to claudio and kyle as well as the team i don't know the names. i only wish they would open a shop here!! thanks again!

 
zadrazil 
this is the fourth bw i have purchased since 2019 joe and his crew have always been there to answer questions and to fix any problems in a timely manner!

 
avery, tiara 43ls
it was an absolute pleasure doing business with you and your team. chris has always said you are world class and that was abundantly clear every step of the process. thanks for your help.
