what determines if my citation is payable or whether i must appear in court?
whether a citation is payable or requires a court appearance is determined by the judges of the cobb county state court. in creating what is known as the traffic violations bureau (tvb), the judges drafted and signed an order setting out what offenses were to be payable without a court appearance.
for further information you should contact the state court clerk's office, traffic violations bureau, at (770) 528-2660. office hours are 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. however you can access our ivr system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

how long do i have to pay my fine?
if the citation(s) you received is a "payable" violation, you must pay your fine by 8:30 a.m. on your scheduled court date, or appear in court. your court date is located in section iv of your citation. (if paying online, your payment must be made no later than 6:00 am est two (2) days before your court date. for example, a ticket for a wednesday court date must be paid no later than 6:00 am on monday.)







if i choose to pay a fine without a court appearance, what does that mean?
