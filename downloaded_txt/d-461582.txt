“off the chart! marjie is one of the nicest and friendliest salespeople i have ever met. she was responsive, readily accessible, and had the ability to take care of my wants and needs. everything you could want in an agent can be found with marjie and each one of her team. i would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone who is planning on selling or buying property”
