    the "only project"

 only watch was created in 2005 by luc pettavino with one intent: raise funds for research on duchenne muscular dystrophy (a genetic disease that concerns 1 in 3,500 boys and weakens progressively all their muscles and that affected luc and monique’s son, paul) by auctioning one-off timepieces. since then, thanks to the increasing formidable mobilization of the watch industry and the support of an entire ecosystem, this initiative has become a very awaited biennial rendezvous in the horology calendar for both brands and collectors.
