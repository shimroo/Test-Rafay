what we mean by home, health, hope.



home
the journey to self-sufficiency and recovery begins with a home. thresholds residential programs offer a variety of community housing options for people with serious mental illness. a thresholds residence is far more than mere shelter. many residences also offer opportunities to develop social relationships and friendships through communal living and shared activities.




health
an evidence-based practice (ebp) is a clinical intervention that has been consistently shown in research projects to assist consumers in achieving their desired goals of health and wellness. there are currently six ebps that best fit the needs of our members.  research to date has shown that these methods are the best and most effective ways to increase consumer outcomes in these domains.




hope
thresholds rejects the notion that anyone is a lost cause. our foremost goal is to ensure that every individual in our care, called members, receives the necessary skills and support to live an independent and fulfilling life. recovery from mental illness is possible. recovery is a process of finding and living a satisfying and meaningful life, as one defines it for oneself. we assist our members as they work to reclaim a positive sense of self, and discover their own potential, gifts, and skills.
