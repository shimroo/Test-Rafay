welcome to the home of the heritage region jeep alliance (hrja).  hrja is a jeep-related organization that is based out of western pa and was formed in may of 2000.  hrja is comprised of people from all walks of life, but all having one common interest, the jeep! we’ve always been a family-oriented club, open to people with all levels of off-road experience, and jeeps from stock to heavily modified.  
in addition to hosting local events for our club members, our mission is to educate and promote the historical facts relating to the invention of the jeep in butler, pa. we seek to promote the interest and pride in the ownership of jeeps through organizing and holding activities to demonstrate the unique qualities inherent of jeep vehicles. we also participate and support civic activities for the betterment of the community.
