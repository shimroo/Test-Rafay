we had a great time – the unit is very nice. no issues, everything was working well and was very clean. we will certainly keep you in mind for future weekend getaways to the beach.

i must say everything was just excellent with the condo. very spacious for two adults and two kids (boys). we actually arrived earlier than expected on day of checking in and sunglow management was more than accommodating with allowing us to check in early and giving us a parking pass. we are looking forward to next year already and definitely going to try to get the same condo.
