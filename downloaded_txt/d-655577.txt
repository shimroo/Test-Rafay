adding a shortcode sms call-to-action to your contact details, wherever they are used, makes it âeasyanytimeâ for a consumer to respond impulsively to your advertising.








monitor your market
media agencies are known for their âspray-and-pray approachâ; the philosophy that â50% of advertising works; weâre just not sure which 50%.â but floodgateâs online reporting helps you to determine which media are generating the best returns for your adspend: radio, tv, print, web, billboard, roadside, branded vehicles, in-store promos or even packaging. 








build a base
the report file database benefit is a biggie because floodgate stores each keyword activation, recording the consumerâs cellphone number and the date and time of the activation, in a password-protected database for your exclusive use. for you, this translates into a private message centre able to capture consumersâ interest 24/7.
