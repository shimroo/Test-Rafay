dharian basenjis in 
            wolfforth, texas (near lubbock) has produced generations of 
            basenjis for show, agility, lure-coursing, obedience...or just to 
            love. our puppies are bred for temperament, health, and performance 
            as well as appearance, and are raised in a home 
            environment with lots of early socialization and 
            training.  dharian puppies are raised on a biologically 
appropriate raw food diet (yes, those are raw chicken wings you see them 
munching on!) and are vaccinated using dr. jean dodds' recommended protocol.basenjis are 
            not for everyone. they are a breed of special intelligence, 
            athleticism, and humor who should be owned only by those who 
            appreciate their 
      uniqueness.


dharian puppies are well socialized!
