america’s premier traveling country club for senior golfers.


















welcome 




great people. great golf. great memories.
competitive & non-competitive golf

couples, singles, & social members 
all are welcome! 
 

















thank you for supporting our family-owned business!
 
"we're focused on creating the most magical golf experiences —
trips that people dream of."
 



we are the senior golfers of america.
the senior golfers of america was founded in 1976 as a traveling country club for senior (50+ years and older) golfers. we create fun and interesting bucket-list experiences, all built around the great game of golf. we love to meet new people, to travel, to sample fine food and wine, to dress up, and to experience all the good things that life  has to offer.
sga events focus on unique venues, attract interesting and welcoming people, and are curated with a personal touch. our family business offers  mid-morning tee times preceded by a leisurely breakfast, with plenty of time for warmup/practice, and fun evening social events.
membership is open to singles as well as couples, to ladies, men, and non-golfer spouses and friends. a full program is provided for sga fogs (friends and spouses of golfers), including opportunities for sightseeing, art appreciation, shopping, and visiting local historic sites.
sga is proud to support the first tee, the audubon society, lady bird johnson wildflower center, for the birds of acadiana, and other charities.
if you love golf, if you love to travel to the nicest places on earth, and if you love meeting new people, then senior golfers of america is for you!  let us hear from you with any questions you may have.
