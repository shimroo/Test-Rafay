banking that's got your back
banks are for-profit. advantis is for you.





like to know how?






advantis is a not-for-profit financial co-op, locally owned by our members. so rather than giving our earnings to corporate stockholders like banks do, we return them to our members in the form of better rates, lower fees, and more free services.
the cooperative difference 
learn about credit unions and how they work.




that's really awesome. we can move on.



















grow spotlight: beaverton education foundation

beaverton education foundation (bef) is the primary nonprofit partner of the beaverton school district supporting 54 schools and nearly 38,000 students. bef used its grow funds to launch or expand three student-run businesses last fall. the enterprises directly serve 300 students, half of whom are bipoc, with 80 percent coming from low-to-moderate income households. the hands-on, experiential opportunities teach business skills, improve school engagement, and help prepare students for future careers.
