welcome to greensburg
decatur county, indiana
greensburg, decatur county is a growing, thriving community in southeast indiana, conveniently situated midway between indianapolis and cincinnati. and while we’re most famously known for our tower tree, we’re so much more than that. small-town charm. midwestern work ethic. hoosier hospitality. great schools. neighbors who look out for each other. it’s a quality—and enjoyability—of life that just might surprise you. in the best possible way. of course, we’re proud of where we’ve been, but we’re even more excited to see where we can go. to continue to move our community forward. together.
