justice sotomayor speaks in miami





 jay weaver covers it here: sonia sotomayor may be a household name, but her storied legal career stems largely from feeling comfortable in her own skin. “you have to be true to yourself,” sotomayor, the nation’s first hispanic justice on the u.s. supreme court, told more than 200 people tuesday evening during a chat with knight foundation president and ceo maribel pérez wadsworth at the miami dade college campus in little havana.“i have never denied my culture or hidden my love for my spanish roots,” sotomayor said, highlighting her love for family, salsa and roasted pork. “all of these things are important to me and i take pride in them.”

judge tjoflat says it's the gulf of mexico





in a footnote from this case:on january 20, 2025, president trump issued an executive order directing that “[t]he area formerly known as the gulf of mexico” be renamed as the “gulf of america.” exec. order no. 14172, 90 fed. reg. 8629 (jan. 20, 2025). because the statutory schemes pertinent to this appeal explicitly refer to this geographic area as the “gulf of mexico,” we continue to use that name.

"us attorneys said to be told to justify keeping newest prosecutors"





 that's the headline from this explosive article from bloomberg's ben penn.  i'm told there are at least 20 local probationary prosecutors who may be fired.  from the article:justice department headquarters has given all 93 us attorneys two business days to explain why prosecutors they’ve hired in the past two years who aren’t focused on trump priorities such as immigration and public safety should be retained, said five people briefed on the situation.although the nation’s chief prosecutors haven’t been told exactly how the department will use this information, some are treating it as a weekend assignment to save the jobs of numerous line attorneys and support staff on probationary status who aren’t pursuing cases aligned with the president’s agenda.us attorneys must provide by feb. 10 justifications for keeping anyone with less than two years of service who doesn’t work on immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety, said the individuals, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. the request came from a senior career official who is herself being kept in the dark about the purpose of the mandate.recent hires who don’t fall into those three specified categories would potentially include prosecutors specializing in white collar, civil fraud, and civil rights investigations.the directive is the latest signal about how the trump doj intends to shrink the size of its workforce. prior guidance from the federal government’s hr office required agencies to assemble lists of new hires for possible termination and attorney general pam bondi’s day one memos warned employees could face termination over their politicization or disobedience.in a memo thursday from the executive office for us attorneys and in a followup call friday, us attorneys were instructed to identify the probationary status of anyone hired in the past two years and then provide details about their work if they deserve to stay.determining when each assistant us attorney surpasses their probationary term—making them tougher to fire—is a complicated exercise. it generally lasts two years into the job, but that can be shorter or longer depending on prior government service, security clearances, and other factors.adding to the frustration for the us attorneys is that the senior official tasked with delivering the orders—an eousa director appointed by then-attorney general merrick garland in october—didn’t know answers to their questions about what would come of the identified employees.the directive to the field comes a week after bloomberg law reported that senior doj political appointee emil bove asked us attorneys to recruit line prosecutors for assignments to border districts.on feb. 5, bondi, hours after being sworn into office, issued memos to diminish white collar enforcement by redirecting foreign corruption, money laundering, and overseas lobbying transparency prosecutors to focus more narrowly on cartels and transnational crime.the us attorneys, a mix of holdover biden appointees, acting career officials, and interim leaders installed by trump, will now have the next few days to make their case to justice department headquarters about retaining prosecutors involved in corporate crime and other fields that weren’t singled out as priorities.

news & notes





1.  last night was the federal bar prom.  it was very well attended with federal judges and lawyers, all mingling on an outdoor deck on a beautiful miami night.2.  former u.s. attorneys bob martinez and marcos jimenez come to the defense of fbi agents in this op-ed in the miami herald. from the piece:today’s fbi agents, like their fallen colleagues, live and work among us, mostly maintaining a low profile. they send their children to our local schools, raise their families in our communities, and maintain a modest and law-abiding lifestyle. they live like average americans. yet, on a daily basis, their jobs are not average. they are the ones that americans have assigned the responsibility to shield us from terrorism and espionage, from predators targeting children, to ferret out public corruption, to protect us from fraud, from kidnappers, from violent predators. to guard our civil rights. they are located in cities and towns across our country and throughout the world. their work is essential to a safe and free society. many americans are trying to make sense of the current effort to purge potentially thousands of hard-working, dedicated agents from the fbi. what would be the impact of the removal of so many federal law enforcement officers on the safety and security of our nation? who will want to join the fbi if their employment can be terminated, and their identities exposed to retribution by the very criminals they investigated, whenever a new politician takes over? 3.  congress has tasked the sentencing commission with describing extraordinary and compelling reasons that may warrant a sentence reduction. the commission issued a policy statement in 2023 that allows defendants to move for a sentence reduction if they can show that their original sentence is “unusually long.” in issuing that policy statement (section 1b1.13(b)(6)) the commission wanted to clarify that defendants may present—and district courts may consider—nonretroactive changes in law as the basis for concluding that a sentence is “unusually long.”   judge ruiz has concluded, in this 40 page order, that district courts cannot apply section 1b1.13(b)(6) of the united states sentencing commission’s policy statement as a matter of law, because the commission exceeded their statutory authority in allowing district courts to consider nonretroactive changes in law.  the eleventh circuit will be weighing in on this issue soon, i'm sure, as district judges on our court are coming out on different sides of the issue.

judge mcaliley defends michael thakur and other doj lawyers





 one of best all-time magistrate judges wrote an op-ed in the miami herald, doj firing of miami federal prosecutor is a ‘gut punch’ to the rule of law.  some snippets:until my recent retirement, i worked for nearly 19 years as a u.s. magistrate judge on our miami federal trial court in the southern district of florida, where i had the honor to preside over a wide variety of criminal and civil lawsuits. last week i read with despair – for our country – that acting u.s. attorney general james mchenry fired one of miami’s finest federal prosecutors, michael thakur. did thakur not do his job? no. quite the opposite. thakur, a harvard college and harvard law school graduate and a 15-year veteran of the u.s. attorney’s office, was one of the best to appear before me and my colleagues on the bench. intelligent, ethical, hardworking, with excellent judgment.assistant u.s. attorneys, who are career prosecutors, may only be fired for cause — not for a political reason. they are career civil servants who must fairly apply the law, “without fear or favor.” they serve under both democratic and republican administrations, as thakur did. they do not “implement a president’s agenda,” but rather follow where the facts and the law lead them. during my years on the bench, i watched thakur represent the u.s. in the courtroom and behind the scenes. magistrate judges review countless sealed applications submitted by prosecutors investigating crimes, asking for government access to possible evidence. thakur’s search warrant and similar applications were top notch, carefully prepared and supported by evidence and law. he displayed the same sound judgment in the courtroom as he prosecuted terrorists, foreign spies, narcotics traffickers, fraudsters and violent criminals.***our justice system is designed to protect against mistaken, incompetent or even corrupt prosecutors. the doj imposes high internal standards on its lawyers, which is another backstop against error. the standards are higher yet for investigations of political figures as the department imposes layers of review of those cases. the dismissal of brilliant, hardworking, conscientious career public servants like michael thakur is a gut punch. thakur is ushered out the door, and the morale of his colleagues tanks. if such unjustifiable dismissals in the doj continue, we will no longer have the best among us, proud to serve and protect us. it will take generations for this country, and our institutions, to recover.

suggested changes for the new u.s. attorney





 hayden o'byrne takes over an office that has the lowest morale that i have seen since i started working down here.  and monster problems permeate the entire culture of 99 building.  some suggestions for the office below.  please add others to the comments:1.    stop bringing the low level drug and gun state cases.  leave those to the state system.  focus on the large scale cases that the feds were traditionally known for.2.    give your line prosecutors more discretion to do the right thing.  let them work out deals to pretrial diversion, minor role, lower loss, etc., without having to get 8 levels of approval.  3.    see #2 when it comes to variances.  give line prosecutors the ability to agree to variances.4.    make yourself and your senior staff available to defense counsel to discuss cases.5.    open file discovery.6.    early jencks.7.    stop filing motions in limine to preclude the defense from defending their clients.8.    stop filing motions to reconsider when you lose a motion. 9.    stop assigning prosecutors who clerked for the judge to that judge's courtroom.10.    zero tolerance for prosecutors who engage in misconduct.11.      what else?
