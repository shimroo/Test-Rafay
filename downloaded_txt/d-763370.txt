bamboo poles, parts & pieces 











 looking for bamboo poles or searching for some smaller pieces for bamboo crafts???bamboo branch is a home-based bamboo business, offering bamboo poles, pieces and parts and is situated on an acre of bamboo in a residential area in austin, texas. prices vary depending on the quality, length and diameter of bamboo that your project requires. all of my bamboo poles are locally harvested and are not treated with any chemicals. 











 



















i started working with bamboo in 1991 when i purchased a house that had an established bamboo grove. as i started grooming the grove and “debranching” poles – i wondered what i could do with all the small branches and that is how i came up with the business name bamboo branch.a few years later, i started making bamboo beads from the bamboo branches. now-a-days, i spend most of my spare time grooming my bamboo grove and maybe some day i will get back to making bamboo beads again! so far i do all the bamboo grooming by using simple hand tools and manual labor.  i harvest each cane, debranch them, and haul them to my back yard. next step is a simple washing of the poles – as they have been growing several years outside obviously and a little washing makes them clean and shinier.  carole meckescall or text 512-906-8250 to set up appointment to discuss your next project or send email
