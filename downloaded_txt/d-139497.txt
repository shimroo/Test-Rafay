iritis overview
iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is a condition that affects the eye. it is an inflammation of the iris, the colored part of the eye, and the surrounding tissue known as the ciliary body. iritis can occur suddenly and may cause eye pain, redness, and sensitivity to light. in some cases, it can also cause blurred vision.
iritis is usually caused by an immune response, and it can be associated with various underlying conditions such as infections, autoimmune disorders, or trauma. it can affect people of all ages, but it is more common in adults between the ages of 20 and 50.












the diagnosis of iritis involves a comprehensive eye examination, including a detailed medical history, visual acuity test, and examination of the anterior segment of the eye. if iritis is suspected, further testing may be necessary to identify the underlying cause.
the treatment of iritis usually involves the use of corticosteroid eye drops to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms. in some cases, additional medications may be required to manage the underlying condition. it is important to follow the treatment plan as prescribed and to attend all follow-up appointments to ensure proper management of the condition.
if left untreated, iritis can lead to complications such as cataracts, glaucoma, or vision loss. therefore, it is essential to seek prompt medical attention if you experience any symptoms of iritis.
