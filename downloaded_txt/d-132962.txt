if your serial number is not populating using our online verification tool, it is likely a serial number that has been lost during some software updates to our grading applications. this can be corrected, but requires the coin to be sent in and assigned a new serial number. please use the attached form to send your mis-verified coin in under quality control. there are no service fees in doing so, and we will cover return shipping and insurance back to you.
