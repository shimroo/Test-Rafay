changes…

i wrote the following after senator sanders conceded to hillary clinton at the democratic national convention. there were a lot of people calling for sanders supporters to “fall in line” behind the democratic nominee.

people, especially people of my generation, try to remember what this felt like, and give the dnc protesters you disagree with a little room to figure things out for themselves. don’t push and don’t belittle.
put your own fears aside and offer empathy instead of hatred and apocalyptic fear mongering. stop pushing and listen. acknowledge the great loss they are suffering. give them time to grieve and show them the respect they deserve, and maybe then they will be more receptive to your point of view. some will not, but that is their right. some who sanders brought into the party would have never registered or voted without him anyway. some would have always voted green or 3rd party. that’s democracy.

… and these children that you spit on
as they try to change their worlds
are immune to your consultations.
they’re quite aware of what they’re going through…
