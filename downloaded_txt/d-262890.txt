always ask for roofer recommendations
reach out to any friends or family members you have in the area. see if any of them can recommend a contractor to you. if they had a positive experience with a particular contractor, you should ask them to tell you more.
it can be hard to get started when you’re trying to search for a contractor. if you ask for recommendations, you’ll be able to reduce the length of your search. with a little bit of luck, you’ll find the perfect contractor in no time at all.
look for a contractor that has plenty of experience
you should make sure that the contractor you select has been working in the roofing business for a very long time. if you choose to work with an experienced contractor, you can expect to have a much smoother experience.
knowledge and experience are two of the most significant advantages that a contractor can have. if a contractor has been working on roofs for a long time, they’ll be very familiar with the ins and outs of their job. this means the roofer will be able to do more to help you.
find a contractor that can do the job for a fair price
when you’re looking at tips for choosing roofing contractors, you’ll want to consider your budget. you should make sure you select a contractor that will be able to do the necessary work for a very fair price.
some contractors overcharge for this kind of work, but other contractors work hard to keep their rates low. if you do end up selecting a roof contractor that charges reasonable prices, you should be able to put the funds that you save to good use. get quotes from a few contractors and see what they typically charge. make sure you work with a someone that is willing to give you a fair price.
interview your top choices
you should take the time to interview every roofer that you’re seriously thinking about working with. interviews are an excellent way to begin your process and evaluate options. during an interview, you’ll have the chance to ask a lot of helpful questions.
whether you interview a contractor in person or over the phone, you’ll be able to learn a great deal from the responses that they give you. set up a few interviews so that you have the chance to talk to contractors about the work that they do.
read your contract before you sign
if you’ve chosen a contractor, you won’t want to sign the contract that they give you immediately. you’ll want to take the time to read through that contract so you know exactly what it says.
it’s important to remember that contracts are a legally binding document. before you agree to enter into an agreement with a roofer, you’ll want to figure out what it is you’re agreeing to. go over a contract carefully before you put your signature on it. if you have an issue with a contract, you should bring those issues to the contractor.
keep all of these tips for choosing roofing contractors in mind as you explore your options. make sure that the contractor you work with is more than qualified for the job. if you find an excellent contractor, you can expect to have a very smooth experience.…

what are the average costs for replacing a roof in 2019?posted on october 26, 2018october 26, 2018


as you can imagine, roof replacement costs can have everything to do with material choice. are you going for the traditional asphalt shingle roof, or do you plan to choose a different material? the national average for roof replacement is right under $7500, so that gives you a baseline. you’re not going to pay much less than that to have a roof replaced, and in fact, the charges can be significantly more.
that’s why it can be essential to look into the costs for replacing a roof before making a material choice. the low end for roof replacement is quoted as being right around $1200, but that has to be for a tiny home. in all seriousness, can you guess the high end? it can be as much as $30,000. as for a typical range, the numbers are anywhere from $5200 on up to $10,000, encompassing that initial quote of $7500.
roofing estimates can vary by geographic location, too. for example, let’s look at the averages in both denver and austin, which are $7500 and $6100 respectively in 2019. that’s just one way of looking at the geographical differences of course, as with those numbers, there are going to be other factors that come into play. in other words, not everyone in austin had the same roof and square footage as the people in denver.
geographical differences do still play a role when it comes to roof replacement costs. they can also play a role when it comes to choosing a roofing material. you might want to know some of the other factors that can make roof installation more expensive, too. for instance, the pitch and steepness of a roof can be part of the equation. chimneys, skylights and other adornments can also play a role.
if you choose a metal or tile roof, you’re going to pay more than you would if you go with an asphalt shingle roof. no matter your material choice, you need to be sure you take the expert advice of getting more than one quote. not two but three or four quotes is what we suggest. and to boot, the experts say not to take any lowball bids.
taking the lowest bid can be dependent on the circumstances. you might have vetted the companies to the point that you are sure you can depend on them to do the work that is necessary. if that’s the case, you might feel like the lowest bid is the winner. just be sure that you’re not too heavily focused on the price above other vital factors.
the average costs for replacing a roof in 2019 have been mentioned in general, but now it’s time to make a material choice. it’s also time to get some quotes. when you have chosen a material, you can also look at the average costs for that specific material. then you will have an even better idea before you ever get a quote concerning what you might be charged for roof replacement.… 







real news or fake?posted on june 29, 2018leave a comment on real news or fake?


everywhere you turn someone is screaming “fake news”,  media outlets today not only offer up a different point of view but seemingly a whole different set of facts.  is there a way to verify facts and make sure that the news you are reading is in fact true?  let’s have a look at how you can discern real news from fake.

consider the source

remember a few years ago all those tabloids near the checkout in the grocery store, proclaiming alien abductions or the love child of elvis and big foot.  those tabloids have all moved online.   while you are reading news online  you have to consider the source just like you used to in the grocery store.  do they verify their sources, are there links to a credible source.  there are some sites that offer headlines so irrational you can dismiss them out of hand.

the devil is in the details

no one has screamed “fake news” louder than president trump, seemingly every outlet that doesn’t give him favorable coverage now publishes fake news.  sometimes you get news stories with one or two verifiable facts but the rest is completely false.  if you rely on social media to get your news, and many people do, then be wary of meme’s.  memes provide an often funny or humorous way to present information, the problem is, most of the information is outright false or completely biased.

don’t live in an echo chamber

don’t automatically agree with the information because it supports your point of view, rather try and look at it objectively.  does it make sense?  look at the actual facts rather than what you would like to be true.

try and be openminded

overcoming your own personal prejudice and biases isn’t easy.  you need to evaluate the entire story and never get all your information from just one source.  there are plenty of credible media outlets that have their own political biases so don’t rely on just fox news or msnbc to get the whole picture, get as many facts and perspectives as possible.

double check absolutely everything

don’t be part of the problem and spread misinformation, even inadvertently.  that means before you post a story on social media do the best you can to double check the facts.
we deserve better than having to double check each and every piece of information that comes in front of us.  yes, some news organizations are far better than others but be wary just the same.… 







is a trade war eminent?posted on june 29, 2018leave a comment on is a trade war eminent?


what is a trade war?
trade war isn’t the conventional physical war between nation’s as you maybe thinking, but this is rather fighting for the dominance over the global market. this in simple words means, knocking out other countries trade business’s, by imposing certain kind of restrictions in form of levying the taxes in huge amount. this could be the high rate of import duty taxes in the imported goods or services, which could cripple down the other countries exports. this trade war is currently in the news, as everyone’s eyes has focused on the united states of america, following it’s protectionism policy, as the president donald trump came into power.
speculations’ of trade war
united states of america has been the super power since the cold war era. the dominance over the world trade was maintained by us. the active trade disputes is largely between the usa and china, but recently spilled over the latin american and some very close ally’s of usa in the european union. but in recent decades china has immensely growing as the worlds fastest economy and is on the verge of replacing us as the number one in ranking.

the american economy is being damaging due to the chinese growing influence all over the world via it’s unlikely trade practice’s. the expansionist policy of china in the south china sea and rapidly growing unfair trades has urged usa to forced trade restrictions on certain types of chinese goods exported to us. this in return, about to some extent back fired upon us, where chinese have also added trade restrictions upon us. this growing trade disputes outbreak upon other latin american countries like brazil being heavily levied tax in chunk’s for aluminum exports to usa.
world trade organization (wto)
the world trade organization is an independent body which regulates the trade flows across the globe and sets the rules and regulations through legal channels which are abide to all countries but every nation has it’s foreign trade policy and right to trade freely on global market. the recent reports by wto says to avoid the on going trade disputes and further to stop the future escalation on global scale, right decision should be taken to resolve the issues mutually, since trade war is currently hot bed for certain countries currently. the protectionism policy by major world leaders is not good for free and fair the global market.
in the future, this might give a way to recession, which isn’t good as trade war keeps looming over. so overall to see, the trade disputes is neither going to help anyone of the countries, as it is better to resolve the issues mutually and beneficial to all in peaceful manner.…
