in case you aren't familiar with what makes morley amazing — and it's a lot — she started boxing at age 40, and, in july of last year, won the masters division of the national golden gloves as a light flyweight. morley shared on her blog that she retired from boxing in may of this year, self-aware enough to know to do so at a high instead of a low. now, she has more time to focus on her work as a teacher, writer, and filmmaker. you might know her from projects like her documentary fight like a girl, which includes a personal, vulnerable look at her own struggles with depression. not to mention the fact that it's proof that morley gives everything to every new project she picks up.– alexis rhiannon  |  www.bustle.com
