because amazon’s unique shipping, labeling and invoice requirements are outside of our standard operating procedures, we are unable to ship directly to amazon fulfillment centers.  we are happy to ship to a third party, but not directly to amazon. additionally, we are unable to ship to canada due to unique labeling laws. our minimum requirements for establishing an account include; a $3,000 opening order, and a minimum of $12,000 purchased annually. please review our product line on our website and if interested, fill out our on-line form.  do include your city and state as our account managers are geographically located and the appropriate one will be in touch.
