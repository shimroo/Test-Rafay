animals are still coming in:
eastern gray squirrels still have babies that may be orphaned, attacked by a predator or blown from their nest. many species of songbirds, hawks, owls and wading birds that are migrating and wintering here in florida are arriving in  poor condition. this weakened condition can lead to slowed responses and thus increasing the chances of car collisions, and attacks by dogs and cats. 
animals are cared for at the center as well as  with our network of volunteers that specialize in different species. during the winter months the center has irregular hours and all animal calls are handled through our helpline.

 
happy holidays to all our members, 
supporters and partners! 
your support and encouragement means so much and we look forward to another year of working together for wildlife!
