flyleaf, with their original lineup including lacey sturm, will be one of the many bands featured at sick new world festival.  sign up for your presale code before friday in order to get tickets to this festival!
i hope to see all of my old flyleaf friends there, and hope i make some new ones in the crowd.  this is going to be a legendary, fulfilling show for all of us kids who have been waiting for so many years.  i’m so endlessly grateful that flyleaf is coming back, even if it may just be for a short while.  this is such a gift!  i can’t wait!

flyleaf is back, and so is flyleafonline.com!  i don’t currently have a working laptop, but that should change very soon and i will update the look of the website and start hopefully flooding you guys with new information.
lacey is back!  and the band has scheduled one show that we know of.  but on jared’s instagram, he hinted at the fact that there may be more than that.
more news and a new website look to come soon!
