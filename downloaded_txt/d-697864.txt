volunteer & internship programs in costa rica



kids saving the rainforest wouldn't be where it is today without the help from our amazing volunteers and interns. volunteers and interns have the opportunity to work with our full-time kstr staff and help monitor, observe, and care for the wild animals that we host at our sanctuary and rescue center. we offer study abroad trips for teachers and students of all ages and intern/volunteer programs from 1 week to 1 year.
