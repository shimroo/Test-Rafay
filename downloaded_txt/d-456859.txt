official web site of mythic artist mary laytoni am an author and artist of the mythic tradition.i paint using watercolour, sometimes digitally, and i also work in graphite, and pen & ink. occasionally i blend some or all of those methods.i also write - my published work to date is paranormal romance, though i have works in progress in the mystery and general fantasy realms.



blue moon atelier radioi almost always listen to music when i’m working on art, so i decided to share my favourite music! an eclectic mix of prog, alternative, indie, some 80s new wave & pop, goth, a smidge of metal, a bit of ambient, and a smattering of jazz. kind of like old-school aor.i host the 80s hour on wednesdays at 5pm est.
