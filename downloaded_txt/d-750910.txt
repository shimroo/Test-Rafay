jesus needs souls who listen to him in silence.saint rafael arnaiz
 







desire for god.

our lady of the angels monastery is a community of trappist-cistercian nuns. our life is wholly ordered to contemplation. we journey together towards an ever closer personal union with christ, through mutual care, a balanced life of prayer, work and study, according to our cistercian tradition, in communion with the church and in intercession for the world.
							
						









the lord is coming! it’s time to watch. as the first christian communities, pray, “come, lord jesus.” this powerful and humble prayer can transform your day no matter how busy you are. and, when christmas comes, you’ll be ready to celebrate; you’ll truly know that the lord is emmanuel, god with us.
