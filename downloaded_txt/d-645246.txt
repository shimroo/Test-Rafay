when visiting the creek environment, please remember that most of our creeks receive stormwater that can carry pollutants. due to their urban environment, most of the creeks have bacteria levels that exceed state standards and could pose a health risk to humans and pets even when the water looks inviting. please enjoy our creeks from designated trails in our parks.
