come travel with me and here's what you will see,â 
as i travel around the country in my rv!







my name is khloe paws.â â  i am now part of the âpaws familyâ to spread joy and happiness to my pet parents.â â read about me and how it came to be that i am here with them.







my name is krystal paws.â â i am the new addition to the paws family. after dolly passed away in 2017, they did not know if they were going to get another dog, but as time passed something very special happened.â â read about me and how it was met to be that i am part of this special family.â 







my name is dolly paws. i am the new addition to the paws family. after daisy had passed away, bill and nancy were
very sad and they said to themselves that they wanted another maltese. i was only 3 months old when they got me, and i will now be part of their life as we travel and i see new and exciting things. my how time flies, i just celebrated myâ 
one-year-old birthday on april 14, 2004.â â â â 







my name is daisy paws. i will take you on one of the many travel adventures that i have made in my recreational
vehicle. but, first, let me tell you a little bit about myself. i am a maltese, this is a toy breed of dog that some sayâ 
belonged to the ancient egyptians thousands of years ago, and some also say that my breed began on the island of malta. the average weight is between 4 to 6 pounds, but i am a little heavier, you know how that goes when you get a little older! i can have my hair grow as long as down to the floor, but my owners prefer to groom me to a shorter length. i have a black nose as well as black around my eyes.â 







my name is lady ii paws. i am the second dog that bill and nancy have had. since bill and nancy were still working
when they got me, i have been on many adventures with them. while they were still working i mainly traveled with them
as we took weekend trips or a weekâs vacation to nevada, colorado, utah, montana, oregon, wyoming, alaska, and mexico. we were either fishing, water or snow skiing, hunting, backpacking, or just sightseeing. after they retired, we went full-time rving, i went from the west coast to the east coast, north, and south on a grand tour of a lifetime.







my name is lady i paws.  i am bill and nancyâs first dog, i look like a brittany spaniel and that is why they named me
lady. i was a stray on a cold, rainy night when they found me and took me back to their home. they did not think at that time that they were going to have a dog, because they were just married. they had so many activities that they did that owning a dog might make it hard to travel. luckily for me, they did not find my owner, and i spent 10 years
traveling with them from the west coast to mexico.â â â 







about my "human parents," bill and nancy.â â they have been married for over 50 years, and started camping with a
tent, then a station wagon, and then bought their first mini motor home. as retirement approached they knew that they would sell their house and go full-time rving and that is where part of this story begins.

they have been traveling full-time in their rv for 20 years, they are seasoned travelers and have been throughout the united states, canada, mexico, alaska, and hawaii. they enjoy all sports from water skiing, snow skiing, golfing, tennis, fishing, backpacking, riding their mountain bikes, and oh yes, also traveling and sightseeing. i was lucky enough to be able to see so many places with them and so i have many stories to tell you about.â 







about the six of us. read about the five of us, the paws family that began in 1965 and continues today.â â pets are a part of our lives, and we have had many special trips with them.â â one has been to the northwest territories, one to tepic the capital of nayarit state in western mexico, and one traveling down baji california sur to cabo san lucas.







about our recreational vehicle. i have been traveling around in a 1980 - 34 foot silver streak travel trailer pulled with a 1979, 1 ton ford pickup truck with an 8-foot custom build cab over camper. on top of the camper is a 15-foot gregor aluminum boat along with a collapsible boat trailer. on the front of the truck is one of my favorite toys, my motorcycle, and on the rear of the trailer is where our mountain bikes go. talking about "taking it all with you"! there is so much to tell you about our rv, and how it was set up for full-time traveling and helpful hints.







how to buy your rv. information about buying a recreational vehicle, do you want a travel trailer or a motor home?â â how your lifestyle and your travels help you decide what works best for you.







how to buy your camper. information about buying a camper.â â how we designed our camper for our needs, so that
we could take it all with us.







how to buy your boat. we have owned three boats, and when it came time to retire we knew we had to downsize so that we could have a car-top boat on top of the camper for fishing all over the country.



as you read about the places that we have been to during our marriage with our pets, you will soon realize that we traveled from the 1960s to the 2000s.â â when gas prices were cheap, rv parks were cheap, and you could almost go anywhere without reservations.

we are glad that we traveled during this time and saved many weeks of vacation time to allow us to drive the alcan highway to alaska for six weeks, and to have traveled three times to mexico.

as we returned to many places that we saw back then, we could see the changes with more people traveling to yosemite, yellowstone, and zion national park just to name a few.â â now to see these areas you have to plan and make reservations, and wait to get into the parks, something that we did not have to do.

so go back in time and see the places we traveled to with our paws family, you wonât be disappointed.

i will take you there, come travel with me!
