icdd courses




icdd training courses teach both theoretical knowledge and practical applications of x-ray fluorescence spectrometry and x-ray powder diffractometry. instructors have extensive experience in the field and are specially selected from academia, government, and industry to deliver the best of theory and practice.
the focus on practical applications, hands-on experience, and intense personal instruction differentiates icdd courses from other training courses. participants gain practical skills, enhance their understanding of these advanced analytical techniques, and receive insights into optimizing instrument performance, data analysis, and interpretation. these clinics provide a unique opportunity for professionals and researchers to stay current of the latest developments, ensuring proficiency and effectiveness in their applications of xrd, xrf, and rietveld refinement in various scientific fields.

jade® = everything you need for xrd pattern processing!
• whole pattern fitting + rietveld – simulation and visualization – cluster analysis •
• one-click analysis – flexible multi-seat license – always up-to-date •
materials data®, also known as mdi, and the international centre for diffraction data are now united and continues to serve the global xrd community. icdd and mdi have worked together in a complementary manner since mdi began in 1987.
materials data creates xrd software applications to collect, analyze, and simulate xrd data. mdi is best known for jade, which may be found in labs wherever x-ray powder diffraction data is explored. mdi software works universally with every manufacturer of xrd equipment to help provide unbiased results.

who we are
the international centre for diffraction data (icdd®) is a non-profit scientific organization dedicated to collecting, editing, publishing, and distributing powder diffraction data for the identification of materials. the membership of the icdd consists of worldwide representation from academe, government, and industry.





diffraction databases you can trust
the powder diffraction file™ (pdf®) is the only crystallographic database that is specifically designed for material identification and characterization. it is an analysis system that is comprised of crystallographic and diffraction data. these data with embedded data mining and analysis software have been through a quality and classification editorial review system.





iso certified
icdd database operations, based in pennsylvania, usa, is the only crystallographic database organization in the world with its quality management system iso 9001:2015 certified by dekra.
