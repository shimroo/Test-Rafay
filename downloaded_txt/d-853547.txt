						"to date we are extremely happy with our crestwood pool. it's a 24 round that we had incorporated into our backyard deck. it is still as nice as the day it was installed. we couldn't have chosen a nicer pool. our 6 grandchildren were very young when we got our pool and it made summer visits spectacular. our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, friends, and other family members continue to enjoy our pool each summer."
