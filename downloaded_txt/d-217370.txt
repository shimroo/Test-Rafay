o
nce
jim lewis unveiled his revolutionary astrological map, it didn't take
long
for other software developers to jump in. in every case they have made
improvements to the original acg-style map, adding in more astrological
factors (lines), allowing for alternate systems, and offering their own
textual interpretations. because of trademark concerns, most of these
maps
go by other names, and sometimes use alternate symbols or 
nomenclature.
but the same lines given on the original acg map are present on these
other
maps, and often much more. it's all astrological mapping. the public
has
begun to use the term "astrocartography" as a generic term for
astrological
mapping in general, and even for the study of locational influences in
general. 
the original

astro*carto*graphy
map 
by equinox

equinox was one of
the three original
astro*carto*graphy map licensees.  (the other is astrodata,
zurich.)
their maps are almost identical to the maps provided by astro numeric
service
(below), but carry graphical enhancements such as lines in color,
latitude
crossings (parans) listed right on the map. they also print node and
chiron
lines (not included in the original lewis formula.) you can order it
online
at: www.astrocartography.co.uk

the original

astro*carto*graphy
map 
by
astro numeric service 
these linemaps
show where planets
come into conjunction with cusps of  four angular houses, in
your
relocated natal charts, worldwide. their promo says that the map
presents
your "horoscope" in the form of a map, but that's an overstatement.
still 
this is the first astrological map, and started  the
locational
astrology
revolution. everybody should have one, and you will  have fun
when
you  first see yours. in addition to the "angular lines" shown
on
the worldmap, the material  includes lewis' "latitude
crossings"
theory, with a sheet showing yours. you get a quality worldmap (11x17),
and a 48 page booklet giving  the lewis take on the particular
locational
influences that are shown. all for just $18.

astro
numeric service 
astrolocality
maps 
astro
communications service (acs) 
features the same
angular conjunction
lines (just labelled differently), but adds important line markers for
the sextile, trine, and square. call acs directly at 1-800-888-9983
            to
order, as these maps are not listed on their website. ask for
the "astrolocality
map." you can specify u.s. only, western europe, australia,
etc.
you
can also get the world, but their "world" maps don't carry the valuable
added aspect lines (trine, sextile, etc.) because it becomes an
unreadable
mess. for a world view, the maps from astro numerics are larger and
nicer
looking. however, if you want to study a single country, astrolocality
maps provide much more information than available on the first acg map.


for those who
don't have software,
acs is the premier provider of astrological charts and reports, with a
wide range of specialty and arcane items, along with more conventional
stuff.  request their catalog. they have been around a long
time
and
are innovators. the staff at acs is professional, efficient, and
friendly
enough. try to get to know who the long-timers are, especially if an
operator
doesn't know what you're talking about.  if you are into
linemaps,
the astrolocality map represents a great advance over the original
astrological
linemap. you can produce maps just like these -- even  nicer
--
with
the kepler software, reviewed below. maps are 8.5x11.

and locational
astrology
the geostel
brownbook 
 better
guide to acg maps

download

alternative
and surprising guide to acg map lines by practicing locational
astrologer
julian  lee. the brownbook is enriched and
clarified by
over
10,000 personal interviews with people in their locations from 1989 to
2019,
plus studies of public and historic figures, along with a heavy 12 year
practice in relocation consulting. reports the real life facts about
living
with various linemap factors, going far beyond  previously
published
material. the 112 page geostel brownbook lays out
abundant
juicy
details, and  is more direct and particular than either the 44
pg.
acg  booklet, or the lewis-irving work.  based on
actual
feedback
and observation rather than theory, many of its findings are quite
different
from the first acg accounts. it lays out the nitty gritty of locational
factors, meanwhile ushering  you into an entirely new world of
astrology. $5.95

see sample
sections of the brownbook here. 
 
the
psychology 

of astro*carto*graphy 
material
from the first linemap developer jim lewis, put together 
posthumously. 
currently out of print, it is billed as the "definitive work on
astro*carto*graphy," i.e.
on the first astrological linemap, its particular selection of aspects,
and the a*c*g  trademark name. but as the author died young
and
locational
astrology is a vast new field in its infancy, and  developing
rapidly,
it is early to call any book "definitive.

"the
psychology of astro*carto*graphy" is an elaboration on the
original
acg brownbook. (the booklet sent with all acg maps from
astonumerics.) 
the book is well titled, since it deals in psychological theory and
mythological
exegesis, vis-a-vis location, more than with everyday practical life or
phenomena. this approach to astrology  became popular in the
70s
and
80s, and is well represented in "psychology."
compiled by
psychologist
kenneth irving from lewis' papers after his untimely death in san
francisco,
it was out of print as of jan. 2002. you can usually get the used
paperpack at amazon.com.

mapping software









kepler

by cosmic
patterns
kepler
generates astrological
linemaps of excellent graphic quality, and lets you draw lines for the
other major  aspects (sextiles, trines, etc.) -- on a range of
map
pallettes from the globe to regions and states. you can even put in
lines
for asteroids. good-looking maps with a growing range of technical
options
by a developer aiming to be tops. see a full review below.  $300

solarmaps

distributed
by lehman associates

solarmaps
features a geodetic
option that is highly valuable, but deals in only the conjunction
aspect. 
the quality of the map drawings is a substandard. (see review below.)
it
costs  $195 and includes the acs atlas program (necessary to
run
it)
which is normally $195 by itself. ) see a full review below. $199.

winstar
professional 
by matrix
software 
good
looking maps,
not as many
options as the two above, but the best for studying  local
space
lines
(azimuth lines.) see a full review below. $199
