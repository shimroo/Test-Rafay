from a small bedroom apartment in chicago with nothing more than a telephone,d & r industries burst onto the billiard industry scene in 1963.


and after 25 years of distributing fabrics and supplies, a commitment was made to becomethe premier source for high quality billiard fabrics.


a team consisting of engineers, textile professionals and seasoned billiard aficionadoswork together to create the “championship line” of fabrics. manufactured since 1990,championship now sells more billiard fabric than all of its major competitors combined.
