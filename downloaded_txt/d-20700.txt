welcome to our website portal for timshell farmâs 
                  tripleâcross puppies, and for our new program 
                  page for service and therapy dogs in arizona.



























for 17  years, steve & linda rogers of timshell farm have raised specialty triple-cross  cava-poo-chon and petite goldendoodle puppies.  we migrated from central  texas to the magical mogollon rim mountains in arizona, one hour north of  phoenix.  here we continue to lovingly raise our sweet and wonderful  puppies for adoptive families across the u.s. and the world!  our “pause  for paws” non-profit work provides therapy and service dogs to volunteers  bringing special healing and love to people in need â hospitals, counseling,  schools and retirement homes.  we especially enjoy working with juvenile  diabetes research foundation, and gabriel’s angels in scottsdale, az and the  make a wish foundation.
