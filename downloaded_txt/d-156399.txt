(for more on batson see our 2005 interview with him.) the latest producer is rob cavallo, known for his extensive work with pop punk band green day, plus his production for one-time dmb collaborator alanis morissette, chris isaak and jewel. tim reynolds is back in the game, contributing to the new album, presumably in the form of guitar, which explains how tr3 came to join the tour this summer. (see our 2000 interview with him.) there's no eta on the long-developing album, but having surpassed the gestation period for the lillywhite sessions, it has now been in progress longer than any other dmb album. more news »          welcome nancies.org is a ten-year-old not-for-profit website aboutcharlottesville, va usa musical group dave matthews band. this site is run byfans, for fans, and has been named for the song "dancing nancies."  ifyou're new here, we recommend that you read the dmb faqand the nancies.org introduction.              upcoming:  summer tour, august-october new album in fall?                  all trademarks and copyrights owned by their respective owners.  user-submitted comments are owned by theindividual that provided them. all other contents on nancies.orgare licensed under a creativecommons attribution-noncommercial-share alike 3.0 license.
