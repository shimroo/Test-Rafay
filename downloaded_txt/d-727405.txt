we pride ourselves in top quality restorations of all makes and models.









about us
the shop was built in 2004, and it was designed specifically for restoring tractors. it is large enough for multiple restoration projects to be in progress at the same time, and it includes a built-in paint booth. the paint booth is a 30' by 30' area with 150' of cable available for hanging parts. it has in-floor heating which helps control dust, and it has plenty of lighting to guarantee proper visibility while painting.
