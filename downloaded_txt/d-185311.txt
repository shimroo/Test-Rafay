meade monument
direct dimensions recently worked with conservators and the national park service to laser scan the washington, d.c. based meade monument, which honors a u.s. army general from the american civil war. for this project, 3d data was captured with a combination of ground-based lidar and photogrammetry, a great solution for capturing complex sculptural monuments, then rendered and resolved as 3d models. this 3d model serves as an archival digital twin and the images were used to create habs drawings to aid in the preservation of this beautiful monument.
