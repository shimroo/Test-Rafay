“when i hurt my back at age 64 after a diagnosis of severe osteoporosis, i was terrified and didn’t know what to do. my back hurt in two places, between my shoulder blades and in the upper buttocks area. i also had sciatic nerve pain that shot down my leg and kept me up at night.  despite having had extensive diagnostic work done by my doctor, i remained unable to walk, stand, or sit upright comfortably. i could no longer work at my part time job, and i spent most of my day lying down in the most comfortable position i could find.  i knew amy had expertise in low back pain, so i asked her to help.  amy came into my house, identified problematic furniture that was keeping me in pain, and came up with affordable, comfortable fixes. she then designed a comprehensive exercise program that healed my back, and offered the emotional support i needed. she educated me on how to move within my body’s ability, in a way that would heal my back. within days i was standing, sitting, and walking more comfortably, and now i no longer have chronic pain in my back! i am moving comfortably again, back at work, and back to doing things i enjoy, like taking long walks in nature.  i’ve been telling anyone who’s willing to listen about amy and her back healing process!”
