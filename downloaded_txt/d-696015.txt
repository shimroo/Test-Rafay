latest update [january 28, 2025]

                                    believe or not, i still update my website on regular basis :-) some of the latest additions include roger's recent guest appearances
                                    with the sas band or at the jools holland annual tv show, there are always a couple of new tickets or flyers and
                                    i have also managed to fill one gap in my (world's largest) collection of queen/related concert programmes - i have been sent a copy of the programme from wintershall 2001 where roger performed a medley of queen songs.
                                    the remaining seven (?) missing programmes are of highest priority so if you have any of the programmes shown below please get in touch. the prices/values are just estimates. if you have any of these
                                    programmes but feel the value is higher please let me know!
