anti-masonry: points of view












 



 








what's 
        here?
since the earliest days of freemasonry 
		and for over three centuries, there have been people 
        and groups who opposed its existence for various reasons. on this site, 
        we describe:





the objections to freemasonry
  
          - including new world order, conspiracies, 
			'freemasonry is a religion' and more





 
those
          who oppose masons and masonry - with lots of 
			information about masonophobia





 
freemasonry 
          itself 
            - including masonic charities, books about masonry, famous masons, 
			joining masonry, 
            and much more....
