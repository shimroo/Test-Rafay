located in what was once old california restaurant row, fish house vera cruz has been a leader of fresh seafood for over 40 years. 

















 

watch this video for a deeper understanding of the history of old california restaurant row and the influence on san marcos. 

fish house vera cruz opened in december 1979 and set out to offer the largest variety of fresh fish in san diego county. our fish market and restaurant derives its name from the rugged commercial fishing boat the "vera cruz", which was built in 1965 in costa mesa, california. the vera cruz has been admired by artists as well as commercial fishermen over many years. all our seafood is mesquite grilled which brings out the total flavor of each fillet. we offer an extensive list of fresh seafood options year round, as availability is subject to weather and fisherman's luck. you can check our our fresh fish menu for today's seasonal selections.the interior of fish house vera cruz is unique among san diego restaurants and features adobe brick walls and salvaged douglas fir wood beam ceilings from oregon, as well as gorgeous fish tanks throughout the bar and dining room. our rustic, sea inspired style makes dining with us as unique as the seafood you will find on our menu.thanks for visiting our site and we hope you eat lots of fish!
