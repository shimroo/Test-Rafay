parallel programming laboratory


















































welcome! we are the parallel programming laboratory.
our goal is to develop technology that improves performance of
parallel applications while also improving programmer productivity. we aim to
reach a point where, with our freely distributed software base, complex
irregular and dynamic applications can (a) be developed quickly and (b) perform
scalably on machines with thousands of processors.
processor virtualization is one of our core techniques: the
programmer divides the computation into a large number of entities, which are
mapped to the available processors by an intelligent runtime system. this
separation of concerns between programmers and the system is key to attaining
both our goals together.

  charm++ version 8.0.0 release

- the license has changed to apache 2.0 with llvm exception.  this
  change to a popular open source license is intended to simplify use,
  collaboration, and greater community involvement in the development
