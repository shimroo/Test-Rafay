authorities are searching for a pit bull and its owner after a man says the dog attacked him, seemingly for no reason, over the weekend along a street in mount lebanon.

paul kruper’s face is torn up, the gash is difficult to look at. it took more than a dozen stitches to stop the bleeding and he will most likely need plastic surgery.

“at that moment, you get a cut on your face, there was blood pouring down my chin, there was blood everywhere,” said kruper.

it was labeled "innocence."

but the photo of a woman with an exposed breast -- from a historic painting hanging in the mercer county courthouse -- might be construed otherwise, according to mt. lebanon public library officials, who asked photographer john flatz to replace it with something else.

he refused, and thus began a tug of war that has, for now, ended in a draw.

at 17, nathan zezza of mt. lebanon wasn't even old enough to vote in the presidential election earlier this month.

but that didn't stop him from working more than 500 hours on the campaign to re-elect president barack obama, manning phone banks and pounding the pavement.

he thought his big reward for that effort was the president's re-election.

but last weekend, he found out he's getting a more personal reward. nathan, a senior at mt. lebanon high school, received an invitation from the president, vice president joe biden and their wives to a holiday reception dec. 18 at the white house.
