king family vineyards is a family-owned and operated winery. we’re known as one of the best wineries in virginia. the gorgeous foothills of the blue ridge mountains in crozet, virginia are stunning. and, just 15 minutes from charlottesville, there’s so much to do and explore. 
we specialize in the production of premium wines that showcase the remarkable quality and terroir of the monticello ava. beginning with carefully selected grapes, winemaker matthieu finot creates wines inspired by the old world, but uniquely expressive of virginia wine.
our passion is the customer. our craft is the wine.
“when you visit our tasting room, you are coming to our home.we hope you enjoy the fruits of our labor as much as we enjoy sharing them with you.”
-the king family

great wine, huge vineyard, with amazing views! they also have polo matches with a very well kept lawn for viewing that reminds me of golf course grass. the wine tasting was great.

the entire experience was incredible. the staff was the friendliest by far out of the 15 wineries we went to. the wines we’re great and the property was the prettiest and so well laid out. our number 1 recommendation!!
