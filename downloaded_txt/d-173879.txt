casual atmosphere. serious faith.
first and foremost, eastlake church is people helping people find and follow jesus. sure, there are lots of ways to describe what a church is like, but we figure that it’s pretty important that we tell you up front that he is what we’re all about. so if you’ve got questions about jesus, we’d like to think that we’re a good place for you to find some answers. and if you’ve already decided to follow jesus and are looking for a place to get plugged into ministry and connect with other people in a meaningful way, we believe that eastlake church is a good place for you to take your next right steps in faith.
