 hey we're back! they finally updated the old games and we even might get a new one eventually. can you imagine what that will look like? an update from our flash site was long over-do and this was a motivating moment. special thanks to my good long time friend moudy for enlightening me to the news. since 2001 i am also the webmaster of   lara croft online and bloodrayne.net since 2002 and yes it is a tried and tested fact that many tomb raider fans love bloodrayne and probably hope there would be a crossover 
										game someday.  to once again test that theory we're setting up a section for bloodrayne help and discussion on the  lara croft online forums.




bloodrayne: terminal cut: in the years between the world wars, agent bloodrayne works as a killing machine for the brimstone society â a top secret fraternity that hunts down and destroys supernatural threats. two missions, five years apart, turn out to be connected by one man. in this frenetic and bloody third-person shooter that unleashed the iconic red-headed femme fatale on the world, the dhampir rayne faces horrific creatures, hordes of soldiers with an array of tools and firepower, and every nazi officer that stands between her and the one she must stop.
bloodrayne 2: terminal cut:
bloodrayne is a dhampir, born from the unnatural union of vampire and human. blessed with the powers of a vampire but cursed with the unquenchable thirst for blood and a weakness to sunlight, rayne is challenged with her most personal battle yet as she hunts down her siblings. with new acrobatic movements and rail sliding, fast-paced blade and gun combat, fatal finishing moves, more dhampir powers like time control, and an extensive combo system, bloodrayne 2 is a brutally satisfying continuation of the iconic series.

terminal reality

bloodrayne: betrayal is the third game in bloodrayne series. in a big departure from the previous parts, the game uses a much more cartoonish and comic-like approach, both in its graphics style and its increased use of humorous content. it is a side-scrolling action platformer in vein of castlevania titles, with strong emphasis on stylish and exaggeratedly bloody hack-and-slash action.
on the request of the brimstone society, rayne leads a group of soldiers to a gigantic, evil underground castle to battle kagan, her father. the soldiers don't turn out to be too effective, but at least rayne gets help from surprising directions. rayne is able to dash, take long backflips, and wall-jumping is an effective technique for navigating the castle. she may attack enemies with her blades, and guns and kicks, with various combo attacks. being a dhampir - a half-vampire - she's also able to drink the blood of her enemies to recover her energy. she's also able to infect enemies, essentially turning them into walking bombs that she can detonate on her whim, causing spectacular spreading explosions.
