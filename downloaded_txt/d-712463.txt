colorado’s safety net is in crisis





















in 2024, an estimated 575,000 coloradans lost their medicaid coverage as pandemic continuous enrollment ended. many are still eligible for medicaid but unenrolled due to barriers or they are unable to afford private health insurance. without this coverage, they are unable to access the health care they need. providers who serve them across the state are seeing large increases in uninsured patients, creating significant financial burden. additionally, health care providers are facing higher costs for supplies, prescription drugs and labor – and the medicaid reimbursement they are receiving doesn’t cover the costs.

 what you should know about the medicaid crisis in colorado



1













colorado is among the worst states in the country for disenrolling medicaid members following the covid crisis. further, a significant portion of coloradans who lost their medicaid coverage did so for procedural reasons, not eligibility reasons - meaning they are being denied health care benefits to which they are entitled under federal law.



2













the loss of medicaid coverage is driving increases in number of uninsured coloradans seeking health care services. losing coverage is devastating for vulnerable coloradans and the increasing number of uninsured is financially unsustainable for the health care safety net that serves them.



3













this crisis impacts not only medicaid clients and health care providers who serve them, but the broader colorado economy, as medicaid is a critical piece of the health care sector and health care is a major industry in our state and a critical employer, particularly in rural communities.



4













this is an urgent situation: if policymakers don’t act soon to stabilize the health care safety net and address medicaid enrollment challenges, our state will lose critical health care infrastructure that will be costly, if not impossible, to rebuild.

denver (kdvr) — colorado’s budget is facing a billion-dollar deficit this year.the  governor has proposed cuts in some areas for members of the state’s  joint budget committee to consider. one group that could be impacted  urged lawmakers to find another way. nearly 50 healthcare groups that do  not always see eye to eye are all asking state leaders not to issue any  cuts to medicaid.“it’s not a group that always agrees on all the health policy  solutions. in fact, sometimes we very respectfully disagree on what the  solution is. when it comes to medicaid folks and the lowest income folks  in colorado, i think this coalition is very clear in knowing that we  cannot balance our budget off the back of the poor and the vulnerable,”  said ross brooks, colorado community health network ceo.

over the last 15 years, colorado voters and policymakers have prioritized health care coverage and access. we have worked together to ensure our neighbors could get the care they need when they need it. our health care system is far from perfect, but colorado’s progress has been undeniable. sadly, administrative failures in the medicaid program over the last year have put that progress in jeopardy and created real hardship for coloradans and our communities. we are now counting on our state partners in the polis ad-ministration and the general assembly to step up in the next legislative session to strengthen medicaid and support health care safety net providers.
