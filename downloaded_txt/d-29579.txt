==> our initial eclipse report is here. <==
for science!
we will try to run a cw beacon w6rek/b from near trenton, south carolina usa,
on some hf bands (probably 10, 20, 40, 80, & 160 meters)
before, during, and after the solar eclipse of august 21, 2017.
(you might be visiting this page because you received the beacon.)
our site is in the path of totality of the eclipse.
the purpose is to generate data for scientists studying the ionosphere
and radio wave propagation.   the reverse beacon network (rbn) will be used to
track reception of the beacon.
we will be isolated at a lake in the country during this time,
where we can operate our beacon station for many hours.
we are aware of the requirements to operate the station and stay below 100w.
we will try to choose frequencies that are not too close to the primary
calling or operating frequency for any common mode or other known use.
(we're currently thinking of around 87 khz above the beginning of
each band, near where digital modes are usually found.)
however it is hard to know everything, and we'll apologize in advance
and beg your patience for any inconvenience caused for a few days around the eclipse.
we will shut down probably a day after the eclipse.
this eclipse provides a rare opportunity to test scientific theories,
and we hope the short-term inconvenience is worth it.
contact me at strick@yak.net or phone 404 452 5484 (use sms, not voicemail)
if we conflict with emergency or higher priority traffic.
thank you and 73, henry strickland (w6rek) and friends of the yak. zut
