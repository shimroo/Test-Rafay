where children come to heal, learn and grow
at the bradley center, children get the help they need to overcome trauma and rediscover hope.

how we help








we believe in hope because we believe in kids.
at bradley, we help children and teens who experience trauma, mental illness, and behavioral challenges.
to succeed, these children often need much more than just a second chance.
they also need guidance, compassion, and help making good choices, so they can grow up to become their best selves.
