he was like a father to me, 
      the greatest salesperson i have ever known, took me under his wing and 
      nurtured me. to  mrs. page and the boys, may the love and the peace 
      of god bind your hearts and minds now and forevermore.

long time friend from grosse 
      baptist church. sill remember a group of fellows were at church picnic on 
      bob-lo island and saw a group of girls from my high school (denby). we 
      talked a little and that is where gordon met linda and the rest is 
      history. praying for you linda and you family.

to one of my very best 
      friends that i have known since august, 1950. gordon has been my very 
      faithful friend for all of these 68 years. how many folks can say that !! 
      i have enjoyed gordon & linda so much during my life as my christian 
      buddies since we have shared many happy and some very sad moments from 
      time to time. i will never forget our trip to the hawaiian islands 
      together in 1961. what a joyous and memorable time we experienced together 
      seeing all the sites and coming home with such a deep tan that my children 
      didn't know who we were.

      i feel very honored and blessed in living my earthly life knowing the page 
      family and look forward to a heavenly reunion with our members who have 
      gone on before us and as we prepare ourselves for an eternity with our 
      lord an savior. may we all live in remembrance of our wonderful friend, 
      gordon.

richard and i were so sorry 
      to hear of my cousin gordon's passing. growing up and living in atlanta, 
      our interaction with the family in michigan was limited to a number of 
      summer trips in various station wagons, but they were memorable. i dearly 
      loved aunt bertha, and loved visiting her home where she would show me 
      around her flower garden (that's where i got that bug!) i only remember 
      gordon and gary from when they were already young men - all the more 
      reason to impress me! i loved gordon's "bigger than life" personality, and 
      am still proud to point out his book to people i've advised about buying 
      cars. prayers and condolences to linda, the boys, and the rest of the 
      family.

gordon will truly be missed. 
      my husband ron and i dearly loved this precious man. he had a heart of 
      gold and was such a blessing to our family. we enjoyed his singing heart 
      in our choir for many presentations and services. linda and family you are 
      in our prayers. until we meet on the side and sing a song there. god bless 
      you. all our love.

dear linda, gordon jr., 
      lance and todd, sorry to hear of your husband and father's passing. but as 
      the apostle paul tells us in scripture, "to be absent from the body, is to 
      to be present with the lord!" what a blessing we have as christians, 
      knowing that you will see him again in glory!

gordon and linda page and 
      their three boys were nearby neighbors to us when they lived in 
      brookfield, wisconsin, they were active members of our church and 
      respected in the automobile sales business. in those days, the country 
      went through tough financial times, and gordon had to shut down his 
      chevrolet dealership. with his positive christian attitude, gordon never 
      gave up, and even wrote a book then. he alway advised people to have a 
      "god-filled day". - bob&jane mitchell & family
