starbucks everywhere








my name is winter, and my goal is to drink coffee from every company-owned starbucks in the world. i have pursued this goal since 1997, and more recently i have developed a passion for lighter-roasted craft coffee and other foodie pursuits.






i finally reached 20,000 starbucks!
