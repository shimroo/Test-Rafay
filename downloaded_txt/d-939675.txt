warm greetings from nepal!...nature talks to you hereabouts...
unique adventure international - we are naturally unique...on our trips, you discover the unknown from the known...
unique adventure international is an adventure operator with our office located in thamel, asia's well known hub for backpackers in the ancient capital of kathmandu, nepal. we specialize in organized trekking in nepal which also includes short hikes, peak climbing, mountain expeditions, mountain biking, & motorcycle trips in the himalayas of nepal. our trips also venture across the border into tibet (china), india, and bhutan. we are well known for operating mountain expedition, 4wd overland excursions, and jungle safaris inside nepal and throughout the southeast region of asia.

unique adventure international has always believed in personalised services. the moment you book with us, you're family. we've always felt like this from our very inception. our ''no frills'' prices are reasonable and pocket friendly. we don't entertain any hidden costs at all. we provide a breakdown of our costing if our clients request it. we offer rich and rewarding mountain cultural experiences on all our trips and take you to places where some trekking companies would opt to just pass by to conclude the trip sooner rather than later. our services are built on a reputation earned through blood, sweat, and tears over the years; we've now crossed the threshold of over two decades. we are noted as one of the best adventure travel companies in nepal. we don't say this, our clients do. safety has always been our top priority. for us, this is mandatory. we are highly vigilant in all our planning and logistics and ensure that care is given individually throughout the whole course of our journeys when on the trails. we make sure we go the mile to make your trip the safest possible without spoiling all the fun so that you enjoy lifetime experiences that can be passed down to generations to come.
welcome to nepal! enjoy unique adventurous experiences you've never really known before...

mera peak - 2014
mera peak : the highest trek in nepal is not a technical climb, you can reach the summit in 9 days from lukla, the last day only 4 hours is necessary to be on the top, you just have to follow a daily vertical higher of 500, 600 meters (walk only in the morning), with only 2 nights in tent. the view is unique and wonderful. in may the rhododendrons are in bloom!

mera peak climbing
our experience in nepal was very gratifying. your company contributed enormously to it. this is more or less, our experience. i hope to meet you next time we go to nepal.

    


                                         jose miguel goni, spain





everest north side advanced base camp - (6500m)
my friend traveled with unique adventure several years ago. so, it was an easy choice for us, when we decided to reach advanced base camp (abc), 6500 m, on the north side of everest. we just contacted khum.

    


                                        jeff zhuk, usa





mera peak 
i was on a 12-day mera peak climbing with unique adventure international, mar 18 to mar 29, 2013. we started from lukla and ended up there.
my original itinerary was to go mera peak, then take amphu lapcha and finally climb island peak.

gokyo and renjo la trek 
the reasons i choose unique adventure international p.ltd. trekking for a trek to mustang in 2008, and again a few weeks ago (april 2013) for a trek to gokyo and renjo la, is primarily because of the company's responses to specific requests i made. 

    


                                        marco capriz, british 





mera peak 
in november we climbed mera peak together with unique adventure international. we were the only two clients and were supported by the guide lakpa and two porters. since we were such a small group we adjusted the program to fit us. 

    


                                        tobias gustafsson & annika, sweden





upper mustang valley with tilicho 
we trekked the upper mustang valley and within the annapurna conservation area with unique adventures. and what an adventure! upper mustang was beautiful with its stark high desert landscape

    


                                        angela and kyle, usa





mustang, throng la pass & tilicho 
i did a 20 day trek through unique trekking company from pokhara to tatopani and then into the upper mustang region, throng la pass and visiting tilicho lake. i could not be happier with my experience. 

    


                                        anthony mitchell , australia 





mustang trek with tilicho lake
we chose unique adventures because of their professional website and prompt and concise answers to all our queries. it turned out to be a really good choice!
we wanted to see the rhododendrons, go to mustang and get into some high altitude areas. khum and his team put together an exciting trek which is now offered on their website.
