the spiritist group of new york ("sgny") is a not-for-profit organization with the main goal of promoting and disseminating spiritism (the "spiritist doctrine") philosophy according to the teachings of allan kardec. the sgny does not charge for any of its services or activities; its members, associates and/or volunteers do not receive any type of compensation for their services. revenue from the sales of books, magazines, videos, and audios is entirely used to cover sgny's expenses. the views expressed in the books, magazines, videos, and audios sold, recommended and/or referred to by sgny members, assocites and/or volunteers belong to their authors, and those views do not necessarily represent the views of the sgny or of any of its members, associates and/or volunteers. the sgny does not promise or guarantee physical, spiritual, emotional, and/or mental healing, cure or improvement to attendees, their relatives or acquaintances. although the spiritist philosophy advocates the possibility of physical, spiritual, emotional and/or mental healing, cure or improvement through its study and practice, it also advocates the causational complexity of suffering and illness, and of their solution. therefore, sgny recommends to attendees, their relatives or acquaintances who seek physical, spiritual, emotional and/or mental healing, cure or improvement not to disregard, interrupt and/or abandon ongoing and/or future traditional methods of treatment.©2008 copyright by sgny.powered by wordpress - developer: renataventura.com
