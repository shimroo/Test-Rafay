a little peace of me! i am me and going to find her again real soon!





i was just sitting here watching sex in the city the movie and wondering to myself ; how do you know if you are really happy? why are there things that i am not sure about? why does the relationship i'm in seem like its standing still? how do i make my relationship lively and functional again? how can i make myself fell for him the way i did in 1997 how i ask? does anyone know the answer to that question does anyone know how to change something that has been in the same spot... i find my self always under the gun with question like do you still love me? do you wanna be with me? and of course i have to sit back and wonder am i lying to this man? can this relationship be saved? can we get out of this rut? so many questions and no one to answer them for me! i want the butterflies in my stomach i want to wonder is he gonna kiss me.... i want to feel those feelings again. am i being selfish for dreaming for happiness when i am part of the reason we are masking are true feeling. i have a man that truly loves everything the way that it is, however is very clear about the things that i should be doing to pledge my undivided love for him. i want the little things. i feel like i have lost who i am .... do i deserve to be happy and how do you go about making yourself happy without destroying the people you care about the most.. i love my man but how do i fall back in love with our relationship?     something big is missing in me... and has been gone for the longest time. i need to find it desperately, maybe i should work on myself first and get things right in my head and get to know myself again. i am going to school and loving it! i am a mom to 2 beautiful children that i love more then anything in this world, but am i wrong for not liking staying home. i don't like to clean, or cook what am i doing i am making myself miserable. a little something i need to get worked out don't you think. time to go to bed and think about how to make me a better happier person! i know no one is going to read this kinda like my own online journal of thoughts.

i guess it has been forever





i don"t think anyone even looks at this thing anymore! but i am going to write anyway. a lot of time has gone by since i last wrote my son is 1 year old now he is such a handful. linzie is in school so weird that i actually have to take her everyday.. not like daycare where i can keep her home. everything is pretty much the same though just taking care of kids cleaning... nothing really exciting to report. i am sitting up writing on my blog at 10 :30 at night and my kids are sleeping very peaceful....

stay at home mom is hard yo!





ok so i have been staying home for about 3 months and i like it for the most part i just don't understand why my house wont stay clean, i clean it everyday and now i have a chris's 16 yr old daughter staying with us again and it is better then before but she is still not very nice to linzie and that really bothers me and i know it hurts linzie's feelings. no matter what we say or do to her she still treats her like a peace of crap.... she sneaks my phone at night and stays on the phone till 4 in the morning and the computer  she never gets off that thing ever! i mean i knew it was gonna be tough but i also know that chris can't just tell her no when she asked if she could stay and finish school, but i don't want to get stressed out over it and i can't keep complaining to chris cause it annoys him i just have to let him witness it for himself..          another subject i am going to be starting school soon try to get a better job when i have to go back to work... the baby is getting so big, he is walking already and a big handful. well people or whoever i don't even think anyone ever looks at these anymore but leave your feedback...

backache is a part of pregnancy





so that is what the doctor has told me, i am getting closer and closer to the end and now i am trying my best to cope with this backache..but complain complain i guess that is what i do best... everything else seems to be going pretty well. i can't really do much these days but i am gearing up for this baby i guess i should enjoy not having to deal with a crying baby but really i am dealing with linzie and she can be quite a handful most of the time.so i guess i am saying i would rather have my energy back...... thats it for now nothing to exciting but it is an update..

this is almost over guys





i am kinda nervous, cause after i go into labor i am gonna have a little boy. iam so ready to not be pregnant, but am scared wondering how in the world am i gonna deal nwith 2 kids... i have no patience as it is..haha i know things will get better once i have this kid and am not so emotional right.. i know egveryone is ready for me to be myself again...or not. on another note everything else seems to be going pretty good so far other then the tiredness but i think i am just gonna have to deal with it till this kid is born. i can't expect to wanna jump rope or anything you know. i have alot of things to do still, well everything, i am gonna have a baby shower and whatever i dont get i am gonna need to go buy. i still have to pack a bag to carry to the hospital for me and the baby.. i really still have plenty of time but it is getting closer. everyone pray that i dont go insane before the end haha.... this is it for me guys no more babies, does this mean i am getting old.i really and truly don't like being preggo so i am gonna turn the baby machine off. haha well that is an update on me and the little one write back soon........
