happy customers












cribley was able to help us out with our well problems. jack, joe and the ladies in the office (sorry i didn’t catch their names) were all great to deal with. they were out here quickly and solved our issues. fast, courteous, efficient what more could you ask for! i’d recommend cribley to anyone that needs well service.

very prompt and courteous service from tod and justin. they came out within two hours of our call with a backhoe, were able to locate a break in an underground pipe near the well head and repaired it within three hours after arrival, in extremely cold weather. even apologized for the mess in the yard (not a problem if it means we have water!). also did a couple of extras/upgrades that we asked for at the last minute for our 36 year-old system. very refreshing to have such great customer service. thank you !

a huge shoutout to ken & chris from cribley well drilling for coming out right away for no water at our home. i was expecting a new well pump but, when they removed the well cap, they found a wire nut rusted and broke. they fixed the connection, put a new regulator on the bladder and filled the bladder with air. now how much more honest can it get? so appreciated!
