$5,000 for a homicide in champaign county
$2,500 for a crime involving an illegal gun in champaign county
up to $1,000 for tips leading to an arrest in any other crime or a fugitive

to be eligible, and to protect the tipster's anonymity, tips must be submitted via one of the following ways:


call our call center at 217-373-tips (8477).  this professional call center is operated by civilians (not law enforcement) and are specially trained to take crime stoppers tips. information will be anonymously relayed to local law enforcement for investigation. calls are not recorded and all caller id information is electronically stripped and deleted.

note-tips received via email, social media, reported directly to 9-1-1, police, etc., will not be accepted, processed, or eligible for a reward from crime stoppers.
 
when you contact crime stoppers, you are not contacting law enforcement. we do not record phone calls or using any tracking schemes. sophisticated and expensive technology is employed to ensure your identity will never be known to anyone.

you will remain completely anonymous and neither crime stoppers nor the police will ever know your identity. we don't want your name, just any information to help solve local crimes and put criminals behind bars.   
champaign county crime stoppers relies on a community volunteer board of directors and tax deductible contributions from the public in order to operate the program.
