we have stayed here 5 times, every time it has been enjoyable and relaxing. we will be back again. stayed in the skiff house this time and really enjoyed the cozy feel of this little room. woke up to a ship in port and the signal horn blowing. how cool is that for an alarm? i think we should be still putting up the flag in the morning and taking it down in the evening tho. also, miss feeding the deer, but i understand they have their social distancing stuff going on as well with cwd. but all in all this is a must experience for all that would like a different one.

the lighthouse b&b is amazing. everything about this place is charming. my friends and i were already making plans to come back before we even left. it’s everything you dream of and so much more. the lighthouse is so beautiful and we saw three ships! the wildlife were all over the place and for once in my life, i was not chased by a goose! they seemed to tolerate us being around and we loved it!! put this place on your list of places to stay. you won’t be disappointed

this is my absolute favorite place! staying at an actual lighthouse and on beautiful lake superior, is the most amazing thing ever! it is so beautiful there. the lighthouse is very clean and beautifully decorated. i love it!!

this is a very nice and clean property. we stayed in the actual lighthouse. the rooms were very nice, along with comfortable mattress. there were board games for us to play in the evening, otherwise with the location you can walk the break wall, take a walk along the shore or sit outside and enjoy the view. the only issue are the stairs. stairs to get into the building and all of the bedrooms/bathroom is on the second floor. but we will be staying again.

a good friend of mine and i took over the entire lighthouse b&b. how fun. great views, comfortable beds, the robes were a great surprise… place was clean, loved full kitchen and living room reminded me of days gone by as a kid when we turned on the radio. we even took our own lantern into the tower when it was dark and just us climbing the stairs. fun! melissa could not have been sweeter and made sure we enjoyed our stay. we especially enjoyed lowering the flag at dusk and raising it in the morning. cudos to the staff. we’re recommending to our friends that they put this on their bucket lists.
