a deep sea adventure 

 


a deep sea adventure
the sea silhouette collection is all about nautically-themed features that send children on a deep-sea odyssey. scaled for big adventures, they often serve as the focal point of your splashpad®. each elevated product remains slightly abstract, encouraging little ones to exercise their imagination.

rain, rain come today

 


rain, rain come today.
inspired by children’s unconditional love of playing in the rain and jumping in puddles, vortex created the perfect accessory: ombrellos! these play features are part of the splashpad® contemporary collection, an extensive array of sleek, urban designs that can be integrated into any landscape.

explore

 


explora collection
the explora collection invites little ones to explore the world around them (and beyond)by pushing, pulling, and spinning colorful orbs of different sizes – even oversized ones! the result is a series of moving play events that get kids moving! these highly kinetic products help children develop motor skills and keep them engaged.

the world's most loved brand

 


a splashpad® for the world’s most loved brand

the lego discovery center in texas (usa) features the first lego-themed water playground in the world. vortex created custom lego water features: familiar characters such as captain redbeard, the parrot, and other pirate-themed mini-figures, treasure chests and palm trees contribute to on-brand storytelling and unforgettable experiences.

beauty meets structural integrity 

 


beauty meets structural integrity
our structures are recognized for their vibrant and attractive colors. but beneath the colorful paint lies high-end stainless steel, making our products built to last.
manufacturing excellence












 










legendary stories of the high seas

 


legendary stories of the high seas
from peter pan to pirates of the caribbean, adults and kids never tire of the legendary stories of the high seas: buried treasure, cannons, hidden coves and beaches, and of course the skull and crossbones. a real play battle opportunity awaits little swashbucklers with this multi-deck, multi-cannon configuration, part of our elevations™ product line.

natural formations for early childhood play

 


as children, we valued natural water settings because of the rich and varied sounds, textures and reflections. pico and alto, two new water journey™ experiences designed especially for toddlers and preschoolers, are inspired by natural elements like cascades, mountain formations and rivers. pico and alto streams water down small indentations. as children interact with the rocky walls and interactive accessories, they manipulate the way the current moves.
water journey™ 












 










the "green room"

 


the “green room”
inspired by surfers’ favorite spot, the hollow tube or barrel space that forms inside the wave as it breaks, the water tunnel is a highly interactive ground spray feature, inviting children to run through and dodge the water sprays!
ground sprays collection












 










becoming the focus attraction
