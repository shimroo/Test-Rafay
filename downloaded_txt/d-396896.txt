"rose transports readers back in time to a world where the pursuit of power supersedes all aspects of what is right. vera is a woman who is ahead of her time in her efforts to obtain equal rights and respect for all women. the mix of history with compelling characters both real and fictional is the true priceless treasure in this beautifully written novel."  —jeff ayers, associated press
"rose's latest stand-alone is a gilded age gem highlighting social injustices and an ahead-of-her-time woman's resolve to make a difference. rose's elegant narrative and timely dialog express her characters' humanity and inhumanities, while her research and attention to every detail occasionally make it difficult to separate facts from fiction. a must-read for lovers of atmospheric historical fiction."  —library journal (starred review)
"rose's newest title is complex and compelling, with many threads of history, plot, and character that weave together into a bold, satisfying tapestry. along the way, she touches on issues society still faces: power, privilege, anti-semitism, women's sexual, social, and professional rights, and the never-ending struggle for tolerance and equality. smart, fierce, lovely, and intricate." —kirkus (starred review)


new york, 1910: a city of extravagant balls in fifth avenue mansions and poor immigrants crammed into crumbling lower east side tenements. a city where the suffrage movement is growing stronger every day but most women reporters are still delegated to the fashion and lifestyle pages. but vera garland is set on making her mark in a man's world of serious journalism.


shortly after the world-famous hope diamond is acquired for a record sum, vera begins investigating rumors about schemes by its new owner, jeweler pierre cartier, to manipulate its value. vera is determined to find the truth behind the notorious diamond and its legendary curses—even better when the expose puts her in the same orbit as a magazine publisher whose blackmailing schemes led to the death of her beloved father.


appealing to a young russian jeweler for help, vera is unprepared when she begins falling in love with him...and even more unprepared when she gets caught up in his deceptions and finds herself at risk of losing all she has worked so hard to achieve.


set against the backdrop of new york's glitter and grit, of ruthless men and the atrocities they commit in the pursuit of power, this enthralling historical novel explores our very human needs for love, retribution—and to pursue one's destiny, regardless of the cost.
