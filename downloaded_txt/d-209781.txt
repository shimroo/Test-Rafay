autocad 
          batch script?



= 
          features unique to hurricane.






"autocad 
              batch scripts" allow you to process any number of drawings 
              with your own commands!




manage 
              your files to process. keep lists, save "project" directories. 
              share these lists and "user-scripts". combine user scripts 
              to accomplish complex editing tasks. (you can even store scripts 
              specific to each project, and retrieve them easily.)




this 
              means you can easily use autocad to batch plot your files, batch 
              purge, batch bind, batch script anything, maximizing your pc's power 
              to perform redundant tasks fast! 

 

add 
            more time-saving batch script functionality to autocad 
            electrical, mechanical, and architectural.




batch 
                all drawings run in a single autocad session (they don't 
                "open-run-close, open-run-close...")





"file 
              renamer" - batch rename your dwg files outside of autocad. 
              renumber, append, and search and replace text in your filenames.




definable 
              "tags" - include dynamic data in your autocad 
              batch script without having to edit it every day.




built-in,"command 
            capture utility", "capture" your autocad commands 
            (entered in the command line) in autocad 
            script format, saving you time.



"usersets", 
            to "switch" between working environments quickly, very useful 
            for those working on several projects at a time.

 


 
drag 
                and drop files between explorer and hurricane. drag single 
                files, or drag entire directories, or drag file-lists 
                to the file queue (even file-lists generated by other software)






drag 
                and drop your currently selected directory to 
                hurricane from windows explorer by dragging it from explorer 
                to the hurricane "file selector" menu.

                  support, updates/bug 
                  fixes, and a global 
                  user base like no

                      made in r12, that you need to convert to the latest autocad 
                      version)

                            batch scripts at a particular time of day or night..

other 
          considerations


hurricane 
            does not change any autocad settings, nor will it "take 
            control" of autocad. it simply creates an "autocad compatible 
            batch script".





 hurricane 
                  is in use by all types of autocad users, architects, mechanical 
                  & electrical designers, aerospace, defence and our free 
                  support has been utilized in an mit research experiment.








 hurricane 
                  is autocad 'version independent' - you can be sure that hurricane 
                  works with future versions of autocad (or any other autocad 
                  alternative, such as bricscad®) 
                  without the need to wait for an update to hurricane.

 







all 
                    of hurricane's data is stored in plain text files, not 
                    in clumsy databases, so you can access it in any text 
                    editor.








hurricane 
                    is network or locally installable (all with the same 
                    distribution files), and requires no special setup programs. 
                    just run the setup file and specify any network directory, 
                    and all registered users can run the executable at the same 
                    time! they can share all autocad scripts, with absolutely 
                    no local installations required!









flexible 
                      licensing options! 

                      hurricane (standard) can be licensed to your username 
                      (allows user to use hurricane on multiple pc's), to the 
                      pc itself, to a usb flash drive (portable) 
                      or enterprise/domain 
                      license.













hurricane 
                        does not contain any spyware or adware.
