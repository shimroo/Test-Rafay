patients and parents resources




while the primary intended purpose of this website is to serve the ongoing academic, research, and practice-based needs of its members, the ultimate, intended beneficiaries are the patients and families they see on a daily basis. at the cns, every member counts because every child counts. we encourage the 1 in 5 families with children living with neurological conditions to begin their search for on-line support and guidance by going the child neurology foundation website. those wishing to schedule an appointment with one of our members may click “find a neurologist” to locate a physician nearby.
