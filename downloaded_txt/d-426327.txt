“i never thought i’d find ‘home’ again once i needed 24/7 skilled nursing care. but it happened for me at tabitha’s martha house. i don’t know what i’d do without my friends and caregivers here. they’ve made it so that i’d never want to live anywhere else.”
mabel, tabitha residence client




“after experiencing the love and compassion my dad received from tabitha at the end of his life, giving back was a no-brainer. it’s the least i can do for someone else’s family knowing that tabitha took such great care of mine.”
eric, son of tabitha hospice client




“leaving my home of 40 years, at first i wasn’t sure about the move. but almost immediately, it became my home here … like a second family.”
art, tabitha assisted living resident




“it’s just like home—plus a lot of other perks i never had at home! i’m still close to my family and friends, but now i have all the help i need, whenever i need it.”
mike, tabitha in crete—the gardens assisted living resident




“i never would have imagined the end of life could be so beautiful, peaceful and fulfilling. i thank the journey house staff that my dad was able to live out his final days surrounded by the love of a family, including his tabitha family.”
marcia, daughter of journey house resident




“when it’s your parents, it’s a completely different experience. they cared for us about as much as they did for my husband’s parents, like an extended family member.”
debbie, daughter-in-law of tabitha clients




“tabitha made a difference in my life; i could hardly walk. tabitha did everything they could for me, and i can't say enough good things about them.”
jim, tabitha lifequest client
