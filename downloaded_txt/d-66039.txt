climate change is a health crisis, yet its impact on patient safety is often overlooked. after witnessing its effects at the un climate change conference, i explore why urgent action is needed and how the most trusted profession can lead the way.

member story






lillia mrza's life has been marked by chronic pain due to endometriosis, a condition that went undiagnosed until just before her final exams in nursing school. despite the challenges, lillia persevered, passed her exams, graduated, and became a nurse; however, she was forced to miss her sigma induction because of the pain. this year, her chapter invited her back to officially receive her honor cords.
pain has controlled lillia mrza’s life since she was just 13 years old. but in the year leading up to graduating nursing school, the pain became too much to bear, leaving her bedridden for days at a time.  after countless dismissals from professionals and several visits to the er, lillia was finally introduced to a specialist who would provide a diagnosis—and more importantly, eventually—relief. during a laparoscopy, an investigative procedure of the abdomen, she was officially diagnosed with endometriosis and had all her endometrial tissue removed. despite this being an outpatient procedure, she was forced to stay in the hospital overnight because of her pain.  this all happened the week before her final exams.  “my family and friends tried their best to support me and encouraged me to just focus on the exams so i could finish the program,” lillia said. “i was the last person to take the last exam and it was just my professor and i in the room. i broke down in tears when i turned it in, afraid of the unknown.” lillia had always known she was passionate about helping others and knew for a long time that she wanted to be a healthcare provider. it wasn’t until her grandmother, “nana gina,” was diagnosed with a fast-progressing case of alzheimer’s disease that lillia knew exactly what she wanted to be—a nurse. after all, her grandmother had been a nurse first in iraq, before her family immigrated to the united states. “she was an inspirational woman to us all and the most hospitable person i had ever met,” lillia said. “it was while spending this time with her [after her alzheimer’s diagnosis] that i knew after this chapter closed, the next chapter would be dedicated to finally pursuing my calling to become a nurse.”her perseverance paid off. she is currently transitioning into a new role to work as a registered nurse investigator for the state of arizona. lillia was invited to join sigma in 2022, but because of battles with her health at that time, she was forced to miss her ceremony. she chose to preserve her wellness as much as she could so that she’d be able to attend graduation instead. “it was really hard for me to have missed out on getting inducted with my classmates,” lillia said. “at the same time, i was so happy to see those purple cords around them on our graduation day.”in april 2024, lillia’s chapter, zeta beta, invited her back to her alma mater to officially be inducted into sigma. though graduation had long passed, she finally got her honor cords to wear with pride. “i can’t believe that i had the chance to stand up there with my professors and join sigma,” lillia said. now years after her diagnosis, lillia says life is good. “i am so grateful for everything that was ahead of me following my diagnosis and first procedure. i feel truly accomplished to have passed my boards, gained a certification, and have had a couple of years' experience as a nurse.”while she still experiences pain from time to time, she has discovered a community of women with the same diagnosis, and she finds comfort in sharing her struggles with them. “i no longer feel alone or confused,” she said. “reading others' experiences and learning remedies to manage symptoms has helped me tremendously.”like all sigma nurses, lillia demonstrates the attributes of sigma—love, courage, and honor. but she has gone above and beyond to show that she has courage, and that no amount of adversity could stop her from achieving her goals. as her nursing journey continues, lillia looks forward to improving the health of patrons across arizona and hopes to one day network with all of the generations of nurses she has met at a sigma conference.
