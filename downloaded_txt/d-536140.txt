“fritz michel is doing a great job of combining noticeable genres while blending them to create a sound all their own …a cool vibe… this song is less about the boat crashing and more what do after that, when you see that other person and you realize you’re ok, they’re ok and life doesn’t seem quite as bad as it did before.” — raised by cassettes
