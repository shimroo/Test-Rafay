for sale by owner




 
retail greenhouse, garden center, &
  nursery business
 
successful,
  well-established, and largest greenhouse operation in the county.  included is 6000 sq. ft.
  of greenhouses plus an extra 1800 sq. ft. poly house (brand new  never
  assembled), 1500 sq. ft. garden center retail store (retail store built brand
  new in 1985), very nice 2-3 bedroom ranch home (1100 sq. ft. not including
  its attached garage and full dry basement) which rents for $660/month,
  natural gas heat, award winning municipal water & sewer and all situated
  on huge lot located in the center of a growing, but well controlled, upscale
  progressive small town of 5432. 
 
profitable operation, fully equipped, with plenty of room
  for expansion and excellent growth potential.  includes land enough
  to expand and develop a full service landscape division, which has
  considerable demand and no local competition.
 
this is a wonderful
  opportunity to work for yourself in a delightful
  atmosphere surrounded each day by beautiful plants, flowers, and cheerful
  people.  perfect opportunity for
  grower, manager, or passionate gardener ready to start growing
  his or her own money in this well established greenhouse and nursery!  this is a business that you could even
  be an absentee owner of, if you chose to team up with a manager.
 
net discretionary cash flow (net
  profit to the owner) is currently between $40,000 and $50,000 annually (part
  time  march-june), not including the additional $7,400 annual net income
  from the home if not occupied by owner.
 
historically, the annual gross revenue
  exceeds $60,000 and the annual operation costs are less than $13,000
  (including all materials, supplies, inventory, labor, property taxes,
  insurance, advertising, utilities; gas, electricity, water, sewer, trash, and
  telephone services).  unlike most
  retail operations, there is very little overhead to this business since most
  of the retail product is produced from seeds,
  cuttings, and divisions.  click here
to view a list of plants grown.
 
to facilitate a quick private sale,
  owner has firmly priced this property well below market value to eliminate
  the time consuming burden of negotiating between buyer and seller.  
 
owners
  first preference is to sell outright; however, owner is also willing to
  provide financing through a lease/purchase agreement (rent-to-own) or land
  contract.  a lease/purchase agreement
  for the business property could be arranged with a deposit little as $3,000
  plus inventory. 
 
will sell separately or all together.  the business,
  real estate, and residence are package priced for swift private sale by owner for
  only $149,000 plus inventory and all closing costs.  alternatively, the price is $85,000 excluding the home.  
 
either price includes the
  well-established and registered business name, all equipment, fixtures,
  signage, deed of conveyance, well over 30 years
  goodwill, and covenant not to compete.
 
at
  this point inventory on hand is minimal and estimated to be under $5000
  (mostly supplies & hard goods).  all inventory on hand will be
  priced well below wholesale allowing at least 100% markup on retail items.
 
this opportunity is available on the
  first one with the money gets it basis. 
  owner can be ready to close the transaction for an outright purchase
  of this business and real estate upon issuance of commitment for title insurance
  (within 2 business days) or upon receiving a deposit under a lease/purchase
  agreement.  an outright purchase offer
  will naturally take precedence over a lease purchase offer.  either way, the new owner will be able to
  assume possession and begin operations immediately or as soon thereafter as
  is convenient and practical for the buyer.   
  
 



 
owner is
    also a retiring landlord and has for sale separately, and in addition to
    the above business and home for sale, five other single-family homes in monticello
    that are also package priced below
    market value for swift private sale
    by owner at only $195,000 for all five properties or will sell individually
    or in any combination in between.  
 
in addition to the consistent 3-5%
    annual appreciation of the real estate itself, the minimum annual net
    (after tax, insurance, maintenance, & etc.) rental income to the owner
    of these five houses is between $22,000 and $26,000 (11.3% to 13.3%)
    depending on length of tenancy (1-year or 2-year lease term), which is based
    on the rental rates which were set in 1993.
 
the net rental income is actually greater than reflected
    above, since these figures only represent the base double occupancy rates,
    and as such do not include the additional rent received if there are more
    than 2 occupants.  click here to view the rental rate schedule for these properties.
 
all but
    one of the five homes for sale are located within
    two blocks of the retail
    greenhouse, garden center, & nursery property.
 
one of
    these five homes, a unique 4+ bedroom, 2
    bath, 2 kitchen, 1700 sq ft house (not including its full basement) is
    located on a ¼ acre lot that directly adjoins the above business
    property.  this home can also rent as
    a 2-unit apartment, further increasing the current rental income.  
 
as with the business property, owners first preference
    is to sell these houses outright,
    however, owner is also willing to provide financing through a
    lease/purchase agreement, lease with option to buy, rent-to-own, or land
    contract with a deposit as little as 5%.

    information about seller financing.  click here to view

even if the next owner of this
  business requires financing to make the purchase, this operation will easily
  continue to be quite profitable over and above the finance costs.  a u.s. department of agriculture
  business development loan also possibly available with very favorable terms.
 
this business is eligible for a $3,000
  grant through the facade
  improvement grant program funded by the city of
  monticello. 
 
in the past, this operation
  has run seasonally, less than four months during the year (march-june) and can easily be expanded to a
  year-round operation if a new owner so desires.  in addition to expanding goods and
  services offered and/or operating year-round, both the top and bottom lines
  of this opportunity can be increased by an entering owner who likes to be
  outside the store marketing and/or installing plants, trees, and shrubs.  
 
with staged production, the
  existing indoor growing facilities are large enough to produce at least 20%
  more under roof before the additional greenhouse (which is brand new and
  included) would be required.  there is plenty
  of room for expansion in the outdoor growing area of the nursery as well
  since less than 30% of the 23,000+ square feet of outdoor growing area is used at any one time. 
 
the potential of this business
  opportunity and future growth is limited only by a
  person's imagination and willingness to take advantage of existing and
  growing demand.  many other companion
  operations can easily be added to this existing
  operation.  for instance, there is an
  extreme local demand for landscaping design, supply, and services, not to
  mention lawn care.  while
  current owners do plant trees, shrubs, etc., they have never had the time to
  expand that segment of this operation, but it would be an obvious extension
  of the current operation, especially now that inexpensive and easy to learn
  and use landscape design software is available and most modern pc's are now
  powerful enough to easily run cad software, landscape design and instillation
  would be a natural expansion of the services and a great source of additional
  revenue, all the while allowing the business to operate more than the
  march-june season as in the past.
 
with the exception of
  poinsettias and easter lilies, which are bought in,
  all plants are grown and retailed locally on site.  owner considered wholesale production, especially
  during the off-season, however never attempted wholesale growing after
  researching the possibility, discovered the market to be highly competitive
  and very low profit.  to be profitable
  a wholesale operation must be huge and fully automated = very large capital
  investment with no guarantee of buyers from year to year.  the large wholesalers that have contracts
  are corporate owned, have multiple huge facilities & locations and truck
  their plants coast to coast.  it would
  be difficult to compete as an independent wholesale grower and still make a
  profit.  moreover, growing just one or
  two varieties of plants, as wholesale operations do would get monotonous,
  since part of the fun of this business is experimenting with new varieties
  and interacting with local customers.
 
the internet is another
  untapped market for expanding this business as well, especially into niche
  markets.  
 
another
  option to expand this business to year-round operation would be for the next
  owner to offer fresh cut floral arrangements for occasions including
  weddings, funerals and every day events. 
  silk flowers, balloons, giftware, and other products could easily be added to complement the existing operation
  as well.  a full service florist with
  an emphasis on customer service and satisfaction would be a welcome addition
  to the community.  a floral division
  could easily be further increased through internet presence and/or
  subscribing to a national floral wire service.  
 



 
comment
    added:
 
in years past, we have
    been too busy to visit other garden centers at the beginning of the spring
    season, so when we did observe them it was always after the first of june.
 
we always assumed
    that the reason that their plants were so much of lesser quality than ours
    was that it was the end of their season and that their plants were
    "picked over".  at the same
    time, our plants back home at eades greenhouse & nursery were still
    fresh, compact, and vigorous looking, since we purposely staged our crops
    for that reason (and to conserve bench space).
 
however,
    if what we saw when we walked through the nearest wal-mart on mother's day
    sunday, may 11, 2003, is representative of the typical quality offered by
    the garden centers 20 minutes from here in champaign, urbana and decatur,
    we can now clearly see that we missed a huge market over the years, by not
    advertising in those communities, especially considering their population
    base.
 
the quality of the
    "factory mass-produced" trucked in plants we saw at wal-mart at
    the beginning of their season compared to the superiority of the locally
    grown greenhouse plants we offer is no comparison.  while their mediocre quality plants were
    alive, that is about all that can be said for
    them.
 
the second shock we
    had was the extremely limited selection of plants offered by wal-mart.  see for yourself.  print out www.eadesgreenhouse.com/plants.htm,
    then go to any garden center and compare their selection of annual,
    perennial, and vegetable plants to ours.
 
after the shock wore
    off from the mediocre quality plants and limited selection, we were stunned by the fact that their "everyday low
    prices" were in fact higher than ours were!
 
i
    realize that these are some bold statements.  it is not my
    style to belittle others, as i always stand on my own virtues.  however, at the risk of
    sounding condescending, it is fair to say that if our selection were as
    limited as theirs is, we would consider our inventory sold out for the
    season and if our plants were of that quality, we would call it a crop
    failure and dump them on the compost pile, rather than insult our customers
    with them.  no wonder we
    always received so many warm compliments from our patrons.
 
given my proven record of accomplishment as a successful
    entrepreneur, it is not like me to miss such a wide open market and obvious
    opportunity to easily multiply our volume and bottom-line profit like
    this.  i could just kick myself and
    the only thing i can say in my defense is that when we considered these
    markets 10 years ago, the quality, selection and prices must have been
    considerably better than they are today..at least that is my story and i
    am sticking to it :).
 
sincerely, 
    steve shreffler
 



 
owner
  has streamlined operations and maintained meticulous records of supplies
  & materials and production and sales statistics and is available to
  assist as consultant through transition period.  a certain amount of orientation and consultation will
  naturally be included in the sale of the business and property to insure a seamless transition and the next owner's
  success.  ongoing
  fee-based consulting and/or hands-on assistance can be
  arranged depending upon the next owner's needs.
 
this successful business has been a
  fixture in monticello illinois for over 60 years and since renamed eades
  greenhouse & nursery in 1969, enjoys a celebrated reputation for
  quality.  this operation returns a
  good profit now even though the owner always uses only the best materials and
  has never sacrificed quality for profit.  the firms renowned reputation has always been based on producing the greatest selection
  of the freshest and highest quality plants the area has ever seen. click here
to view a list of plants grown.
 
in
  the last 3 years of operation, during the month of may, annual bedding
  plants & house plants have accounted for 59.6% of the sales,
  vegetable & herb plants 9.9%, hanging baskets & potted flower arrangements
  8.6%, hard goods 8.1%, perennials 5.7%, soil products 5.4%, seeds 2.1%, trees
  & shrubs 0.5%. 
 
this
  business can be 100% operational within 7-10 days and the next owner will
  have full control over the operation as no plants are growing at this time.
 
owner
  has good and legal title and full authority to sell and transfer this business which is owned free & clear including the
  real estate, buildings, & all fixtures, which has no debt, outstanding
  loans, notes, liens, or mortgages or any other encumbrances and is not in
  default of any credit, involved in any litigation or subject to any
  judgments.  owner has always paid all
  account statements/invoices by return mail the same day as received.
 
reason for sale: success in the stock
  market combined with too many irons in the fire.  after working 16-18
  hours/day, 7 days/week for over 20 years (including the 40-48 hours per week
  that it takes to operate this business march - may), owner intends to slow
  down and spend more time with family and have elected to discontinue five of the businesses
  they own and retire in monticello at their home 563 feet east of this
  business property.  having never missed a day of work due to
  illness on over 30 years and not taken a vacation in 12 years, owner wants to
  play hooky for a while.
 
current owners operated this business
  as husband & wife team and as such, the cost of additional labor has been kept to a bare minimum.  using contract labor on a
  piece work basis, the following does not apply to this business, however, if
  employees were hired, under the state and federal agriculture regulations
  which govern greenhouse & nursery operations in the state of illinois,
  this business would be exempt from the following, since the labor
  requirements to operate this business fell far below the following limits; 1)
  with less than 4 employees, this operation would be bound by no minimum wage
  requirement or overtime pay.  2)
  workmans compensation insurance is not a requirement if the business had
  less than 400 workdays of ag. labor per quarter
  during preceding calendar year.  3)
  unemployment insurance is not required unless the business exceeded
  $20,000.00* payroll/quarter or employed 10 or more employees on 1 day
  during any 20 week period.  this type
  of business has the most favorable labor laws and requirements of any small
  business, which further contributes to a surprising low cost of overhead and
  unusually high profit margin.
 
*if memory serves correctly this is per employee, per
  quarter (either way this business would fall far below $20k/quarter payroll).
 
this operation requires no federal,
  state, county, or local permit or licenses, other than simply registering for
  standard tax numbers (no cost or qualifications) and paying a nominal state
  nurserymans license fee of $20 (simple application, no test or credentials
  required).
 
a recent
  development that should positively influence this business is that due to a
  tornado (first in 115 years) that recently struck the city of monticello, it
  is anticipated that this business will benefit from dramatically increased
  demand for nursery stock, due to the destruction the tornado caused to trees
  and shrubs on the west side of the community (you have to look for it but
  its there).  
 
reports tallied the loss of trees to
  be in the thousands and certainly many of those will be
  replaced over the next few years.  with eades greenhouse and
  nursery being the only local supplier of nursery stock, understandably this
  business would be the main source for our residents.  
 
fortunately, the properties on this
  web page were spared serious damage as the tornado
  struck the other side of town.  click here
  to view an email sent at the time containing news stories pertaining to
  the tornado.   
 
this property suffered only minor
  damage due to the tornado, which will initially add at most a day or two to
  the normal 2-3 day annual preparation work, which is typical in for the
  spring startup for a seasons production. 
  the cost of this minor additional maintenance and repairs has been generously factored into the selling price.
 
another aspect to how the storm may
  significantly benefit this business is addressed in
  an article regarding this issue from the local newspaper.  click here to view the article.   
 
in addition
  to several affluent new residential subdivisions and industrial parks that
  are filling right now, there are a number of local multi-million dollar
  capital improvement projects underway (see below), including a brand new
  middle school and a new public safety facility (not that a new jail is even
  needed), all of which will increase the demand for nursery stock for the
  local garden center and bottom line profit for the owner. 
 
if a person
  were to market to these projects, it is very possible that the nursery and/or
  landscaping division of eades greenhouse & nursery alone would net
  additional profits which could easily surpass the annual net income from the
  current seasonal greenhouse and garden center spring operation as
  historically the sales of trees, shrubs, and landscaping have been less than 1%
  of this firms annual sales.

  give an idea of the layout of the garden center complex and make it easier to
  consider possible division options for the sale of this property.  
 
the overall lot size will depend upon by how (and if) buyer
  and seller actually choose to divide the property, which will ultimately be
  determined by what houses and buildings are involved in the sale.  the total lot size is about one acre (which
  is equivalent to one full city block) and is located one block north and six
  blocks east of the center of town.
 
 




- -the community - -




 
 
the above is all located in a city that is a great place to raise children or to get away from the
  busy city and own your own business that already has an outstanding
  reputation.  the lifestyle in
  the city of monticello, illinois is comfortable and secure, offering a nice
  contrast to the hurried and congested lifestyle in a larger city, with
  monticellos rich architecture, abundant green space, continuous and positive
  growth, relaxed pace and down-to-earth midwest values. 
 
blending the charm of country living
  with the services and conveniences of a city, monticello, illinois is a
  unique community of 5,432 in the heart of illinois farm country with an abundance of natural
  resources and unequalled quality of life. 
  located in the center of the sangamon river valley, the dark prairie soil in piatt county
  is some of the best in the nation according to u.s. statistics.  the fertile topsoil is deep and production
  abundant.
 
the
  business and all homes described above are all centrally located within easy
  walking distance of anywhere else in town. 
  this business is included and pictured on page 140 of the hardbound historical book monticello
   150 years later published in 1987.

  medical facilities (number of physicians per capita is 3-times the national average),
  hospital, local based ambulance service, esda, police & fire protection,
  excellent schools, affordable and executive housing, both old and new,
  extensive public library, public airport (medi-evac capable), golf course and
  driving range, large municipal swimming pool and other recreational
  facilities and parks, year-round city-sponsored recreational activities (over
  25 programs and 6 annual special events), local radio station and cable tv
  channel, live theater, local dining & lodging - as well as a established
  daycare, retirement village, nursing home, county health and mental health
  centers, social and senior services, and more than a dozen local churches
  representing the various denominations (64 churches listed in the monticello area, of which 17 are
  here in town), several county and state offices
  including a local drivers license examination station and many other
  amenities and conveniences only enjoyed in larger cities.  
 
in
  monticello, quality is the way of life. 
  monticello has a progressive, friendly government and one-stop city
  services second to none including an excellent recreational program with a
  full-time director, aggressive capital improvements program, enhanced 911
  emergency services system, full time professional 24/7 city police protection
  (officers are also trained first alert responders and each squad car is fully
  equipped including emergency defibrillators). 
 
the
  monticello fire department is fully trained in fire
  and rescue.  most of they calls to
  which they respond are medical assistance and due to the continuing advanced
  training program and state-of-the-art equipment they have, the monticello
  fire department has achieved fire rating code decrease from city class 7 to a
  5 and in turn causing a 10% decrease in insurance premiums city wide
  effective last october.  monticello is
  also located within minutes of multiple trauma centers.
 
in
  spite of the current national economy, the city of monticello currently has
  the largest fund balances (cash in the bank) in the history of the city.  all of this with no debt and no outstanding
  bonds, and most importantly all of this accomplished with no increase in the
  city tax rate.  in fact, the city tax
  rate has decreased each of the last 7 years in a row and the city has
  millions of dollars cash on hand thanks to fiscal responsibility and wise
  long-range planning.  
 
as
  in past years, the recently passed city budget once again includes huge
  capital improvement projects, further enhancing the city, while other
  communities are struggling just to pay their bills.

  illinois and freely used by the residents, there are the monticello public
  schools 5 gymnasiums, weight room, handball court, 2 running tracks, lighted

  beautiful attractions is robert allerton park, a designated national natural
  landmark located just southwest of town. 
  in addition to the large georgian mansion, allerton park consists of 1,500 acres of formal gardens, many famous and
  meaningful statues, nature areas, and miles of walking trails.  more than 100,000 people visit the park

  monticello.  moreover, the u of i maintains a fully staffed county extension office
  located in monticello offering free horticulture, lawn, and garden programs

the air quality in monticello as reported by the epa is rated 46% better than the national average.  this location in central illinois also
  enjoys a climate entirely free of serious natural disasters and occurrences
  including geologic hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis,
  landslides, floods, subsidence/collapse, sinkholes, karsts, mudslides, or
  avalanches.  with the exception of
  minor thunderstorms, and in spite of spite the occasional (but very rare)
  tornado, monticello does not lye in tornado alley and is completely free
  from atmospheric hazards such as hurricanes, droughts, blizzards, nor'easter,
  typhoons, tropical cyclones, tidal waves/tsunamis, el nino/la nina, locusts,
  or wild fires.  due to the low
  population density location, there is virtually no threat of disease
  epidemics, war, riots, urban or other terrorism, and almost no exposure (if
  any) to anthropogenic or technological hazards such as smog, radon, mercury,
  asbestos fibers, coal dust, acid rain, oil spills, or contamination of the
  atmosphere or surface waters with harmful substances.
 
monticello is a proud community, and its schools, museums, parks,
  historical landmarks, are a major contributing factor in that feeling of
  pride.  monticello schools have always been staffed with well-trained, highly
  qualified people and as a result, monticello students have consistently
  scored far above average and in the top 5% on both state and national
  achievement tests.  
 
monticello, already containing a lot of magnificent older homes
  and numerous beautiful newer homes, has room to add many more.  when visiting monticello,
  be sure to visit millionaires row (north state street), south charter
  street, and piatt street.
 
every town has similarities and unique characteristics, but few
  under 5500 population can compare to monticello for its abundance of
  preserved historical and architecturally significant homes, buildings, and
  landmarks.  
 
in 1976, 24 sites, including 18 homes were
  identified by the historical preservation board and designated with bronze
  plaques including the spot where abraham lincoln first met and talked to
  stephen douglas, which led to the famous series of debates in 1858.  abraham lincoln stayed in monticello while
  practicing law in the piatt county courthouse.  ever hear the phrase lincoln slept here ?  well, the
  building immediately north of the eades greenhouse
  and nursery is the hotel that abraham lincoln frequently stayed in when he
  was in monticello and as such is listed on the national register of historic
  places.
 
in spite of the fact that monticello is located on interstate
  i-72, less than 30 minutes from a large shopping mall in champaign and
  another in decatur, the business climate remains consistently healthy as the
  residents choose to support their local merchants, both out of convenience
  and loyalty, as well as the knowledgably personalized service they are
  accustomed.  
 
monticello is home to over 50 retail businesses and over 100
  non-retail businesses and the community is also home to many professional
  people, including doctors, chiropractors, dentists, optometrists, and
  attorneys with local practices. 
  perhaps the least publicized monticello advantage is its fine
  selection of restaurants.  few small
  towns can claim cuisines so varied, with 18 dining locations.  
 
parades, holiday celebrations, and homecoming are all part of the
  yearly activities in most small towns and monticello has all of these and an
  especially fine 4th of july free fireworks display and celebration, which
  grows bigger every year, and attracts large crowds including the area
  television news.
 
piatt county ranks 4th of illinois' 102 counties by percentage of
  residents who are high school graduates and of the population over 25 years
  of age, over 21% are college graduates with 4-year degrees and 11% have
  graduate degrees.  
 
the median home
  value is $100,700, and the per capita income of $45,754 ranks 11th of
  illinois' 102 counties.  more than 74%
  of monticello residents own their own homes (18% above the national average),
  average rent in monticello is $480, average household net worth is $204,174,
  and the average farmer in piatt county owns a
  604-acre farm worth $972,596.
 
illinois
  has no capital gains tax and the illinois state income tax is fraction of
  that in most other states.  if fact,
  there are only 7 states in the usa that have a lower state income tax.  most state tax rates are as much as 3 times
  that of the illinois flat tax (3% of federal adjusted gross income with
  modification), which naturally does not penalize upper income brackets.  
 
better
  still, with local tax rates in other cities being in excess of 12%; both the
  county of piatt and the city of monticello have no local sales tax surcharge
  and no county or city income tax!  zero
   zip  nata  never had it  never will.
 
monticello
  has one of the finest school
  systems (1 teacher for every 16 students), lowest crime rates (almost
  nonexistent), and lowest property taxes in the state*.  click here to view a shocking
  property tax-rate comparison chart. 
  
 
*thanks to illinois power
  company and verizon communications (formerly general telephone company) having located their
  official home offices in monticello years ago to take advantage of the low
  taxes, further resulting in an unusually large distribution of the corporate
  replacement tax, and ultimately resulting in far lower property taxes in
  monticello.  all if which acts to lower
  the overall cost of living and doing business in monticello as compared to
  other communities in the state.
 
monticello is the
  piatt county seat and enjoys the solid work force that is available in the
  area with a stable population base. 
  population within piatt county is 16,623.  there is a population base of 250,000
  within a 50-mile radius.  two of the
  world's largest agribusiness processing companies, as well as a renowned
  research, technological and educational center, are within a 30-mile
  radius.  
 
approximately 90%
  of the area is cropland, 3% pasture, 1% woodland, and 5% other
  (municipalities, waterways, highways). 
  
 
the transportation
  network of piatt county includes interstate highways, u.s. highways, state
  highways, and a network of well-maintained local roads.  
 
monticello
  is the ideal central illinois draw location near i-57 & i-74 on i-72, 20
  miles from & midway between champaign-urbana (home of the university of illinois) and decatur il. 
  monticello enjoys two exits off interstate i-72 and one off i-57.  this county seat community is only 1 hour
  from the state capital and 2 hours from chicago, st. louis, & indianapolis.  
 
strategic
  location for work and play, easy access to
  highways, rail and air travel, an abundant and skilled work force, and a
  vibrant local economy (to spite the current condition of our the national
  economy).  these are just a few of the reasons why so many businesses
  call monticello home.
 
for
  more information about monticello and piatt county, please visit: the
  illinois dept. of commerce & community affairs (dcca) analysis.  the dcca
  also has a variety of assistance and financial information for new business
  start-ups and those existing businesses needing to upgrade or expand.  click here for a brief
  description of some of the federal, state and local assistance programs and
  tools available to new or expanding businesses within the city of monticello.
 
the city of
  monticello is pro-business and has on staff a full-time economic development director and is also designated
  as a "main street community" thanks to the
  planning and proactive approach of our city administration and staff, planning
  commission, zoning board (owner sits on the
  monticello zoning board), and various other business, religious
  and civic groups including a very active chamber of commerce and tourism
  bureau which work closely with the city of
  monticello administration to create a favorable business climate, retain
  existing jobs, create new jobs, and bring new business and industry to the
  area.
 
monticello has several strong
  organizations that are always actively pursuing the various grants, which in
  turn pay for projects like the multi million-dollar streetscape project
  which is currently wrapping up.  click here to view line item # 172, which
  shows the $1,104,443 bid for the state of illinois half of
  the streetscape project.
 
since the city of monticello has the
  foresight to maintain a current comprehensive plan, which is already in place
  as well as other prerequisites, surveys and studies, we are able to take
  advantage of the state and federal sponsored programs and grants that many
  other communities do not qualify.  several times monticello has been one
  of fewer than 12 communities that qualified for grants in the entire
  state.  
 
illinois is currently undergoing the
  largest capital improvement programs in decades.  the good economy in the late 90s and
  legislative initiatives have fueled and created programs such as build
  illinois and illinois first programs, both dedicated to building,
  expanding, rehabilitating, and repairing illinois infrastructure, schools,
  universities, hospitals, businesses, and state-owned facilities.  there is a local matching portion of the
  program of school construction.
 
the illinois
  first program
  (illinois fund for infrastructure, roads, schools, and
  transit) is a five-year, $12 billion funding package (of
  which piatt county gets at least $5,483,342) is the largest state public
  works program ever funded in illinois. 
  projects include highways, bridges, school classrooms, mass transit,
  water and sewer lines, economic development projects, park and playground
  development, biking and hiking trails, fire equipment, police equipment and
  community centers for senior and youth programs.
