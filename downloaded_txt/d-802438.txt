sunseeker doors - innovative door design




slide & turn doors



our unrivalled innovative range of affordable slide and turn glass doors are british designed & engineered. they are made to measure, delivered and installed direct to you. more versatile than bi-folding doors, our practical and stunning contemporary glass doors suit most specifications and, with a choice of ultra slim aluminium frames or frameless glass, all our ‘slide and swing’ doors are manufactured installed with minimum fuss by our experienced teams. the original slide & pivot door systems have been designed & manufactured by sunseeker doors since 2009. click for quote!
slide & pivot, slide & turn or slide & swing describe the way that you open the doors. you unlock the master (pivot) door and open with a swing motion (it can open inwards or outwards). once you’ve done that, the next door can slide towards the master door then you can open it in the same way, and so on. the way the doors slide and turn to stack at right-angles to the opening is why the doors are also referred to as slide & stack. they can also remain anywhere along the opening and are therefore spaceable doors. see our video demos.
