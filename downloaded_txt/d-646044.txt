promoting puritan reformation in family, church and state
the goal of the puritans’ network and its various projects is christian conquest such that the nations of the earth bow the knee to the lord jesus christ. every man and institution of man should glorify god and enjoy him forever, according to the biblical christian principles outlined in the original westminster standards, the doctrinal confession of historic puritanism.
our method to effect this goal is to proclaim the truths of god’s word, and rely upon the holy spirit to change men’s hearts to follow it. this is in contrast to the methods employed by false religionists, who often use the sword and deceitful machinations. because the truth lies on our side and our god is sovereign, we can wait upon him to bless our efforts in his due time. we do not even have to worry about numbers on our side, for “there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few” (i samuel 14:6). that which is contrary to god and biblical principles is a house of cards that god will in his own time blow down.
regarding various specific issues, please see questions and answers page.  please direct inquiries to puritansinfo@gmail.com .
