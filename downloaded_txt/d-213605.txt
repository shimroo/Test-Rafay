the perfect retaining wall system
versa-lok retaining wall systems are cost-effective, easy-to-install, and give you endless design options.
versa-lok segmental retaining walls are made from high-strength concrete units, dry-stacked, interlocked with pins, and set on granular leveling pads. these mortarless walls do not need frost footings. and when stabilized with geogrid soil reinforcement, versa-lok walls can be built 50 feet tall and even higher. from intricate landscaping features to tall, commercial walls, versa-lok delivers your best value in segmental retaining wall solutions.

versa-lok’s unique hole-to-slot pinning system provides your walls with an automatic setback, improving stability and making installation a snap. durable, solid versa-lok units have no voids to fill and can be modified easily on-site to create a variety of special landscaping features.
