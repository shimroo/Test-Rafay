        “for while gentle silence enveloped all things, and night in its swift course was now half gone, your all-powerful word leaped from heaven, from the royal throne.” (wis. 18, 14-15)














 









 

seeking the face of god.the discalced carmelite nuns of flemington follow the ideal of life established by st. teresa of avila to support the church by their contemplative lives of prayer. their loving fidelity to the magisterium is lived out in the cloister where prayer, solitude and the common life in a marian spirit nourish an apostolic zeal.
