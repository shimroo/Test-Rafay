after over 50 years of purchasing, selling and collecting antique clocks, karen and i have decided to retire from the clock business.it is not due to health issues or anything like that. it is simply time for us to slow down and to do other things.   we will leave this website up for a while just as a way of letting people know about this change and to provide a way for people to stay in touch. we have been so wonderfully fortunate to have had all these years of enjoying life in pursuit of these clock treasures. the thrill of discovering some beautiful or unusual clock never got old especially when we could share that discovery with someone else who understands. in this clock collecting journey we have been blessed to have made many life-long friends throughout the country and beyond. that has truly been the very best part of the past 50 years. we will still attend a few clock shows and look forward to seeing many of you again. please stay in touch as we miss you. lindy and karenthe following are links to only the sold clocks pages:
