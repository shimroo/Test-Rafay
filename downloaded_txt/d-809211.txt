donations

the lute society’s finances are reasonably secure with the present membership fees and it is breaking even in a safe and steady manner. but we would like to be able to fund occasional additional activities without having to raise the general membership fees to a level which would put off some from joining. if you feel able to help in this way, it will be greatly appreciated.
there will be an opportunity for uk tax payers to gift aid their donation after they click the donate button.
