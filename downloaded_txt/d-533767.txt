about
hallett is a 1.8 mile, 10 turn road racing course located 35 miles west of tulsa, ok. with over 80 feet of elevation change, hallett is considered technically challenging and can be run clockwise or counter-clockwise ­ making it two completely different race courses.  hmrc hosts cars, motorcycles, karters, and drifters….plus many private/corporate events.  with new pavement in jan 2025, the racing community is itching to get back on the new smooth surface of this legendary race track! click here for more info
