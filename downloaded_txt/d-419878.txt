► ira individual retirement 
      accounts  

 


approximately 50 million 
        americans own individual retirement accounts (ira) worth an estimated $3 
        trillion. types of iras include: 


traditional ira & roth ira

401(k) rollover ira

coverdell education ira, 
        medical ira, 
          health savings account (hsa)

sep (simplified employee 
          pensions) & simple (savings incentive match plan for employees) ira


about half of all iras are 
        administered by and invested in various mutual funds. one-third are 
        held in brokerage accounts, while bank deposits and life insurance 
        annuities account for the remainder. due to the long term nature 
        of this type of investment, each year large numbers of owners and heirs 
        - who may not be aware of a deceased family member's ira or roll-over 
        401k - fail to claim accounts to which they're entitled. 



        while unclaimed 401(k) 
        retirement plan assets come under the purview of federal guidelines mandated by erisa (employee retirement income security act of 1974); missing and 
        forgotten iras at banks, brokerages and insurance companies do not. 



        the rules for determining how a dormant or 
        unclaimed ira is treated depends on  the type of ira and the state of 
        residence of the owner.

        401(k) plans 
   



the u.s. department of labor 
        estimates each year tens of thousands of workers fail to claim or 
        rollover $850 million in 401k retirement plan assets when they change 
        jobs. 

a disproportionate share of 
        the missing are family members of deceased employees who fail to claim 
        pension benefits stemming from employment that may have ended years 
        earlier.  


another  common 
        problem: former employees of bankrupt companies are unable to locate their 
        401(k) accounts, because many insolvent businesses fail to provide for 
        the administration of 401k plan assets when they cease operations. 

participants in 
        defined-contribution retirement plans such as the 401(k) are protected 
        when their employers fail or otherwise cease operations, because they 
        individually own the assets in their accounts.

        pensions

pension plan administrators are often unable to locate lost employees or missing
        beneficiaries who have moved or changed name over the
        years, and companies owing unclaimed pension benefits may
        have moved, change name or merged, making them difficult
        to find. 

because many 
        defined-benefit private 
        pension plans are federally insured - even if a company dissolved or went 
        bankrupt - it may be possible to receive unclaimed benefits.  

the pension 
        benefit guaranty corporation (pbgc) guarantees payment of basic pension 
        benefits earned by workers and retirees in over 35,000 private sector 
        defined benefit pension plans, with over $300 million available for 
        claim.

        tsp and government pensions    

records on two million former 
  civil service workers are not automated, but rather stored in some 35,000 file 
  cabinets by alphabetical order. this system does not permit sorting by age, a 
  likely indicator of unclaimed and unpaid benefits. because many government 
  employee records at the office of personnel management (opm) retirement 
  operations center are not computerized, it's difficult to determine when a 
  federal retirement benefit has gone unclaimed and unpaid.

federal retirement benefits 
  include thrift savings plan (tsp) distributions, a defined-contribution plan 
  similar to a 401(k) created by the federal employees' retirement system act of 
  1986 to supplement fers benefits. 
as of 2012, tsp accounts for 4.5 
  million participants - including federal civilian employees in all branches of 
  government, u.s. postal service employees and members of the uniformed 
  services - totaled $313 billion. 

unclaimed government retirement 
        funds are not declared abandoned unless unclaimed by the employee's 
        115th birthday or 30 years after death; but virtually no effort is made 
        to find lost employees owed government pension benefits.

        veteran pension benefits   



  va helps veterans and their families cope with financial challenges by 
  providing supplemental income through the veterans pension and survivors 
  pension benefit programs. va offers two broad categories of pension benefit 
  programs: veterans pension: tax-free monetary benefit payable to low-income 
  wartime veterans. survivors pension: tax-free monetary benefit payable to a 
  low-income, un-remarried surviving spouse and/or unmarried child(ren) of a 
  deceased veteran with wartime service. 

veterans and survivors who are eligible for pension 
  benefits and are housebound or require the aid and attendance of another 
  person may be eligible to receive additional monetary amounts.

        railroad retirement benefits   


the railroad retirement act replaces social 
  security for railroad employees, providing payment of retirement, disability 
  and survivor benefits. monthly benefits are payable to surviving widows, 
  children, and certain other dependents at the time of death of a covered 
  railroad employee. the railroad unemployment insurance act also provides 
  unemployment and sickness benefits for railroad employees, replacing 
  unemployment insurance. 

the railroad retirement trust fund is valued at 
        approximately $18 billion. currently 818,000 railroad retirees and heirs 
        are eligible for benefits, but five percent of addresses on file are not 
        current, because workers or family members have not made the proper 
        notification.
