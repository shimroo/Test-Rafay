how can we increase the biological complexity of biomaterials?



              researchers at the new jersey center for biomaterials report on merging the versatility of 3d printing innovative "bioinks" with the biological complexity of decellularized extracellular matrix to build hybrid scaffolds.  this approach offers a pathway to future tissue-engineered regenerative implants and organs.

new publication: nanospheres with a smectic hydrophobic core and an amorphous peg hydrophilic shell: structural changes and implications for drug delivery



              nanospheres are often regarded as little homogenous balls with a readily recognizable size. this study shows that some nanospheres have a layered structure such that the size depends on the layers that are included in the measurement, and provides a detailed view of the complex internal organization that changes with concentration and ph.
