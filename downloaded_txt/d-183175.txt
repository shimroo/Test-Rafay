welcome tost. norbert arts centre

 

the st. norbert arts centre (snac) is a diverse community dedicated to the cultural, environmental, and spiritual preservation of its home—the historical trappist monastery site located in st. norbert, a thriving community in the south of winnipeg, manitoba. we offer a setting for a multitude of diverse activities that range from art and music events to special occasion events staged for indoors or outdoors. we also house a community of artists and small businesses within a variety of available studio rentals.
