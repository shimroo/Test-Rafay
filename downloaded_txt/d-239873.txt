explore yoga of mystics®








































































our aim is to help others realize and spread the knowledge of unity, so that the bias of faiths and beliefs may of itself fall away, the human heart may overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences may be rooted out for the sake of harmony.
our ideal is to educate the heart, mind and body of humanity, one at a time, in the universal ideal of oneness with god.
