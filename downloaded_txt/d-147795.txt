hotel aiglon,
an art deco hotel in paris







art deco is an artistic and architectural movement born in the 1910s in france and belgium, that developed into a major style and influence in western countries in the 1920s, before declining in the 1930s.
the predecessor of art deco was art nouveau, also known in france as the "noodle style", a pejorative name given by its detractors because of its arabesque and curved shapes.
before the first world war, the art nouveau evolved into a more sober and geometric style. art deco was born !








 
it showcases the harmony of symmetry and is characterized by trapezoidal, zigzagged, and triangular shapes, stepped forms, sweeping curves…and by the refusal of right angles for the facades of buildings with more rounded or even cut angles. for example, the “bow-windows”, like those of the hotel aiglon, break the flat monotony of the facades by creating relief.
ornamentation with mosaics and ceramics is also one of the main characteristics of art deco architecture, as well as the use of chevron or sunburst patterns, and spiral or floral motifs! whether expressed through flowers (roses or sunflowers), trees, lianas or even fruit baskets, they are carved into freestones or ironworks.

visit the montparnasse district of paris







stroll through the montparnasse district and you’ll be walking in the footsteps of the artists of the belle epoque and the roaring twenties.
discover the spirit of paris montparnasse from your base at the hotel aiglon
from the studios of the artists who lived there to the many theatres and cinemas it hosts, the montparnasse district is one of the most artistically vibrant in paris.








follow the trail blazed by the roaring twenties with our paris montparnasse hotel
following the end of the first world war, the french people rediscovered their interest in popular culture and pleasure. the world of entertainment took on a whole new bold and effervescent dimension with the coming of the roaring twenties, an era that brought a period of renewal. imported from the united states came jazz, the charleston and the shimmy, bringing fresh excitement to the french cabarets. pleasure and exuberance became the watchwords! this phenomenon from the united states was also being exported to england and germany. at that time, montmartre and montparnasse were the busiest, liveliest and most famous districts of paris.
montparnos and artists’ studios
montparnasse was the nucleus of a cultural and artistic renaissance in paris. many creative people from all over the world were drawn to the amazing ambiance and inspiration of this part of the city. loving the feel of the place, many artists set up their studios here. among the best known, from about 1904, were pablo picasso, amedeo modigliani and guillaume apollinaire, each of whom settled in montparnasse. later, from 1928 or thereabouts, ossip zadkine, salvador dali and antoine bourdelle came to paris and took up residence in montparnasse. these artists were called the ‘montparnos’. their studios have now been turned into museums close to our paris montparnasse hotel and await your visit. you’ll find many of them along the rue campagne-première, the street of artists.
the gaîté and montparnasse theatres
located in the west of montparnasse, the hotel aiglon stands amidst a wide selection of theatres. perhaps the most notable is the théâtre de la gaîté montparnasse, which dates from 1868! it was initially a café-concert, a kind of music establishment popular during the belle époque, and what was then called the concert de la gaîté montparnasse had a very lively atmosphere, by all accounts.
however, by the 1930s, the café-concert fashion had run its course and so had the théâtre de la gaîté montparnasse. a change of owners did not help, and debts accumulated. threatened with demolition for several years, the theatre was saved by supporters in the performance industry and underwent renovations to regain its yesteryear cachet.
other performance venues are within easy reach of our paris montparnasse hotel, including the théâtre bobino. when it was created in 1873, the bobino was first a café-concert and then became a music hall after the first world war. a cultural import from the uk, music halls replaced concert halls during the roaring twenties. in 1930, bobino became the chief venue on the left bank dedicated to the art of chanson. 
the cinemas of montparnasse
the studio raspail, located on the boulevard du montparnasse, is the meeting place for literary people. it regularly hosts the société littéraire (literary society), which presents theatrical discoveries and literary evenings.
created in 1932 by the architect bruno elkouken, the studio raspail is also known as ‘raspail 216’. housed in a fine art deco building, it has artists’ studios and private apartments. it was a public cinema until 1982. nowadays, it is rented by cultural or artistic associations.
in 1913, when it was created, the cinéma gaumont-parnasse was called the cinéma du palais montparnasse and had a large screening room with 900 seats. over the years, the cinema underwent various renovations and changed its name to the pathé-montparnasse.
however, dwindling audiences that could not fill the huge screening room led to the cinema closing its doors in 1972. two years later, however, the cavernous space was divided into five smaller ones, moviegoers came flocking back and the montparnasse-pathé was born. its new layout helped the montparnasse-pathé to become the most popular movie theatre in montparnasse.
but in 1994, work began on the creation of a multiplex bringing together 3 cinemas: the montparnasse-pathé, gaumont-parnasse and paramount-montparnasse. this multiplex, now called the gaumont-parnasse, is one of the most frequented cinema establishments in paris.
the montparnasse district is also full of newer cinemas, both independent and those belonging to chains.
for a delightful example of the former, head to the place denfert-rochereau, where you’ll find the cinema chaplin denfert, a charming neighbourhood movie house that screens films in their original versions with subtitles.
ugc has also established 2 cinemas not far from our paris montparnasse hotel: the ugc montparnasse and ugc rotonde.
historic brasseries (select, couple, dôme, etc.)
ideally located in the heart of the montparnasse district, the hotel aiglon is a few minutes’ walk from the famous parisian brasseries of the area. le dôme, a seafood restaurant, was the district’s first café. just opposite is la rotonde, a typically parisian restaurant with its luxurious red velvet and exquisite woodwork.
in the same street, a few steps away, you’ll find le select, a famous brasserie in the 20's style. the haunt of montparnos artists, it was the first café in paris to remain open all night. located opposite the select is la coupole, an essential brasserie in the art deco style and the largest restaurant in paris.
finally, on the other side of our paris montparnasse hotel is la closerie des lilas, a gourmet restaurant and a literary landmark that was once the gathering place of great writers.
if you love to shop, don’t miss le bon marché
shopping fans take note; our hotel is located just 15 minutes by public transport from the rue de rennes. many chic and trendy boutiques have established themselves on this street, making it the most shopaholic-friendly on the left bank.
if luxury shops give you a thrill, don’t miss le bon marché and la grande épicerie de paris. located in the saint-germain-des-prés district, these shops are about 15 minutes via public transport from the hotel aiglon.
even closer to the hotel aiglon is the montparnasse rive gauche shopping centre. situated in front of the montparnasse tower, this large mall is just ten minutes by public transport from our paris montparnasse hotel.
