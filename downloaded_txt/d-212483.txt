  chris leggpersonal statement chris is interested in re - energising painting by expressing the concerns of the real world and aspects of human experience. the energy in his work stems from dynamic constrictions and the tensions between meanings.  the work is defined as process painting and investigates conceptual relationships related to abstract painting, whilst also using the processes of photo-mechanical reproduction, digital screen printing, collage and the use of paint. he considers his practice in post-historical terms, using a vast repertoire of painterly moves and samplings. .
