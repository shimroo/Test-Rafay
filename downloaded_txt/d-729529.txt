just wanted to let you know, i used olt for the first time this tax season and i couldn't be happier with the results. it's very thorough but yet easy to use.. needless to say, i will be using olt next year. thanks!
- charles w





i got my state refund back in 6 days, and federal back in 11 days. easy, honest and free! thanks olt, you are by far the best! i will be back next year and will recommend to my friends and family.
- paul d





just a short note of thanks for your excellent tax service! in the past i had always prepared my own tax reports, but decided to try your electronic route, which was very efficient & understandable. very much appreciated.
- william s









 i have always before felt the need to do the whole process with at least 3 different online tax websites before i was confident that they were done properly. this time was a completely different experience, i have no doubt that they were done right. your service is awesome and i will be back again next year!
- jessica b





appreciate ease of using system for both federal and state taxes. still somewhat new using on-line tax programs. your site was much easier than previous company's site. this was the fastest tax forms have been sent, approved and processed!
- christine s





i just wanted to say thank you for such a simple, yet comprehensive, product.  the little help links on the pages are great.  i did my taxes on two different sites to compare. my refund was higher on your site (the other completely left out a category) and your price was lower. it was an all-around win!
- edie t









this is a compliment concerning olt's website and service staff.   the changes to your website make it very user friendly and easy to navigate. i had to ask a question and was pleased with the service. the fee that olt charges for its premium service was very reasonable, and i will use olt again.
- richard s





i just wanted to send a quick note and thank you for your product and services. i can't tell you how long i've been filing my taxes with you, maybe 10 or more years. it's never an issue.  great prices for the services.  easy to follow. keep us the good work.
