what is osteoporosis?
osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, which can lead to increased risk of fracture. known as the “silent thief”, bone deterioration can occur over a number of years without presenting any symptoms.
unfortunately, if detected at the time of a break, the disease is already fairly advanced. the most common fractures associated with osteoporosis are in the hip, spine, wrist, and shoulder. today, no single cause for osteoporosis has been identified.
