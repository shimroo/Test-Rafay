hello bob,

the women men adore is superb and one of the most impressive things about it is the clarity, directness and simplicity with the concepts conveyed.  i couldn’t have asked for better.  i’ve had so many eproducts through the internet that have been so much superfluous verbiage, i’ve got sick of plugging through it all, sometimes so much so that the meaning becomes lost or obscured in the maze!  yours  are a joy. an excellent investment!

thank you again.

sincerely
diana

dear bob grant,

thank you for your program “the woman men adore…and never want to leave.”.i have tried one of your suggestions and they worked :), so i trust all the others and i’ m exited about their effects, so thank you very much indeed!

best wishes,
maria

dear bob,

i don’t know if you will get this email, but i wanted to express my gratitude about your techniques in “the woman men adore”. i was 20 years old, and i had never been with anyone. i wanted to learn, however, and so i purchased your program. what you revealed at the time sounded a bit simple. but i did wonder if you were right.

today, i’m with someone that loves me and cherishes me. we’ve had our ups and downs, but i have applied your techniques, and let me just say: they work. we actually had a conflict not so long ago over behavior that i felt was inappropriate. the few things i said were more effective than if i would’ve yelled and screamed and nagged.

he asked me, “what can i do so the next time i don’t hurt you the way i hurt you tonight?” he really wanted to make me feel better, he wanted to please me. it was exactly how you had described in your program. i have followed everything you’ve mentioned in the program to the letter. women who question your techniques without trying them are insane.

sincerely,
nathalie

i have started  ‘the woman  men adore and never want to leave’ program.

i am finding it  inspiring , allowing me insight into my own relationship issues and confidence to listen to my heart first. the graphic  description  about a man’s heart is amazing, it makes it so much easier for me to understand  a man’s responses.

thank you bob,
wendy

dear bob,

i purchased your program woman men adore over a month ago. the results really are outstanding. my partner has gone from my worst nightmare to the man of my dreams i never thought would actually be real beyond my wildest dreams!

we were separating almost hating each other,  three weeks ago he proposed to me, we will marry in august and we have never been happier. i myself am trained in psychotherapy and despite spending the last for years qualifying and taking relationship workshops none of it has such amazing effective fast results.

thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and wisdom. it’s quite some legacy to leave.

i have finished the women men adore program.  loved it.  i have had so much attention in the last three months then i have my entire life.  i have men hitting on me everywhere i go now and it’s almost over whelming.

the funniest part of it all…  i’m 41 and i have yet to date a man over 33 in the last 3 months since going through the program.  i never dated younger men and now i love it and i have more in common with them then men my age.  crazy… never thought i would!  i’m really loving my life for the first time in years even as a single mother of two great kids. i love it!

thanks!
