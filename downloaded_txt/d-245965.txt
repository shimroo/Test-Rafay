club activities (nets and other special events)



nparc sunday night net - 
al k2al is the regular net control on the
			w2li-vhf (2-meter) repeater (147.255, input +.600 mhz, tone 141.3)
			every sunday at 9 p.m. local time.
			we encourage and welcome members and non-members
			alike to join us on the net.  it is an informal, directed
			net.  we discuss topics related to our ham radio
			activities, club activities and other topics of general
			interest.
			note: tcra has been nice enough to link the
			w2li-uhf (70cm) repeater (449.975, input -5.000 mhz, tone 141.3)
			in for our net.



			nparc digital net - david kc2wuf is the regular net
			control for the nparc digital net currently held
			every monday when no in-person meeting is held at or slightly after 9 p.m.
			local time. digital mode and frequency are announced
			via the reflector sometime during the week leading
			up to the net. often the operating parameters are
			also announced during the club business section of
			the nparc sunday night net the night before. we
			encourage members who are equipped for operating
			digital modes to check in to the net. lately the
			mode of choice has been psk31 and the signal frequency has been 28.086.000 mhz.
			the net is a directed net and will be handled
			round-table format similar to the sunday night net
			as long as conditions permit. the net is a good
			forum for members who are new to digital modes as
			there is no pressure to "complete the qso" quickly.
			



			nparc cw net - dave k2yg is the regular net
			control for the nparc cw net currently held
			every thursday at 9 p.m. local time.

			followed by 28.050.000 mhz.

					the january 23, 2023 meeting featured a talk from 2 of our members on "the basics of operating pota".
					the talk featured kevin n2to (69/69 activations at 10 different parks) and brian w2emc (3/3 activations at 2 parks - twice in ny for the ny qso party).
				




2022



						this is a reminder that november's in-person hybrid meeting is the annual business meeting where officer elections will be held. plsn on attending either in person or via zoom so that we can make our quorum.
					



						this is a reminder that in-person hybrid meetings resume on the second monday of each month at
						the salt brook school.
						



						arrl field day was a success by all accounts.
						the stations were manned most of the time thanks to kevin n2to for getting station schedules arranged.
						vhf was a little disappointing after the previous 2 weekends saw opennings to eu and as that were the best in at least a decade.
						food was the usual success. plenty of able bodied members showed up to help make quick work of setup and teardown.
						looking forward to implementing lessons learned and having another great field day next year.
						



						for the month of july while co-net control dave k2yg is away, we may be operating on 80m as well as 10m for both the digital and cw nets.
						please check the reflector and the website for notices.
						the cw net will probably start on 10m and move to 80m half way through to allow those without 80m antennas to continue to participate. they did this for the july 7th edition.
						the digital net will run on 10m for the time being until the ncs station has 80m capability.
						



						this is a reminder that all meetings during the summer will be on zoom as the salt brook school is closed during this time.
						



						please note the in-person meeting titled "portable generator care and maintenance" scheduled for may 23, 2022 has been cancelled due to family circumstances with the presenter.
						we will have a zoom meeting instead and the information will be sent via the reflector.
						



						the march 28th zoom meeting featuring a talk by k3lr tim duffy was well received. he went over the dx engineering product lines for people have limited space or no external antennas allowed.
						a special thanks goes out to tim for accomodating us while he was in europe helping to get radio equipment to support the efforts to evacuate ukranians during these tough times.
						



						the february 28th zoom meeting featuring a talk by vu2rbi d. bharathi was well received by the slightly larger than normal zoom audience. look to the reflector to find links and other info.
						special thanks to heather speas kd2vza for arranging this with sam kc2osr.
						



						the february 28, 2022 post-zoom digital net was cancelled due to the lateness of the program during the zoom meeting featuring d. bharathi.
						



						the february 26th auction went well by all accounts. look for photos to be posted in the near future.
						



						the talk on satellites by james kb2fcv went well on our january 24, 2022 zoom meeting. everyone had a good time and enjoyed the talk.
						look to the reflector for a copy of the powerpoint and also for a link to the zoom recording which will be available for a short time only.
						



						the january 10, 2022 business meeting originally scheduled to be hybrid will be zoom only due to the rise in covid cases.
						please look for zoom information in the meeting change notice on the reflector.
						this also means that there will be a digital net following the meeting.
						



						starting in january 2022, we plan on having hybrid meetings on the second monday evening of each month and
						continue with the zoom meetings on the fourth monday of each month.
						the in-person part of the monthly hybrid meeting will be held in the cafeteria at the salt brook school
						in new providence where we held our most recent auction.
						we will need to find a different location for the july and august hybrid meetings as the school is closed for the summer.

						we will continue have a digital net every monday night except for the hybrid meeting nights at approximately 9pm.
						generally psk31 on 28.085 mhz + 1000 hz. (july digital nets are generally moved to 3.585 mhz + 1000 hz)

						this is a 2 part full year event to celebrate the centennial of the arrl.
						the first part is working w1aw portable operation in each of the 50 states and most us territories.
						during 2014, w1aw will be operating in each state during 2 different weeks
						as well as many of the us territories.
						the second part is centennial points challenge where you accumulate points by contacting arrl member stations.
						point values are awarded based on the position(s) held by the station/operator.
						the w1aw portable operations also counts for the points as well.
						all scoring and awards from this event will use the honor system with logs submitted to lotw.
						since this is more of an event than a contest, warc bands are acceptable for qsos.
						more information is available on the arrl web site
						here.
						the schedule for state portable operations is available
						here.


the december 22, 2014 meeting featured a talk given by barry k2jv on a
						visit some club members took a few years ago (i believe 2010) to the battleship new jersey bb62 and
						the amateur radio station nj2bb on board. this was in preparation for a trip some members were planning
						on taking the following saturday. due to unforeseen circumstances, the trip was not completed as
						planned.


as 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of nparc, we have discussed a number of
						possible events to help celebrate. as was recently posted via the reflector, the first event announced
						will be the operation on hf bands (160m - 10m) of the primary club call, n2xj, by club members during
						the 2015 calendar year. each member will be able to sign up for individual weeks (thu 0000 utc - wed
						2359 utc) throughout the 2015 calendar year. more information was available in the reflector posting
						and will be posted on this website shortly. if you are interested and capable of operating, please sign
						up for one or more operating slots with our activities manager, paul wolfmeyer, w2ptp. paul had
						the list available at the holiday luncheon and will again have it at the next club meeting, december 8,
						2014. after that, please email or call paul to schedule a future operating week. it is hoped that
						we can work both dxcc and was (via lotw) as a club during the 2015 calendar year. we plan on having all
						log entries submitted to lotw (and hopefully eqsl).
						paper qsls should also be available with details to follow. for those of you new to the hobby or who are
						unsure about operating, please seek out elmer help from another more experienced or better equipped
						club member.

the "hands-on antenna modeling using eznec workshop" parts i, ii and iii
						were held during 3 consecutive club meetings (september 22, october 13 and 27).
						part i included a basic overview of eznec by david k2mun along with a 40-meter dipole
						and then he added some drooping ends.
						part ii was run by barry k2jv with david k2mun walking around the room to help.
						barry began by reviewing the basic operation of eznec and then taking the "back yard" dipole model
						that comes with eznec and modifying it to show what various changes can do to the results.
						he also showed the swr graph of his approximation of his 300 foot loop that he
						had when he lived in massachusetts which he proposed to model at the following meeting.
						part iii was barry k2jv running through setting up a 4x70-foot sided horizontal square-loop
						which he hinted at the previous meeting.
						many questions were posed during the 3 weeks and many members came away with positive
						comments on the capabilities of eznec for modeling simple antennas.

						finally, both david k2mun and barry k2jv have been
						gracious enough to provide some information about
						their talks:
						    part i - david's october president's column.
						(.pdf
						and .doc formats) are available.
						    part ii - barry's outline
						(.pdf
						and .docx formats)
						and presentation
						(.pdf
						and .ppt formats) are available.
						    part iii - barry's presentation
						(.pdf
						and .ppt formats) are available.


barry k2jv finished up the "hands-on antenna modeling using eznec workshop"
						by reviewing an approximation of his 300 foot loop that he had when he lived in massachusetts at the
						october 27, 2014 meeting. our next meeting will be held on november 10, 2014 at the
						the decorso community center of new providence.


barry k2jv joined david's "hands-on antenna modeling using eznec workshop"
						demonstrating a simple dipole and refreshing us on the various settings.
						barry has graciously volunteered to continue this subject in a part iii
						at the next meeting and plans on modeling his 300 foot loop that he had when he lived in
						massachusetts.
						the next meeting is october 27, 2014 at the
						the decorso community center of new providence.
						since it will be hands-on once again, hope to see you all there with your laptops. 

						finally, it would be nice if at least a few of you could bring your own "real-world" antenna
						descriptions to be modeled.
						basic element (wire, rod, etc) dimensions (lengths, etc.) and conditions
						(height above ground, etc.) is all you really need to provide.


david k2mun began his sessions guiding us through
						a "hands-on antenna modeling workshop using eznec".
						many members brought their laptops and followed along.
						david would love to get some feedback and is willing to try to
						address some particular issues (if he can).
						please send your feedback and/or questions to k2mun at arrl dot net.
						please try and bring your same laptop(s) with you so that you can follow along some through
						the more advanced analysis.
						the second session of this will take place on monday, october 13, 2014 at
						the new regular meeting location of
						the decorso community center of new providence.
						hope to see you all there with laptop in hand again.
during our next 2 club meetings (september 22nd and october 13th), david
						k2mun will be guiding us through a "hands-on antenna modelling workshop using eznec".
						please try and bring a windows capable laptop with you so that you can get the freeware version of eznec
						and try out some of your own antenna models.
						both of these sessions will be held at the new regular meeting location of
						the decorso community center of new providence.
						hope to see you all there with laptop in hand.
