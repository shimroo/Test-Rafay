we are grateful to our panelists marylyn ritchie, phd, vice dean of artificial intelligence and computing, penn medicine, david fajgenbaum, md, mba, msc, associate professor of medicine, penn medicine and cofounder of every cure and walter witschey, phd, associate professor of radiology, penn medicine, for sharing their insights on the impact of ai in healthcare, personal examples of how ai is being used and studied their fields and what’s next for ai in medicine. thank you to roy rosin, mba, board partner, first round capital, for serving as moderator for the panel and asking such insightful questions.
