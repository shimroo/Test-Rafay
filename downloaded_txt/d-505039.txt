travel with curious minds
    
commonwealth club travel was founded on the tradition of cultural and intellectual exploration that has made the club the nation's leading non-partisan public affairs forum. our trips take that forum around the globe by providing educational journeys, meetings with thought leaders, and discussions with people in other countries and from other cultures. the premier quality of our programs, combined with the opportunity to make connections with other interesting club members in the bay area and across the country, set our trips apart.
