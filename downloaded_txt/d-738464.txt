do you have confidence in conventional medicine? the american medical system is the number one killer in the united states.  the deaths caused by conventional medicine, in just one decade, equate to approximately eight million.  that’s more than all the casualties from all the wars america has fought in its entire history.in 2006, health care spending reached 2 trillion dollars.  for that money, we should have the best medicine in the world – preventing and reversing disease, and knowing how to do minimal harm.   instead we are getting buried prematurely.add to the errors of medicine, deceptive marketing has led to consumer consumption of highly processed foods.  sugar in soft drinks is the number one source of calories in the u.s. which now causes one in three americans to have diabetes, or pre-diabetes, and two in three americans to be overweight.  toxic medicine will never reverse poor health that is due to poor food choices.the truth is sloppy handwriting [by doctors] is the cause of 7,000 patient deaths each year, while preventable medication mistakes hurt 1.5 million patients.every year 7.5 million unnecessary medical and surgical procedures are performed.at least 106,000 people die every year from adverse drug reactions.  a mere 6% of all adverse drug reactions are properly identified.  most side effects are instead mistaken for new disease symptoms, leading to further drugging and unnecessary medical procedures, increasing the risk of death even further.most of these deaths are from expected adverse reactions, because they are an extension of the drug reaction.the mortality rate for people between the ages of 45 and 64, who took their prescription drugs correctly, rose 90% in just five yearsas of 2001, pfizer was the number one most profitable company of all fortune 500 companies.  their profit that year was 7.8 billion dollars, which is more than the profits of all fortune 500 companies in the home building, apparel, railroad and publishing industries combined.modern medicine is no longer about health.  it is a for-profit disease industry that can only survive if millions of people get sick, and stay that way… it’s an industry that refuses to consider vitally important aspects of health, like how stress lowers the immune system… how processed foods, alcohol, excessive calories in insufficient exercise are recipes for disease…how exposure to tens of thousands of toxins in our environment and in our food supply, have direct links to the illnesses you suffer.you are told to stay out of the sun yet more than 50,000 people die each year because they do not get enough sun exposure.why are we being kept in the dark?  why is the truth not being sought?    follow the money!more than half of the united states has received unnecessary medical treatment.  that’s about 50,000 people each day.42% have been directly affected by a medical mistake, from a procedure or a drug, and 84% of our population personally know someone who has been a victim of a medical error.these medical errors and deaths equate to six jumbo jets falling out of the sky every day.  the only difference is the media coverage – there’s no public displays of grief for those who die of faulty medicine.the error rate of intensive care units is like the post office losing 16,000 pieces of mail every hour of every day or banks deducting 32,000 checks from the wrong account each and every hour – every day, year in and year out.you do not have to become a statistic.  this information is presented in memory of the millions of people who placed their trust in a corrupted medical system that took their lives for profit.

breast cancer breakthrough: watercress turns off signal that causes tumor to develop(naturalnews) as a cancerous tumor develops, it quickly outgrows its existing blood supply. so a protein called hypoxia inducible factor (hif) is released that sends out signals causing surrounding normal tissues to grow new blood vessels into the tumor -- and that provides the cancer with oxygen and nutrients. this plays a critical role in the development and spread of breast and other cancers. but now comes word from university of southampton researchers in the united kingdom that they've discovered something which interferes with and actually "turns off" the ability of hif to function -- a natural plant compound dubbed  phenylethyl isothiocyanate (peitc) found in the herb watercress.to read this article in its entirety at naturalnews.com

the marvels of melatoninby dr. russell blaylockmelatonin — which most people think of as a sleep supplement — is a hormone secreted from your pineal gland. it is critical for sleep, but it is also a powerful antioxidant that can help the body fight many diseases including cancer. studies have shown that melatonin increases the levels of several antioxidant enzymes in the brain and possibly other parts of the body. recent studies have shown that fluoride, monosodium glutamate (msg), and aspartate (as in aspartame) shut off the production of melatonin. since fluoride is common in public water systems and diets are filled with msg and aspartame, this could explain the proliferation of insomnia in this country. (to read more about the dangers of fluoride, read my special report "why fluoride is toxic.") and we know that chronic insomnia leads to stress, which boosts the risk of cancer and other diseases. melatonin is connected with: • sleep. melatonin is known to help promote restful sleep. to use as a sleep aid, start at 1 mg 30 minutes before bedtime and increase as necessary. it will induce dreaming. do not use it during the day, or you will become sleepy. (for additional tips on how to get a good night’s sleep, see my report "good sleep: stop insomnia, reduce stress, boost your total health.") • glaucoma. all antioxidants help protect the retina from glaucoma. a new study found that melatonin not only reduced free radicals in the retina, but also dramatically reduced the glutamate level in the retina (that is, the excitotoxin level) and did so at concentrations usually taken for sleep — 1 to 3 mg.• brain health. melatonin actually increases the amount of antioxidant enzymes in the brain which protect it against damage by free radicals seen in all degenerative brain diseases. recent studies have shown that these protective enzymes are low in people who develop alzheimer’s dementia and parkinson’s disease. find more details on how you can protect your brain from dementia and alzheimer’s by reading my report "save your brain."• puberty. melatonin regulates the onset of puberty in both boys and girls, and young girls who live in cities with fluoride in the water (remember, fluoride lowers the production of melatonin) have been known to begin menstruating five months sooner than their counterparts in nonfluoridated towns. the amount of melatonin begins to decline with aging, and is one of the reasons for the high frequency of insomnia in the elderly. if you notice you no longer dream, your melatonin levels are probably low. is your body producing enough melatonin? the comprehensive melatonin profile measures your melatonin level. in most cases, there is little reason to worry about low melatonin levels until the age of 45. yet, there are exceptions. certain drugs (beta-blockers, ibuprofen, steroids, sleep aids, and prozac), caffeine, alcohol, and fluoride can lower melatonin secretion. with the widespread fluoridation of water, use of fluoridated medications (such as prozac), and increasing fluoride in foods, melatonin deficiencies are becoming more common and occurring earlier in life. low levels have even been measured in infants and are associated with poorer brain function.

latest report on flu fatalities: a shocking fabrication





we have been telling you recently about phony data from the government. here is another egregious example—and no one in the major media seems to know or care.for years, the centers for disease control (cdc) has been citing an annual estimate of 36,000 deaths from flu. that figure has been used to justify mandatory flu vaccination for children and has been parroted the world over by news organizations that never question its validity. last week the cdc released new figures: rather than 36,000, the three-decade average is actually 23,607 deaths, a full one-third fewer people than previously cited.latest report on flu fatalities: a shocking fabrication

nutrition and mental healthpeople with mood problems may find benefit in becoming aware of their food and drink intake, and making step-by-step changes based on their findings. research that specifically looks at nutrition and mood is still in its infancy, though the available studies do suggest strong causal links.introduction to food and moodmood disorders such as depression are often complex, varying from individual to individual. diet choices will depend on a number of factors such as tastes, lifestyle, medications and state of health. for example, people prescribed lithium are advised to keep caffeine to a minimum, as it is known to increase lithium levels in the blood.mental health charity mind points out that the psychological relationship between people and food is significant. for example, when people have tea or coffee, they may also socialize with friends, which may result in positive feelings. such interactions are important to account for when considering how mood and food are connected.to read this article in its entirety continue here

prescription pill-popping by far a leading killer as florida’s drug deaths spike 20%july 1, 2010 oxycodone, the addictive prescription pain-killer also known by its purdue pharma brand name oxycontin, directly caused more deaths in florida in 2009 than cocaine, heroin and morphine combined. prescription drugs as a whole are killing far more floridians than illegal drugs, with some 8,600 deaths last year involving at least one prescription drug, according to an annual report released today by the florida medical examiners commission. that’s 5 percent of all deaths in florida in 2009, when 171,300 people died in the state. the number of people killed by prescription drugs is a significant 20 percent increase over last year’s 6,200 deaths attributed to overdoses. much of the increase is due to a spike in oxycodone addiction. the increase in prescription-drug addiction continues a trend that began in florida 10 years ago, when prescription drugs overtook illegal drugs as leading causes of drug-related deaths. alcohol is also included in the examiners’ analysis, and it leads the way of all drug-related deaths, with 4,046. the annual report is a stark look at the effects of legalized drug addiction and over-prescription of drugs, both of which affect a far larger segment of the population than recreational or illegal narcotics. for the first time in 2009, the commission tracked deaths by region. in flagler county’s district, which includes st. johns and putnam counties, 22 deaths were attributed to oxycodone (the fourth lowest number in the state’s 23 districts), with 13 of those deaths directly attributed to the drug, and nine cited as being present among other drugs that contributed to death. hydrocodone claimed 16 lives in the district. cocaine contributed to 19 deaths in the flagler district, though only four cases were directly attributed to the drug. in 15 cases, cocaine was present in the body in conjunction with other drugs that proved lethal. overall in florida, cocaine-related deaths (including the majority of cases where cocaine wasn’t directly the factor but was present in the body at the time of death), have fallen from a peak of 2,179 in 2007 to 1,462 in 2009. (again, cocaine was the direct result of death in 529 cases out of those). ken kramer, a researcher with the citizens commission on human rights of florida, says the numbers underestimate the extent of the problem, because medical examiners do not track deaths attributed to antipsychotic drugs or to antidepressants, both of which carry black-box or black-label warnings. the warnings on antidepressants, required by the food and drug administration, state that the drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents and young adults up to age 24. (antidepressants include paxil, prozac, zoloft, effexor, lexapro and celexa.)anti-psychotic drugs carry a variety of black label warnings of increased mortality in elderly patients (including a death rate almost twice as high for people taking risperdal, for example). those drugs, prescribed and often overprescribed in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, include abilify, clozaril, geodon, risperdal, seroquel and zyprexa.“certainly, the actual number of prescription drug deaths is higher than the annual report states,” kramer said. “it is unknown just how much higher because the medical examiners commission does not track these classes of drugs.”two years ago kramer got his concern heard by the commission following an email exchange with a commissioner in which he argued that antidepressants and anti-psychotic drugs’ contributions to mortality should be part of the annual report. he was rebuffed. one examiner said he had not seen “more than the occasional death caused by these types of drugs,” according to the minutes of the aug. 13, 2008 meeting of the commission.  prescription drugs tracked in the report account for 79 percent of all drug occurrences in deaths when alcohol is excluded. deaths directly attributed to oxycodone increased by 25.9 percent over 2008. cocaine occurrences decreased by 18.4 percent over 2004. 5,275 individuals, or 7.1 percent more than in 2008, died with one or more prescription drugs in their system. the drugs in those cases were identified as both the cause of death and present in the deceased person. overall, 171,300 deaths occurred in florida in 2009. the report specifies that the “state’s medical examiners were asked to distinguish between the drugs being the ’cause’ of death or merely ‘present’ in the body at the time of death. a drug is only indicated as the cause of death when, after examining all evidence and the autopsy and toxicology results, the medical examiner determines the drug played a causal role in the death.”

latest news on legislation involving regulations on natural supplementsby: jenny thompson - hsiin the david vs. goliath world of the vitamin and herbal supplement industry vs. big pharma, the medical mainstream and the fda, you can put away your slingshot--for now. but don't put it too far out of reach, because you'll need it again...sooner than you may think. yes, it's hunting season...on supplements, that is. we'll start in congress. it seems like every couple of years light bulbs blink on and some congressmen get the brilliant idea that the supplement industry should be more severely regulated. of course, on the surface that might sound reasonable. why not make sure something that millions of americans are putting in their bodies every day is as safe as possible? the problem: that isn't how regulation works. first of all, the fda can't manage and adequately enforce supplement regulations already in place. how in the world will they cope with excessive new layers of bureaucracy? that's exactly how regulators bog down the whole system. they pile on layers of needless red tape at unmanageable expense and, at the end of the day, the results for the consumer are rarely any better. and make no mistake...if the ideas currently pending actually come to life, supplement companies will be forced to shut their doors or raise their prices so high that it would put them out of reach for most of us. so while some of the proposals seem harmless on the surface, i promise you they are anything but. your right to buy the supplements of your choice at a reasonable price is under attack by a congress that sees an easy target and an administration looking to cross things off its "to do" list. ----------------------------------------------------------- mccain failin' ----------------------------------------------------------- a bill, titled the dietary supplement safety act of 2010, was recently introduced by senators john mccain and byron dorgan. mccain is the big gun here, obviously, so the bill is widely referred to as "the mccain bill." yet, in a surprise move, senator mccain withdrew his support of the bill late last week. (i don't remember that in the schoolhouse rock song.) a new "compromise" bill is reportedly in the works. as originally submitted, the bill would have been disastrous. in fact, a statement on the website for the alliance for natural health usa spells out the chilling details: "under current law, the fda cannot arbitrarily ban a supplement that was sold prior to october 15, 1994, the date that the dietary supplement health and education act (dshea) was passed. mccain's bill wipes out that protection." in addition, the bill would have authorized the fda to keep a list of legal supplements. "the fda would have arbitrary power to choose permitted supplements and (importantly) supplement doses." that means that the fda could have decided vitamin c could be sold in doses only of 60 mg or that coq10 couldn't be sold at all. so, of course, supplement takers, makers and marketers alike are rejoicing in what they are declaring a victory. but it's not quite time to pop the champagne and laugh in goliath's face just yet. one thing we know about senator mccain is that he doesn't walk away from a fight. we'll soon see another version of his bill, and the changes may or may not be to the average supplement user's advantage. in any case, congress isn't the only looming threat... ----------------------------------------------------------- all noisy on the western front ----------------------------------------------------------- over at the ftc, someone appears to be cooking up such strict new requirements for supplement product claims that many supplement makers would simply be driven out of business. according to todd harrison--a washington, d.c., attorney and columnist for nutraceuticals world--the ftc plans a new regulation that would require two human trials on the actual products to provide scientific support of supplement products. (right now, most supplement companies rely on scientific studies about individual ingredients or combinations when developing formulations.) again, on the surface that might sound like a good idea. but clinical trials like that are extremely expensive-- like, drug company expensive. in other words, it would effectively prevent most new supplements from entering the market or put the natural medicine industry squarely in the hands of the big pharma companies that could afford to comply. around the country, there are foxes guarding henhouses who are saying, "wow...that's a really bad idea!" in addition, the ftc would be able to use third-party studies to refute a supplement maker's claims, but the supplement maker would not be allowed to use third-party studies to support the claims. here's the real kicker: if the supplement company did two human trials and their research proved a substantial benefit but the prevailing body of evidence doesn't support their research, they still can't use their study results. so they will have invested years and hundreds of thousands of dollars and proven the value of their products and then the ftc can still disallow their results. we still don't know the true scope of this threat. the ftc is not quite as predictable or transparent as congress. but if we do get an opportunity to comment on this before the agency makes a final ruling, i'll make sure you're the first to hear about it so we can let ftc officials know they're way off track on this one.

the truth about tamiflu - the atlantic (december 10, 2009)two months ago, we pointed out in our story on flu in the atlantic that the antiviral drug tamiflu might not be as effective or safe as many patients, doctors, and governments think. the drug has been widely prescribed since the first cases of h1n1 flu surfaced last spring, and the u.s. government has spent more than $1.5 billion stockpiling it since 2005 as part of the nation’s pandemic preparedness plan.now it looks as if our concerns were correct, and the nation may have put more thana billion dollars into the medical equivalent of a mirage. this week, the british medical journal bmj published a multi-part investigation that confirms that the scientific evidence just isn't there to show that tamiflu prevents serious complications, hospitalization, or death in people that have the flu. the bmj goes further to suggest that roche, the swiss company that manufactures and markets tamiflu, may have misled governments and physicians. in its defense, roche stated that the company “has never concealed (or had the intention to conceal) any pertinent data.to read the article in its entirety continue here.

vaccines and pregnancy do not mix(naturalnews) from an internet forum: "i got both vaccines [seasonal and swine flu] on thursday. i was 9 weeks pregnant. i miscarried on sunday. i was told by several doctors to get these vaccines. now i wish i followed my gut feeling and not get them at all!" this is not an isolated case.here's another report: "i feel like i had a healthy baby and i caused this by getting the h1n1 vaccine. my doctors pushed it. i researched online and there have been many miscarriages after the h1n1 vaccine but they haven't been reported since it is hard to say what caused the miscarriages."she researched online, the only source reporting vaccination tragedies throughout the world.lies under the light of truthfirst of all, the swine flu is less harmful than a normal seasonal flu. research with ferrets, real statistics released by independent researchers, as well as reports from uncorrupted medical authorities have confirmed this. the cdc and mainstream media bury that information. instead, they circulate alarming false swine flu statistics.but one mainstream media outlet, cbs washington unplugged, did inadvertently reveal true swine flu statistics. they had tried to get information from the cdc about swine flu episodes actually confirmed. the cdc skirted the issue and stonewalled them.so they surveyed all 50 usa state medical laboratories themselves. the results were that most states had confirmed five percent or less of reported cases as swine flu. most labs reported half or more cases were not any kind of flu! so much for hysteria.dr. michael bronze of the university of oklahoma health sciences center, stated on webmd that the actual risk of pregnant women getting hospitalized for swine flu infections is one in 300 thousand.the australian/new zealand's flu season was surveyed by american epidemiological statisticians. the data from around the middle of that flu season indicated that pregnant women are 99.97 percent sure of avoiding hospital care for any flu.of those few admitted and held in icu 7.7 percent died. not a high figure. and even those few had other health complications prior to being infected with the swine flu.vaccinations are the real danger.according to dr. russel blaylock, retired neurosurgeon and author of excitotoxins: the taste that kills, various studies have proven that artificially stimulating the immune system causes a cytokine immune reaction that damages the forming brain of a fetus.throw in thimerosal mercury additives as well as formaldehyde and other toxic materials delivered in the vaccines. these circulate through the fetus if a pregnant woman is vaccinated. the child can become prone to seizures, autism, schizophrenia, and a host of other neurological problems.there is the case of desiree jennings, the young washington redskins cheerleader who was diagnosed with dystonia by doctors at john hopkins and fairfax inova. they determined her dystonia, which caused chronic severe spasms and partial paralysis, was a reaction to her seasonal flu shot.right, she wasn't pregnant. she was also active and healthy. but her story links the miscarriage stories to dr. blaylock's conclusion, "the bottom line is vaccinating a pregnant women is vary hazardous to the mother's health as well as the baby."as for miscarriages, there has been a history of sterilization agents planted surreptitiously in vaccines intended for women in developing countries. some vaccines were examined and recovered before further damage could be done.

7 reasons schools should notmandate vaccines by neil z. miller1. parents should not be obligated to play russian roulette with their children.vaccines pose serious risks. these hazards are acknowledged by vaccine manufacturers in their product inserts, documented in numerous studies, substantiated by the federal government's vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), and confirmed anecdotally by parents. for example, the mmr vaccine manufacturer concedes that diabetes, thrombocytopenia (a serious blood disorder), arthritis, encephalitis (brain inflammation), guillain-barre syndrome (paralysis), and death, have all been reported during clinical trials of its vaccine. peer-reviewed studies link the haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine to epidemics of type 1 diabetes, the hepatitis b vaccine to autoimmune and neurological disorders, and the flu vaccine to paralytic ailments. these are just a few examples. medical and scientific journals contain hundreds of other peer-reviewed studies linking vaccines to debilitating ailments. in addition, every year approximately 14,000 people file vaccine adverse reaction reports with the cdc. in just the past 26 months -- as of august 2008 -- more than 8,500 young american females filed adverse reaction reports after receiving the new hpv vaccine. nearly 600 of these cases were labeled "serious," requiring hospitalization, resulting in life-threatening disabilities, or death. vaers is a passive reporting system, so the number of people believed to be hurt by vaccines is vastly underreported. according to dr. david kessler, former head of the fda, "only about 1 percent of serious events -- adverse drug reactions -- are reported." this is confirmed by the thinktwice global vaccine institute, which receives unsolicited personal stories of vaccine damage every day. the families telling these dreadful stories rarely file official reports. of course, these stories do not constitute "proof" of vaccine damage -- at least no more than a child's cry after skinning his knee is "proof" of pain. however, patterns of adverse vaccine reactions are easily observed when unrelated families consistently report similar stories of healthy children prior to their shots, and hospitalized children after their shots. these patterns tell a larger story. a medical industry that errs on the side of denial rather than concern is backward and criminally negligent. in an enlightened healthcare community, we would listen to the larger story with sincerity, and opt to protect additional children from harm. pretending that serious reactions to vaccines are rare does not make it true, incapacitates our children, and degrades our society. since reputed vaccine risk-to-benefit ratios are bogus, and pharmaceutical shots are considerably more unsafe than officially acknowledged, it is morally unconscionable to mandate vaccines for entry into an educational institution.2. unvaccinated children cannot threaten vaccinated children if the shots are effective. when students contract disease, vaccine proponents are quick to blame the outbreaks on unvaccinated children. yet, the official data tells a different story: a majority of cases occur in fully vaccinated populations. dr. william atkinson, senior epidemiologist with the cdc, admitted that "measles transmission has been clearly documented among vaccinated persons. in some large outbreaks...over 95% of cases have a history of vaccination." similar problems with vaccine efficacy plague other vaccines as well. for example, in a 2003 outbreak of pertussis, 4 of every 5 people who contracted the disease were vaccinated against it. in 2006, there was a large outbreak of mumps in the united states; 92% of the cases were in people who were vaccinated against mumps. such data provides evidence that herd immunity -- the idea that when a proportion of people within a targeted population are immune to a disease, transmission rates are reduced -- may not apply to vaccinated populations. vaccination and immunity are not synonymous.authorities claim that vaccines won't work for society unless a very high number of people in the targeted population -- school children -- take them. apparently, unvaccinated children are a threat to the group. but this does not make sense. by this reasoning, the unvaccinated -- who are being coerced into taking the shots -- are somehow responsible for protecting the vaccinated. how ironic! if some students are vaccinated, that's their family's choice. if other students are unvaccinated, that's their family's informed decision as well. vaccinated students take their chances hoping to avoid serious adverse reactions, while unvaccinated students risk contracting the disease. however, if vaccinated students contract the disease, the shot was ineffective, not the fault of unvaccinated students. officials ignore their own ineffective vaccine, choosing instead to smear the unvaccinated. outrage should be vented in the proper direction -- at those who developed ineffective shots and falsely promoted a defective product.3. some vaccines required for school entry are clearly unnecessary. our children have become captive instruments of the vaccine industry, accessible by mandate to satisfy other purposes. for example, children rarely develop hepatitis b. in the united states, less than 1% of all reported hepatitis b cases occur in persons less than 15 years of age. when the hepatitis b vaccine was initially introduced, 87% of pediatricians did not believe it was needed by their patients. doctors knew that children rarely develop this disease. according to the hepatitis b vaccine manufacturer, children are targeted "because a vaccination strategy limited to high-risk individuals has failed." in other words, because high-risk groups -- sexually promiscuous adults and iv drug users -- are difficult to reach or have rejected this vaccine, authorities are targeting children. authorities believe that by vaccinating children (a low-risk herd) they will protect unvaccinated adults (a high-risk herd). since children are unlikely to contract hepatitis b, and studies show that vaccine efficacy declines after a few years, children are being subjected to all of the risks of the hepatitis b vaccine without the expected benefit.the chickenpox vaccine is another drug that should not have been mandated for all children. it was available since the 1970s but authorities were reluctant to license and promote it because the disease is rarely dangerous and confers lifelong immunity. the vaccine, however, contains a weakened form of the virus; once injected, it remains in the body indefinitely. authorities were concerned that it could reawaken years after the vaccination and cause serious problems. in addition, the chickenpox vaccine was originally developed for children with leukemia or compromised immune systems, a small population at greater risk for complications from the disease. but vaccine manufacturers quickly sought a wider market for their potentially lucrative product. a study conducted by the cdc in 1985 determined that the vaccine was not necessary. however, in 1995 it was promoted as "cost-effective" -- rather than essential -- because moms and dads would not have to miss work and stay home (an average of 1 day) to care for their sick children. it was licensed shortly thereafter. before the chickenpox vaccine was licensed, doctors would encourage parents to expose their children to the disease while they were young. doctors recommended this course of action because they knew that chickenpox is relatively harmless when contracted prior to the teenage years (but more dangerous in adolescents and adults). however, after the vaccine was licensed, the cdc began warning parents about the dangers of chickenpox. doctors stopped encouraging parents to expose their children to this disease. instead, they were told to have their children vaccinated against chickenpox.these examples confirm that some vaccines required for school entry are not essential. school officials have become henchmen for the vaccine industry. low-risk children are being force-vaccinated to protect high-risk adults or to increase the vaccine manufacturer's profits. blackmailing families by threatening to withhold a child's education for refusing needless vaccines is a moral outrage.4. conflicts of interest permeate the vaccine industry. vaccine recommendations and other important healthcare decisions that affect our nation's children are frequently based on ulterior motives. safety and protection are not always top priorities. instead, authorities may be influenced by monetary considerations or the urge to manipulate undesirable study results. for example, in june of 2000, two separate yet highly significant events rocked the vaccine industry:event #1: congress held a hearing to determine if "the entire process [of licensing and recommending vaccines] has been polluted and the public trust has been violated." two years earlier, vaccine authorities had evidence that a new vaccine under consideration (for diarrhea!) was dangerous, yet that didn't stop them from licensing and recommending it for every child in the usa. this vaccine was linked to numerous cases of a life-threatening intestinal blockage and baby deaths. after this vaccine was withdrawn from the market, congress discovered that 60% of the fda advisory committee members who voted to license this defective vaccine, and 50% of the cdc advisory committee members who voted to recommend it for every child in the country, had financial ties to the drug company that produced the vaccine or to two other companies developing their own potentially lucrative competing vaccines. for example, an fda committee member who voted to license the defective vaccine had received more than $250,000 per year in research funds from the drug company that made the vaccine. a cdc committee member who voted to recommend the defective vaccine for every child was paid by the industry to travel around the country teaching doctors that vaccines are safe. in addition, he held a potentially lucrative patent on a similar vaccine under development! despite this important congressional expose', no one at the fda, cdc, or u.s. department of health and human services admitted a problem, and claimed that it's perfectly acceptable for committee members with obvious conflicts of interest to make healthcare recommendations for every child in this country -- even when they stand to benefit financially from their own decisions!event #2: just one week prior to the congressional investigation into conflicts of interest within the vaccine industry, a top-secret meeting of high-level officials from the cdc, fda, world health organization (who), and representatives from every major vaccine manufacturer, was held at the secluded simpsonwood conference center in norcross, georgia. they had gathered to discuss an alarming new study that confirmed a link between thimerosal (mercury) in childhood vaccines and neurological damage, including recent dramatic increases in autistic spectrum disorders. according to the lead researcher, "we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposures and outcomes." since 1991, when the cdc and fda started requiring babies to receive multiple doses of thimerosal-laced hepatitis b, hib, and the already mandated diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis shots (via dpt and dtap), cases of autism skyrocketed. dr. robert chen, head of vaccine safety for the cdc, congratulated the group for their apparent success thus far at being able to keep the incriminating data out of "less responsible hands." dr. john clements, who vaccine advisor, was more blunt, declaring that perhaps the cdc study "should not have been done at all." instead of warning the public and recalling the dangerous vaccines, this small group of federal health officials and vaccine industry executives spent the weekend calculating how to cover up the truth -- and followed through on their plot over the next few years. first, the cdc's vast database on childhood vaccines was removed from public access so that unbiased researchers could not confirm the study results. next, the incriminating data from the original study was reworked, and the new version was published in a peer-reviewed journal. however, this time "no consistent significant associations were found between thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes." finally, to complete the deception, the cdc would need additional "proof" that thimerosal-laced vaccines are safe. according to dr. gordon douglas, the director of strategic planning at the national institutes of health (and former president of vaccinations for merck, a major vaccine manufacturer), four new studies were currently taking place "to rule out the proposed link between autism and thimerosal."these two events -- the congressional hearing on conflicts of interest within the vaccine licensing and recommendation process, and the secret simpsonwood conference -- confirm that u.s. health authorities have lost their ethical bearings and have not made our children's safety a top priority. requiring vaccines for school entry when they may have been added to the childhood immunization schedule simply to line the pockets of powerful authorities is dangerous and corrupt. withholding a child's education for refusing vaccines when crucial studies purporting to prove their safety are bogus, is both reprehensible and indefensible. thus, every family must remain free to accept or reject vaccines.5. recovery from natural disease provides advantages over artificial immunity. measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox usually confer permanent immunity; the child will rarely contract these ailments again. in contrast, vaccines provide temporary immunity; protection is incomplete, requiring booster doses. vaccinated children are still susceptible to the disease. studies also indicate that childhood diseases can have a favorable effect on the child's immune system. when children overcome illnesses on their own, their immune systems are stimulated: they build resistance to other diseases in later life. for example, several studies show that women are less likely to develop ovarian cancer if they have had mumps in childhood.6. few people utilize exemptions. in 1991, the cdc concluded that outbreaks of disease can be avoided if 70% to 80% of children are vaccinated. a 1992 study published in the journal of the american medical association confirmed that vaccination rates of "80% or less" should be sufficient to protect against disease outbreaks. most parents obediently follow their doctor's orders and vaccinate their children. in addition, schools rarely publicize legal exemptions to "mandatory" vaccines. thus, only about 2% of families file waivers to recommended shots. this number could substantially increase without threatening herd immunity.7. australia doesn't mandate shots and is not overtaken by disease. in the united states, healthcare authorities, pediatricians, and school officials use coercive tactics to increase vaccination rates. parents are intimidated and their children threatened with removal from school if vaccines are not "up to date." other countries recommend fewer vaccines and do not require them for school entry. for example, in australia medical intervention is not compulsory, free will is honored, yet epidemics do not occur. in fact, disease case and fatality rates are lower in many countries than in the united states. many americans would be shocked to learn that the u.s. has the greatest number of mandatory vaccines yet the 42nd worst infant mortality rate in the world. outbreaks of common ailments are manageable without requiring vaccines for school entry.copyright © 2008.  all rights reserved.

">how safe is the swine flu nasal spray vaccine?(originally published on facebook) october 28, 2009several people have asked me about medimmune's swine flu nasal spray vaccine. of the four swine flu vaccines that have been licensed for use in the united states, the vaccine that is sprayed up the nose is the only one that is mercury-free. (the injectable swine flu vaccines contain 25mcg of mercury per dose when administered from a multi-dose vial. this is more than 80 times the mercury content found in vaccines containing "trace amounts of mercury.") yet, the nasal spray, mercury-free vaccine may be more risky.all four of the u.s. licensed swine flu vaccines were made by mimicking earlier seasonal flu vaccines (and by adding the new swine flu virus). however, the manufacturers admit in their product inserts that these new swine flu vaccines were not tested for safety or efficacy. the fda allowed them to be rushed to market assuming that they will be similar in safety and efficacy to previous flu vaccines. thus, medimmune's swine flu nasal spray vaccine should be similar in safety and efficacy to its seasonal flu nasal spray vaccine, flumist.the following information on flumist was excerpted from my recently updated vaccine safety manual, 2010 copyright. all of the data is properly referenced in the book. excerpt from the vaccine safety manual, 2nd edition: the american drug maker medimmune recently submitted a confidential briefing document to the fda containing safety data from studies that it conducted on its own vaccine. medimmune was seeking permission to vaccinate children under 5 years of age with its live-virus nasal spray flumist vaccine (the one that is squirted up the nose). when this vaccine was originally licensed in 2003, the fda only permitted it to be given to children 5 years of age and older because a large study conducted in 31 clinics showed that it caused "a statistically significant increase in asthma or reactive airways disease" in children under 5 years of age. in addition to this confidential briefing document, the fda also had access to data from studies that were not conducted by the manufacturer. according to the fda, flumist can cause "medically significant wheezing" and pneumonia. in fact, 3 percent of all children 6 months to 1 year of age who received the vaccine ended up in the hospital with respiratory problems! (with the inactivated flu shot, 1 of every 100 vaccinated children in this age group had to be rushed to the hospital.) in addition, of all children between 6 months and 1 year of age who developed "protocol-defined wheezing" after their flumist vaccinations, 9 percent required hospitalization. this figure was 7 percent for children between 1 and 2 years of age. the median duration of hospitalization in children 6 months to 2 years of age was nearly 5 days with most requiring bronchodilators and steroids. many of these children had multiple wheezing episodes. nevertheless, in september 2007, the fda licensed this vaccine for children as young as two years of age.for additional information regarding flu vaccine safety and efficacy, read the entire chapter on influenza in the vaccine safety manual or visit the thinktwice global vaccine institute.

ten swine flu lies told by msm(naturalnews) the mainstream media is engaged in what we americans call “bald faced lies” about swine flu. it seems to be true with this issue more than any other, and it became apparent to me recently when a colleague of mine — a nationally-syndicated newspaper columnist — told me their column on natural defenses for swine flu was rejected by newspapers all across the country. many newspapers refused to run the column and, instead, ran an ad for “free vaccine clinics” in the same space.the media, it seems, is so deeply in bed with the culture of vaccinations that they will do almost anything to keep the public misinformed. and that includes lying about swine flu vaccines.there are ten key lies that continue to be told by the mainstream media (msm) about swine flu and swine flu vaccines.lie #1 - there are no adjuvants used in the vaccinesi was recently being interviewed by a major u.s. news network when the reporter interviewing me came up with this humdinger: there are no adjuvants being used in the swine flu vaccines, he said!i assured him that adjuvants were, indeed, a crucial part of the vaccine recipe, and they were being widely used by drug companies to “stretch” the vaccine supply. it’s no secret. but he insisted he had been directly told by a drug company rep that no adjuvants were being used at all. and he believed them! so everything being published by this large news network about swine flu vaccines now assumes there are no adjuvants in the vaccines at all.lie #2 - the swine flu is more dangerous than seasonal fluthis lie is finally starting to unravel. i admit that in the early days of this pandemic, even i was concerned this could be a global killer. but after observing the very mild impact the virus was having on people in the real world, it became obvious that this was a mild flu, no more dangerous than a seasonal flu. the msm, however, continues to promote h1n1 swine flu as being super dangerous, driving fear into the minds of people and encouraging them to rush out and get a vaccine shot for a flu that’s really no more likely to kill them than the regular winter sniffles. sure, the virus could still mutate into something far worse, but if it does that, the current vaccine could be rendered obsolete anyway!lie #3 - vaccines protect you from swine fluthis is the biggest lie of all, and the media pushes it hard. getting a vaccine, they insist, will protect you from the swine flu. but it’s just flat-out false. even if the vaccine produces antibodies, that’s not the same thing as real-world immunity from a live virus, especially if the virus mutates (as they often do).   as i pointed out in a recent article, statistically speaking the average american is 40 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to have their life saved by a swine flu vaccine. (http://www.naturalnews.com/026955_s…)lie #4 - vaccines are safeand how would any journalists actually know this? none of the vaccines have been subjected to real-world testing for any meaningful duration. the “safety” of these vaccines is nothing more than wishful thinking.     the msm also doesn’t want you to know what’s in the vaccines. some vaccines are made from viral fragments grown in diseased african monkeys. if that sounds incredible, read the true story here: http://www.naturalnews.com/026779_s…lie #5 - the vaccine isn’t mandatoryyou hear this lie all the time: the swine flu vaccine shot is voluntary, they say. but it’s not true if you’re an employee at a place where vaccines are being mandated. millions of americans are now being told by their employers that if they don’t get vaccine shots, they will be effectively fired from their jobs. it’s especially true with health care workers, day care employees and school teachers.lie #6 - getting a vaccine shot is a good bet on your healthin reality, a vaccine shot is far more likely to harm you than help you. according to one viral expert, the actual mortality rate of the swine flu virus is estimated to be as low as .007 percent (http://www.reuters.com/article/heal…). that means h1n1 swine flu kills less than one person in 100,000. even if the vaccine works, let’s say, 10 percent of the time, you’d have to vaccine one million people to prevent one death from swine flu.  and in vaccinating one million people, you would inevitably harm or kill several people, simply from the vaccine side effects! your net risk of death is increased by getting a swine flu vaccine.lie #7 - the vaccine isn’t made with “attenuated live virus”when the swine flu vaccines were first being announced several months ago, they were described as being made with “attenuated live virus.” this was directly mentioned in cdc documents, among other places.  this term apparently freaked out the american news consumer, and it has since been all but erased from any discussion about vaccines. now, journalists will actually argue with you and insist the vaccines contain no attenuated live viruses whatsoever.   except they’re wrong. the vaccines are, indeed, made with “attenuated live viruses.” that’s how you make a vaccine: you take live viruses, then you weaken them (”attenuate”) and inject them into people.lie #8 - wash, wash, wash your hands (to avoid exposure)this idea of washing your hands a hundred times a day is all based on the assumption that you can avoid exposure to the swine flu virus. but that’s impractical. the virus is now so widespread that virtually everyone is certain to be exposed to it through the air if not other means. this whole idea of avoiding exposure to the swine flu virus is nonsense. the conversation should shift to ways to survive exposure via a healthy immune system.   of course, hand washing is a very good idea in a hospital setting. recent news reveals that doctors are too busy to wash their own hands, resulting in the rampant spread of superbugs throughout most large hospitals in first world nations.lie #9 - children are more vulnerable to swine flu than adultsthis is just a flat-out lie, but it makes for good vaccine sales. vaccines are right now being targeted primarily to schoolchildren.   but the truth is that swine flu is extremely mild in children. “it’s mildest in kids,” says dr marc lipsitch of harvard university. “that’s one of the really good pieces of news in this pandemic.” reuters actually had the guts to report this story, but most of the larger media outlets are still reporting that children are the most vulnerable.lie #10 - there is nothing else you can do beyond a vaccine and tamifluthis is where the media lies by omission. the mainstream media absolutely refuses to print just about any story that talks about using vitamin d, anti-viral herbs or natural remedies to protect yourself from swine flu. in the msm, there are two options and only two: vaccines and tamiflu.that’s it. no other options exist in their fictional reality.why is the mainstream media so afraid to print the truth these days? why can’t reporting on swine flu see the light of day… literally, with a mention of sunlight and vitamin d? apparently, big pharma has such a tight grip on mainstream newspapers that no true story on swine flu can ever make it past the editor’s desk.killing stories, deceiving the publicit must really be depressing to work for the mainstream media. even the reporters i know can’t stand it. the truth, they admit, rarely makes it into print.over the last few years, i’ve had a couple of job offers from large media outlets. they want to pay me a six-figure salary and stick me behind a desk where they can control what i report. needless to say, i routinely reject those offers. if i can’t write the truth like i do here on naturalnews.com, there’s no point writing at all. in too many ways, the mainstream media has become little more than a corporate mouthpiece, whoring itself out to the highest bidder / advertiser.it’s no fault of the frontline reporters who actually work there. for the most part, they agree with what i’m saying. it’s the fault of the profit-oriented corporate mindset where news is about selling newspapers rather than actually informing the public.important news stories get killed every day in the newsrooms across america. they get killed not because they are poorly investigated or poorly written, but because they upset advertisers and corporate string pullers who shape the news and reject any stories that threaten their own financial interests.here in 2009, the distorted reporting on the swine flu vaccine has been one of the greatest media frauds ever perpetrated. the media has in every way contributed to the widespread ignorance of the american people on the subject of vitamin d and natural immune-boosting defenses that could reduce swine flu fatalities. rather than informing readers, the msm has made it a point to keep the people stupid, and in doing so, the media has failed its only mission and betrayed the very audience is claims to serve.www.naturalnews.com/027055_swine_flu_vaccines_swine_flu_vaccine.html

what to do if force vaccinatedrussell blaylock, md8-16-9dr blaylock's list of suggestions on how to reduce the toxic effects of the a/h1n1 vaccine, is as follows: 1. number one on the list says dr blaylock, is to bring a cold pack with you and place it on the site of the injection as soon as you can, as this will block the immune reaction. once you get home, continue using a cold pack throughout the day. if you continue to have immune reactions the following day, have cold showers and continue with the cold press. 2. take fish oil. eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), one of the omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements, is a potent immune suppressant. if you take high dose epa you will be more susceptible to infections, because it is a powerful immune suppressant. however, in the case of an immune adjuvant reaction, you want to reduce it. studies show that if you take epa oil one hour before injecting a very powerful adjuvant called lipopolysaccharide (lps), it would completely block the ability of the lps to cause brain inflammation. take a moderate dose everyday and more if needed to tame a cytokine storm. 3. flavonoids are third on the list, namely curcumin, quercetin, ferulic acid and ellagic acid, particularly in a mixture. the curcumin and quercetin in particular have been found to block the ability of the adjuvants to trigger a long-term immune reaction. if you take it an hour before the vaccination, it should help dampen the immune reactions says dr blaylock. 4. vitamin e, the natural form that is high in gamma-e will help dampen the immune reactions and reduces several of the inflammatory cytokines. 5. an important ingredient on the list is vitamin c at a dose of 1000 mg, taken four times a day between meals. it is a very potent anti-inflammatory and should be taken in a buffered form, not as absorbic acid, says dr blaylock. 6.  also use astaxanthin as it's an anti-inflammatory. according to dr blaylock, fatal reactions to vaccines in aboriginal and african children occurred in those who were deficient in carotinoids, like astaxanthin. it is a good protection against the toxic effects of the vaccine. 7. likewise, it was found that children who were deficient in zinc had a high mortality rate. zinc is very protective against vaccine toxicity. (do not use zinc mixed with copper however, as copper is a major trigger of free-radical generation according to dr blaylock). 8. ensure you avoid all immune-stimulating supplements, such as mushroom extracts, whey protein and beta-glucan. 9. take a multivitamin-mineral daily ­ one that does not contain iron. this multivitamin-mineral is to make sure your body has plenty of b vitamins and selenium. selenium, said dr blaylock, is very important for fighting viral infections and it reduces the inflammatory response to vaccines. 10. magnesium citrate/malate 500 mg of elemental magnesium two capsules, three times a day. (this was not mentioned during the show, but was posted at dr deagle's website, clayandiron.com). 11. what is very important is vitamin d3, which is the only 'vitamin' the body can manufacture from sunlight (uvb). it is a neural hormone, not really a vitamin says dr blaylock and helps if you are over-reacting immunologically by cooling down the reaction. similarly, if you are under-reacting, it helps to boost your immune response. in addition it also protects against microorganism invasion. black people and those in colder climates are particularly deficient, so they will almost certainly require supplementation. dr blaylock recommends that following vaccination it will help to keep the immune reaction under control if: i) all children get 5,000 units a day for two weeks after the vaccine and then 2,000 a units a day thereafter; ii) adults get 20,000 units a day after the vaccine for two weeks, then 10,000 units a day thereafter; iii) and with that adults should take 500-1000 mg of calcium a day and children under the age of 12 years should take 250 mg a day, as vitamin d works more efficiently in the presence of calcium. 12. ensure you avoid all mercury-containing seafood or any other sources of mercury, as the heavy metal is a very powerful inducer of autoimmunity, is known to make people more susceptible to viral infections and will be in h1n1 vaccines. 13. avoid the oils that significantly suppress immunity and increase inflammation - such as corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, canola and peanut oils. 14. drink very concentrated white tea at least four times a day. it helps to prevent abnormal immune reactions. 15. pop parsley and celery in a blender and drink 8 ounces of this mixture twice a day. dr blaylock says the parsley is very high in a flavonoid called apigenin and that celery is high in luteolin. both are very potent in inhibiting autoimmune diseases, particularly the apigenin, so go and plant some parsley in your garden now.

mayo clinic dead wrong on diabetic recommendations by: dr. joseph mercolaresearchers from north carolina state university and the mayo clinic have developed a computer model that is intended to determine the best time to begin using statin therapy in diabetes patients to help prevent heart disease and stroke.according to the lead author, "the research is significant because patients with diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and statins are the single most commonly used treatment for patients at risk of heart disease and/or stroke."the new model incorporates patient-specific data. an established risk model calculates each patient's probability of heart attack and stroke based on risk factors, such as their cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. this overall risk "score" is used to weigh the medical advantages of beginning statin therapy against the financial cost of the statins.dr. mercola's comments:statins, which are a class of drugs used to lower your cholesterol, are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the world, and i believe, one of the most unnecessary drugs there are.this is one class of drugs that i am dedicated to sound the alarm about. we are actually in the process of seeking to replicate a campaign similar to what was done to raise awareness of the dangers of smoking, to inform the public about the dangers and combat the media fraud, deception and manipulation that causes people to believe otherwise.they could have saved loads of time and money here by reading this website, because the answer to the question, “when should you begin taking a statin?” is “never.” no computer models required.why?because it’s safe to say that a drug intended to prevent heart disease which actually causes heart failure is not the right treatment for most people. statin drugs offer a “cure” that is far worse than the disease.read entire article here.

fears rise over side effects of tamiflu as cases of adverse reactions double in a week august 3, 2009by daniel martinfears over the side effects of tamiflu grew last night as it was revealed that the number of suspected adverse reactions had doubled in one week.figures from the drugs safety watchdog, seen by the daily mail, show there have been 293 reports of side effects from the powerful antiviral since the beginning of april, when the swine flu outbreak began.this compares to the 150 reported the week before - a jump of 143 in only seven days. the cases include heart and eye problems, and psychiatric disorders.more than half of children who take tamiflu suffer from nausea, nightmares and other reactions, a study found.the figures come only a few days after a study showed that more than half of children who take tamiflu suffer from nausea, nightmares and other reactions.the massive rise coincides with the launch of the national pandemic flu service, which allows britons for the first time to get tamiflu over the phone or internet without the intervention of a gp.in the first three days of its operation - between 24 and 26 july - no fewer than 150,000 tamiflu packs were handed out.a growing number of doctors have raised concerns over whether the drug is being handed out too readily, putting many at needless risk of side effects when in the majority of instances, swine flu is a mild illness.[to read article in its entirety.]* * * * *author's note: one of my favorite sites to check adverse reporting on drugs is askapatient.com. if you are considering taking tamiflu, i highly recommend you check out www.askapatient.com to see what others are saying before you agree to taking a drug that is highly suspect and merely shortens the duration [disputably] of the flu.

just say no to the swine flu vaccinedr. eisenstein's comments:i have offered vaccine choice to over 20,000 families. this has led to my practice(www.homefirst.com) that has virtually no asthma, allergy, diabetes, or autism.the idea of giving any vaccine to pregnant women is overt malpractice and borders on criminal intent. flu vaccines have never worked in any age group. there is limited or no data on the safety and effectiveness of the swine flu vaccine especially with the new untested adjuvants(formulated compounds, which when combined with vaccine antigens intensify the body's immune response). let us not be like sheep being taken to be slaughtered.give the right to make medical decisions back to the patients and their doctors! the notion of mandating an unsubstantiated injection with no clear evidence of efficacy is outrageous.vaccine choice is what it is all about. an informed and aware public both physically and intellectually is what is best for us.to become better informed please go to medical voices vaccine information center. we need big pharma and big government to stay out of our lives.become active in the battle against swine flu vaccine. go to www.pandemicfluonline.com and get your community tool box.my recommendations:1. stay as far away from this swine flu vaccine experiment as possible. flu vaccines have never worked.2. maintain adequate levels of vitamin d and probiotics.3. death from flu usually comes from a secondary pneumonia not from the flu itself. you must stay away from all over the counter and prescription acid reducing pharmaceuticals tums®, rolaids®, zantac®, tagamet®, or the more dangerous, ppis [proton pump inhibitors] (nexium®, prevacid®, prilosec®, protonics®, etc..4. and of course have lots of chicken soup available.

basement logic on the swine flu/h1n1 virusby: paula rothsteinapparently, our "world government" has waited as long as it can possibly wait for an actual flu pandemic that is dangerous. how else can one explain the hysteria and hyperbole surrounding this rather mild flu which is making its way around the world, killing very few, generally mild, yet officials are stoking irrational fear in the public at every turn.i am not a germ expert but i certainly know enough on the subject of our immune system to surmise that catching the current strain would be far preferable to coming down with a more virulent strain in the future (a fear experts profess to holding). they have admitted that any vaccine based on this current strain would not protect you from a mutated strain. however, our brilliant immune system has the ability to learn each time it is exposed to a virus under normal circumstances and i imagine that would help in a situation of a second exposure. call me crazy but wouldn't a vaccine -- assuming it actually works -- keep me from getting the current strain but then leave me vulnerable to the more virulent strain?what is most disturbing is that this series of shots will be tested for safety on chidren and pregnant women. of course, we are to take comfort in the fact that they will be carefully monitoring adverse reactions. well that's a relief!! i for one will not be turning over my small children like a couple of guinea pigs for a government financed vaccine. governments and pharmaceutical companies do not inspire confidence. the people involved in this "crisis" (head of the world health organization and cdc) have resided over numerous vaccine disasters with rarely a peep to parents when safety concerns have unfolded with regards to a particular vaccine.most people do not understand that the immune system is weakened by vaccines -- having a new toxic load invade the body artificially is not an easy thing to handle. top the insanity off, their treatment plan (and one now approved for infants!) is to recommend tamiflu. the same tamiflu which has been linked to hallucinations, dangerous psychiatric behavior and in some instances led to death. visit http://www,askapatient.com/ to see what patients are reporting with regards to this drug.on november 14, 2006, roche laboratories made the following statement with regards to abnormal behavior reported in children:"new precautions have been added to tamiflu's professional product label (also known as a package insert) about the possibility of abnormal behavior in children and adolescents that, in extreme cases, has resulted in deaths. oseltamivir [tamiflu] should be stopped immediately if the person taking this drug develops abnormal behavior, delirium, hallucinations, delusions, aggression, suicidal ideation and/or other mental status changes while taking the drug to treat the flu."however, caution is now thrown to the wind! why, i ask you, would a parent risk this drug's deleterious effects rather than the effects of a flu, keeping in mind this drug is only reported to shorten the duration of the flu by one to two days. you could do that using natural products that pose no danger. in fact, the only component of tamiflu which could explain why it may help shorten the duration of a virus is zinc.i urge you to just include zinc as a vitamin along with vitamin d and lots of vitamin c during this flu season. contrary to what the medical community would have you believe (sung in choir with all governmental officials involved) good hygiene, vaccination and tamiflu are hardly your only options. however, if they were to admit that the immune system could be both supported and strengthened naturally, profits would be doomed. and make no mistake about it, there are many who will be quite rich as a result of this pandemic.

mumps the word -- are vaccines necessary?by: william campbell douglass ii, m.d.as you know, i'm not exactly a fan of vaccinations. at best, they're unnecessary. at worst, they're downright deadly. but the fact is that the medical community (read: big pharma) has done such a bang-up job of convincing everyone that they're an absolute necessity that in many cases, you are legally required to be vaccinated.this gross violation of personal freedom was on full display recently when the university of southern maine sent out notices to 400 students that they were being banned from campus for failing to meet the latest vaccination requirements for mumps. yes, banned. this isn't anything new, you understand. in the not-so-politically correct past, lepers were cut-off from society and left to literally rot in colonies on remote islands. but these students don't have mumps--they just haven't been vaccinated against mumps.anyone else think this is a violation of personal rights?these notices went out after a recent mumps outbreak throughout the state of maine (officials believe this spread down out of canada). among the 400 who've been banished from the halls of learning (you'd have to wonder exactly what they'd learn at a university that's so willing to employ these kinds of extreme, draconian tactics) are 20 students who have declined the vaccinations on religious or philosophical grounds. in other words, those that stood up for their rights.how seriously is the university of southern maine taking this "dangerous" mumps health threat? so seriously that students who are medically exempt from the vaccination are allowed on campus with "special passes." (reminds me of the nazis in old movies: "show me your papers, please!") so now you're thinking, "hold on, douglass -- there's got to be a very good reason for this. mumps must be a deadly virus, right?"wrong.the mumps are painful. there's fever. there's a swelling of the salivary glands around the jaw. it's not pleasant, and it's another of those childhood diseases like chicken pox which is much more painful to weather as an adult. but to be clear: it's not gonna kill you. in fact, most common treatment for the mumps is an ice bag and a couple of aspirin.in the rarest of rare cases, the results could be a mild form of meningitis, organ infections, encephalitis (rarely fatal), and sterility in men. and i suppose these "risks" could be considered serious if the university of southern maine happened to be located somewhere in the congo where disease is rife, sanitation poor, and medical aid practically nonexistent. but this is maine -- and last i heard, that was one of the forty-eight contiguous states. hardly the wilds of africa.so where did the university get the wrong-headed idea that they needed to treat 400 of their student body like disease-ridden pariahs? from maine's state government, of course (i love putting blame where it so often belongs: in the laps of unthinking, butt-covering bureaucrats). the maine center for disease control and prevention recommended that these actions be taken, and they have amended the health codes on states college campuses to require two doses of the vaccine. most people receive their first and only mumps vaccination not long after birth -- it's known as the mmr (the same one that has been linked to the rise in the number of cases of autism inchildren...).the campus ban has caused all kinds of issues, especially for the university, since it's now their responsibility to work to find off-campus housing for the 400 affected students, and to make special arrangements to allow these students to complete their coursework for the semester.of course, i'm probably the lone voice in the wilderness decrying this act -- yet another case of something stupid and dangerously wrong being enacted in the name of "the common good." but as if to underscore my point, there have been a whopping eight laboratory-confirmed cases of mumps in the entire state of maine, and just thirty-five suspected cases. so i know who's being ridiculous here. it's not the students -- especially not the 20 students who stood firm against the vaccination fascists. and it certainly isn't me. who's left? you do the math.a sweet solution for kids' coughs.fortunately, not all research concludes that the best cure is always found at the business end of a hypodermic needle. in a nice counter to that enraging vaccination story, there's a new study out about a simple, non-medical, and darn tasty solution for children's coughs: a teaspoon of honey. according to a study published in the archives of pediatrics and adolescent medicine, this homey folk remedy was better than cough medicine for children. it calmed the cough, helped kids sleep better, and coated and soothed the irritated throat.this report is like a breath of fresh air. there have been recent warnings about the dangers of over-the-counter cough and cold medicines for children younger than age six, and (shockingly) some big pharma companies even removed their baby cough-and-cold products from the market. of course, many parents already know that honey shouldn't be given to kids from birth until after age one (there's a rare but serious danger of botulism).i love it when grandma's old remedies are verified by research. this particular study used 105 kids with upper respiratory infections, some were given honey, others a honey-flavored cough medicine. all the kids got better but plain-old honey consistently scored higher than the drugs at combating the symptoms.pretty sweet, huh? helping to keep the needles at bay.

celebrity doctor says health care reformers are traitors committing genocidewashington, d.c.- celebrity dr. leonard horowitz says president obama's health care reformers are acting like drug pushers, vaccine junkies, and population controllers, neglecting alternatives that americans really want, including low-to-no-cost solutions to common health problems, with many cures immediately available online for free.citing "pharmaceutical prostitution" on capitol hill, and "blind, deaf, and mute" governors neglecting available remedies to urgencies brought on by population intoxication and corporate-controlled media deceptions, the public health and natural healing expert has launched a video website along with an international campaign featuring a dozen youtube programs to promote alternatives to mass murder in medicine, technically called "iatrogenocide.""americans have already paid with their tears and voted with their dollars for alternative health care reform," dr. horowitz says, citing substantial science proving families spend more out-of-pocket dollars for natural, alternative, and complementary care than they do for medical doctors visits. beyond this, he cites statistics showing the leading causes of death in the united states are all linked to drugs or vaccinations, and their side effects."now that every family has sustained tragic injuries, witnessed medical murders of their mothers and fathers, and suffered toxic poisonings of gifted children, people are waking up and dropping out of this sick system," dr. horowitz observes.the doctor is convinced that 70 million people without health insurance are safer, and probably healthier, than those covered by insurance served by medical doctors, hospitals, and long term care facilities he calls "concentration camps." here, toxic chemicals and deadly drugs, reminiscent of the experimental poisonings advanced by nazis, are exclusively prescribed, he explains.indicting obama's administration for "gross criminal neglect" of alternative and complementary healing practices, and a deadly fixation on vaccinations and medical intoxication for corporate controlled depopulation, he says everyone needs to take personal responsibility for prevention through vaccine risk awareness, drug risk avoidance, and generally healthier living.booming growth in the alternative and complementary care industries has ignited grass roots actions advancing legislation to free practitioners and health product manufacturers from stifling regulations imposed by federal officials on behalf of pharmaceutical interests. in new mexico, for instance, the "unlicensed health care practice act," started july 1, 2009, frees alternative healers, equipment manufacturers, and nutritional supplement providers to practice responsibly. this increases access to quality care, promotes prevention, and in many cases early diagnosis and treatment of life threatening conditions."vested interests are trying to maintain public ignorance," dr. horowitz wrote for alternativehealthcarenow.org. drug companies despise their competitors--alternative and complementary health care practitioners. that is why codex alimentarius is being advanced to kill all competition and block people's access to natural healing methods and materials. big pharma can't claim natural and safe effective solutions to improving health, patient satisfaction, employee benefits, corporate savings through reduced absenteeism, better morale in workplaces, and growing employment and economic development in many communities. these are the benefits of alternative and complementary care exclusively."dr. horowitz's new website provides many links to natural healing information and free online resources, including youtube videos, audios, and articles for saving lives. featured here is s new video titled "health care reform fraud," that responsible adults will want to watch and share with others.

complimentary medicine receives broad support in switerzerlandon may 17, 2009, the people of switzerland voted in favor of a constitutional amendment that supports the use of complementary medicine (cam). a total of 67 percent of the population voted in favor. thus switzerland becomes the first country in europe to set out in its constitution authority for the national government and its constituent states to take cam into consideration in its health services. it is an astonishing victory and may set the model for other countries as well.as the united states examines what needs to change in an effort to drive down cost and raise accessibility, do you think there is any chance special interests, big pharma or the playground's bully known as the fda will allow u.s. citizens access to complimentary medicine as part of their health care plan? i think not but i am pleased to note there is a country which is coming around. of course switzerland is always ahead of the rest of the world.

the swine flu swindlethe new swine flu vaccine should be coming to a clinic near you just in time for halloween. it seems appropriate, given the bizarre nature of the entire pigs can fly panic being spread by who and cdc, that the first h1n1 approved vaccine should be ready by halloween. can anyone say “trick or treat”? no doubt, the government will ask that i produce my children as a pin cushion or they will be denied entrance to school.hysteria is good for business – that is most certainly true when the hysteria surrounds a highly contagious flu and your business sells anti-viral drugs. as the world health organization raises the threat level for the h1n1 flu to 6 (and there is no 7) several companies are preparing for a golden harvest come fall 2009.the us government recently made available one billion dollars to help big vaccine makers like sanofi-aventis and glaxosmithkline rush to market new vaccines. novartis leads the pack with $289 million in federal support, followed by sanofi aventis with $191 million and glaxosmithkline set to receive a respectable$181 million. in addition the us government has decided to ‘de-risk' the vaccine production, presumably removing usual safeguards for new vaccines. can anyone say “swine flu of ‘76”?the us health and human services department (hhs) is placing orders with manufacturers with which it already has contracts to produce a pandemic vaccine for the never-turned pandemic h5n1 avian flu. more than $3 billion in federal funds since 2005 have gone toward developing, building manufacturing and stockpiling a vaccine to fight that disease. how long do such vaccines hold in stock? no doubt they will find some way to keep their investment from going to waste! perhaps some 3rd world country could be used for their test market.it is disturbing to learn that many drug makers are using techniques of genetic manipulation to produce their new vaccine offerings in a race to market. the maryland drugmaker novavax which reported severe annual income losses prior to the current swine flu scare, now is preparing a genetically modified vaccine they claim is suitable for h1n1 flu.free from liability?it may surprise you to learn that insurance companies historically have refused to insure vaccine manufacturers against lawsuit for vaccine-related illnesses or deaths. however, under rulings made during the bush administration, vaccines can be labeled as “unavoidably unsafe” meaning that when a product is ‘carefully designed, manufactured and marketed, but is dangerous nonetheless,' it is not a defective product, even though it might cause injury. clear as mud pigs love to frolic in! today drug makers need have little fear of damages from product liability lawsuits for, ironically, the drug manufactures are now “immune” from any lawsuits. in fact, some might argue this particular immunity is the only one effectively conveyed when someone is vaccinated.is mandatory vaccination coming to a clinic near you?at least three us federal laws should concern all americans and suggest what may be coming - mandatory vaccinations for hyped, non-existant threats, like h1n1 (swine flu). vaccines and drugs like tamiflu endanger human health but are hugely profitable to drug company manufacturers.the project bioshield act of 2004 (s. 15) became law on july 21, 2004 "to provide protections and countermeasures against chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that may be used in a terrorist attack against the united states by giving the national institutes of health contracting flexibility, infrastructure improvements, and expediting the scientific peer review process, and streamlining the food and drug administration approval process of countermeasures."in other words, the fda may now recklessly approve inadequately tested, potentially dangerous vaccines and other drugs if ever the secretaries of health and human services (hhs) or defense (dod) declare a national emergency, whether or not one exists and regardless of whether treatments available are safe and effective. around $6 billion or more will be spent to develop, produce, and stockpile vaccines and other drugs to counteract claimed bioterror agents.the public readiness and emergency preparedness (prep) act slipped under the radar when george bush signed it into law as part of the 2006 defense appropriations act (hr 2863). it lets the hhs secretary declare any disease an epidemic or national emergency requiring mandatory vaccinations. nothing in the act lists criteria that warrant a threat. also potential penalties aren't specified for those who balk, but very likely they'd include quarantine and possible fines.the hhs web site also says the secretary may "issue a declaration....that provides immunity from tort liability (except for willful misconduct) for claims of loss caused, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of (vaccine or other pharmaceutical) countermeasures to diseases, threats and conditions determined by the secretary to constitute a present, or credible risk of a future public health emergency...."the industry-run us food and drug administration (fda) notoriously rushes inadequately tested drugs to market, putting their efficacy and safety into question, and turning those who use them into lab rats. it includes everyone if a mass vaccination is ordered on the mere claim of a public emergency - no proof required.the pandemic and all-hazards preparedness act (s. 3678) is the other worrisome law, effective december 19, 2006. it amended "the public health service act with respect to public health security and all-hazards preparedness and response, and for other purposes." even its supporters worry about issues of privacy, liability, and putting profits over public health. critics express greater concerns about dangerous remedies for exaggerated or non-existant threats as well as mass hysteria created for political purposes.at least one other measure is also worrisome - the model state emergency health powers act (msehpa). so far it's just a proposal by the center for law and the public's health - "a collaborative at johns hopkins and georgetown universities (as) a primary, international, national, state, and local resource on public health law (and) policy for public health practitioners, judges, academics, policymakers, and others."msehpa is now "track(ing) legal responses to the emerging international response to the 2009 h1n1 (swine flu) outbreak, including declarations of public health emergency at the international, national, state, and local levels...." even though forensic evidence can't confirm any h1n1 deaths. no emergency exists anywhere, and reporting one is all hype to sell dangerous drugs to unsuspecting people globally.on its web site, the aclu says this about msehpa:it's "written in a way that doesn't adequately protect citizens against the misuse of the tremendous powers that it would grant in an emergency. (it's) replete with civil liberties problems. its three top flaws are that:(1) it fails to include basic checks and balances (by) grant(ing) extraordinary emergency powers (that) should never go unchecked. (it) could have serious consequences for individuals' freedom, privacy, and equality."(2) "it goes well beyond bioterrorism (with) an overbroad definition of 'public health emergency" that may be anything a local or national authority declares for any reason with no conclusive evidence for proof.(3) "it lacks privacy protections (and) undercut(s) existing protections for sensitive medical information."msehpa worries other organizations besides the aclu, both conservative and progressive - including the free congress foundation, american legislative exchange council, conservative association of state legislators, human rights campaign, and health privacy project.the real threat of dangerous, mandatory vaccinationsin the wake of the hyped swine flu scare, media reports suggest mass vaccinations are coming. the may 6 kimberly kindy – ceci connolly washington post one, for example, headlined "us may add shots for swine flu to fall regimen" without saying they'll be mandatory but reading between the lines suggests the possibility this year or later.the writers report that "the obama administration is considering an unprecedented fall vaccination campaign" to include regular and swine flu shots, the latter because it's "spreading across the globe."hhs' dr. robin robinson said "we are moving forward with making a vaccine," and if the government proceeds with a national program, enough supply will be produced to provide two doses for all americans with spokespersons like national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, anthony fauci, claiming adverse reactions aren't to be expected and adding another shot for swine flu "should not present a problem."the new york times also hypes the scare with reports of city schools closed after unconfirmed swine flu cases, a few adult deaths blamed on h1n1 bringing the claimed total in the city to seven, and the world health organization (who) saying on june 3 that it's moving closer to declaring a worldwide (level 6) swine flu pandemic - even though none exists.with all the hype, misinformation, and willful lies who's dr. keiji fukuda, in charge of flu, said only 117 deaths globally have been "blamed" on swine flu and any warning may include the caveat that the virus isn't very lethal. a more accurate statement would explain that no forensic evidence links any deaths to h1n1, and influenza annually kills about 30,000 people in america alone - something the major media never report or that scattered accounts of any type flu deaths worldwide are no cause for alarm or reason for scary headlines.it's also unconscionable for the who, us and other nations' officials to spread lies, deception, and hysteria so major pharmaceutical companies can foist dangerous vaccines and other drugs on unsuspecting people, harming their health and making them vulnerable to later diseases and possible early deaths.massachusetts may be a forerunner of what's to come on april 28, the massachusetts senate unanimously passed a pandemic flu preparation bill that rises to the level of martial law. if approved by the house and signed into law, it will mandate among other measures:-- "vaccination, treatment, examination, or testing of" all individuals involved in providing health care - as perhaps step one before ordering the same process for all state residents;-- owners or occupiers of all premises "to permit entry into and investigation of the premises;"-- closure, evacuation, and decontamination of all suspected facilities; and-- restricting or prohibiting "assemblages of persons."other states may be planning similar measures as precursors to mandatory nationwide vaccinations and overall suspension of civil liberty protections.adverse vaccination effects on gulf war troopsbefore deploying to the persian gulf in 1990 - 91 (and thereafter to the present), all us troops got a standard series of inoculations against infectious diseases - the same ones given to all us citizens traveling to the region. after arriving, 150,000 also got anthrax vaccinations and 8,000 botulinum toxoid ones even though concerns were raised about adverse long-term health consequences.a national academy of sciences' institute of medicine (iom) study was conducted to assess them with results released in september 2000. in december 1997, the department of defense (dod) announced that all us military forces would receive anthrax vaccinations. the anthrax vaccine immunization program (avip) began in march 1998 even though iom found little published peer-reviewed scientific information on its safety.in its study, iom reported evidence of an association between vaccinations studied and transient acute common health effects, including redness, swelling, and fever commonly associated with other vaccinations. however, conclusive proof of long-term problems wasn't determined - likely because study findings were skewed not to find them. more on that below.iom also studied botulinum toxoid vaccines and found evidence of an association between the vaccine and transient acute local and systemic effects similar to anthrax vaccinations. again, conclusive proof of long-term adverse health effects wasn't found - another very dubious conclusion as evidence below explains.military personnel usually get multiple vaccinations. iom studied their effects but didn't prove or disprove any long-term adverse effects. however several independent studies of british gulf war veterans found some link between multiple vaccinations and later health problems.gary matsumoto is a new york-based award-winning investigative journalist. his 2004 book, "vaccine a: the covert government experiment that's killing our soldiers and why gis are only the first victims" took sharp issue with iom results and the pentagon's denial of gulf war syndrome.investigating the shadowy vaccination development world, he discovered us military-employed doctors and scientists conducted secret medical experiments on us citizens in violation of the nuremberg code and fundamental medical ethics.for its part, nuremberg established legal medical experimental standards now incorporated into ethical medical codes, including:-- requiring voluntary consent of human subjects without coercion, fraud, deceit, and with full disclosure of known risks;-- experiments should avoid "all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury;"-- experiments should never be conducted if there's "an a prior reason to believe death or disabling injury will occur;"-- risk "should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved..;" and-- experiments should be terminated if there's reason to believe they'll cause "injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject."according to matsumoto, the pentagon violated these and other standards, betrayed the troops, and the fundamental duty of military and civilian leaders to protect them. since at least 1987, biowarfare development trumped the welfare of tens of thousands of gis used as human guinea pigs for inoculation with experimental unlicensed anthrax vaccines containing squalene – an oil-based adjuvant (to enhance immunity) known for decades to cause severe autoimmune diseases in lab animals, yet administered involuntarily without disclosure of its harmful effects to human health.matsumoto wrote:"the unethical experiments detailed in this book are ongoing, with little prospect of being self-limiting because they have been shielded from scrutiny and public accountability by nationalsecurity concerns." he suggested the "writing (was) on the wall" of what's to come with prospects now it may be soon."when ucla medical school's michael whitehouse and frances beck injected squalene combined with other materials into rats and guinea pigs back in the 1970s, few oils were more effective at causing the animal versions of arthritis and multiple sclerosis." in 1999, immunologist dr. johnny lorentzen at sweden's karolinska institute found that on injection, an "otherwise benign molecule like squalene can stimulate a self-destructive immune response," even though it occurs naturally in the body.other research shows that squalene is the experimental anthrax vaccine ingredient that caused devastating autoimmune diseases and deaths for many gulf war veterans from the us, uk, andaustralia, yet it continues in use today and for new vaccines development in labs. there's a "close match between the squalene-induced diseases in animals and those observed in humansinjected with this oil: rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus rythematosus."other autoimmune diseases are also linked to humans injected with squalene. "there are now data in more than two dozen peer-reviewed scientific papers, from ten different laboratories in the us, europe, asia and australia, documenting that squalene-based adjuvants can induce autoimmune diseases in animals...observed in mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. sweden's karolinska institute has demonstrated that squalene alone can induce the animal version of rheumatoid arthritis. the polish academy of sciences has shown that in animals, squalene alone can produce catastrophic injury to the nervous system and the brain. the university of florida medical school has shown that in animals, squalene alone can induce production of antibodies specifically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus."micropaleontologist dr. viera scheibner conducted research into the adverse effects of adjuvants in vaccines and wrote:squalene "contributed to the cascade of reactions called "gulf war syndrome". (gis developed) arthritis, fibromyalgia, lymphadenopathy, rashes, photosensitive rashes, malar rashes, chronic fatigue, chronic headaches, abnormal body hair loss, non-healing skin lesions, aphthous ulcers, dizziness, weakness, memory loss, seizures, mood changes, neuropsychiatric problems, anti-thyroid effects, anaemia, elevated esr (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, als, raynaud's phenomenon, sjorgren's syndrome, chronic diarrhea, night sweats and low-grade fever." matsumoto's book includes numerous case studies of gis afflicted with one or more of the above syndromes, their devastating effects, and the outlandish us government reaction - failing to acknowledge their existence or a connection between them and administered vaccines. also denying the effects of other toxic gulf theater exposures (like depleted uranium) as well as withholding meaningful treatments or protocols.us army captain george l. skypeck spoke eloquently for many when he said:"was the character of my valor less intense than those at lexington? was the pain of my wounds any less severe than those at normandy? and was my loneliness any less sorrowful than those at inchon? then why am i forgotten amongst those remembered as 'heros?'"if mass vaccinations are ordered, millions of americans may ask: why do you keep using unsafe vaccines and other drugs when clear evidence shows their dangers? why do you jeopardize all americans by unleashing a future plague of serious illnesses, diseases, and disabilities? why have you willfully and maliciously ruined my health?from inception, vaccines have always been dangerous enough for some experts to call them biological weapons undermining health, manipulating and crippling the immune system, and creating the possibility of future debilitating diseases. so big pharma's solution is new, more potent genetically engineered vaccines and drugs that may end up harming or killing many who take them, especially people with weakened immune systems.matsumoto and others sounded the alarm to alert everyone to avoid these poisons masquerading as protective drugs. in fact, they benefit only the bottom lines of companies that manufacture them and scientists reaping generous royalties.stephen lendman is a research associate of the centre for research on globalization. he lives in chicago and can be reached at lendmanstephen@sbcglobal.net.

is american medicine working?

at 14% of the gross national product, healthcare spending reached $1.6 trillion in 2003. considering this enormous expenditure, we should have the best medicine in the world. we should be reversing disease, preventing disease, and doing minimal harm. however, careful and objective review shows the opposite. because of the narrow context of medical technology through which contemporary medicine examines the human condition, we are completely missing the full picture. instead of minimizing obvious disease-causing factors such as chemical exposure and diet, we actually cause more illness through medical technology, diagnostic testing, overuse of medical and surgical procedures, and overuse of pharmaceutical drugs. the huge disservice of this therapeutic strategy is the result of little effort or money being appropriated for preventing disease.

toxins - they are destroying your health

science has uncovered the relationship between persistent exposure to toxins, the body's natural ability to heal and restore itself, and the resulting health conditions that occur because of the dysfunction of these systems. toxicity, acidic conditions and viral load, all of which suppress the immune system and interfere with normal cellular metabolism, are behind a whole array of conditions that plague humanity — from cancer and a wide range of serious chronic illnesses, to low energy and a susceptibility to colds and flu. to order a heavy metal test kit, visit drlyntests.com.

quick overview on stem cell enhancers

how does stemenhance work?when you take two capsules, the ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. through a natural process, those stem cells then travel to areas of the body where they are most needed.what are stem cells?stem cells can be thought of as “master” cells. you’ve probably heard about the controversy of embryonic stem cells in the news. stem cells are found in human embryos, but are also found in adult tissue. adult stem cells are most abundantly found in bone marrow. stem cells circulate and function to replace dysfunctional cells, thus fulfilling the natural process of maintaining optimal health. stemenhance supports the release of adult stem cells from bone marrow into circulation.the recent advances in stem cell research were listed as one of the most significant health-related stories in the past 25 years by cnn, second only to the complete mapping of the human genome.
