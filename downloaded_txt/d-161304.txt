			no single product better represents the true american spirit than the classic wooden canoe. they are a direct link to the adventures and legends of outdoor life. they capture and reflect nature's wonders and help you enjoy the simple pleasures of life as you take in the beauty of the world around you. with over 35 years of canoe building experience american traders is the largest builder of classic cedar canoes in the world. our commitment to the craft and the careful attention to detail in each canoe really defines the exceptional quality of our boats.

			our winter toboggans are built in vermont with the same attention to detail and focus on high quality. we know that years of family pleasure will come from owning one of these classic wooden toboggan designs. also check out our  gransfors-bruks axes these are the finest axes in the world and make great gifts all year round.
 
			with most of us living insanely busy and stressful lives it's important to find time to enjoy the simple pleasures of life 'american traders' canoes are the perfect escape, what could be better than spending a few hours connecting with the outside, exercising to keep fit and unwinding on the water.  as beautiful as our canoes are, they are not museum pieces. yes, they are nice to look at but all are intended for use in the water. and now the same classic designs availble in lightweight e-fusion kevlar or carbon and wood trim, built with the same high quality and attention to detail.
