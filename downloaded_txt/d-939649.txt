 our namesake was a difference maker 







h. wayne huizenga set success records in starting, acquiring, owning, and revolutionizing
                                             businesses like autonation, blockbuster, waste management, and many more. he had ownership
                                             in all three major professional sports teams in florida—the dolphins, marlins, and
                                             panthers. but through it all, he lived his commitment to putting people and planet
                                             before profit. he made a difference in the way others defined wealth, success, and
                                             purpose.
come to nsu business to be like wayne. be a leader. an innovator. a good-hearted citizen
                                             who gives back to your greater community. be whatever you want to be. but above all,
                                             like wayne, be a difference maker.
