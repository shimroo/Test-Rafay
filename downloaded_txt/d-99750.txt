welcome
      to caesar-salad.com 

"i look for a balanced,
      yet distinct flavor that dances with the sunkiss of
      lemon, garlic and zesty cheese, speckled with the warmth of cracked pepper
      and distant
      anchovies"...

going out for
      a caesar's salad is an event for me; it is the one dish i will not prepare,
      simply so that i have an excuse to go out!  and how i love the
      dish;  i find people everywhere as passionate about that salad as i
      am.  but what amazes me most is how everyone i know claims to be able
      to make the "best ceasars i've ever had"!
the
      creation of caesar's salad has been attributed to an italian, caesar cardini,
      who at the time was a restaurateur in tijuana, mexico. according to records, supplies in the cardini establishment ran
      short one holiday weekend in 1924.  caesar experimented and that
      evening the caesar's salad was born.
      "take everything to the table" he
      said, "and make a ceremony of fixing the salad".  let guests
      think they're having the specialty of the house".  later, it was voted
      " the greatest recipe to originate from the americas in fifty
      years" by the international society of epicures in paris*.  
for purists,
      caesar salads are made from simple, fresh ingredients, and contain fresh garlic (used to flavor the oil), cold, dried heart of
      romaine leaves, fresh ground pepper, a dash of salt, imported olive oil, fresh
      lemon juice, worcestershire sauce
      (where the anchovy flavor came from), homemade croutons and parmesan cheese. 
      the cheese is usually grated in front of you.  more upscale restaurants
      may prepare caesar salads right at your table (tableside), although these have been more difficult
      to find.
now if you're
      wondering why i've created this website, it's because i've been thinking
      about it for many years: visiting restaurants, comparing flavors and
      textures, looking up all sorts of stories, becoming more and more of a fan.  finally,
      i received a bet that i just couldn't turn down....and so,
      here it is..... 
...... a tribute to that honorable,
      captivating and nostalgic caesar salad.
