self 
                empowerment counseling by phone or in person includes 
                both counseling dialogue and life coaching, two very powerful 
                and highly customized methods to help you triumph over lifes 
                challenges and live more joyfully. 
counseling dialogue 
                uses specific questions to help you identify 
                and explore your core beliefs, gaining powerful insights into 
                why you do what you do. you will overcome seemingly insurmountable 
                challenges and create lasting change much more easily and quickly 
                than youve ever imagined. 
life change coaching is a laser sharp way to start creating 
                and continue achieving your dreams. youll get help where the 
                rubber meets the road, an action plan outlining specific steps 
                to create and grow your ideal livelihood, relationship, lifestyle.              
we call this work self empowerment 
                counseling because it puts you 100% in the drivers seat, with 
                clarity, direction and unstoppable passion.
life coaching, counseling 
                dialogue and combination power-on 
                sessions are all available by phone or in person at our office 
                on the big island of hawaii.
