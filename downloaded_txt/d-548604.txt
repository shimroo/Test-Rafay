“walmart.com review “this stuff is simply amazing. i have no other word that does it justice. i have a ton of wood in my house which was built in the 50's.. doors, molding, etc. i have tried so many products over the years...some clean but don't moisturize and vise versa. this is the first product i have ever seen that does both, and i am in love!”ginger, november 2020
