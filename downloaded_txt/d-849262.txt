international olive oil expert
judy ridgway

i am an author, journalist and broadcaster and one of the few independent experts on olive oil outside the producing countries.  ​i have been working with olives and olive oil for more than thirty years, travelling the olive oil world and tasting oils from all round the mediterranean as well as from north america and the newer producing countries in the southern hemisphere such as australia, new zealand, south africa, chile and argentina

​in 1993 i was commissioned by the direction generale de l’agriculture (promotion huile d’olive) of the then eec to write the paper taste and flavour in olive oil. this paper has been thoroughly revised and is now published as a paperback booklet.  its tasting vocabulary is now in general use. i was appointed by the italian mastri oleari (masters of olive oil) to sit on the judging panel for the prestigious international leone d’oro awards for olive oil.  i sat on the panel for eight years until 2002.  during this time i also acted as the independent consultant to the uk olive oil council and subsequent olive oil information bureaus for the uk and eire. i have written five books on olive oil as well as numerous articles and blog posts.  books currently in print include the olive oil diet, written in conjunction with dr. simon poole, a leading authority on the nutrition of olive oil and the mediterranean diet.  published at the end of 2016, the book won the “first in the world” dun gifford special award at the 2017 international finals of the gourmand world cookbook awards after winning the diet section of the same competition earlier in the year. the book also won a gold diploma at the oleocanthal international society health and foods award the same year. foreign language editions are available in spanish, turkish and bulgarian.  also currently in print is the international wine and food society monograph around the world with olive oil which looks at the quality, style and flavour characteristics of olive oil around the world.  it covers 25 different producing countries and references over 100 extra virgin olive oils.
