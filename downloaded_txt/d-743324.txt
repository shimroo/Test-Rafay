what’s coming






























concertsjazz, chamber, new music & acousticsin march, the winter jazz at the athenaeum series continues with   allison, cardenas & nash, a collective trio of top new york city–based artists bassist ben allison, guitarist steve cardenas, and saxophonist ted nash. they weave musical conversations that are full of subtlety and surprise. the trio is modeled after reedist-composer jimmy giuffre’s drummer-less groups of the 1950s and 60s. next up is a return visit by the remarkable sullivan fortner trio, featuring new orleans–native fortner on piano, tyrone allen on bass, and kayvon gordon on drums.

exhibitionsjulian tan will exhibit end trances, a body of work centered on a blinding, mysterious light in the sky and humans’ moments of wonder, panic, and solace as they witness it. in creating these paintings, tan was thinking about recent trends including the use of ai in art making, the vastness of knowledge at our fingertips in a world dominated by instant information, public fascination with unidentified aerial phenomena, and a pervasive sense of being at the precipice of something—whether the end of the world or a cultural shift we have yet to understand as a society.the show will be on display in the joseph clayes iii gallery and the carolyn yorston-wellcome rotunda gallery from january 18 through april 19, 2025.
