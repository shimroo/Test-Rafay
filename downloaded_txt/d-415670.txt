i have not had a decent piece of pizza since i was diagnosed with celiac 4 years ago until tonight. i almost ate the entire pizza, who knows- if i go by the kitchen again i may polish it off. i must say that you aided in the destruction of a week of weight watchers but what fun it was! thank you, thank you, thank you!!! i am going back to the store tomorrow to tell them how good it is as i clear out their stock. i also called my dad and told him his days of eating cardboard pizza are over too. i honestly do not know who you made happier, myself and my dad who suffer from celiac or my husband and mom who rarely get to eat pizza anymore because they live with celiac sufferers. my compliments to the chef!!!!" https://gilliansfoodsglutenfree.com/testimonials/amy-fulton/kathy hawk, high falls, ny "at last, a gluten free apple pie, and it's delicious. the apples aren't too sweet. the crumb topping is crunchy....kathy hawk, high falls, nygillian's foods 2016-09-12t14:50:17-04:00kathy hawk, high falls, ny"at last, a gluten free apple pie, and it's delicious. the apples aren't too sweet. the crumb topping is crunchy. and it came by ups, ready to pop in the oven. thanks gillian's. oh, and the 'everything' dinner rolls are a big hit here too!
