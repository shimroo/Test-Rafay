keto caramel low carb protein shake & bars











i just tried these new keto caramel products and let me tell you they are amazing! i have been following a ketogenic way of eating for most of this year so i have been doing my very best to keep my carbs super low and proteins high and these products fall right in line with my needs. if you read the ingredient list, you too will be surprised of all the healthy stuff they have packed into these.  with the keto caramel shake mix, i prepared it with some really good cold coffee, add a scoop of the keto caramel shake mix, some ice and blend, it tastes like you are drinking a healthy "starbucks" drink.  the keto caramel bars will remind you of a decadent dessert, sweet and chocolatey. i gathered all the info and put onto one page for your convenience to learn about it. http://www.globalsuccessmentor.com/keto-shakes-bars-keto-caramel.html to order, visit http://www.gotenergydrink.com you can simply search for "keto" and it should come up, but if you need help finding it or are looking for any other health or nutritional products, let me know, as i am more than happy to help.

2016 amazing fitness & health results including weight loss, fat loss, getting healthier





this year has seen amazing fitness and health results including weight loss, fat loss, muscle gain and overall healthiness (if that is even a word).  i have been really focused this year on getting back into shape as i got off track ever so slightly and gained back close to 20 pounds slowly over time.  it creeps up on you if you aren't careful and that is what happened to me.  i attempted to lose weight last year but it just wasn't working.  this year i tried something different to see if it would work as it was for others.  i have lost about 30 lbs of fat since the end of january 2016.  i have exceeded my goal of weight loss, which is amazing.  i started on the basic reset products i mentioned in my last post.  what i used:  body mass reset, aqualyte, ionyte, vibrant energy drink and bee gold.  i followed the suggested menu and instructions with the body mass reset and started losing weight the very first week.  i continued to lose weight each week.  after i finished the body mass reset, i continued to eat healthy following the menu and continued to see results. http://discount.basicreset.com/ i am still using all of these products as they are great.additionally if you are looking to promote a health & wellness company, they pay 35% weekly for your referral business when people shop or sign up through you and there are other bonuses. there is no fee to join, no auto ship, no purchase required, your website is free, there is no catch.  check it out.  everything has a 30 day money back guarantee. http://discount.basicreset.com/

basic reset - vibrant energy drink - aqualyte - ionyte - free







vibrant energy drink

i don't even know where to start, but i can say for sure i have stumbled onto something that you are going to want to check into.  a longtime friend and business partner of mine told me about these products and this company called "basic reset" a few months ago, however i was too busy at the time to take a good look at the time. i put it on my agenda to figure out what was up and what i needed to do and i have to say i am very impressed so far with what i see.  first off there is no cost to join, no website fee, no purchases required, no autoship required, no strings attached, no catch whatsoever and in this day and age, that is normally too good to be true.  as i look a little further i recognize some other business people i know and look up to are also associated with this affiliate program, and yes, this got my attention.  

i was told a new healthy energy drink would be available and of course i was very interested in that because the one i used to market and love evolved into something that no longer did anything for me personally.  i just got a chance to try this drink yesterday for the very first time and let me tell you, it is good! it is called vibrant energy drink, it's all natural with no artificial sweeteners or preservatives, it definitely has some "power" to it.  oh and of course it tastes great.  you might think you want to drink it all day long, but let me assure you that you do not need to drink more than one to get yourself going, trust me on this. :) if you would like to get some of this drink, you can find it in the store or catalog section on my basic reset site.  it is priced at $34.95 for a 30 serving canister.

additional products highly worth considering are the aqualyte, ionyte, beta factor, body mass reset, and bee gold. all the products carry a 60 day money back guarantee! i have already ordered most of these in my first order and am in the process of trying them.  there are more products and i will be sure to get around to trying them and sharing my experience and results.

you may be interested in creating some additional income for yourself and if you are, you can earn 35% commission on all of the sales from your free affiliate website with basic reset.  you can start making money immediately with no waiting and the commissions are calculated in real time and paid to your paypal account weekly.  additionally, you can choose to spend the money accumulated in your commissions on products before the money is transferred to paypal. if this sounds like something you are interested in, check out the site and sign up as an affiliate with no risk whatsoever. http://discount.basicreset.com/

drew pearson joins youngevity® as a celebrity brand ambassador and member of athletic advisory board





al international (jcof) announces new partnership with nfl legend drew pearson

drew pearson joins youngevity® as a celebrity brand ambassador and member of athletic advisory board

san diego, ca – may 8, 2013 –youngevity® essential life sciences, a wholly owned subsidiary of al international, inc. (otc pink: jcof), announced today that sportscaster, businessman, and former superstar wide receiver for the dallas cowboys, drew pearson, has joined youngevity® as a celebrity brand ambassador and member of its athletic advisory board in its effort to continue promoting active, healthy lifestyles.

drew pearson began his professional nfl career in 1973 as a “walk-on” free agent with the dallas cowboys, where he rose to become one of the nfl’s greatest all-time wide receivers.  a three time all pro, drew pearson played his entire professional football career for the dallas cowboys and helped the cowboys to three super bowl appearances and a victory in super bowl xii in 1978.  pearson is recognized for many achievements highlighted by being named to the nfl 1970s all-decade team.  his name is proudly displayed in cowboys stadium as a member of their prestigious ring of honor.

pearson was known as "mr. clutch" for his numerous clutch catches in game-winning situations, especially the celebrated "hail mary" reception from roger staubach that sealed the victory in a 1975 playoff game, one of the most famous plays in dallas cowboys and nfl history. he caught the game-sealing touchdown in the 1973 playoff game against the los angeles rams and the game-winning touchdown pass from reserve quarterback clint longley in the 1974 thanksgiving game against the washington redskins. all three of those plays were named among the top 75 plays in nfl history by nfl films in 1994 and were included on a video/dvd by that name.  in 2009, on the nfl network show "nfl's top 10", in the episode titled "greatest dallas cowboys", he was named as one of the 10 greatest dallas cowboys to ever play.  

since august of 2012, pearson has been a co-host of the drew pearson show, “more than just sports”, which is the pre and postgame show for the dallas cowboys season.  on the show, drew shares real life stories of his own personal experience with the cowboys coupled with engaging guests and informative interviews.  the show is featured on local dallas fox television affiliates and the audio portion of the show will be broadcasted over several different internet sports radio stations nationwide.

drew pearson stated, “i am very excited about joining the professional team at youngevity as they continue to promote wellness and good health through their amazing array of products.  i am fully engaged in their 90 for life program and i have personally enjoyed the benefits from a number of their products.  i became sold on the company through the use of their natural topical pain reliever called cm cream.   obviously, after playing 11 years in the nfl for the dallas cowboys, i walked away from the game with a few bumps and bruises.  i have been dealing with an arthritic and joint pain condition that has accelerated at my current age.  i am proud to endorse youngevity’s cm cream which provided me almost immediate relief from the knee joint pain i had been experiencing for years. trust me...it really works for me.” 

steve wallach, ceo of al international, inc. said “we are extremely fortunate to have the original number 88 join our team.  i am personally thrilled that drew pearson is having success with our products and i could not be prouder to have him be a part of our athletic advisory board.”

san diego, ca – may 6, 2013 – growing direct-selling conglomerate youngevity® essential life sciences, a wholly-owned subsidiary of al international, inc. (otc pink: jcof), welcomed nearly 1500 independent business owners and customers from around the globe to the annual youngevity® convention, which was held on may 2nd through the 4th at the red rock casino resort & spa in las vegas, nevada. 

with more than 70,000 active distributors and customers, youngevity® is quickly becoming a leader both in the direct selling and dietary supplement industry.  recently, youngevity® has been named among the top 100 global direct selling companies by direct selling news®, the leading trade publication for the direct selling industry.

youngevity® and its distributors have rallied around the healthy body challenge, a campaign supporting optimal wellness.  the youngevity healthy body challenge is a world-wide movement that has given the opportunity for thousands of individuals to transform their lives by realizing their health and wealth potential.  the beginnings of the healthy body challenge started over 20 years ago by dr. joel wallach, a foremost authority on the nutrient deficiencies leading to today's health concerns.

youngevity® convention speakers included our celebrity brand ambassadors, marilu henner, former nba all-stars, theo ratliff and mike glenn, and nutritional pioneer and youngevity® founder dr. joel d. wallach, bs, dvm, nd to name a few.  during the event, company executives and top distributors presented information to the audience about the ‘90 for life’ health message, which emphasizes the benefits of the 90 essential nutrients at the center of youngevity’s commitment to improving lives through science-based, high-quality nutrition. 

additional convention highlights include:

   o on-the-go cardio daily premium pak™:  provides an antioxidant-rich supply of vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and other key nutrients that may help with cardiovascular health and optimal wellness in easy-to-consume packets. 

• awards and recognitions including healthy body challenge winners, slim city contest winners, theo ratliff rebound award recipients, and rank advancement recognitions. 

youngevity presented a comprehensive technology review that outlined its plans to build a state of the art on line shopping experience for its distributors and customers.  some 1500 distributors rose to their feet when the company announced the release of the 90 for life mobile app, which enables youngevity distributors to promote their business and manage their prospective customers from their apple or android devices. 

youngevity president, bill andreoli, said, “our distributors were excited about the new product announcements and the upcoming exposure that will come via success from home magazine.  the most applause came from the live launch of our 90 for life mobile app.  this allows our distributors to send, track, and manage customer invitations, view videos and invite anyone with a mobile phone or app enabled device to join their business – all right from their contact list.”

as the company continues to experience growth and success, youngevity® ceo steve wallach adds, “the annual convention is the ultimate experience for our distributors to come together and network, learn, and celebrate with others who share similar goals. whether they are just starting out in the business or have been in it for 20 years, everyone at the convention is there for the same reason and you feel the liveliness from everyone there, it’s an amazing experience.”
