summer is the season for camping at fisherman's point campground. fish, canoe or kayak on whitewater or colby lake. swimmers can enjoy a lifeguard supervised swim and a picnic at birch cove beach. test your skills at the 9 hole, par 36, municipal golf course. hoyt lakes is proud of its outdoor recreation facilities that also include regulation tennis courts, volleyball courts, four ball fields, skateboard park, playground and many paved hiking and biking trails. all facilities are in close proximity to the country inn of hoyt lakes.
the winter season provides opportunities for ice fishing, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, hockey, skating and snowmobiling. from hoyt lakes area trails, riders can connect with a network of 3,100 miles of groomed trails which wind through some of minnesota's most beautiful forest areas. the scenic bird lake and colby lake cross country skiing trails are just outside of town. downhill skiing and cross country skiing can also be enjoyed at nearby giant's ridge golf & ski resort or in the winter wonderland of the superior national forest. the hoyt lakes arena facility offers basketball, pickleball, indoor and outdoor ice rinks, and youth hockey.
