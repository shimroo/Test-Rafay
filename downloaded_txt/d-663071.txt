 what is it?
 
  

 





i've been collecting unusual objects for quite a while, and several years ago i started posting them on this site as puzzles for 
visitors to figure out what they are.  most of the items are mine but a few belong to others, if you aren't interested in tools there are plenty of other type objects that have also been posted.




for first time visitors i recommend 
this archive
for a wide variety of some of my best pieces.
