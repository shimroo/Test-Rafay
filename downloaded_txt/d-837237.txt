the legend


skys blue boy
1993  
								2012

 blue,

   if tears 
								could build a stairway, and memories a lane,

   i'd walk 
								right up to heaven and bring you home again.

   you 
								came into our lives and left hoofprints on our 
								hearts.

    
								for that dear gentle giant, you will never from 
								us part.

           
								- ray & linda
