we aim to offer the same high standard quality in remanufactured parts as you would expect to get from buying a new unit. the advantage of a remanufactured part is we can re-engineer the units to permanently eliminate any design faults and offer a more reliable solution over a standard replacement. one of the main reasons is because a new replacement part will most likely retain the same design fault which caused it to fail. part receivedyour part is booked in and sent into the workshop waiting for initial testingpart testedfault is identified and customer notified of the test resultsrepairs in progressunit is remanufactured and the fault completely rectifiedpart shipped outunit is retested after repairs to confirm full functionality + returned to customer    latest power steeringthe causes of your car pulling to one sideposted in  general category | posted by: jasonis there anything more annoying than driving your vehicle and having it constantly pull to one side? not only is it distracting, but also unsafe, as it’s harder to[+]diagnosing electric power steering system issuesposted in  general category | posted by: jasonas the automotive industry is evolving, more vehicles are shifting from the traditional hydraulic power steering systems to electric power steering (eps). this is not to be mistaken with[+]symptoms & causes of engine overheatingposted in  general category | posted by: jasoninternal combustion engines tend to generate a lot of heat as they are operating, so cooling techniques are necessary to avoid damage being caused. while an engine is running,[+]mot testing guide – tips on how to prepare for it!posted in  general category | posted by: jasonif you own a vehicle, mot tests are part of the regular responsibilities you will have, just like road tax, insurance, and servicing. an mot test’s purpose is to[+]steering feels loose – what are the causes?posted in  general category | posted by: jasonwhen you’re driving with a loose steering wheel, not only does it make you feel like you don’t have full control of the vehicle, but it also makes you[+]what are common bad wheel bearing symptoms?posted in  general category | posted by: jasonwhat is a wheel bearing? any vehicle that has wheels will have wheel bearings, such as bicycles, aeroplanes and even boats. they consist of a group of steel balls[+]do you need car wheel alignment?posted in  general category | posted by: jasonchecking wheel alignment is often overlooked by many drivers, as it’s usually not the first maintenance task on the list! however, by neglecting to correct misalignment, you run the[+]what are common catalytic converter problems?posted in  general category | posted by: jasonif you happen to be experiencing catalytic converter problems, it means that you run the risk of your vehicle becoming less environmentally friendly, as it’s one of the most[+]power steering rack reconditioningposted in  general category | posted by: jasonpower steering is a fundamental system in our vehicles… imagine having to steer the weight of your car without any help? we would never miss arm day, that’s for[+]common steering column problemsposted in  general category | posted by: jasonwhen we think of important systems in our vehicle, we usually think of the engine system, the transmission, fuel system and braking system. however, we forget what actually allows[+]previousnexttestimonials

only issue i had was the fact that it took me so long to find these guys… took my e320 to another ‘mechanic’ for a steering rack issue and got nothing but hassle… got in touch with pss who really know their stuff, they kept the car for 2 days, picked it up today and drives like new… couldn’t be happier..! thank you.
