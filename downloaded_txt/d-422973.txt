welcome to usmc hangout
your one stop source for everything marine corps. from military legal info to a list of famous marines, you will find it here. we now have over 200 pages to this site! you will also find navigation links that point to the main sections of our site at the top of every page.




thanks for visiting our site! over the years usmc hangout has been a huge source of information for everything marine corps and even general military information. at one time, way before social media, our site hosted forums that had hundreds of thousands of threads and thousands of members. with the invention of socail media, our forum dwindled and we eventually closed it down due to non-use.
over the years, much of our general military information has been transfered to our owner's site nutty hiker adventures, so she could quickly keep the information updated as needed, and due to the fact that is where she hosts her (now retired) dear military spouse column.
 what remains of this site is for nostalgic purposes and marine corps specific information that the owner updates from time to time. as your read the pages, you will quickly realize just how old this site is! notice we refer a lot to "dial up users"! however, that does not mean all the information is out of date! if you see something that needs an update, contact us!
now sit back and browse your way through this huge site. most pages do not have graphics, this enables the pages to load more quickly for our dial up users. as always if you have something you would like to add to the site or have a question, please feel free to contact us. we try to reply to all e-mails within 48 hours.
