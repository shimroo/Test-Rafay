our farmhouse
































































the farmhouse was built at the turn of the 19th-century when new mexico was still under spanish rule. the double adobe structure served as a family home for over a century and a half, undergoing its first remodel in the early 1900’s with victorian details added throughout the home. in the 1960’s, at the peak of the rainbow coalition’s gatherings in the surrounding areas, the space became a religious commune at which point the barn and stables were adopted and transformed into living quarters. as a commune, all that were hungry or in need of a bed were welcome. it wasn’t until the late 1970’s that the second story was added in northern new mexico territorial style; entering into its new life as an inn.we love it when you book directly with us (use code direct10 to receive a 10% discount).
