signs of the times, or why we are in the end of days, according to prophecy



did you know? 1. two symbols predicted that the last empire of the world will choose are the symbols of the european union?
2. the last seven years will start when the leader from europe make a peace treaty with israel?
3. that the eu has made their top military office with document number 666 and that his job is to make 7 year peace treaties. (his first time to make these treaties will be 2007)

same harbingers, same warnings, same judgement same remedy.





luke 21:35-36 - "for as a snare shall it ( these days, this time of great trial) come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. verse 36, watch you therefore, and pray always, that you many be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the son of man."

revelation 3:10 - "because you have kept the word of my patience (waiting upon the lord in obedience and faith), i also will keep you from the hour of temptation (trial of testing during great adversity), which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."

if this is true of the tribulation in total, it is not true for the end of the events brought to light in the book the harbinger. a more relevant warning would be "come out of her my people that you might not participate in her plagues. rev 18 he would not have said this if he were to take out "his people" with the rapture. this would parallel the warning given ancient israel after the events for the first harbingers that appeared.jeremiah 51:45 (hcsb) — come out from among her, my people! save your lives, each of you, from the lord’s burning anger.

same harbingers, same warnings, same judgement same remedy. 
if the harbinger is to be taken seriously, then all the signs that hit ancient israel have appeared here. if that is the truth then the final judgement that hit israel will hit america just as it hit ancient israel. while israel had the promise of being scattered and then again being gathered and made a nation again, that promise is lacking for the united states. the spirit over america is "because she gloated, “i’m queen over all,and no widow, never a tear on my face,” this spirit is over america and i believe it is the spirit that keeps us from seeing that what awaited israel awaits us. if the information that is in the harbinger is correct it is the only sane conclusion. this all awaits us if america does not repent. because america is not present in the end times i believe like israel we do not repent. it is only the "i am no window" type of spirit that prevents us from seeing it or giving it weight. give gods promise of judgement full weight just for a few moments and what does that bring you to? what should be done? watch how the spirit of "i am no window" tugs to bring you back, nothing is wrong, "these are not the droids your looking for" ... spirits are tricky.

what is revelations 18 all about?






anyone know what this is about?  "get out, my people, as fast as you can,     so you don’t get mixed up in her sins,     so you don’t get caught in her doom."  revelation 18  the message (msg) doom to the city of darkness 
 18 1-8 following this i saw another angel descend from heaven. his 
authority was immense, his glory flooded earth with brightness, his 
voice thunderous:  ruined, ruined, great babylon, ruined!     a ghost town for demons is all that’s left! a garrison of carrion spirits,     garrison of loathsome, carrion birds. all nations drank the wild wine of her whoring;     kings of the earth went whoring with her;     entrepreneurs made millions exploiting her.  just then i heard another shout out of heaven:  get out, my people, as fast as you can,     so you don’t get mixed up in her sins,     so you don’t get caught in her doom. her sins stink to high heaven;     god has remembered every evil she’s done. give her back what she’s given,     double what she’s doubled in her works,     double the recipe in the cup she mixed; bring her flaunting and wild ways     to torment and tears. because she gloated, “i’m queen over all,     and no widow, never a tear on my face,” in one day, disasters will crush her—     death, heartbreak, and famine— then she’ll be burned by fire, because god,     the strong god who judges her,     has had enough. 
 9-10 “the kings of the earth will see the smoke of her burning, and 
they’ll cry and carry on, the kings who went night after night to her 
brothel. they’ll keep their distance for fear they’ll get burned, and 
they’ll cry their lament:  doom, doom, the great city doomed!     city of babylon, strong city! in one hour it’s over, your judgment come! 
 11-17 “the traders will cry and carry on because the bottom dropped out
 of business, no more market for their goods: gold, silver, precious 
gems, pearls; fabrics of fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet; perfumed 
wood and vessels of ivory, precious woods, bronze, iron, and marble; 
cinnamon and spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine and oil, 
flour and wheat; cattle, sheep, horses, and chariots. and slaves—their 
terrible traffic in human lives.  everything you’ve lived for, gone!     all delicate and delectable luxury, lost!     not a scrap, not a thread to be found!  “the traders who made millions off her kept their distance for fear of getting burned, and cried and carried on all the more:  doom, doom, the great city doomed!     dressed in the latest fashions,     adorned with the finest jewels,     in one hour such wealth wiped out! 
 17-19 “all the ship captains and travelers by sea, sailors and toilers 
of the sea, stood off at a distance and cried their lament when they saw
 the smoke from her burning: ‘oh, what a city! there was never a city 
like her!’ they threw dust on their heads and cried as if the world had 
come to an end:  doom, doom, the great city doomed!     all who owned ships or did business by sea got rich on her getting and spending.     and now it’s over—wiped out in one hour! 
 20 “o heaven, celebrate! and join in, saints, apostles, and prophets! 
god has judged her; every wrong you suffered from her has been judged.”  21-24 a strong angel reached for a boulder—huge, like a millstone—and heaved it into the sea, saying,  heaved and sunk, the great city babylon,     sunk in the sea, not a sign of her ever again. silent the music of harpists and singers—     you’ll never hear flutes and trumpets again. artisans of every kind—gone;     you’ll never see their likes again. the voice of a millstone grinding falls dumb;     you’ll never hear that sound again. the light from lamps, never again;     never again laughter of bride and groom. her traders robbed the whole earth blind,     and by black-magic arts deceived the nations. the only thing left of babylon is blood—     the blood of saints and prophets,     the murdered and the martyred.

the last pope is upon us.






this is the last pope.
a little known catholic predicted all the popes with stunning accuracy for hundreds of years.
after  glory of the olive benedict xvi (the current pope) comes "peter the roman"
this is the pope that is with the church during the great tribulation and is present when jesus comes back.
benedict xvi announced he would resign this month.
according to  saint malachy this next pope is the last pop and will be here during jesus return, the battle of armegeddon, and thee 7 year tribulation where around 5 billion people die..

see the charred rocks on top of the real mount sinai





saudi arabia has armed guards and barbed wire fences around the real site of mount sinai where the ten commandments were given, see the charred rocks on the top of the mountain, see the stone where millions of gallons of  water came out in a desert that gets .5 inches a year of rain, see the altar where the golden calf was placed. see the pillars that were placed in the altar to god, see the markers that were placed around the mountain by moses to warn people. the bitter springs, the 70 palms. http://www.archive.org/details/the_search_for_the_real_mt_sinailink to the mpg4 video:http://www.archive.org/download/the_search_for_the_real_mt_sinai/the_search_for_the_real_mt_sinai_512kb.mp4

the next thing to happen...





the very next hing to happen on the prophetic calendar is that the arabs and the russians are about to make their move on israel lead by iran as predicted thousands of years ago. it is also highly likely that israel will discover oil in the tribal land of asher. they recently found enormous reserves of natural gas there.

the quick version, mostly pictures





the bible predicts that rome (europe) will come back in the last days.the european union made their chief military office with "eu recommendation #666"i had to look that one up before i could believe it.the bible predicts as a symbol a woman on a (scarlet beast)the eu headquarters has a picture of a woman on three red beasts in the air with people looking up her in awe.the european union signed their constitution on the same hill that ruled rome for thousands of years.speaking of a woman on a beast thisis the eus other stuff: stamps, money, statues etc.ok next it talks about this last empire being likened to babylon, which the bible uses to symbolize mankind's rule over the earth.  so that being said here is a old masters picture of the tower of babylon.  then here is the official eu poster, it says europe many tongues one voice.  then they build their parliament building to look like a unfinished tower. it has the picture of the lady on the red beasts in the sky in it.just coincidence? ya right...the prophet daniel predicted all the leading nations of the earth in a vision of a metal image. all the nations that ruled the earth came true just as described and even the metals were symbolic of the nations. all happened and only one is left. its the toes and they are made with clay and iron mixed cause some of the nations would be strong and some weak and they would not mix together well. just like the eu today. it would end in ten toes. during the "toes" jesus would come back and hit the toes , the image would fall and jesus would rule the world. we are in the toes now. (pictures below if you want to see them)the anti-christ will make everyone take a mark in the hand or forehead  in order to buy or sell.to take the mark it means "insert" in the greek.the world will see two prophets get killed and then get raised up, it says that people all over the world will see it. this is only now really possible with stuff like video cell phones and television.it also said this would all happen when "knowledge would be increased and people would go to and fro about the earth with great ease." this has only happened in the last 100 years.also about the timing,jesus said that the generation that saw israel become a nation would not go away until he came back. that happened in 1948 in may.they will have to rebuild the temple in israel. they all ready have the plans and they have made the gold stuff for it costing millions of dollars. they will need red heiffers that are perfect for temple sacrifices. during all the temple ages their were only 9 of these. on the earth now their are 3 which is really amazing.they re-instated the council that tried jesus the sanhedrin after 1600 years. they need them for the temple.they will rebuild  the temple right after the russian iranian invasion of israel. can anyone see in the news how that might happen?almost all the arab nations come but iraq is left out. most all of the arab and russian forces will be wiped out.they will then burn the weapons of warfare for 7 years. the russians who supply most of the armor use a laminated wood for armor which burns under intense heat and is a excellent fuel source.when the invading troops die their eyes melt in their sockets and interestingly no one will touch the bodies. they will put flags there and walk away and professionals will come and pick them up. israel has the neutron bomb tech which can be used in short nuclear pulses of a few miles radius. it kills all living things but will leave the vehicles. the bodies though would be radio active and need professional cleaning up.their is a youtube video below if your interested.god said as a test to see if he was the real god was to see if he told you the end from the beginning. he said let the other guys do that. if you look into prophecy you will find out it comes true just like he said, no one comes even close to having a record like god.

eu document #666 creates the antichrists office





the following is a article that talks about the antichrist.  recently the eu made the most powerful office in its history with weu document number 666. yes really, document #666!  i had to look it up on the eu site to believe it. (see post below) this office is in charge of eu security and will have use of the eu army in 2010.    one of his jobs is to make 7 year agreements with all the nations that insure the eu's interest.     the eu in europe is the revived roman empire that prophecy speaks about. this last world ruling empire will produce the antichrist. (the ten toes in daniels vision) he will come from europe from rome reborn and sign a peace treaty with israel for seven years that will start the worst period in all of human history, the tribulation, jacobs trouble. it will last for seven years. during that time 1/4 of the worlds population dies, then of what is left another 1/3 rd dies. 1/3 of all fresh water is gone. it will be the worst time ever. the next event on the prophetic calendar is something called the rapture. at that time all christians looking for the rapture will be taken off the earth. below is the article. taken from (http://fulfilledprophecy.com/read_rec_666.html)friends, i believe the stage may be set for the events of the seventieth week foretold by daniel the prophet. in the old testament book of daniel we read: and he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week (seven years), but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate (daniel 9:27 new america standard bible). it is commonly believed the passage above foretells the rise of a strong leader from out of a revived roman empire who will make a seven-year covenant with israel, which he will violate 3 1/2 years later. in other passages from daniel, we learn this leader will rise from among a 10-nation alliance (daniel 7:7-8). and, in the new testament book of revelation, we learn he will somehow be connected to the number 666 (revelation 13: 18). this appears to be exactly what we're seeing. as i've been reporting, a 10-nation alliance did appear on january 1, 1995. it's a 10-nation military alliance known as the western european union (weu). these nations are members of both nato and the european union (eu). what binds these 10 nations together is their mutual defense obligation under the modified brussels treaty. they are also known as the brussels treaty powers. in december of 1998, at their vienna summit, the eu's heads created the new office of high representative of common foreign and security policy for the european union. the holder of this office would be empowered by the member states to directed their common foreign policy toward russia, ukraine and the mediterranean. the legal document that created this office was numbered 666. in november 1999, javier solana, the former head of nato, became the first person to hold this powerful new position. he was also made secretary general of the council of europe. this is the main decision making body of the eu. the following month, solana also became the secretary general of the 10-nation weu alliance. these three positions made solana a very powerful new player on the world scene. on june 5, 2000, the weu adopted its assembly recommendation 666. the following month france, one of the 10 weu nations, took over the eu's six month rotating presidency. it was immediately announced that the assembly of the weu would become the temporary assembly for the eu's new 10-nation military wing. keep in mind, this is the same body that adopted recommendation 666. the infamous solana decision soon followed. this decision removed from public view all documents that the council (solana) thought should be kept secret. this move was interpreted by some to be a military coup. looking back, it's obvious to me that's what may have occurred -- a 10-nation takeover of the eu. and, it was done implementing recommendation 666. these were amazing events and i detail them all in my book. and, also in my book, i often state that if these events were what i though they were -- fulfillments of bible prophecy -- then they would lead to a seven-year agreement with israel. well, that may be exactly what we're now seeing. you see, the eu's new constitution, combined with the eu's neighborhood policy (enp) and the seven-year european neighborhood policy and instrument (enpi), may set the stage perfectly for the events of the seventieth week. unlike the us who's military is the primary weapon in the war against terror, the eu's primary weapon is economic. solana's european neighborhood policy (enp) is the eu's way of exercising its influence and is part of solana's new security doctrine. it is primarily aimed at russia, ukraine and the mediterranean. the enp is a huge package of different types of deals for each participating nation. it also includes tailored action plans for each country and a monitoring program. and, these many deals and plans have different terms. here's where the seven-year element comes in. the eu has a seven-year budget term. so, solana has been tasked with drawing up a new funding instrument for his enp that will take over when the eu's new term begins on january 1, 2007. this new instrument is called the european neighborhood instrument (enpi). it is basically solana's new budget when he becomes super foreign minister and commission vice president. it's goal is to finance solana's foreign policy objectives. starting on january 1, 2007, the enpi will begin funding all the action plans and deals for all these many nations. the long-term plans will be up to seven years. again, there will be monitoring and reporting mid-term. a total review is to be completed by december 31, 2011. it's a covenant with many. and, it's for seven-years.  besides the extended powers provided solana -- powers that will rival the new eu presidency -- the constitution of rome sets a headline goal of 2010 for all solana's civilian and military peace-keeping/peace-making capabilities to be deployable. these broad-ranging assets including 9 battle groups, heavy lift aircraft, aircraft carrier, satellite communications and much more. here's the way i see it: beginning on january 1, 2007, solana will have a huge expense account with which he can implement his enp foreign and security policy for seven years. and, it's not hard to see how solana's covenant with many could easily fall apart. if so, it's also not hard to see how solana's emergency powers could be evoked 3 1/2 years later in 2010  when all his civilian and military capabilities are in place. it's also easy to see how solana could receive emergency authority to act for the remaining 3 1/2 years of the seven-year term. and, this could lead to the final events of this age that are described in both daniel and revelation. friends, the stage may be set for the seventieth week of daniel. are you walking with jesus yet?

prophecy is a light in this dark world





2 peter 1:19 (contemporary english version)all of this makes us even more certain that what the prophets said is true. so you should pay close attention to their message,as you would to a lamp shining in some dark place. you must keep on paying attention until daylight comes and the morning star rises in your hearts.

if you ask for a digg will you get one





this is a little experiment to see if you ask for a digg will you get one. i thought it would be interesting to see if you could actually ask for a digg and get it or if it will be ignored. just a little social experiment purely for fun.

interesting comment





here is a comment from a guest, its interesting, take a look.cumnsoon  to timjordan more options mar 26 (14 hours ago) time to wake up, everybody! there is a strong possibility that the rapture will be sometime this year [2006], since solana's 7-yr. neighborhood policy (covenant)with israel/plo/eu starts january 1, 2007 and he will be able to command the mighty eu armies by 2010, coincidentally when the us pentagon anticipates a war with china. of significant note: that would also be 3 to 3-1/2 yrs. into the great tribulation period, which is the mid-way point prophesied for when the antichrist breaks his peace covenant and the worst begins to happen leading to armageddon and the 2nd coming of "the champion!" [aka jesus christ] get happy - the 2nd coming is within viewing range.

"from poland will come a the spark that will prepare the world for my final coming"





i am not big on prophecy that doesn't come from the bible but i thought this snippet was interesting.annunciations: april 2005: "'from poland will come a the spark that will prepare the world for my final coming'i read these words from st. faustina's diary that were spoken to her by jesus back in 1978. they were published before anyone had even thought of a polish pope, but somehow one knew that jesus was referring to this pope and twenty six years later the spark has spread it's fire throughout the world and the devotion to the divine mercy is one of the most popular."

many nations converting to the euro





the european unions currency is destined to be the worlds standard. many countries that are hostile to the us are converting their currency because they dont want the us to have leverage over them by freezing thier assests. as you are reading this iran and syria along with many others are converting all their banking deposits into euros and away from the us dollar. the reason being stated to hide their funds from the possibility of the us freezing them. but there is a more sinister plot going on behind the scenes. hal lindsay hits the nail on the head in this report http://www.hallindseyoracle.com/articles.asp?articleid=12477 (see article below).  what iran is now doing is breaking with opec and establishing its own oil exchange called iob (iranian oil burse). for the first time all of europe can purchase oil with the euro instead of the dollar. with europe as their largest oil customers it will be much easier for them and cheaper, possibly as much as 25% cheaper. this new plan of the iranians is scheduled to go into effect this march. this will of course boost the euro and cause a crisis for the us dollar. the bottom line is easy to see, this will destroy the us dollar and the economy.
