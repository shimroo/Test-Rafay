due to health reasons we will not be offering charters on pipe dream this season.  we hope to see you all again next summer.  you can still contact capt. bob rice for small boat instruction at 49windguru@gmail.com 



welcome aboard pipe dream, a southern cross 39, she’s a beautiful cutter-rigged classic. she is ruggedly built and a proven bluewater passage maker. at cape sail we offer private sailing charters, sunset charters, and a variety of learn-to-sail programs from beginner to advanced, including customized alternatives to the traditional sailing school.  whether you are interested in a half-day sail boat charter, an overnight to the islands or in gaining the confidence and competence to skipper your own boat, our captains have the patience, experience and skill to meet your needs.
