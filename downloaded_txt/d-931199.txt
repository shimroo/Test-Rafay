	if you don't mind doing so at your own risk. when planning your vacation schedule, keep maine in mind!

find out more at www.loringtiming.com


for exact current price and availability in real time  for all parts in our system by part number, just click on the red button below and follow the directions, entering part numbers in the correct format, as we do not currently produce a pricelist due to their becoming obsolete immediately due to prices and 
	availability changing constantly. if you do not have a partsbook, we can sell you one if we are advised of motorcycle serial numbers.

	notice:
we have had some gremlins intermittently frolicking lately in the "price &
availability lookup by part number" feature on our website.
please remember we will always confirm correct price and availability before
shipping any phone, fax, or email orders.
thanks for your patience while we get this resolved, and continue to work on
developing a better website,
	- mark, and the britcycle crew

	please do not email us requesting shipping quotes, as we are unable to calculate this until an order is actually, picked, packed, weighed, and measured, which we cannot do until it is placed and fully processed. if 
	you are paying by paypal, you can send us payment for parts total, and we 
	will then email back when order is ready to ship with how much to send in a 
	second payment for shipping, insurance, (and sales tax for canadian and 
	maine customers).

we have what you need - not counting used and items not yet listed, we have 27,877 part numbers in our system. our 
	maine warehouse contains 195,013 individual new parts and accessories on our computer. 
the canadian warehouse contains 143,050 individual new parts and accessories. 
in total, that's 338,063 individual parts in our computerized inventory, with more being added every day.

tradition of free tech help and friendly review of each customer's individual 
requirements that was begun in 1977 continues unchanged.
