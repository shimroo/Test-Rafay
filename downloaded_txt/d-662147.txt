flight of contradiction and spite___x 




















the humble and righteous and meek
are teaching me who's will to seek
but who really knows how to speak
about these things

questions of where can he go
when he is feeling so low
and kicking himself just to show
how he still bleeds

and i want to know the difference between
what sparkles and what is gold

i wonder how many eyes
are fixed like a vulture's on me
now i wonder if i can even move or breathe
without disappointing someone

and i know what they call themselves
but i don't remember inviting them
to put me on this pedastal
and make me feel so naked

afraid to look down
afraid to turn around

i bring it on myself
i know i bring it on myself

and i want to know the difference between
what sparkles and what is gold

woit!!got big fat 0 for my lab test today. cos i entered some wrong command and the rest of the pcs in the lab were affected. in the end the lecturer dulan lo..say byebye to me. and to make things worse all me close mates have gone for their attachments...so boring lo...arghhh fuccckkkk.anyway, the chap marahs had a national education trip last sunday night. to the whore headquarters in geylang la. where else? and nonono..no fucking, no screwing and no casual sex. it was strictly for educational purposes okay. we started walking at ard 8..b4 that mio was oh so excited about checking out whores i was starting to worry about him being a potential customer there in the future. quite an eye opener i must say. the, tight, smelly bends around the lorongs, pimps coaxing us to try out their chicken(some even willing to give student price..like wtf?!), whores with thick make-up and ultra skimpy clothing "lelong-ing" themselves, porn vcd stalls and that particular spot where there's indian whores with sari's negiotiating with their indian customers..walao that area like little keling siak..we planning to have another national education trip again this coming weekend, this time changi village. fresco!had a chat with this dude at beats with raihan on saturday. he was telling us abt his four years in the uk and how gr8 it was.was kinda fascinated lo, especially when he talks about how unified and established the underground scene was at there. it was a normal sight to see skinheads and punks boozing together(which is so wrong..haha) and goth chicks with fishnet stockings and pink hair driving around the streets of leeds in a mini cooper. wahhh.he told us that he's planing to go back ther one day and ask if we would like to tag along..pay only the air fare as accomodation and transport we don have to worry. yes2 it can just be empty words but no harm being optimistic about it what. hoho.

smile that kind of icy blue smile of a noon day reckoningthe tied together of two tell-tale picturesi've sketched in sand castle plots and planssimilar starting points, both for sin and shooting blanksbut it's always the unseen sharp pang the awkward rhythm of the dance like a tick-tock clock in that heart of gearts repeating, "there is no happy here" "there is no happy here""there is no happy here""there is no happy here"devil may care touches trickled downspine, thigh, and breastmay never truly illuminatethe finer art of heartwork.i was turning over with the sheetsand facing the arched back thinking of how my eyes, half-openedcaught her arm moving from side to side, but never to me. it's all connected by blank words to tell empty promises of clumsy miscommunication. so we say what we will to see what we may to find a biblical knowingenfolded within the next few hours.it's too bad, too tragici spent myself choking on the motionsleading up to said misfortune.

woit!!!its so fucking scratching my pissed off bone when people say that older men tend to be more mature. bullshit. they've been given the oh-i've-my-first-fuck-when-you-guys-were-still-sucking-on-your-mum-tits status just becos they lived longer then us. yes by default humans become more wiser as they get older but as far i see it..its soooo fucking untrue..well all i say is tat u narrow-minded bitches who's eyeing for older men because they are more "mature" shld just get go kill yourselves because u hoes are soo dumb..here's a good example.there lived 3 dumbfucks who has a band that goes by the name unclassified identity. the ----> 24 <---- year old vocalist a.k.a the chong in matrip terms and his lackeys(or dogs), guitarist brother and bassist gay partner. k lets just turn the spotlight on the vocalist. he's 24. should be mature rite? not! k picture this. u go into a frens blog. then u read a particular post. i bet at first 1st glance ur sure that that post is not intended for you rite? but apparently mr vocalist doesn seem to understand english or he simply just shiok sendiri and he whole heartedly thinks that that post was meant for him. even after countless explainations he still don get the fucking picture? y becos it was in english! musibot! wonder how can he pass his 'o' when his english is so psle! must be he suck the marker's dick or sumth. but then its so ridiculous la..no matter how rotten he's english is, he's 24! surely there must be sumth inside that 24 year old brain that can make him understand! but apparently zilch! nothing. he decided to be a sappyfuck and start hurling hate smses cos he's hurt...awww poor thing...wana suck dick? and then he took it out on the (ex)drummer, who was also the blogger's sister. errr...hello? where the professionalism, bitch? if your mature enuff, you should put aside personal matters and don drag it into the band! but then nooooo. and wat in barney's purple dick does immaturity come into the picture? and from a dumbfuck mouth like him somemore! he accuse people of being immature?! so contradicting la fuck! oh yaaa...ego. that testicular fortitude of his is so large that he can't afford to be brought down. cos he's 24 ma. just break up la guys. its a waste of time. at the rate u guys are going, i tink uid will disappear into oblivion in no time.

this life in my box lets you turn the keywhen u want to hear a melodystuff to be associated with beat merchants- this big ugly pooch who is not leashed up by the undertaker owner.  loves scratching its nuts.- the 3 side-by-side murtabak shops thats constantly battling for customers.  i have a feeling that one day there's going to be a big quarrel between them  and for sure murtabaks and pratas will start hurling in the air. me, as a member   of the public, would just mind my own business and instead concentrate on catching   the hurling murtabaks onto the plate i brought from home. free food la sia.- yassir, the owner who never grew up.- the teh tarik and the 2 bucks mixed rice from the sarbat stall at busorah street.- the filling sandwiches at mosi cafe. pay special attention to the sardine and  potato with moroccan chilli sandwich. sounds kinda harmless but just one bite of   this blissful shit will have your tongue and anus cursing at ya.- pharell williams and jessica alba.- pharell williams and jessica alba??- some pig skinned bastard who switch on the fan to 3 even when the air con is   switched on to full blast.- a black couch with a crater in the middle.- fauzi, the brillant mathematician with a fetish for young mums and rock chicks with  tight asses.- raihan, ex-topshop model, now a spokesperson for beat merc.jammed as sdv for 2 hours yesterday. great da. was havin so much fun, didn realised two hours pass by so fast. reli stress buster. b4 that, some band from the fuckin rockstar crew who broke the small room door when they organised the trendy gig quite recently was there. becos of these fuckers, yassir omost banned gigs from happening in beat merc.

well here i ami don't know how to say thisthe only thing i knowis awkward silencethursday nite thrash was great. went with raihan, abu and yassir. when we reached ther, subtle revenge was halfway thru. break after that then vitamin x was next.and the crowd went wild. continous moshing, circle pits and surfing on sweaty bodies thoughout. was honoured to be launched into the air and onto a swarm of moshing torsos by rahmat from jahilia. reli enjoyed the gig. sadly, i reckon that its going to be quite some time gigs like this will happen again. cos now gigs are mostly catered to the trendy bastards out there(you know who u are)who emphasise the meaning of "mosh" as "to fight", who give this fucking "rockstar" look even thou they have participated in only 1 miserable gig. and fuckers who adopts this attitude like "we oways perform gigs. we are popular. we hang out the coolness of the coolness people. who the fuck are you? i've nvr seen you b4. so get the fuck outta my face". this is singapore, for fucking macaroni's sake. adopting this fucking rockstar shit is useless.

crazy girl was so excited that she can watch r21 movies. would it be better if she just watch porn? sheesh maids....anyway b4 she came, ice box, brad pitt and the midgety one went to carrefour and bought for her a cheesecake, nuttella and these sunflower seeds coated in candy. yea, a d.i.y cake. cos our pockets were kinda hollow at this time and we also noticed that when everytime a cake is bought for a person's birthday, its always not eaten finished. ice box painstakingly spread nuttella over the cake and add the sunflower seeds to make a shape of a heart...aww...and brad pitt held a lit lighter on top of the cake and ask lenny to blow it. yes, its a bit sengket but hey i'm sure that lenny will appreciate our efforts whole heartedly. i didn the expect the cake to taste so marvellously good. sunflower seeds, nuttella and cheesecake make a peerrrfect combination. then stabbing da vinci went jamming later at beat merchants. kinda cocked up i would say..we played only 2 songs instead of the usual 5 cos raihan's guitar sounds kinda weird and azar forgot his drumming for some of the songs...but hey theres bout to be some cock up sessions la...it all part and parcel of makin music.had a great conversation with ismu from 7 pound vein two days ago. they can be considered veterans of the local scene la havin been around for quite sometime now.we shared our thoughts about the local scene as well as music in general. a good chap i must say. he told me that ns is a time wher my passion for music is tested becos of the time constraints and also committments to make. i respect his band and local bands like recover and stompin' ground(considered the pioneers of lion city hardcore havin been around since 1989) for their still active involvement in the local scene. it tells me that they are really passionate in making music and i hope i can have that much passion as them. i was also told the value of humility and respect for other bands for the local scene is already very small and having a distaste for other bands won help. ismu then told me that he was planning to hold a gig next year and stabbing da vinci was first on the list. i don want to put hope into it but i was deeply honoured when he said that considering his status as a veteran in the local scene.(to ismu: if you're reading this, i know u don't like being labeled a veteran cos it makes u feel old and stuff, but i can't help it la. lol)

made some new frens in the dudes from a band , ceramic circle. a bunch of pretty boys who played progressive emo ala mineral and penfold with a tinge of radiohead. had a music discussion with azhar the macho, oj abu and them. mostly about bands, persons who made an impact in the underground scene and the ideologies behind the genres discussed.i love having this so-called music discussions. i mostly keep quiet, and just listen attentively. of course, i don brag and stuff cos i want to listen rather than speak, but in some cases, i do point out my views too.  yea, kinda lucky to have frens who have deep knowledge and understanding abt the underground scene and genres, and oso some less well-known genres la, like trip-hop.followers. the imitators of the underground scene. they make music a trend. ok...lets see...there was this time when being a skinhead was a hype. walk to penin on weekends and u can see groups of "skinheads". kids who has just started puberty or just some plain ol matrip loitering around with their doc marts, fred perry polos and ultra-tapered jeans. then after awhile the trend died out. next comes the rudeboy/rudegirl hype. walk down to penin on weekends and u can c kids with coats and ties. then after awhile they get tired of it and the trend also died out. the same pattern revolves around punk and now its the core/"screamo"/metal hype. u've got gals and boys wearing unbelievably thick mascara, have the good charlotte fashion sense, listen to common bands like cannibal corpse or cradle of filth for the metaltits, the used for the emotation kids and as i lay dying or atreyu for the "yea-look-at-me-i'm-hardcore!! grr!!" fakers. they go to gigs, they mosh...cos their friends would think of them as the coolest of the coolest dudes around. popularity. being a hardcore kid or some other genre u want to label urself as doesn mean that u must listen to only songs of that particular genre or other trendy genres. remember, beneath all those make-up and stupid dress code, u are still a person. a human being. jazz, latin, funk or even some classical music doesn hurt abit. instead it broadens ur knowledge abt music.

well i was actually looking forward to today, but then the date was cancelled. so i switched to plan b, which is to just sk8 myself crazy....but...i woke up tis morning and my saw tat my right foot was swollen and painful. must be due to me landing awkwardly while atempting a 5-0 yesterday. so i limp my ass to mum's crib. ok, in the bus....the conductor came...i give him my ticket....and he told me wher i was gng...i told him my destination and then he said, "i'm sorry but ur fare is not enuff, lu kene bayar lagi 1.40". nonono...i'm freaking sure i paid the correct fare, even ask the damn driver if it is correct! and u tell me to pay extra? 1.40+1.40= 2.80!! thats cow manure!! daylight robbery!! dissatisfied, i brought the conductor to meet the bus driver..i said "uncle, tadi lu ckp wa nye duit bas betul kan?" and guess wat he said? "tak, tak, gua tak tau". make love. vagina kid. reli wana take my deck and give him a good smack to his pocky face..but being the idiot that i am, i left the bus to avoid cr8ting a scene.later in the day, it started to rain. freaking thunderstorm. a mini katrina. rotten penises. so just rot the day away lo...only looking forward to jam as xsdvx later.well, the day was not all manure and no flowers la. watched this movie on ch 5."in time of the butterflies" is the title. it tells the story of the mirabal sisters...patria mercedes mirabal, antonia maria teresa mirabal and minerva argentina mirabal. the sisters grew up in a high class, well-cultured environment. all became married, family women. when the then dominican republic ruler, rafael leónidas trujillo came to power, their family lost almost all of their fortune. the sisters believed that trujillo would send their country into economic chaos and eventually formed a group of opponents to the trujillo regime. it was known as the movement of the fourteenth of june. inside that group, they were known as las mariposas ("the butterflies" in spanish). the sisters were incarcerated and tortured on several occasions. despite these setbacks, they persisted fighting to try to end trujillo's dictatorship. after the sisters' numerous imprisonments, trujillo decided to exterminate the sisters. on november 25, 1960, he sent men to intercept the three women after they visited their husbands in prison. the unarmed sisters were led into a sugarcane field, then beaten and strangled to death. trujillo thought that this was the final solution in thier deaths but, instead it created a public outrage, and trujillo himself was asassinated.the sisters sacrifice for their country will alway in remembered and 25 november, which is the date the sisters was murdered was made the international day for the elimination of violence against women in commemoration for their sacrifice.

dear friendsone child in the commercial sex trade is one child too many. but clearly there is more than one.  estimates are hard to come by, but here are some that give a sense of scale to this abuse.unicef estimates two million children (mainly girls) worldwide are exploited in the multi-billion dollar commercial sex industry. unicef-supported studies indicate that some 1.2 million children around the globe are trafficked every year. approximately one-third of all trafficking in women and children takes place from and within east asia region. one ofthe main demand drivers is the commercial sex trade.the problems that lead to supply are complex, multifaceted and need to be addressed - poverty, lack of education, abuse and discrimination, war and displacement, etc.but what about demand? if there is no demand for the sexual services of children, then there will be no supply.where does this demand come from?  as a country, singapore is as culpable as any other. we cannot say this is not our problem.more needs to be done to stop demand. no one can do this alone - action is needed from businesses, government and the community. we have a collective responsibility.please take the time to read and sign this online petition. <-----(click here) and please forward this on to as many people as possible.yea...cge me blogskin agn. the picture on the left is actually a picture of a rose and a crow. the rose represents tranquility, love and basically everything that is good ...while the crow is represents bad luck, evil, being a jinx..so the pic is actually a convergence between good and evil...much like a person. they can either choose to be good or the exact opposite....sis finally has a job. am happy for her. she's been struggling to get a stable and decent job ever since she finished her nitec. dammit she don deserve this...i hate my past...i hate it...becos its affecting my present life and for sure my future...things wouldn have been wat it is now if my past is not that shady....

this is acually an article taken from a website dedicated to the local underground scene...just read it and c that what the writer is trying to prove is actually true.why i love singapore  quite crime free i can leave the house at 3am to get a snack without fear. cleanlinessat least i know, a dab of perfume is enough so i won't smell as i step on the streets. why i hate singapore gumalthough i don't really like gum, isn't it unreasonable that you ban gum because someone keeps getting the mrt's door stuck by disposing the gum there? instead of banning it, why not educate them? moral of the story: don't get caught bringing gum over to singapore. cigarette box sizes i use to smoke less than 10 sticks a day. as the price increases, i don't feel pinch as i purchase my next pack. they think that by not importing the small packets (10 sticks) it stops people from smoking because the bigger packet of cigarettes are more expensive. that is just plain rubbish. i realize that after they brought about this rule, i ended up smoking more. now i smoke at least 20 sticks a day. moral of the story: sheesa is good too. art hubi can't film a documentary on singapore politics. i can't write a script that includes youth speaking their mind. i can't produce a play that has slightest hint of homosexuality. people have been fined & jailed due to this. and yet you want us to express our thoughts and create an art hub in singapore. quite contradictory isn't it? moral of the story: stick to cartoon network. pampered singaporeansyou guys don't know how lucky you are. i can't think of any government that is willing to help you that much. if you live in indonesia, i don't think you would dare to leave your house at 3 am in the morning. you have to own a gun if you are living in philippines just in case of robberies. moral of the story: singapore is boring. live with it. money system singaporea meeting was held at mom with my boss. we asked if our boss going to attend the meeting. the momers said that they have send a letter to him but it is up to him if he wants to attend the meeting. i asked if he is in singapore, she said yes as the passport has been taken away. so here we are, as 19 of my colleagues are scheduled in the first meeting and my other 16 colleagues and i are scheduled in the second meeting, we are just waiting for an answer and our 2 months pay. guess what? our boss didn't turn up. and each of us had to pay $3 for the meeting, which no one told us about in the first place. 19 + 6 = 35 people. 35 people x $3 = $105 for 15 minutes of waiting in the room to be told that our boss is not coming. a week later, one of the shareholders informs someone that our boss is actually back in london. he even gave us his london address and phone number. moral of the story: quit your job when you realize your pay is late. education systemi remember very clearly once that an em1 student was making fun of the em3 students. of course, it ended up in a fight. guess who got the blame? em3 students. at the age of 10, students have streaming to categorize them. isn't that a bit degrading? and this causes the children to have low self-esteem. and when we thought that is all over, we are categorizing it again in secondary schools. i have a friend who is really amazing at maths but ended up in normal technical because he didn't do well in other subjects. so how do you push a student to excel in their best subjects when they are not giving the students a chance? moral of the story: if you want your children to have low self-esteem, singapore is the place for you.
