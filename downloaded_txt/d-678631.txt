purpose
‘nyttig virksomhed’ is at the core of everything we do

‘nyttig virksomhed’ builds on our founder a.p. møller’s life goal of being useful in the context of society, which can take many forms from building windmills to improving healthcare, and every company in the a.p. moller group contributes to this purpose in their own way.



















“... the ultimate aim is not so much a high dividend distribution, as the build-up of useful activities.”
a.p. møller, 1953
