physics








all of the technological achievements we rely on daily, from power generation to transportation and communication, are based on our understanding of the physical laws of nature. to maintain and improve humankind’s standard of living, it is imperative that we continue to study nature and gain a better understanding of its laws. the department of physics is committed to this process of creating and disseminating new knowledge, and to preserving the knowledge created by previous generations of physicists, through the principle of combining research with teaching.
