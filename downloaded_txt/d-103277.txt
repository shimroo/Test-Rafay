"and you
shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." john 8:32
 

 
for the
message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to
us who are being saved it is the power of god. 1 corinthians 1:18
 
for it
pleased the father that in him all the fullness should dwell, and by
him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on earth
or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of his cross.
colossians 2:19-20
 
for by grace
you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is a
gift of god, not of works, lest anyone should boast. for we are his
workmanship, created in christ jesus for good works, which god prepared
beforehand that we should walk in them.  ephesians 2:8-10.

i am
endeavoring to lead men, women, and children out of bad religions and
into a full relationship with the father, by way of the son, and
through the indwelling of the holy spirit.  i am also endeavoring
to build up the children of god in the christian faith and encouraging
christians to step out in faith to be a witness for jesus christ in
word and in deed.


 
for you are
all sons of god through faith in christ jesus. galatians 3:26

the
christian gospel or good news
 
moreover,
brethren, i declare to you the gospel which i preached to you, which
also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved,
if you hold fast that word which i preached to youunless you believed
in vain. for i delivered to you first of all that which i also
received: that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,
and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according
to the scriptures, and that he was seen by cephas, then by the twelve.
1 corinthians 15:1-5
 

jesus christ
died for our sins.
 
for when we
were still without strength, in due time christ died for the ungodly.
for scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good
man someone would even dare to die. but god demonstrates his own love
toward us, in that while we were still sinners, christ died for us.
much more then, having now been justified by his blood, we shall be
saved from wrath through him. for if when we were enemies we were
reconciled to god through the death of his son, much more, having been
reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. and not only that, but we
also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ, through whom we have
now received the reconciliation. romans 5:6-11.
 

jesus christ
was buried.
 
but jesus
answered them, saying, "the hour has come that the son of man
should be glorified. most assuredly, i say to you, unless a grain
of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it
dies, it produces much grain." john 12:23-24
 

jesus christ
rose again the third day.
 
paul, a
bondservant of jesus christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the
gospel of god which he promised before through his prophets in the holy
scriptures, concerning his son jesus christ our lord, who was born of
the seed of david according to the flesh, and declared to be the son of
god with power according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection
from the dead. romans 1:1-4.

the grace of
the lord jesus christ, and the love of god, and the fellowship of the
holy spirit be with you all. amen.  2 corinthians 13:14
 
in christ
alone
 
in christ
alone my hope is found
he is my
light my strength my song
this
cornerstone this solid ground
firm through
the fiercest drought and storm
what heights
of love what depths of peace
when fears
are stilled when strivings cease
my comforter
my all in all
here in the
love of christ i stand
 
in christ
alone who took on flesh
fullness of
god in helpless babe
this gift of
love and righteousness
scorned by
the ones he came to save
till on that
cross as jesus died
the wrath of
god was satisfied
for every
sin on him was laid
here in the
death of christ i live
 
there in the
ground his body lay
light of the
world by darkness slain
then
bursting forth in glorious day
up from the
grave he rose again
and as he
stands in victory
sin's curse
has lost its grip on me
for i am his
and he is mine
bought with
the precious blood of christ
 
no guilt in
life no fear in death
this is the
power of christ in me
from life's
first cry to final breath
jesus
commands my destiny
no power of
hell no scheme of man
can ever
pluck me from his hand
till he
returns or calls me home
here in the
power of christ i'll stand
