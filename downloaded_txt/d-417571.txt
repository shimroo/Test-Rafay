        andrew corl 13:19 03 oct 22   this cruise was so much fun and relaxing.  the captain and crew were great at getting the passengers involved in operating the boat, hoisting the sails, and steering the boat.  even though it was a cloudy and windy day it was great to be sailing on the bay. yes we would return again.         karen holyfield 21:45 11 jul 22   i loved the crew! you can't fake personality and true love for what you do. i booked in advance and used the link in the info email to help me find parking since i'm from out of town. we were introduced to the crew and given safety instructions. they explained everything that was going on in sailing terms and layman's terms. i actually got to steer the boat (not well, but...) so the pic attached isn't just a prop! i also got to help hoist a sail! the water was great, the crew was phenomenal and very knowledgeable about the area (thanks, sofia, for the best ice cream in annapolis tip! it was great! definitely would do this again and again!         zach johnson 21:59 08 aug 22   first time on a sailboat i must say the group that was with us had a blast. beautiful little cruise with lots of good memories. the crew was very tentative to any needs we had. definitely would recommend and do it again. safe travels         brad miller 20:58 21 jul 22   booked the sunset cruise as part of a birthday gift. we got lucky with perfect weather and a wonderful sunset. the cruise was amazing and the crew was wonderful!

went on a sunday brunch music cruise with many friends and two amazing artists. the crew was friendly and fun. i'd never been on a "sailboat" before, i was nervous. we had the best weather we could have asked for, but i think it would have been great even in rain or cold or hot.         cheyenne mills 14:55 16 may 23   had a fantastic time! the crew was awesome! i highly recommend mondays because they typically don't sell out and u get extra room! the crew interacts with you and asks if anyone would like to help raise the sails or would like to steer! i highly recommend this tour!         y. k. 13:35 15 jun 23   my husband and i had a great time on wednesday night racing tour at annapolis. it was our first experience with woodwind tours and we absolutely loved it!         peggy smith 14:38 15 jun 23   absolutely loved being part of the regatta races on june 14th, 2023.  the woodwind wins and the crew of the woodwind were amazing.  thank you for making my husband's birthday so extra special!         diane stevens 17:13 27 jun 23   we went on a  schooner boat ride as part of my fiance's family reunion and had a wonderful time! the captain and all hands on deck were friendly, knowledgeable and took very good care of us. we were worried that we may encounter rain, but the whole 3 hour tour was enjoyable!         jill scherling 13:04 24 jul 23   phenomenal sunset cruise with capt. andy and crew. he was personable and knowledgeable; sharing information about the harbor and the chesapeake bay. saw several boat races going on and our captain explained what would be taking place with each of the boats. great cocktails on board, too.         aubrey winum 12:41 30 jul 23   we had a great time sailing with captain jen! the crew were so friendly & knowledgeable, we even got to help raise the sails and steer the boat! it was a lot of fun seeing the area from water & the experience of sailing. we went on the sunset sail where we were lucky to have a beautiful night!         timothy white 13:23 03 aug 23   we went to spend the day in annapolis and popped by the information station. we inquired about cruises and this one caught our attention. i have done design work on the mansion featured in ‚Äúwedding crashers‚Äù. when i heard the schooner was too, i thought serendipitously we must take this boat!we booked in the early afternoon, tuesday august 1st. the weather was perfect to sail!an added bonus - there are beer tastings on tuesday!!jen and her team were very attentive and made the trip enjoyable.         harry rieth 12:58 03 aug 23   was a great trip and capt. andy, michael & nellie were wonderful.  they made sure everyone was safe, kept us informed and answered our questions.  we couldn't have asked for better weather.  would definitely do it again.         k stake 15:52 31 aug 23   we had a wonderful time aboard the woodwind ii. the captain and crew were all very friendly and welcoming. i had trouble finding the check-in location but when i walked to the dock, i was taken care of. we were out for a full 2 hours. weather was beautiful (which they have no control over.). i would highly recommend this activity.         jacob b. (jakeycakes) 13:12 23 sep 23   absolutely wonderful experience.  captain jen and her crew took us for the perfect 2 hour ride and even chased the sunset as it was cloudy until this stunning surprise (see pictures) over annapolis. pre-order beers or bubbly to enhance the experience. be prepared to get a little sea spray and enjoy the ride!         helen c 22:21 24 sep 23   great cruise with really friendly informative crew. opportunities to assist the crew, on board drinks at reasonable prices and a loyalty programme. we had a great trip out into the bay and were treated to a fantastic sunset üåÖ         ashley scott 15:07 02 oct 23   my husband and i went on the mid-day sail at 1:30pm and it was great.in our case, the weather was perfect so there was minimal chop + a nice light breeze made for a great outting. the crew was welcoming and not overly enthusiastic which we preferred. if you have ever been on a disney cruise or something similar, that "forced fun" and fake enthusiasm is awful. the crew of the woodwind ii were all genuinely enthusiastic and upbeat. overall it was a pleasant day out on the bay.we learned a lot about the bay and connecting rivers, and meeting others on the boat was an added bonus. we will definitely sail with them again no doubt.(there is a restroom on board if you were panicking about your bladders capacity)         chris jensen 17:42 14 apr 24   the absolute best way to see and appreciate annapolis.  the crew is professional and fun; the schooner is beautiful.  we go whenever we have guests in town. yesterday was the first sail of the season and the wind was howling -- no better place to enjoy it than on the woodwind.         kelsey stout 19:50 14 apr 24   the opening day of sailing was incredible with schooner woodwind! had a great time from start to finish - captains and crew were kind, welcoming, and involved the guests in the experience hands on! i will definitely go again and recommend this tour!         georgij nikonov 12:27 02 oct 22   highly recommend this experience for not only those visiting the area, but locals who are entertaining their guests and are seeking something else other than a boring crowded museum. this is my third time doing this, and it‚Äôs simply magical! crew is entertaining, captain is highly knowledgeable about the area and the bay, history, etc. they have really good beer selection on deck. i do want to try wine tasting cruise as well! again, a super fun way to spend the evening!         steve smalley 18:47 23 may 24   the weather wasn‚Äôt fabulous, but being out on the water cruising under an overcast sky was still great. the captain made everyone feel welcome and a useful part of the crew. no big winds, but a delightful cruise around the bay and into the evening.         jessica 15:29 20 may 24   schooner woodwind sailing cruises proved to be the ultimate venue for our bachelorette escapade. as we boarded, the friendly crew welcomed us with warm smiles and a great sense of excitement. the spacious deck accommodated our party with ease, allowing us to mingle, eat, drink and soak in the beauty of the ocean.the ability to purchase drinks on board added an extra touch of indulgence to our experience. they offered a great variety of beers, wine, champagne and other drinks. one free non-alcoholic beverage was offered with every ticket.we had the opportunity to steer the boat and capture some great pictures. the woodwind crew went above and beyond to capture our memories. moreover, the smooth sailing conditions made for a comfortable and enjoyable ride.overall, our experience with schooner woodwind sailing cruises exceeded all expectations, providing the perfect blend of adventure, relaxation, and celebration. for any group seeking a memorable outing in annapolis, a sailing cruise with woodwind is an absolute must.         karl hanson 13:10 28 may 24   this was a great experience.  i would highly recommend this activity.  the captain and crew were great!  the ride was smooth.  the boat is slick n sick!         vickie sd 12:39 03 jun 24   taking a ride on a sailboat was an experience we wanted to take on our mother/daughter getaway to annapolis. the weather was perfect for this adventure being sunny, bright and clear. captain delaney and crew were accommodating, helpful and provided us with information about the area and the sailboat. passengers were able to assist with hoisting the sails and steering if they wanted. our ride left annapolis waterfront and sailed out to the chesapeake bay bridge. it was the highlight of our weekend!         victoria connell 20:29 02 jun 24   i had a wonderful time! the crew - captain delaney, andrew and sophia - were super relaxed but obviously knew what they were doing and ran the whole operation like pros which allowed me to relax. the boat was in excellent condition, either very new or just very well maintained. had a fabulous two hours out on the water. my only suggestion would be seat cushions of some kind to make our bums a little comfier while we‚Äôre relaxing.         amy tilow 11:25 01 jul 24   visiting our friend, gus, in dc, he made plans for us to sail. so grateful he did!!the experience was amazing! from the land crew (thanks joe!) to the ship crew (sophia and michael) this team was on their game! captain jen made things fun by encouraging folks to participate with hoisting sails and taking the helm!

highly recommend, we will be back next time we are near annapolis!!         elizabeth preston 16:01 11 jul 24   a friend and i decided to take cruise in hopes to beat the heat and had a great time!  purchased our tickets online and arrived at suggested time.  we lucked out as there was nice wind which resulted in a ‚Äúsporty‚Äù sail!  the crew were entertaining and knowledgeable - they all contributed to a great time!         snofroman snofroman 22:26 18 jul 24   had a great sail on a thursday afternoon 4:00-6:00 pm.  captain andy and mates andrew and sophia were great.  all spent appropriate time chatting with passengers.  very competent/knowledgeable but also very relaxed.  our cruise calm and relaxing with moderate wind.  we made it close to bay bridge.  everyone got a chance to steer and to raise a sail as it was not crowded.  the price was very fair for 2 hours on the water.  the boat was in excellent shape.  i would happily do again!         bjorn guintu 15:34 27 jul 24   first time sailing and it was a great experience! great crew and glad they cap the number of folks on the boat where they do as we had ample space on deck. i recommend booking immediately as dates open up (7 day window) as spots fill up quickly.         marcelo pinheiro 15:34 04 aug 24   great boat. great route. great crew and captain. fun all around! a must do in annapolis.         joelle smith 22:44 04 aug 24   captain andy's experience on the water was second to none!  a storm was threatening to come in but we were all excited for the sailing trip. captain andy and his crew made sure our safety came first but we all had a great time on the water even though mother nature had her own plans. he constantly checked the weather and radar while we rode amazing winds in the sails across the chesapeake. it was a beautiful evening, even had our 9 year old daughter in on the fun hoisting the staysail!  the crew had us docking just as the clouds opened up with rain. their experience and expertise on the water was remarkable!! super fun time even though the weather didn't fully cooperate. highly recommend this company and especially captain andy and his crew!! amazing trip!!         ryan carr 14:25 07 aug 24   had an amazing trip and the crew was great! the captain assured all passengers were safe, but also enjoyed their voyage through the bay! i did the sunset beer tasting cruise with my wife, and it was an awesome experience. i would definitely recommend this as part of your trip to annapolis!         eric c. hinderberger 14:15 23 aug 24   highly recommend ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èsailing on the schooner woodwind was an unforgettable experience! the crew was incredibly professional and friendly, making sure everyone on board was comfortable and engaged throughout the trip. the schooner itself is beautifully maintained, and there's nothing like the feeling of the wind in your hair as you cruise the chesapeake bay.the views were breathtaking, and the crew shared fascinating stories about the area and sailing in general. whether you're a seasoned sailor or a first-timer, this is an experience you won‚Äôt want to miss. i especially loved the chance to help raise the sails‚Äîsuch a cool hands-on moment!highly recommend this adventure to anyone looking to experience the beauty of annapolis from the water. can't wait to sail with them again!         steven ackerson 21:10 09 sep 24   the woodwind never disappoints, especially the sunset cruise on a warm late summer night. as an annapolis resident, i always recommend a trip on the woodwind for visiting family and friends.  great crew, views, and brews.         amy diaczenko 21:03 17 sep 24   we did the sunset sailing tour this past sunday. captain jen and her crew were very knowledgeable and courteous.  the boat and sunset cruise were beautiful.         jennifer homer 15:17 23 sep 24   we had an amazing experience on our sunset sailing cruise.  it is a great way to see downtown annapolis from the water.  it was a slow cruise with beverages served. the crew was great and even allowed a few passengers to steer the sailboat. we would do this again in a heartbeat!         kirsten cordial 20:58 29 sep 24   always an awesome time. my third trip! absolutely amazing when they cut those engines and you just hear/see the sails and the water close enough to touch. a complete de-stressor. crew is always amazing and fun. definitely a must do in annapolis! can‚Äôt want to go back next year!         mark engel 21:45 19 oct 24   amazing crew and wonderful sail.  weather was wonderful and while the wind was low we still enjoyed being out on the water.  great way to experience annapolis.         nicholle la vann 14:18 21 oct 24   an exhilarating experience out on the chesapeake bay. witnessing a woman captain on the water was inspiring to say the least. big kudos to jenn and her kind crew that served cold refreshments like the tasty white wine to quench your thirst.  the bay was live with the navy doing their training and folks out on their sailboats having a good time in october. just the type of sunday cruising needed in life today with so much going on in the world it was a break well needed. the excursion allows you to steer and assist with the sails, from tacking to raising the sails it is truly a memorable ride. meeting people from out of town from new zealand and maine were an added plus while sailing on the schooner windward.     next reviews
