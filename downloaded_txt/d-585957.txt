information security group
















we perform research and education on methods and tools for the analysis and construction of safe and secure systems. this includes methods for specifying systems, developing systems in correctness-preserving ways, and verifying or testing existing systems and infrastructures.
our objective is to construct and implement security-critical systems and develop better processes for their construction whereby we can make mathematically precise statements about their behavior. we build on foundations in mathematical logic, discrete mathematics and cryptography, algorithms, complexity theory, and probability theory.











the information security group is led by  and is part of the institute of information security. 






















we have open positions!
visit our webpage for more details

















we are affiliated with the zurich information security and privacy center (zisc).












additional information


our economic, political, and social life today is largely based on modern communication and it infrastructures. the acceptance and continued expansion of these infrastructures depend on trust: all participants must have confidence in their proper functioning and, in particular, their security.
