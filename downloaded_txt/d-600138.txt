welcome from the headteacher
a very warm welcome to crick primary school website. crick primary school aims to be an outstanding school at the heart of a supportive village community. we are a small, one-form entry primary school, with 193 amazing children between the ages of 4 and 11 years old.  we are situated in the picturesque village of crick, northamptonshire.  our pupils are at the heart of everything we do and together we ensure that our pupils feel happy and safe. we endeavor to raise standards by providing pupils with a learning environment that allows them to be curious, resilient and ambitious. kindness, equality and well-being are at the heart of all that we do in order for our pupils to respect themselves, others and the environment. all of the staff and pupils work hard to ensure we keep being the best we can possibly be.  we set high standards of work and achieve this through providing a broad and balanced curriculum. we work closely with parents, carers and the wider community. 
in february 2022 ofsted said, “parents and carers say that their children feel happy and safe here. pupils are happy at their friendly school. they enjoy celebrating their own, and each other’s achievements. they proudly explain, ‘equality is important here'. leaders prioritise pupils’ mental and physical well-being."  
 our staff are fantastic, our parents and carers are supportive and our community are proud of us. we are all working towards the same goal – to develop our pupils love of learning by being curious, resilient and ambitious learners. you are very welcome to come and visit our school, and experience the atmosphere and culture that we believe makes our school a very special place to be.
