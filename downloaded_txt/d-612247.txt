raymond scott: works for orchestra

a new series of five 20-track digital compilations presents remastered recordings — many never previously released — of raymond scott's works for orchestra. spanning 1935 to 1957, these 100 tracks highlight scott's adventurous and eclectic approaches to composing and scoring for large ensembles. most tracks were transferred from discs in the scott collection at the marr sound archives, with digital restorations produced by scott historian/curator irwin chusid. the five sets include dozens of scott originals — including some early quintette titles arranged for orchestra — and a handful of cover versions. these collections are available on spotify, apple music, and all digital retail and streaming platforms. on spotify, here's vol. 1, here's vol. 2, don't miss vol. 3, check out vol. 4, and finally vol. 5.

raymond scott: quintettes or less

raymond scott: quintettes or less presents two 20-track digital (only) collections of mostly previously unreleased scott recordings featuring the composer working with bands of less than seven players. scott's original 1937–1939 "quintette" actually had six members, so we're going with raymond's math in curating these sets. lots of surprises, including rsq alternates and early versions, crisp radio performances, and previously unheard 1940s quintets and sextets. curated and restored by irwin chusid. both sets are available on spotify, apple music, and all digital retail and streaming platforms. on spotify, here's vol. 1 and vol. 2.
raymond scott reimagined

raymond scott is celebrated in a 2023 collaboration between violinist jeremy cohen's quartet san francisco and gordon goodwin’s big phat band. raymond scott reimagined is a thrilling 14-track set featuring goodwin’s inspired arrangements of scott classics, including “powerhouse,” “twilight in turkey,” and “toy trumpet.” the album introduces a posthumous scott composition, “cutey and the dragon,” crafted from an unfinished sketch scott made in 1982 for his granddaughter kathy, with goodwin completing the composition in a manner that honors the great composer’s style and verve. watch a short film about the evolution of this historic collaboration, and read jonathan widran's feature story about the project.


raymond scott news
a new digital-only series, raymond scott's merry melodies, features vintage renditions of scott's best-known quintette titles. the recordings, from the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, feature the well-known (artie shaw, benny goodman, tommy dorsey), the not-so-well-remembered (milt herth, hal kemp, adrian rollini), and the obscure (james kok, shay torrent, gaylord carter). volume 1 can be found on spotify, and it's available on all streaming and digital retail platforms. here's volume 2.
in november 2023, raymond scott received a posthumous grammy award nomination in the best instrumental composition category for "cutey and the dragon." this late-life work, which was sketched out on paper by scott in 1982, was completed in 2022 by gordon goodwin (who also received a nomination as co-composer). "cutey" didn't win — it was edged out by a youngster named john williams — but it was a thrill to have the quality of the new work acknowledged. the premiere recording of "cutey" appeared on the 2023 album raymond scott reimagined by quartet san francisco with gordon goodwin's big phat band. goodwin took the unfinished work and completed it in a manner that honors scott's sophisticated yet playful style. a film of the studio recording can be viewed here. (raymond neither received nor was nominated for a grammy during his lifetime; the awards were launched in 1958, by which time scott had largely stopped releasing records.)
in a recent episode, "player piano," on the popular podcast the last archive, producer ben naddaff-hafrey explores "raymond scott’s lifelong quest to build an automatic songwriting machine, and what it means for our own ai-addled, chatgpt world." the episode can be heard on apple podcasts.
scott's vintage recordings have been used in the soundtracks of a number of recent tv shows and films, including the andy warhol diaries, this fool, winning time, lessons in chemistry, and spiderman: across the spider-verse. the long history of scott's music in soundtracks can be found here.
