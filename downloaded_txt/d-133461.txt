past services 






















your community, your church. 



worship god… enjoy his presence forever. 






meet our leadership















worship 











we focus on ministering to god through worship. passionate, unrestrained worship of our creator is nothing less than he deserves, and this is a vital element to everything that happens within our local body. the presence of the lord is a precious gift we have promised to steward. in his presence, lives are eternally, radically transformed. 







repent 











repentance is not a dirty word! everyone needs a chance to get sin out of our lives, and to be restored to right relationship with god and man. as a church, we urge all to turn from the ways of darkness and run to the marvelous light of christ. it’s the first step in the most exciting journey you will ever take – life in the kingdom of god. 







discipleship 











the primary call of the local church is equipping the saints for ministry. this involves discipleship for daily living, in addition to equipping for the specific purpose of each individual’s life. we believe in activating each person in our local body to live a successful christian life – in small moments and momentous milestones. 







serve 











we are called as servants of god and adopted into his kingdom. at grace, we encourage each person to serve their local church body by exploring what is currently needed, and to serve their community with a humble heart. opportunities to serve create deeper connections within our community and edify the body of christ as a whole.

the bible defines the church as a body. we, as the church, are members of that body, with different abilities and many functions. when one part of the body is not functioning, the rest of the body becomes impaired. every part of the body is necessary, and each part is significant. the church is not a denomination or a building; it is the body of christ. 









 





“worship is at the heart of all we do, because worship is the primary concern of the church. our focus is to make god’s glory known in all the earth, and this is what drives everything i do as a pastor. it is my desire that each person that enters our church will be inspired to seek the lord more deeply.” – lindell cooley 









 





a core value of grace church: nashville is to teach people of all ages the basic foundations of the word of god and help them begin to apply god’s principles to their lives. we believe in being a part of strengthening families through relationship with jesus christ. through christ our mission is to heal the broken, encourage the hopeless, and love the lost.
