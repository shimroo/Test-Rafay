tronair is a good partner and strongly supports us. excellent vendor.
-anonymous 





we bought two new electric eagle tugs a year ago and we haven't had any issues. the tow tractor tows what we need it to and the batteries hold a charge for quite some time. customer service has been quick to respond as well, especially ashley. she always goes above and beyond to make sure we have what we need and is very easy to deal with. would recommend their tow tractors to anyone who wants a quality product. very smooth when it comes to towing. as far as maintenance, with everything being electric, the tow tractor is very easy to maintain.

southern air systems maintenance 





our team performs hundreds of aircraft movements per week, between fbo pushbacks and mro movements in and out of the hangar, to aircraft run bays, etc., and in that capacity, the e-jp100s towbarless tug is a fantastic performer. 
 
we have used other manufacturer’s towbarless tugs over the years  in this business jet category for handling aircraft of sizes ranging between learjet and global express. the handling and control of the jet porter is second to none, and maintenance is simple with ease of access and parts availability.

eagle tugs aircraft tugs
for 50 years, eagle tugs has been designing and manufacturing nothing but aircraft tugs. eagle has instilled those years of experience into each one of its designs. eagle pushback and airport tugs offer a simplistic design, yet they are known around the world for their superior functionality and reliability. they are designed specifically to move aircraft; they are not baggage or cargo tractors repurposed for moving aircraft. that is why eagle tugs can offer its customers an industry-leading 3-year/3,000-hour warranty on its tug tow tractors.
