world responds to jail change
posted may 2006
opponents of private prisons throughout the world are heralding the provincial liberal government's decision to bring central north correctional centre into the public fold.

"this is a very large victory, not only in canada, but across the world," said brian dawe, executive director of corrections usa, a non-profit coalition of corrections professionals from canada and the u.s.

lessons to be learned
posted may 2006
now that the harper conservatives have tabled tough new laws to put more people in jail, the big questions to answer are, 'where are they going to put them?'; 'how much will it cost?' and 'is this the best approach to crime?'

prime minister stephen harper has not put a price tag on his crusade. however, it is obviously going to be steep, and experts are already questioning the wisdom of conducting such a crusade when crime rates are falling. 

(while the murder rate rose somewhat in 2004 - from a 36-year low - crime as a whole declined by 1%, according to statistics canada.)

despite this, the new conservative budget calls for 1,000 extra rcmp officers to crack down on criminals and the tory anti-crime legislation spells out a lengthy list of mandatory sentences to lock them away.

inevitably, this will lead to a big demand for new prison cells. it will also open the door to intense pressure from ideological conservatives to meet the demand by privatization.

cncc was cheaper but results pointed to provincially-run model as better says kwinter
posted may 2006
the privately operated central north correctional centre was simply out-performed by its publicly run twin in kawartha lakes, a partial report comparing the adult prisons indicates.

a comparison review was conducted for the province by consulting firm price waterhouse coopers throughout various times of the jails' operations, including an initial inmate transfer period, a transition period of six to eight months when the adult prisons were first opened and the remaining time of operation, known as a "steady state".

"overall, the data and analysis in this report indicate that (management and training corporation canada) is operating in material compliance with its contractual obligations under its services agreement with the ministry," reads the comparison report's summary of findings. but, "a comparison of the performance of cncc versus cecc (excluding costs) indicates that cecc is rated higher than cncc."

in the partial 12-page executive summary, the consulting firm rated both prisons in performance categories that included security, classification, variety and volume, recidivism, health care, and community impact, among other issues. cncc rated higher than the public jail in variety and volume, but the kawartha lakes facility performed better in every other category.

govt to take over mtc prison
posted may 2006
queen's park, on, april 27 /cnw/ - ontario will transfer the operation of

the central north correctional centre in penetanguishene to the public sector,

community safety and correctional services minister monte kwinter announced

today.

    "after five years, there has been no appreciable benefit from the private

operation of the central north correctional centre," said kwinter. "we

carefully studied its overall performance compared with the publicly operated

central east correctional centre in kawartha lakes, and concluded the cecc

performed better in key areas such as security, health care and reducing re-

offending rates. as a result, the government will allow the contract with the

private operator to expire."

more on mtc's ousting
posted may 2006
central north correctional centre, which opened in 2001 and has been run by management and training corporation since, will be operated by the provincial government, effective nov. 10, 2006, when mtc's five-year contract expires.

the ministry of community safety and corrections made the announcement thursday after completing a report comparing cncc with its physical twin in kawartha lakes, which is publicly run.

a decision on the prison's future was needed six months prior to the current contract expiring.

"on just a cost basis the (private operation) was more economical," corrections minister monte kwinter told osprey news thursday afternoon, "but that reflected on the outcome.

"management and training corporation was in material compliance with the (existing) contract, but there's no question that health care was delivered better at the kawartha lakes facility and that integration was better at the kawartha lakes facility," kwinter said.

mtc saved on personnel
posted may 2006
to help the province make the decision, a comparison study between the two was done on a number of key areas like security, programming; inmate classification; the variety and volume of programming; programming quality; programming effectiveness; continuum of services; recidivism (rates of reoffending), health care and community impact.

 

"(the comparison summary) shows that in most areas cecc ..... was superior," noted kwinter. "the other thing is that one of the key concerns ... is the contract really provided the facility with less personnel than we were using to ministry standards in the (lindsay) facility and (they're) identical. to me, it didn't make any sense as to why they would do that and it's reflected in the outcome."

in the next six months, the ministry will be working with mtc, the employees and with the union to make that transition as seamless as possible, says kwinter.

"we need personnel to run that facility and we're going to have an increase in personnel because we're going to staff it up to the level that we do in (lindsay)," he said. "so, what is going to happen, obviously, there will be opportunities for more jobs."

future of cncc decided in may posted april 2006

officials with the ministry of community safety and corrections services won't say what plans are in store for canada's first privately operated adult prison, but it appears the future of central north correctional centre in penetanguishene should be clear by the end of may.

management and training corporation's five-year contract with the ministry to operate the prison expires in november. according to the ministry, the current deal requires that the province inform mtc of its intentions six months prior to the contract ending. that means a decision on whether to keep operating the facility privately or turn it over to the province should be delivered by the end of next month.
