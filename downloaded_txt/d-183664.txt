copeland sports proudly represents canadian olympic champion summer mcintosh  our mission is to establish and develop strong and lasting relationships with a select group of respected and leading partner organizations. these partners will share in summer’s journey and play an important role in the achievement of her inspiring ambition to be a generational global champion and role model.  
























revenue generation
in addition to developing traditional sponsorship relationships, we help summer and her partners to explore creative opportunities across the full commercial landscape, and unlock the full potential to drive revenues from existing sources - and identify and create important new ones.


























brand development
  summer’s personal brand is about more than what she accomplishes in the pool.  and her brand must support and amplify the most important priorities and values that her partners stand for and live by – integrity, determination, leadership, confidence, success, community, connection (and hopefully some happiness and fun). we help summer and her partners ensure that these brand priorities and values are represented consistently and creatively through every touchpoint with customers, employees, partners and others.


























partner support & development
the most valuable partnerships are the one’s founded on trust, support and mutual commitment. summer is focused on supporting organizations and brands that she respects and believes in - genuinely and without compromise - and then enthusiastically leaning-in to help drive value for them. we envision these organizations coming together to collectively form a formidable “team summer” - with each member not only sharing in her development and success but actively contributing to it over the span of her career (inside and outside of the pool).
