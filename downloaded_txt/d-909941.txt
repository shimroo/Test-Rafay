a special message from the kalamazoo living history show





when we took over the kalamazoo living history show™ in 2007 after the retirement of show founders larry and carol coin, we planned to run it for about 20 years before turning over the reins to a new generation. the fact that a transition is coming about a bit before the 20-year mark does not mean that either of us is tired of the show, or that either of us is in bad health. we had been quietly “successor shopping” for some time; certainly, since the pandemic years. the largest challenge the show faces may be the aging of our dealer (and visitor) base. in our opinion, this challenge can best be met by a younger team, well connected in all aspects of living history and muzzleloading, with the personality, credibility, trustworthiness and communication skills to support the mission of the show while reaching an even wider audience. we know good talent when we see it and we believe that we have found that team. we are thrilled to announce that ethan and paisley yazel have agreed to take over the ownership of the kalamazoo living history show™, beginning in january of 2026. “we care deeply about the show, what it represents, and the community of vendors, artists, educators, staff, and visitors that make it possible. we look forward to working with all of you to carry on the promotion of living history through the kalamazoo living history show™,” states ethan. “we’re excited to be continuing the great tradition that rick and leslie have preserved,” adds paisley. the four of us are very excited about this partnership. ethan and paisley will be training with us in the planning and implementation of the 2025 show and will then take the show into the future. we hope that you will welcome and support ethan and paisley as you have supported us these many years. the future of the kalamazoo living history show looks very bright!
