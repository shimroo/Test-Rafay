louis nichole....from the white house to queen elizabeth’s house to your neighbor’s house.”  
                    the press described him best: “louis nichole, master craftsman, designer, singer/songwriter, landscape arctitect, photographer, author, and raconteur extraordinaire, is a roman candle of energy going off in a dozen directions at once. what do you say about a young man, who has been featured in almost every newspaper, magazine, and tv talk show across the country? what does he do for an encore?”
the former kindergarten teacher built an international brand and consumer base in only 10 years…without advertising, marketing or public relations. 
living to the left of the 20th century, nichole licensed his name and old world craftsmanship to major corporations across the globe in such diverse industries as furniture, bed, bath and table linens, lighting, carpets, textiles, lace, china, dinnerware, christmas decorations, porcelain dolls and decorative home accessories.
