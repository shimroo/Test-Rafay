contemporary design, traditional process





we look to the future and honour the past, celebrating traditional weaving methods and the hand-finishing process whilst innovating with cutting edge hand-tufted technology and experimenting in colour, pattern, and texture.
we are committed to using the best possible materials and are proud of our british production.
