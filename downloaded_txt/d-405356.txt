fine classic cars




with over thirty years experience as a collector and a dealer of highly collectable motor cars, i enjoy a reputation for maintaining a professional focus on finding lost treasures.
i seek out cars with a passion and commitment to good taste, evident in the cars i have offered for sale over the years.
my reputation among connoisseurs is one for absolute discretion and honesty, identifying the true historical value of these cars which will be preserved for future generations as witness of the past.
combining preservation and authenticity constitute my long term goal and i wish to attract customers who share in this.
out of time…                                      …simply different
