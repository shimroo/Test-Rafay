customer reviews










"i had my wedding at adventures unlimited. during the pandemic, the week of an impending hurricane. the staff at adventures unlimited went above and beyond working with me during these difficult times. they were extremely flexible. especially the day of, when our outdoor wedding got completely rained out and we had to move it inside. so many crazy situations arose on this day. jo dee and the adventures unlimited staff went out of their way to accommodate us and make sure we were satisfied. i cannot thank them enough. they were there for me every step of the way.
my guests loved the adventure as well. most everyone i have talked to about our wedding, said it was one of the most fun weddings they had ever been to. guests loved the cabins and being able to have places to hangout together the day before and after the wedding"

"went here for a spur of the moment with my friend. a bit of a drive from pensacola, but it's worth it. the instructor's were really friendly, outgoing and funny. especially the guy, he was quite the comedian. you work your way up from small potatoes to a 900 foot zip line over a river. it's pretty crazy. after the first few though, it's no longer nerve wrecking. so by the time you get to 900 feet, it's nothing but joy and pleasure. super safe, super fun."
