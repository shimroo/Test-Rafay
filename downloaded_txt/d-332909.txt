unknown show at the unknown gallery





unknown show at the unknown gallery

"what is art if not a definition of who we are !", said the man outside the unknown gallery, as he heavily smoked his cigarette. he stepped onto the sidewalk, and into the light. he was tall and dark, and reeked of heavy smoke and alcohol.  
"in this town, if a person is not an artist then he or she is a critic.", a well dressed man yelled as he walked out of the art show..  "nobody buys anything." he continued, "what's the point". he continued to walk across the street and into his car.
people still standing in line to go into the show looked away perhaps trying not to get caught in the uncomfortable moment. 
"that's him", a girl whispered. "that's the artist." 
 i had no intentions of walking in, it was too crowded. when i left the house, i had told myself, if i pass by the front door, i'd somehow be able to take a peek and perhaps come at a later time. who knows, perhaps i was hoping i would run into a friend and they would convince me to stay and go in.
 i stood in front of the gallery, "another art show, another local artist trying to make his mark in the world", i thought..
