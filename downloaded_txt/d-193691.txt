view available lotsclient testimonialshere’s what our client’s have to say about their homes and experience building:

our friends and family have been very impressed with the quality of the woodwork and all the other finishing touches that have made our home so comfortable and livable. our building experience was basically pain free thanks to the wonderful staff you have working for you.
jim & linda grimsley
your team deserves notable accolades as relates to the level of service and follow-up after the home was completed and we moved into it.  naturally there are always a few things to do after the close, and i have to say that we were incredibly impressed with the prompt and efficient support we received from sterling, well beyond any reasonable follow-up period.
greg & donna burt
we had no idea that you could actually turn one of life’s most painstaking processes for a married couple into an enjoyable experience. your “can do” attitude and intensive focus on your customers are obvious reasons why people continue to refer business to you long after their homebuilding process is completed.
jim & kathy erben
throughout the entire planning, designing and construction process, the sterling team made us feel like we were their only client. they were very attentive and responsive to our suggestions and concerns.
wayne & diane hussey
you’ve surrounded yourself with experienced, caring individuals that help your customers on a daily basis. there isn’t anyone on your staff that wouldn’t bend over backwards to help us and their attitudes made us feel like we were dealing with family, not vendors.
jerry & cindy johnson
you have taken the arduous task of building a home and made it understandable, reasonable and actually fun at times! the way in which you schedule, plan and execute home construction is impressive.
doug & june baker
sterling custom homes is a firm you can trust implicitly. we trusted them from the get-go and they more than earned that trust over the entire 18 months of design, build, and settle in. the most remarkable part of that trust is that it permeates the organization. trustworthiness is in the sterling culture.
