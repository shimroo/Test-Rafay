about avid


					the avid microchip was designed and developed to specifically address the problem of identifying missing pets and returning them home to their families. the aim has not changed, but the products have evolved to include a choice of two implantation products to better suit your requirements.
					
high quality microchips and scanners
					to complement the high quality microchips, avid microchip scanners have been designed to include models which suit all types of environment and that are appropriate for your needs. the avid minitracker is perfect for most applications due to its compact size, easy to use design, extended read range and most notably that it reads all four current companion animal microchip standards from around the world. 
					
a robust and proven pet microchip database
					whether you are implanting and registering pet microchips or handling stray or found pets, you always have to consider the microchip database that will be handling those details. avid manages the pettrac database to ensure that the high quality found in the microchip products continues in the service which is provided to vets, rescue centres, dog wardens and pet owners alike.
