in february 2019 - we attended the orlando hamcation - our five hundred eighty first hamfest -
	  following which  we retired from the hamfest circuit. 




we were pleasantly surprised to be honored by the oarc and the hamcation committee
	  at the club's meeting on thursday evening prior to hamcation this year.
	  we were presented this lovely plaque with cake and ice cream for all.
	  thank you oarc !

our alaska trip was a real blast !

at long last... we'll soon have more of the trip pictures ready...
and a better display engine!   once you've selected a slide, you can step forward or backward from that point, or return here.
we have a new version of photoshop which makes getting these pictures online a lot simpler so we're back to having new ones up every few weeks or so, so check back and you can enjoy the trip with us.
   they are stacked bottom to top so you can easily see when new ones are up
