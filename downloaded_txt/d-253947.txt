we’ve got adventures for everyone! which best describes you?


i want to try scuba divinga big part of what island divers does is taking people on their first scuba dive.  there is more than one option for these introductory dives. our most popular program is a day long experience that introduces people to the basics of scuba diving with a morning pool session followed by a two tank afternoon dive from one of our dive boat
reserve a dive 

i am an experienced diverif you are scuba diver with a fair amount of experience and/or an advanced open water diver scuba certification, chances are you want to reserve our morning boat charter service. the morning boat charter starts out with a deep dive to a wreck, followed by a shallower drift dive. occasionally, dive sites will change due to conditions or the desires of clients on the boat, but this is the typical schedule. sundays are the exception.
reserve a dive 


i want to get certifiedthe beginning level of certification is called open water certification.  you can get that certification from many different organizations; island divers is associated with and has instructors certified from ssi, naui, & padi. once certified, you are certified for life and able to rent dive gear, book dive charters, and just go diving with a buddy anywhere in the world.
get certified

i am a wreck enthusiastthe big island and maui might have healthier reefs but nothing compares to diving the wrecks of oahu. with over 10 accessible wrecks around the island you have several choices and a lot to explore. the wrecks act as magnets and home for sea life and are usually the best dive sites for spotting hawaiian stingray, eagle rays, white tip reef sharks and pelagic fish.
