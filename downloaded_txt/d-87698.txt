our tuition includes all fees in one price. each family will have one clear tuition number to budget for at the beginning of each school year. 








            financial aid available
          









we are committed to not letting finances be the barrier for families who want to be here. a family who is unsure about affording the full tuition price is encouraged to apply through facts, the third-party organization we partner with.








            safe, family atmosphere
          









student safety is prioritized in all that we do. teachers and staff offer daily individual attention, providing a christian community of care, love and support for each student and family. 








            before & after school care
          









we offer before school care from 6:30-8:25am, and after school care from 3-6pm. families are charged per hour only for the time their student(s) used each day. 








            school nurse and pastors on-site daily
          









we employ a certified nurse who is on site each school day. we also have at least one local pastor available and on-call for support each day. 








            weekly chapel and team talks

            daily recess breaks
          









we believe movement, exercise and brain breaks are critical to the overall educational experience of each student, which is why we prioritize getting students outdoors and keeping them active throughout the day.








            guidance counseling
          









we have an on-site guidance counselor available daily to work with students and families on academic schedules, progress and college planning.

we offer daily hot lunch, made on-site in our kitchen, including a-la-carte items and salads for students in 7-12th grade.








            1:1 chromebook technology
          









every 5-12th student is issued a school-owned chromebook for their use throughout the school year. younger grades utilize school-owned chromebooks and ipads throughout the week.








            weekly art, music and pe for elementary
          









little lions-6th students receive art, music, and physical education at least once per week. 








            computer science, agriculture, art, choir & band electives
          









7-12th students work with our guidance counselor to select necessary classes in addition to electives they are interested in.

            championship athletic program
          









we’ve experienced huge success in athletics over the last few years, including conference championships and undefeated regular seasons. football, volleyball, basketball, track, wrestling, baseball, soccer, golf, cheer all offered, starting as early as 4th grade. our newly refinished gym floor provides a beautiful setting for indoor sports, while our on-site baseball, football and soccer fields provide a special atmosphere for each home game.








            camp offerings
          









we offer many camps throughout the year including stem, robotics, basketball, baseball, volleyball, wrestling and cheer.

a dedicated stem room is utilized by elementary students for project-based learning, and a jr. high robotics team competes in local and regional competitions. 








            high school internship program
          









high school seniors may participate in an internship with a local business or organization to gain valuable hands-on experience in a career or field they have interest in.
