los treinte y tres





i can't get away from the uncomfortable feeling that the chilean miners were poxed in luck to be trapped in that"third world " country rather than this shithole of a failed state that we call a country.had we got anything worth mining, and had we got a miningindustry, and had our unfortunate miners been trapped following an infrastructure collapse of some description,i doubt they would ever have been located,never mind a rescue attempt.if, by some stroke of luck, they were located after 17 days, our glorious government, having formed a committee to employ consultants, to establish a quango, eventuallyrecall the dail to inform a news conference that thereis no money available to attempt a rescue at this time,but that the irish people would send down an adequate supply of iodine tablets, along with some surplus buttervouchers left over from the eighties.not that i couldn't see a government-jetful of our preening, self-important, expences-fiddling failuresof gobshite ministers junketing off to chile, but onlyto ascertain the most efficient method of suppressingdemocracy.

can they leave nuthin' alone ?





there i was the other day, going about my business in a mildand inoffensive way when i came across this !"there is one christmas song that has always baffled me. what in the world do leaping lords, french hens, swimming swans, and especially the partridge who won't come out of the pear tree have to do with christmas? this week, i found out.from 1558 until 1829, roman catholics in england werenot permitted to practice their faith openly. someoneduring that era wrote this carol as a catechism song for young catholics. it has two levels of meaning: the surface meaning plus a hidden meaning known only to members of their church. eachelement in th e carol has a code word for a religious realitywhich the children could remember. -the partridge in a pear tree was jesus chris t. -two turtle doves were the old and new testaments. -three french hens stood for faith, hope and love. -the four calling birds were the four gospels of matthew, mark, luke & john. -the five golden rings recalled the torah or law, the first five books of the old testament. -the six geese a-laying stood for the six days of creation. -seven swans a-swimming represented the sevenfold gifts of the holy spirit--prophesy, serving, teaching,  exhortation, contribution, leadership, and mercy. -the eight maids a-milking were the eight beatitudes. -nine ladies dancing were the nine fruits of the holy spirit--love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,  gentleness, and self control. -the ten lords a-leaping were the ten commandments. -the eleven pipers piping stood for the ele ven fa ithful disciples. -the twelve drummers drumming symbolized the twelve points of belief in the apostles' creed.so there is your history for today. this knowledge was shared with me and i found it interesting and enlightening and now i know how that strange song became a chris tmas carol...so p ass it on if you wish.'"it may even be true but i think it's just more revisionisttwaddle from our favourite neo-cons.however, it got me thinking about the song itself and whatthe words might really mean, so here goes ;the partridge in the tree is so obviously a turkey that therecan be no dispute.the 2 turtle doves have to be the parents.three french hens would then be their kids anxiously awaitingthe great day.four calling birds will then be the much dreaded visit of thein-laws.five gold ( red ) rings demonstrate the unfortunate result of an ill-advised visit to mcdonalds during a shopping trip.six lordly geese a-milking............. come on folks,help me out here.....................

rather chilly





my house is one of those barns that the greens arealways on about, you know the type, stifling hot all summer and like a cold-room in the winter, i'dswear i could lease it out to a butcher for hangingmeat.the reasons that the oul' insulation is notstate of the art are manyfold, laziness and meanessamong them but mainly because i've had other plans for the property that are now on hold due to thepresent economic climate.what has this got to do with you ?, you may wonder,and not much if the truth were to be told, ( a rareand wonderous thing on this blog )except that mycomputer is in the hallway of said house and it'sfucking freezing here, hence the lack of posts.i did, however, come across thishttp://www.lufthansa-usa.com/useugame2007/html/play.html and it's great craic altogether, if a little addictive.i'd swear it's how ryanair chose their destinations.

i'm not going to shoot fish in a barrel and joke aboutmary harney's beauty treatments  but i ax you, if a single parentasked for , say, 20 euro, for a hairdo for a job interviewwhat would be the answer ? why do these ministers and topcivil servants need their salaries of 200 grand plus ?, do they ever spend a cent of their own money ? the chairman of harvey norman ( more about them later )says the economic lanscape in ireland is akin to the potato famine and perhaps he's right except this timeit's our own who are robbing and cheating us and generallymaking things worse for every one now and for the forseeablefuture.when harvey norman first came to these shores i forbademalicia from ever darkening their doors simply becauseof their ads. i refuse to be bellowed at by some loud-mouthed australian, so now ,fuck off and go harvey go. http://www.independent.ie/national-news/harney-the-fas-trip-and-the-410-hairdo-1554731.html

x rated





never took to simon cowell, the little shortarse bollix off thex factor, and his teeth are far too white to be wholesome,what sort of an englishman  has those ? is he ashamed ofhis culture or what ? not to mention his smarminess andhis wonderful opinion of himself , nor his crimes against theaural senses.and that was before his present incarnation wherby he, hispet poodle bitch-boy louis walsh and the twins, vapid andvacuous insult and degrade unfortunates whose selfish andmoney-grabbing families have convinced them have amodicum of talent, reducing them to tearful, broken wrecksafter queing for hours for the priviledge of being humiliated.all for our delight and delectation, and to make more moneyfor shortarse.this is bad enough, but having weeded out the hopeless , theinfirm and the downright useless, appalling conestants, thecircus begins to find who will win the competition and be thechristmas no.1, the best-selling single of christmas week.cowell and his horrid crew are telling us what we will bebuying at christmas. only it's not us who'll be doing thebuying, the fact that you're here means you have somesemblance of a brain, so you won't  fall for his shite. nor anyof the usual suspects who chose what music they down-loador purchase with their hard-earned. no, the only ones whoare guaranteed to fall for this annual super-con are the pre-teens and 12/13 year olds who are desperately trying to becool in the eyes of their friends and siblings, making theirfirst foray into the few record stores that are left open.     this is where i have the problem in that every show fromnow to the end of the series is just a glorified grooming pro-cess for these children to get them to put whoever he, cowell,choses into the no.1 slot, on the week he chooses. to my mindit is a form of legalised paedophilia.
