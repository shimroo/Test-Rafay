death to pt's big adventure





as i warned last month, i killed and moved pt's big adventure.  to the throngs of loyal readers, thank you for your limited and divided attention over the years. you'll probably be able to find me, just not here.i'm simply holding this address as to prevent someone from pretending to be me, taking advantage of the visitorship that i sometimes enjoyed.
