the wildflowers 
      of ontario are certainly a spectacular collection of some of north america's 
      prettiest flora. that which follows, is a collection of these wildflowers 
      in their natural habitat, ordered alphabetically or by colour. information 
      about some of the flowers is included.
so, sit back and enjoy a romp through 
      the fields and woods of ontario, and feast your eyes on some of mother nature's 
      finest work in all its natural beauty. and all of this without fear of the 
      stinging bite of black fly or mosquito.
my wish is that this site become 
      a collaborative effort. if you have a picture of an identified wildflower 
      that you would like on this site, please submit it. if it is used you will 
      be given a photo credit for your photo.
