closing the digital divide










our mission


our mission is to improve lives by providing innovative solutions that expand the access, adoption, and use of high-speed internet and its related technologies. everyone belongs in a connected nation. 
the way that connected nation is working to close the digital divide in america
how broadband investments are made today will impact the lives of millions of americans – especially those in our most vulnerable populations – for decades to come. seizing this opportunity requires that we truly understand the unique internet landscape in every state and community. only then can we clearly identify how best to tackle the complicated and often highly technical challenges that define today’s digital divide.
