the following is an excerpt of the full page






 


enzo camacho and ami lien. flame garden (bruised) (detail). 2024. watercolor, ink, beeswax, abaca pulp, bagasse, banana stalk, cilantro, coconut, cogon grass, fennel, kale, leek, onion skins, primrose petals, rice hull, sargassum algae, seashell, seaweed, spring onion, statice blossoms, and taro shoots. installation view of enzo camacho and ami lien: offerings for escalante, on view at moma ps1 from october 10, 2024 through february 17, 2025. photo: steven paneccasio








for over a decade, artists enzo camacho (filipino, b. 1985) and ami lien (american, b. 1987) have amplified local forms of survival and resistance, with particular attention to the philippines. on the occasion of their first major us museum exhibition offerings for escalante, on view at moma ps1 through february 17, the duo discuss their historical and material research on the island of negros, with both documentary and indexical approaches to embodying the land. camacho and lien’s interests materialize in two of their recent works on view in the exhibition, langit lupa (2023) and decomposition animation (2023), which recently entered the collection of the museum of modern art. the conversation with chief curator ruba katrib triangulates the social and environmental concerns of artists and activists across the philippines, its diaspora, and new york.
