	 another grand day in my life
	 
    


well on thanksgiving day 2004 i moved into this tiny little apartment from a large one. so as in most moves my large dining room glass table was broken but it would take up my whole kitchen and there is no diningroom in this apartment. and my couch sectional takes up the whole livingroom, and well my king size bed in this little room another story. so fung shei has been hard to do. then of course i have had to get rid of my 40 gallon aquarium, and my cat my dog my rats you name it. fought to bring them back the rats have all passed away, the cat gave away got another gave it away when i thought i was moving this summer when my daughter went and was suppose to live with her dad from here on out. haha ha! got my dog and then the neighbors doing drugs started caliing animal control on her for barking. wish i could call somone on them for doing drugs. the cops out here don't do anything about the drugs. they encourage it. heck one cop has a son who addicted to the stuff. meth that is. but he sure points the finger at you when you make a mistake.anyway i found i can have my 40 gallon aquarium so today i moved it in. don't you know one of the crack head busy bodies already had to say something about i couldn't have it to the manager. i let her know i had already cleared it through corporate. try taking this away from me assholes.  i don't have a light fo rit as the lid is broken and the light is burned out so i have a red light which with fung shei is suppose to bring romance so i got another red night light out and now i have two red night lights going one in my room and one by my coffee pot. what a difference i feel tonight. all my lights except to oil lamps are going tonight. i can hear the water moving and i walked and ran my 2 miles today. the part i jogged i jogged faster then i did day before yesterday. now i can't go to the gym again til monday so tomorrow i think i will try doing it around the area here. sucks cause i don't like doing it around these idiots. this morning after getting home from the gym and cleaning up the aquarium the smell of meth was in the house again. i called my manager and she smelt it to. this comes just a day after i had my carpets cleaned so she knows it is going on.well we are blessed and i think i am going to go eat a salad. i shouldn't but i haven't eaten much and a salad sounds good.

	 wow it's been along time hasn't it
	 
    


well since i kinda of veiw this as a journal and less as a blog i guess i can say it has been a long time. it is now 2007. i believe my last blog was 2005. wow!!! so here i am. let's see what all has happened. i am still in the same small apt! the drugs are still going on all around me and even more so. last summer my daughter went to spend the summer with her dad whom she met in may for the first time in her life since she was about 6 or 7 months old. and i was told she was never coming home. but in the end she threw her rich dady war bucks a looper and came home after all! i got a vehicle thanks to him. he gave me a small amount of money which got me a small older suv which i am blessed to have. it is in good shape except the druggies have tore the outside up by putting dents into it. some peoples children. the police do nothing.my daughter has a hard time with finding her way to school and once there, keeping her concetraction on school. she seems to be alot like me. much rather be outside of school! i just hope she will go to college! she seems really excited about the arts. photography, ceramics, etc. i think she has raally taken a liking to the teacher. you know the teacher can make all the difference.  she could go into school with a scholarship in the arts. with her minor in psychology or vis versa.well then i just turned 44 on the 2nd of march! wow what a grand birthday i had. i am blessed! it started out on the 1st with roses from kali and a ballon that says .....happy birthday! pink roses! my mom gave me money. that's nice made up for the money i spent the next day. then on my birthday i went to vegas. went to wal-mart. it was really a good experience there. surprising with such long lines. everyone was so nice. then i had gotten a new cell phone and didn't like it so i went to the verizon store i don't like but had a great experience there also, everyone was so nice.  i got a new cherry chocolate and i love it. sorry i could get my daughter the strawberry she wanted so badly. then off to the beauty supply store so i could get hairspray. almost got into a wreck but i am such a grand driver i saved myself and everyone i would have taken out.the went to my girlfriends changed and off for sushi! yummy! we discoved white tuna for the first time! yummy! then back at her house another friend came over, she brought me a beautiful arrangement of silk flowers i forgot to bring home. we hung out some more watched tv and then i feel asleep. awoke about 4am and headed home. my relief socoiety president gave me some beautiful opal earrings. i just love them my girlfriend i had sushi with gave me these really cool glass earrings. i have so much jewelry that i forget what all i have and have to remember! now if only i had a nice gold raiders amulet! that would be the ticket!then today my friend in phoenix and i got tired of her phone shutting down on us so we ordered the strawberry chocolate after all and when it gets here my child will get it and my friend will get my daughters chocolate. isn't life full of blessings? oh my girlfriend from az sent me our pictures from our last trip to az and sent me a really cool magnet about pisces. my friends are so hott!

	 dinner at my house this year
	 
    


well as many of you know i live in this tiny little apt. it's 2 bdrms with one bath perfect size for just me. i hope when i move out on my own i can find a nice size one bedroom because i like alot of space, like my last apt. in las vegas.well anyhows yesterday was my first thanksgiving dinner i cooke.  my mom of course made the stuffing, gravy, pies,( i would have gotten store bougth pies cuz i  don't know how to make pies) and the fruit salad. my 15 yr old daughter whipped up the instant potatos, because she loves to make those just to eat when she's in the mood, i  helped her out with some butter and helped her with the consistency. we didn't have any sour cream or i'd suggested that but then she probably wouldn't have eaten them, she doesn't know how many times she's had them with sour cream. the day before i bought the hostess, me a bottle of baileys and started off making the potato salad, guess i had too much much baileys cuz i had too much mayonaise so they came out runny "yuck" and put all the ingredients together for this new atichoke dip i was going to try out. all except the parmesan i added right before putting in the oven the day of thanksgiving. my daughter and i called my girlfriend at the airport where she works at and played a prank on her. my daughter started talking to her in french, now i have tried this before and i am very limited in my french my daughter is taking her 2nd year of french in school so my girlfriend always bust me, but yesterday she believed my daughter so well she got another employee on the phone who asked my daughter are you french? then of course my daughter stated started laughing and the joke was over. we got her! we all three laughed so hard it was so funny!  anyhows, the turkey took longer than the receipe called for and not everyone  showed up only 4 people, thank goodness, and vera who's 96 couldn'r t make make it cuz she can't make my stairs but she got lots of left overs so she ate well and i can guess she shared with my dog who lives with her, and i must say the turkey was the best turkey i  ever had. i usually don't eat the skin because it's always cooked in a bag so it's like rubbery you know like fatty, but mine was crispy almost like it had been fried. there were lots of left overs to take home. i  took the neck and tail and took it out to the raccoons and the liver heart and gizzard out out for my wild grey cat of course i cooked it all first, i wonder if they would have preferred it raw better. i just thought it would be nice to boil it though for them before presenting them with their tasty morsels.  i noticed the stuff for the grey cat was all gone this morning when i checked.  bet he liked that better than the normal cat food. as  for my critters, they got nothing. not about to have them throwing up all over. their stomaches aren't made of steel like the wild critters around here.

	 run around vegas
	 
    


well my friend had to go to the doctor today to have his eye looked at and it looks like he'll have to have out patient surgery, because he always waits until things get bad before he'll go to the doctor. we waited almost an hour to see the eye doctor once we got to her office. i hate the waiting. i of course am fretting over this christmas costume for my daughters clogging. i feel her instructor leaves us so little time sometimes to get the things we need. luckily the sequined skirt will be made. $25.00 for it another $2.00 for a sequined tie. then $10.00 for the bloomers to go under the skirt, $4.00 for the tights, $4.00 for bobbie socks, $6.00 (great deal) for the turtle neck shirt, $13.00 for the lighted glasses and $7.00 for the glow in the dark necklaces and braclets people get at concerts and fairs. so a total of $71.00 to be worn at only two performances the parade in boulder city and one performance at a mall in henderson. then the cost of gas to go to two wal-marts (i could have got it all at one had i known) and to a dance and costume store for the bloomers. luckily i  got the performing custome for $50.00 instead of the $80-$85 but no one could remember what the original person had paid for it, so i was quoted $50.00 and i know the custome was way more than that. $121.00 in customes and i refuse to get the warm up suit for $125.00 nor am i buying the dance bag. add the $40.00 monthly tuition into this and the hair pieces and who knows what else the instructor will add thoughout the year and this gets costly. and we have three performances in december one here locally than one in boulder city which is a about a 160 miles round trip and one in henderson which is pretty close to the same distance maybe about 20 miles less both ways. i am just glad my daughter is ok with one disipline and not two, i couldn't afford the two shoes required for irish step and another costume or two irish would require to perform. but the good news is we found all we needed and my friend got his eye done and friday we drive back for him to get a large skin cancer removed. it gives me a chance to drive and i did get two shrugs for christmas presents for my daughter. i saw a cute skirt for church for her also i want to buy her for christmas and hopefully the top that goes with it is cute and appropriate for sunday dress. then on the 28th our kitten gets spade and since i will have to be in las vegas all day with nothing to do i will be visiting the district attorneys office to go over a discrepancy i have been fighting for 2 yrs now. hopefully they will see they had not changed the computer therefore giving my daughters father a credit for child support that he was not due. i am not looking forward to this visit. believe me they have been nothing but nasty to me over the phone and though the mail, i guess in return i have been a little nasty back. they just seem to have their heads up their behinds. well say your prays for me that that will all go well for me.

	 a day at the lake
	 
    


 well my friend came from the neighboring town yesterday and we decided to leave town for the day. we stopped at the one and only supermarket in town and bought chicken. the only thing in theirdeli ready to eat other than burritos and corndogs. i wanted chili hotdogs from the store at the marina. we headed out there. well the lake was suppose to be up with the flood in january 2005 but i can tell you all of our boating and fishing areas in the upper arm of our lake were gone, i have never seen the lake so low and our boating and fishing and camping areas are gone because they are now accessed only by ground that is mud. so we looked around the store just to see what they had, in case we had to buy something. just an american flag keychain lighter, was all we could find. not much in there anymore, they had no hotdogs and chili, but they had nachos. so we got our chicken from the truck and took out nachos and sat at a table and then all the little sparrows wanted a bite so we had to get popcorn which the store is never out of.after eating we headed to the dock where we spent an hour or more feeding the wild life. the ducks, and lake gulls and the yucky carp, were as usual hungry and i knew i would rest easy knowing some of god's wild life had something in their stomach that night. it was serene and peaceful and the air was fresh, and we were out of town away from the idiots who inhabit this small town. after coming back into town we stopped again at the only store in town and well the one cop who it seems has it out for myself and my daughter had to have a run in with our friend that was with us. we cannot figure out if he did it cuz our friend was with us or because he was really doing his job. it's alittle suspicious, but my friend has had some problems in his past and i'm not sure he could be telling me the whole truth himself. it seems all went well with the police called to the store for the complete investigation and we came on home after going to mc donalds where my daughter ran into her enemy. however those of you who know about my other blog, i'll write about all that there. i'll tell about the drugs, sex and cop there for those interested in our little town.

	 we are doing pretty good with our days
	 
    


we have had some problems with school and my daughter is rpc'd but it has come to my attention that she leaves little details out. one involving the school and now i have made an ass of myself over it. the other happened last night when she told me that she was going to the movies and i asked what movie and she told me, so she just assumed i new that since chicken little was playing in our little theatre in our small town, i knew she and her friends were traveling to mesquite to go to the movies. so we are going to be working on her details.we got up yesterday and i made her and her friend go for a walk with me so i could get out. of course my daughter complained the whole time i visited with my friend and we will be addressing that issue. which we just did. so we wil see how it works out. then i after returning i spent the day out on the porch in the fresh air and in the afternoon i sat in the sun reading and drinking coffee and let my daughter pretty much run back and forth to the store. so she can no longer say i'm not letting her out. and then i let her go to the movies with her friends and now i must go cuz it's time for church.well so much for going to church my friend who gives me rides never showed up. it's funny i knew he wasn't going to. he always does this to us. i almost didn't get out of bed this morning nor did i want to. i wanted to miss church but i missed it last week so i figured i better make a show this week and so i got up did my hair and alittle bit of make-up, i was being lazy today with the make-up and hair, the girls too, and we all got dressed. and we waited, and he never showed. now had i decided to sleep in and not get up and get ready for church you know he would have showed up to take me to church, then he would have left all mad cuz he made the trip over here 1/4 of a mile away 1/2 mile round trip and then i would have heard of the cost of gas. ok i know this is about making it a better day but i just have to get this off my chest. now it's behind me. why is it that so many people cause such effects in a persons life. why can't we go through life with only ourselves effecting ourselves instead outside people their meanness, and their lack of duty effecting us. why can't only the positive people have to offer each other be the guiding force in all of our lives. i know i'm as guilty as the next person of causing friction in anothers life. guess i should ponder that question myself and work on myself.
