welcome to sanctuary wool!home of  homestead wool & gift farm &woolamina’s junk journals & supplies(and our very happy sheep!)













woolamina’s ephemera shoppe is a natural extension of my love of history, all things old- and rescue. books and stray photos have followed me home most of my life. it makes me sad to see them left behind in thrift/antique shops. their stories are important and call out to me. read more.finding them a new purpose in life and sharing them is my goal. read more…















the only 'rule' we have for the sheep is to be happy - and provide us with their wonderful fleeces to share with fiber artists around the world.the sheep offer wool, fiber and our crazy quilt handspun yarn, roving, washed, dyed and raw wool, batts and more. read more...
