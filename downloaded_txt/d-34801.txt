    watch now
  



the australian original documentary hot potato: the story of the wiggles has launched globally on prime video.directed by emmy-nominated director sally aitken (playing with sharks, david stratton: a cinematic life), the nostalgia-inducing trailer depicts the meteoric rise of the wiggles as they become the most successful children’s act of all time, along with the challenges they’ve faced over the past three decades.















this is the improbable story of four friends who recorded a one-off album of children’s music in the early ‘90s and changed the global music industry forever. recognisable by their blue, red, yellow, and purple skivvies, anthony field, murray cook, greg page, and jeff fatt become an unlikely music phenomenon, equipped with early childhood teaching fundamentals and a dose of self-belief. surmounting numerous rejections from industry producers, the wiggles take their career into their own hands and become the most successful children’s act of all time.the film is a backstage pass to one of the world's greatest entertainment stories, and features decades of personal archive footage and intimate access to their sold-out shows. it’s the story of a life of music, friendship, joy, and the enduring power of the child in all of us.
