jesus’ father, the spirit of god, was living within him 




john  


					10:30 -- jesus said, "i and the father are one.", 10:38 -- but if i do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the father is in me, and i in the father .", 14:20 -- on that day you will realize that i am in my father, and you are in me , and i am in you.				







							john 14:8-10						



philip said, “lord, show us the father and that will be enough for us.” 9 jesus answered: “don’t you know me, philip, even after i have been among you such a long time? anyone who has seen me has seen the father . how can you say, ‘show us the father’? 10 don’t you believe that i am in the father, and that the father is in me ? the words i say to you are not just my own. rather, it is the father, living in me, who is doing his work.
