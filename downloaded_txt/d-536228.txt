an  invitation


the jonathan ross hologram collection website was launched in 2005 and redesigned in 2013.

the new format has scope for lots more material so i would like to invite all the holographers whose work is featured here to submit background information, stories and images to supplement those i have provided. that way we can work together to make this the best resource on holographic imaging to be found on the web.






about  the collection


the jonathan ross hologram collection, based in london, uk, is one of the largest resources in the world for creative, display and commercial holography.

a number of touring exhibitions, containing work from the collection, have been presented in outstanding museums and galleries both within the uk and abroad. information about new acquisitions and exhibitions is added here on a regular basis.
