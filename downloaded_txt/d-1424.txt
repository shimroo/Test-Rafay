generosity begins with the self, and colman domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. in a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “everything i do is about radical love,” domingo says, over a coffee at the chelsea hotel in new york city. “it's about seeing each other. what am i doing as a creative? it's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. you know, that's all i can do. the macro i can't take care of. but i can take care of the micro.”
