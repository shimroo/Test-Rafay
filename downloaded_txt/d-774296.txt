bob caples memorial 3-wall tournamentmay 21 & 23, 2022. the annual caples 3 wall tournament & pro clinic were a huge success. thanks to all who helped out and a special thanks to those who contributed to allow us to have the pros at our tournament, it is really enjoyable having them be part of the action.the clinic was taught by sam esser, abe montijo and mikaila esser on friday afternoon/early evening.  it was very beneficial as they went over serve, return of serve, proper ceiling ball positioning and striking as well as doubles strategy in 3 wall.  very well received by the cincinnati group.play started saturday morning with reverse seeding with the pros in the open singles.  they had to play in which gave more players the chance to be on the court with them.  the finals were quite exciting as sam esser prevailed over bill mehilos in the tiebreaker.   the open doubles saw abe montijo and scott walker win over sam esser and david elkin.  we were also treated to a great exhibition match with mikaila esser and megan dorneker.  two exciting 21-19 games !!

 in 2012 the greater cincinnati handball associate (gcha) applied to host the united states handball  association’s national juniors 3-wall championship.  the process required completing an application form which asks questions to determine the gcha’s ability to furnish suitable lodging, obtain committed sponsors, provide highly functional playing facilities, and provide a safe, enjoyable environment for the players. using their mission statement “…..to promote camaraderie among its members, provide resources to execute tournaments, support youth handball, and maintain the 3-wall courts in green township in partnership with the trustees” as a guide, the gcha completed the form – met the requirements - and was awarded the tournament.
