if you know anything about world religions, then you know that easter is a big deal in christianity.in eastern orthodox churches, the big idea is stated this way, over and over, in rites for pascha (easter): “christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life” (see this flash mob celebration in lebanon).i don’t bring this up as a matter of evangelism or some other #triggerwarning behavior. i am noting that this is an essential fact about christianity, the world’s largest religious faith. easter isn’t a “bunny” thing.this brings us to one of the more unusual “religion ghosts” we spotted several times during the 20-year history of getreligion. here’s a case study at newsweek and another at facebook news. however, the classic version of this ghost appeared in the holy (in journalism terms) pages of the new york times in this 2014 feature: “hoping war-weary tourists will return to israel.” here is the key passage:on a recent afternoon in the old city of jerusalem, while fighting raged in gaza, bilal abu khalaf hosted a group of israeli tourists at his textile store in the christian quarter — one of jerusalem’s tourist gems. …“that’s the first group i’ve had here in more than a month,” mr. abu khalaf said. “there have been whole weeks when no one has been inside the shop. i’ve sold almost nothing the entire summer. business hasn’t been this bad since the first intifada in 1989, when the palestinian groups ordered us to shutter our stores.”nearby, the vast church of the holy sepulcher marking the site where many christians believe that jesus was buried, usually packed with pilgrims, was echoing and empty.now, what’s unusual about that? well, it helps to know that the printed version said:nearby, the vast church of the holy sepulcher marking the site where many christians believe that jesus is buried, usually packed with pilgrims, was echoing and empty.it’s all about the word “is,” isn’t it?inquiring minds wanted to know: was there anyone in the editorial chain at the world’s newspaper of record who knew the essential fact that traditional christians don’t believe jesus is buried anywhere? it’s that whole “easter” thing.

peter j. boyer: charged with covering faith for the new yorker, i found getreligion

it was a piece of great luck for me that the “publish” button was clicked on the new getreligion blog in 2004 just before i received the unlikeliest assignment of my career — the faith beat at the new yorker.i had been writing for the magazine for more than a decade, following my fancy on subjects ranging from politics and war to horse racing and hurricanes. i was a generalist, with the blessed (to me) freedom ofthoroughly exhausting my interest in a particular subject and then, once my piece was published, leaving it behind forever.this suddenly changed in november 2004, with the re-election of president george w. bush. the election had been a republican wipeout, with bush not only retaining the white house but republicans strengthening their hold on the house and senate — the biggest across-the-board gop sweep since ronald reagan’s blowout in 1980.the result, to say the least, had come as a shock to many in the news business, including (perhaps especially) those populating the corridors of the new yorker. the magazine had claimed a stake in the election, having published an endorsement of a presidential candidate — the democrat john kerry — for the first time in its 80-year history. the lengthy editorial framed the bush presidency as a creature of a supreme court “fiat,” and decried its “record of failure, arrogance and … incompetence.”to his credit, editor david remnick thought our readers deserved an explanation of the unexpected (to them) republican wave. polling suggested that republicans owed their victory to a cohort that the media quickly labeled “values voters,” people who supported the war on terror and believed that john kerry and the democrats didn’t represent their values.at the core of this group, of course, were people of faith who regularly attended worship services. my assignment: go out among these voters, and explain their motivations to the insular world the new yorker represents.i used to joke that i was assigned the faith beat because i was the guy at the new yorker who’d been to church, and i am, indeed, a believer. but i was anything but an expert on religion, and i quickly learned that very few (of any) reporters in the mainstream media were.happily, i quickly discovered getreligion.org, a website founded on the recognition that the mainstream press didn’t “get” religion.

during world war ii, when i was a young boy in the belgian congo, dad would turn on the large radio console and listen to bbc news.years later, he explained to me that charles degaulle, a french general, was in exile in brazzaville, the capital of french congo, across the river from what was then leopoldville, now kinshasa. we were upriver, in the ubangi territory, the extreme northwest corner of belgium’s largest african colony.my father said that many ex-patriates and congolese were worried that adolph hitler was going to send troops to central africa to capture general degaulle and occupy the region. north africa already had been occupied by the axis powers.so, the bbc provided our family with important news for our daily lives. when we moved to the united states, dad and i would listen to world news roundup with winston burdett as we ate breakfast.because of this, i realized how important accurate news is, and that shaped everything that i did while working at newspapers and magazines and eventually teaching journalism at three universities.the goal was to pass on to students the significance of accurate and complete reporting, and many have distinguished themselves in community and regional journalism as well as elite media.to help students prepare for media careers, we often brought outstanding journalists and scholars (especially those who also wrote for mass media) to campus. one of these events helped inspire the creation of getreligion.after the tragedy of september 11, 2001, our journalism team at the university of nebraska invited the legendary martin marty, fairfax m. cone distinguished service professor emeritus of the history of modern christianity at the university of chicago. in many polls, marty had been named as one of america’s most trusted religious leaders. he was a legend among religion-beat professionals — leading to the old saying that the formula for a front-page feature was a national study or poll, several local anecdotes and “a quote from martin marty.”marty, a native of nebraska, came to lecture about religion in the mainstream press. we asked terry mattingly, a journalism professor and syndicated religion columnist, to respond to marty’s presentation.

closing one door: whither 21st century religion and our beleaguered news media?

the religion guy wishes to underscore increasingly obvious aspects of 21st century america: one: religion is in crisis.two: the media are in crisis.three: media treatment of religion is in crisis.therefore, as getreligion.org disbands this week, something like this website has never been more needed.will anyone again provide informed running assessments of this complex and emotion-laden journalistic beat? please note that my question has also been raised this week by kenneth woodward, the guy’s toe-to-toe competitor for two decades as the newsweek and time religion writers during the newsmagazines’ heyday.starting february 13, the guy will be posting new analytical articles at religion unplugged, but on the way out the door feels urgency to reflect on the three points above.the third, how the media handle — and mishandle — religion, has been amply documented most every day on this very website, so we turn to the realities facing the other two. feel free to explore the 20 years of that work in the getreligion archive in the future.on number one, u.s. religion’s great depression is apparent anywhere you look, whether survey data on the rising unaffiliated “nones” or church groups’ own yearly counts on sunday school enrollment, weddings, baptisms and funerals. fellow religion writers can add many more particulars.gallup has invaluable data on cultural mood swings from polls that have posed the same questions across so many years. since 1973, gallup has asked americans whether they have “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in a wide list of social institutions. public trust has been tumbling across the board in the 21st century, so that only the military and small business now command confidence from majorities (and the military numbers are now headed down).

twenty years is a good run.unfortunately, getreligion should run for at least another 20 more years because the need is still there, and under the circumstances that terry mattingly has described of the current state of journalism, one could easily argue that the need is even greater now than it was when this weblog was born.but alas and alack, it seems that those with the charge of doing actual journalism have not been listening to the wisdom emanating from the authors on this brave site.instead of a revival of the classic american style of objective reporting, the owners of the fourth estate have denominated themselves into camps according to their respective narratives. that leaves them completely closed to the possibility of learning something new, including how to cover the religion beat.as a catholic media pro, this has been especially hard to watch because it makes me believe that there’s an agenda here, whether journalism executives want to admit it or not. when usa today sends out a breaking news alert that links to a story reporting what is old news on the clergy sex-abuse crisis, that makes a reader wonder why they are so uninformed about basic facts.clemente lisi’s latest of many getreligion posts about attacks on catholic churches shows that it’s not getting any better.we are talking about basic information, here.

a free press is part of the american identity. it’s also one of our essential institutions. a responsible press and a faith shaped by the god of charity and justice share two things in common: a concern for human dignity, and an interest in truth.this is why — to be specific — journalism coverage of religion is so important.believers and non-believers might define that word “truth” differently, and the differences might be serious. but an honest search for it creates a kind of maturity. and that maturity enables us to build a decent, common future through our choices here and now.freedom means that our choices matter. and our mistakes have consequences. that’s why so many people, increasingly today, seem to want a rescue from the burden of personal responsibility; deliverance from the work of thinking critically about themselves, their world, their mortality and the purpose of their lives.we all struggle with these temptations. americans as a people are no exception.so i can imagine an america without a genuinely free and fair press. and i can imagine an america with much less religious faith. we’re well on the way to getting both. but in either case, the result will be a very different america and a betrayal of the generations that built it.

it’s been almost nine years since that day in february 2015 when terry called me in alaska to ask if i’d join the getreligion team starting march 1.(we already had a reminder of the mattingly family sitting in our home; an enormous lion gifted by terry and debra to my daughter veeka when she was 6 1/2, about the time she stayed with them for several days while i was on a reporting trip. i’ve included a photo of the aslan-like creature with her delighted face just after she received it. the lion still keeps vigil by her window).the getreligion assignment, terry told me, was that i’d concentrate on west coast media and culture wars coverage. since then, my writing has ranged w-a-y beyond that, from john allen chau to josh harris. i have picked up a lot about analytical writing, hopefully have not made too many enemies and have shown some light into dark corners.sometimes i hit it out of the park. with the election of president donald trump and the ascendancy of his pastor, rev. paula white, i spread word of  an ascendant pentecostal/charismatic movement that was way more powerful than its non-charismatic evangelical counterpart.this was years ahead of the curve. not a whole lot of folks were listening until jan. 6, 2021.but you, dear readers, were seeing it here first, starting my nov. 10, 2020, column that begins with the frantic prayers in white’s florida church in the face of a trump loss. by the time my dec. 15, 2020, column about the “jericho march” in dc surfaced, there were prophets nationwide saying trump would win no matter what and other disturbing trends that not enough reporters were tracking.why? these prophets were considered wackos by most.my jan. 11, 2021, column, about the aftermath of jan. 6 (when some of those ‘wackos’ showed up on the streets of washington) and the resulting “civil war” among charismatics got a lot more ears — and a ton of hits. by this time, the “trump prophets” who had erroneously prophesied that the 45th president would win a second consecutive term were in the middle of a theological maelstrom. the day of biden’s inauguration, i penned one last column on the topic here.i count the work i did on the prophets and my coverage on cardinal theodore mccarrick as among the best work i did for this blog.

“what do you mean by blog?” i asked my friend terry mattingly nearly a quarter of a century ago in jerusalem as we attended a conference on religion in the news, which took place just before pope john paul ii's millennial visit.“the style is informal and conversational,” tmatt explained. “and,” he promised, “it won't take you as long to write a blog post as it does a news story or a column.”terry's vision was to create an online place — we didn't use the word platform then — for journalists to write what he called orphaned religion stories. you know, religion ghost stories, stories with missing in action religion hooks, buried in plain sight.i was fascinated and sceptical.i was fascinated because i was writing and producing cbc radio's “spirituality” show and steering it towards the kind of unembarrassed religion coverage i'd grown up with on the bbc. as a career-long public broadcasting staffer who assuaged my writing itch by freelancing, i loved talking to unusual,thoughtful people. as a baptised catholic turned anglican via british evangelicalism, i knew the religion beat was full of unheard voices. l'abri and os guinness had taught me that journalism was as worthwhile a vocation as being a vicar or an academic or a mother. you could even combine them!how i longed to be part of terry's vision. but i was sceptical because as a full-time staffer at canadian broadcasting, i couldn't take on a regular commitment outside the mothership. worse still would be management perceiving my association with — god-buddha-allah forbid — a “religious” outfit of some kind making judgments about journalism.

to be honest, i still can’t remember how i found getreligion.thanks to google, i was able to find what i’m guessing what my first getreligion shout-out — it was a post by julia duin some seven years ago about the southern baptist megachurch leader robert jeffress claiming that god had given the once and potentially future president donald trump the authority to kill north korean supreme leader kim jong-un.to be honest, jeffress’ comments were made in 2017, which was an era whose troubles i now view with a kind of nostalgia. sigh, i used to worry about covid-19.the tip i’d submitted to this weblog about that story reveals that i had only begun learning to critically view the media and the world in the way getreligion taught to me and many other readers and listeners. back then, i thought it was funny to point out the new york daily news’ editorial incompetence for having published the sentence “though shalt not kill.” you know, as opposed to “thou shalt not kill.” it’s part of that whole ten commandments thing.
