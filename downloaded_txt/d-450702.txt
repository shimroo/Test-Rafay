“we have a legacy to continue and a future to protect.” klint macro, acsl president​






in 1921, the allegheny county sportsmen’s league was first organized by various sportsmen groups in allegheny county under the leadership of charles r. hobson (1880-1954). its purpose was to enhance conservation of the outdoor resources of pennsylvania and increase the recreation found throughout the commonwealth. the protection, preservation and conservation of wildlife and other natural resources as well as the improvement of hunting and fishing within pennsylvania were the goals set forth. one of its first projects was to lobby to have north park lake, just north of pittsburgh, stocked with fish.
charles r. hobson 
(circa 1925)
charles hobson was, by profession a businessman in real estate and insurance, originally from somerset county, residing in homestead, pa. his passion for wildlife conservation and sportsmen’s interests motivated him to devote much of his time and effort into the formation of the league. he is widely credited with envisioning and facilitating the formation of the allegheny county sportsmen's league. ​


a founding member club of the league, homestead sportsmen's club, has the distinction of being the first organized sportsmen's club in the united states of america and is recorded in the us congressional record as such. in 1925, the acsl elected its first president, dr. e.r. raymaley (1878-1971) of the wilkinsburg sportsmen's club.​over the years, the acsl has championed clean streams, wildlife management, planting trees, vermin control, hunter safety, trout stocking, expanding fishing and hunting on sundays, clean air, erosion prevention, sportsmen’s rights, youth programs, civil defense, wildlife disease prevention, water purification, and protection of our 2nd amendment and article 1 section 21 of the pa constitution. ​







during world war ii, the acsl was the only recognized armed organization in allegheny county other than the us armed forces and law enforcement agencies. the ‘acsl sheriff’s rifles’ was reported by robert j. corbett, commander of the sheriff’s rifles, as being a “hard hitting defensive combat unit whose sole purpose is to destroy the enemy”. the allegheny county rifles dissolve after the war, but the acsl, and its passion for fighting continued on.
 

​today, the acsl is continuing to fight for liberty, conservation, wildlife, and our natural resources. in 2021, during the acsl’s annual presidents dinner, pa senator jim brewster presented a special senatorial proclamation to acsl president, klint macro.​the proclamation reads: whereas, the senate of pennsylvania takes great pride in recognizing those organizations which, through adherence to the highest standards of service, contribute in a meaningful way toward a better and more protective society; and whereas, allegheny county sportsmen's league inc., is celebrating the momentous occasion of its 100th anniversary; and whereas, organized in 1921 and incorporated in 1933, allegheny county sportsmen's league inc., strives to promote and foster the protection and conservation of our renewable wildlife resources through hunting and fishing and to promote the improvement of hunting, fishing, and competitive shooting. the league has been instrumental in the passage of legislation to preserve this commonwealths natural resources, including the pennsylvania clean stream act, the bituminous open pit mining act, the solid waste management act, and amendments to the clean air act. allegheny county sportsmen's league inc. has developed a strong reputation for the highest quality of service throughout its history. by steadfast adherence to the principles of fairness, reliability, and integrity, it has become a leader in the community and a model that is worthy of emulation. over the years, those in leadership positions as well as its members, have contributed in a tremendous way to its growth and development. now therefore, the senate of the commonwealth of pennsylvania congratulates allegheny county sportsmen's league inc. upon its richly deserved recognition; extends warmest wishes for a future replete with ever-increasing success; ​and directs that a copy of this document, sponsored by senator jim brewster, be transmitted to the allegheny county sportsmen's league. the allegheny county sportsmen’s league is continuing its legacy into its next century!
