 m’cheyne on answers to prayer  - pastoral letter, february 1839





 m’cheyne on answers to prayer  - pastoral letter, february 1839
from memoirs and remains, page 229-232.

i do not now remember all the points i was led to speak upon to you, but one, i think, was entirely omitted —i mean the subject of answers to prayer.
god left it for us to meditate on now. oh, there is nothing that i would have you to be more sure of than this, that "god hears and answers prayer." there never was, and never will be, a believing prayer left unanswered. meditate on this, and you will say: "i love the lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplication" (ps. 116. 1).

first, god often gives the very thing his children ask at the very time they ask it. you remember hannah (1 sam. 1. 10): she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the lord, and wept sore. "give unto thine handmaid a man-child." this was her request. and so she went in peace, and the god of israel heard and granted her the petition that she had asked of him; and she called the child's name samuel, that is, "asked of god." oh, that you could write the same name upon all your gifts! you would have more joy in them, and far larger blessings along with them. 
you remember david, in ps. 138:3 "in the day that i cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul" 
you remember elijah (1 kings 17. 21): "o lord my god! i pray thee let this child's soul come into him again. and the lord heard the voice of elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived." 
you remember daniel (9. 20, 21): "while i was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people israel, and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god; yea, whiles i was speaking in prayer, even the man gabriel, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation." oh, what encouragement is here for those among you who, like daniel, are greatly beloved, who study much in the books of god's word, and who set your face unto the lord to seek by prayer gifts for the church of god !
expect answers while you are speaking in prayer. sometimes the vapours that ascend in the morning come down in copious showers in the evening. so may it be with your prayers. take up the words of david (ps. 5. 3): "my voice shalt thou hear in the morning; in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up." 
you remember, in acts 12.5, peter was cast into prison, "but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him."and, behold, the same night the answer
surprised them at the door. oh, what surprises of goodnes and grace god has in store for you and me, if only we pray without ceasing! 
if you will pray in union to jesus, having childlike confidence towards god, having the spirit of adoption, crying abba within you,— seeking the glory of god more than all personal benefits, i believe that in all such cases you will get the very thing you ask, at the very time you ask it. before you call, god will hear; and while you are speaking, he will answer.
oh, if there were twenty among you who would pray thus, and persevere therein like wrestling jacob, you would get whatever you ask! yea, the case of daniel shows that the effectual fervent prayer of one such believer among you will avail much. "delight thyself in the lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart" (ps. 38. 4).

second, god often delays the answer to prayer for wise reasons.
the case of the syrophenician woman will occur to you all (matt. 15. 21-28). how anxiously she cried, "have mercy on me, o lord, thou son of david! but jesus answered her not a word." again and again she prayed, and got no gracious answer. her faith grows stronger by every refusal. she cried, she followed, she kneeled to him, till jesus could refuse no longer. "o woman, great is thy faith! be it unto thee even as thou wilt." dear praying people, "continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgivings." do not be silenced by one refusal. jesus invites importunity by delaying to answer.
ask, seek, knock. "the promise may be long delayed, but cannot come too late." you remember, in the parable of the importunate widow, it is said, "shall not god avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? i tell you that he will avenge them speedily" (luke 18. 1-8). this shows how you, who are god's children, should pray. you should cry day and night unto god. this shows how god hears every one of your cries, in the busy hour of the day-time, and in the lonely watches of the night. he treasures them up from day to day; soon the full answer will come down: "he will answer speedily." the praying souls beneath the altar, in rev. 6. 9-11, seem to show the same truth, that the answer to a believer's prayers may, in the adorable wisdom of god, be delayed for a little season, and that many of them may not be fully answered till after he is dead. again, read that wonderful passage, rev. 8. 3, where it is said that the lord jesus, the great intercessor with the father, offers to god the incense of his merits, with the prayers of all saints, upon the golden altar which is before the throne. christ never loses one believing prayer. the prayers of every believer, from abel to the present day, he heaps upon the altar, from which they are continually ascending before his father and our father; and when the altar can hold no more, the full, the eternal answer will come down. do not be discouraged, dearly beloved, because god bears long with you— because he does not seem to answer your prayers. your prayers are not lost. when the merchant sends his ships to distant shores, he does not expect them to come back richly laden in a single day: he has long patience. "it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord." perhaps your prayers will come back, like the ships of the merchant, all the more heavily laden with blessings, because of the delay.

third, god often answers prayer by terrible things. so david says in ps. 65.5: "by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, o god of our salvation." and all of you who are god's children have found it true. some of you have experienced what john newton did when he wrote that beautiful hymn, "i asked the lord that i might grow.” 
you prayed with all your heart, "lord, increase my faith." in answer to this, god has shown you the misery of your connection with adam. he has revealed the hell that is in your heart. you are amazed, confounded, abashed. you cry, "o wretched man that i am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" you cleave to a saviour god with a thousand times greater anxiety. your faith is increased. your prayer is answered by terrible things.
some of us prayed for a praying spirit: “lord, teach us to pray." god has laid affliction upon us. waves and billows go over us. we cry out of the depths. being afflicted, we pray. he has granted our heart's desire. our prayer is answered by terrible things.

fourth, god sometimes answers prayer by giving something better than we ask. an affectionate father on earth often does this. the child says, father, give me this fruit. no, my child, the father replies; but here is bread, which is better for you.
so the lord jesus dealt with his beloved paul (2 cor. 12. 7-9). there was given to paul a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of satan to buffet him. in bitterness of heart he cried, " lord, let this depart from me."
no answer came. again he prayed the same words. no answer still. a third time he knelt, and now the answer came, not as he expected. the thorn is not plucked away-the messenger of satan is not driven back to hell; but jesus opens wide his loving breast, and says, "my grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength, is made perfect in weakness."
oh, this is something exceeding abundant above all that he asked, and all that he thought. ah, this is something better than he asked, and better than he thought! surely god is able to do "exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think" (eph. 3. 20). dear praying believers, be of good cheer. god will either give you what you ask, or something far better.
are you not quite willing that he should choose for you and me? you remember that even jesus prayed, "o my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me!" that desire was not granted, but there appeared unto him an angel from heaven strengthening him (luke 22. 43). he received what was far better — strength to drink the cup of vengeance. some of you, my dear believing flock, have been praying that, if it be god's will, i might be speedily restored to you, that god's name might be glorified; and i have been praying the same. do not be surprised if he should answer our prayers by giving us something above what we imagined. perhaps he may glorify himself by us in another way than we thought. "oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! for of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. amen."
these things i have written, that you may come boldly to the throne of grace. the lord make you a praying people.
"strive together with me in your prayers to god for me." "i thank my god upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all, making request with joy." now, the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another, according to christ jesus
“the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; and the god of peace be with you all, amen."

hymn: closer to me (elizabeth prentiss)





i was happy to stumble across this hymn by elizabeth prentiss today. i had never even heard of it before. i find it quite unique in that we are singing to one another an invitation from christ to draw near to him. so often our songs reflect our desire for him to draw near to us (prentiss herself wrote, "more love to thee"), but in this hymn, it is christ speaking to us to draw near to him. press closer! lovely words to meditate on at the end of lovely lord's day.closer  to  mepress  close,  my  child,  to  me; closer  to  me. earth  hath  no  resting-place 
ready  for  thee; 
straight  to  my  bosom  flee; 
press  close,  my  child,  to  me, 
closer,  closer,  closer  to  me. 

love,  pleasure,  riches,  fame, 
all  may  be  thine, 
and  thy  immortal  soul 
still  will  repine; 
i  must  be  all  to  thee: 
press  close,  my  child,  to  me, 
closer,  closer,  closer  to  me. 

life  may  for  thee  contend, 
hard  toil  and  care 
strive  to  divide  from  me, 
crowd  everywhere; 
let  them  my  servants  be; 
press  thou,  my  child,  to  me, 
closer,  closer,  closer  to  me. 

grief  of  thy  heart  may  make 
a  desert  drear. 
yet  there  my  sufferers  learn 
my  voice  to  hear; 
calling,  with  earnest  plea, 
press  close,  my  child,  to  me , 
closer,  closer,  closer  to  me. 

come,  then,  my  child,  to  me, 
make  thyself  mine; 
i  give  myself  to  thee, 
i  will  be  thine; 
joy,  grief,  and  care  shall  be 
ties  binding  thee  to  me, 
closer,  closer,  closer  to  me.

 keep your sails up






here is a little bit of free advice from a pastor who has been “at sea” for some time. one of the great advantages to maintaining a weekly prayer meeting is that you will catch the wind when it blows. 

just this past week, two of our pastors were down and out with sickness. while we were able to get through our morning duties, prudence suggested we recuperate in the evening. that left the prayer meeting to the last man standing. i might say that, at this point in our church’s life, even if all the pastors were out of commission, i am sure the prayer meeting would stand. we have learned how to pray in some measure. praise god.

but it seems like this prayer meeting was one of those where the lord particularly blessed. i have always said that the single most difficult area of church life to evaluate is her corporate prayer. how can we? who are we to judge whether or not the lord is listening, acting, enjoying, and responding to our prayers? there is a sense where only the great day will reveal that. but, for as much as we can tell, it seemed like the wind blew on sunday night. 

“the wind blows where it wishes…” to this we might add, it also blows when it wishes. and this is my point. 

because we have a regular prayer meeting, our sails were up when the wind blew. praise god. 

the days of calm waters come when we have to break out the oars and row hard to make any seeming progress. god has his purposes in this as well. but, even then, keep your sails up! you never know when the wind will blow and, oh, the joy of sailing along with the spirit’s help as we petition the throne of our king!

how to wreck a revival





in talking with some other pastors recently, i was encouraged to hear of a what appears to be a unique work among young adults in our city. many of our churches have seen significant growth with this demographic, with many of these young folks becoming vital members of our churches. 

i shared some of this encouraging news with our own young adults and then gave them a bit of a heads up. if this is a reviving work of god in our city, we ought to learn from the past and avoid interfering with it or wrecking it! to that end, i told them to avoid three things.

1. dangerous ethics
almost every revival has been sullied in some corner by those old sins of the flesh like gossip, unrighteous anger, quarrelsomeness, jealousy and general relational immaturity. since the holy spirit is the mover of authentic revival, it would make sense that our mistreatment of other believers would thwart or discourage his ongoing work. why? because anger, malice and slander of others grieves him and we cannot conceive of him blessing that which breaks his heart. 

2. doctrinal error
a joy of true revival is to witness the new birth in many souls and the refreshing of the souls of those who already know god. sometimes this excitement leads to a search for novel ideas. sometimes it opens the door for unqualified teachers to have a platform. and if doctrinal error creeps into the movement, it will bring trouble. good doctrine does not divide, it unifies. thus, any time we suspect revival might be occurring in grand or localized ways, we do well to fight like crazy to keep the focus on the gospel and getting everyone on board with who jesus is and what he has done for us. 

3. destructive extremism
we are all pragmatists at heart and prone to believe that the things we are doing or saying are creating certain results. this can lead to placing an undue reliance on areas of christian freedom. for example, demanding that only one form of courtship or dating is “biblical.” whenever a non-bible issue is elevated to the place of christian faithfulness, we promote hypocrisy and/or works-righteousness. and these things lead only to division, discouragement and despair. 

so, my counsel to our young adults was this. let no one despise you for your youth, but rather in speech, conduct and purity show yourselves to be an example to the entire church. walk humbly with your god and read your bible a lot. do not tolerate the sins of the flesh, but strive to grow in self-control. yield your entire self to god. this is a unique season of life and there are trajectories to be set for the next 20, 40, 60 years. so, spend much time in prayer and keep looking to god to do good, to save many and to build his church. after all, in a little while you will all be the leaders and pillars of this family.

through - a poem reflecting on psalm 77





 through (psalm 77)
the lightening, thunder, whirlwind and rain
all of the trials causing me pain,
tempt my weak faith to doubt you are there,
to think you’ve forgotten or become unfair.

until i remember your great deeds of old,
your holy redemptions, dramatic and bold,
and get my poor heart and my eyes to agree;
you walk with me unseen through the deep seaby paul martin

christian parenting resources and... opinions!





i have had the privilege of preaching, writing and collecting what i consider to be wise material on parenting for many years. one of my sabbatical projects has been working on a new parenting class i hope to teach in the fall. it is called something like, pastor paul's parenting opinions. the reason i am stressing opinions, is that the bible actually has very little to say about the details of parenting. wise parents will talk to those who have gone before them and collect (and evaluate) their opinions to chart their own course. however, that does not mean the bible has nothing to say about parenting. so, here is some of the material i have been blessed by or preached on or written about over the years. i hope it is useful to you!part one: articlestexts of scripture you need to think hard about in order to be a faithful parenthttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/for-parents/parenting-wisdom-101childhood conversionby jim elliffhttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/for-parents/childhood-conversion---elliff walter on the familyhttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/letters-from-walter/walter-on-the-family “well, well, well. it's been longer than a hereford's tail since i wrote last and i am glad to get back to pen and pad. the colder weather makes sitting still a might easier to do, and all that time on the tractor this fall has filled my head with perhaps a couple good things to share with you. mrs. walter is all in a wonder that you would want to hear my babbling again, but what's a wife for if not to remind you that you're not half as good as you once thought you were!”walter on parenting little childrenhttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/letters-from-walter/on-parenting-little-children“now, the lord never gives anything that he doesn't include the instructions or resources for - but what i have always found peculiar is just how little he says about parenting. i recall those early days of our first little olive shoot (ps 128:3), when we wondered when exactly it was we stopped being children and started having them!”walter on being a dadhttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/letters-from-walter/on-being-a-dad“thanks for taking the time to read these letters. you've got more patience than a chipmunk stuck at a turtle-crossing!well, last time i wrote i tried to make clear that the most important thing for your family is a happy marriage. husband and wife loving each other and living in unity will create a family bond stronger than duct tape and binder twine.today i want to move on to the role the husband plays in the family.”walter on being a momhttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/letters-from-walter/on-being-a-mom “besides climbing up a greased fireman's pole backwards and blindfolded with your arms tied behind your back, there are few things more difficult in life than being a mom.“authority and submission in the churchhttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/theological-issues/authority-and-submission why keep the whole family together for church?https://www.gfcto.com/why-keep-the-whole-family-together-for-churchwhat does god want from me? some important thoughts for childrenhttps://www.gfcto.com/articles/for-children/what-does-god-want-from-mepart two: audio sermonslet's just parent like christianshttps://www.gfcto.com/sermons/sermon/2021-10-17/lets-just-parent-like-christiansoctober 17, 2021 speaker: paul martin series: let's just act like christianstopic: expository preaching verse: ephesians 6:4–6:4 1. do not exasperate your kids2. lovingly stop and correct bad behaviours in your kids3. teach and urge compliance to the truth in your kidsfamily dynamics (part 1)https://www.gfcto.com/sermons/sermon/2015-11-22/family-dynamics-part-1 november 22, 2015 speaker: paul martin series: be wise, young man, be wiseverse: proverbs 1:1–31:311. the kids

 the elements of the internal call to the ministry - wilhelmus á brakel





 the elements of the internal call to the ministry
this commission is both internal and external. an extraordinary, divine declaration is not an element of this internal commission. god does not do this, or does so only on very rare occasions, and thus one need not wait for this. there are other matters by which one may be assured of his internal calling.

to these belong, first of all, a knowledge of the office. one must know what it means to be a servant of christ, to be the mouth of the lord, to proclaim that great gospel, to teach ignorant men the way of salvation, to be instrumental in delivering men from the devil, and to lead them to christ. one must know that it consists in comforting those who mourn, stirring up the indolent, bringing back those who have strayed, exposing hypocrites and temporal believers to themselves, defending the truth against error, rebuking the ungodly, helping to keep out or expelling from the church those who lead offensive lives, and adorning the church, so that by the holiness of those who profess the truth she would bring glory to christ. one must know that it consists in being an example and in being able to give an account of the souls entrusted to him. how can he who is neither thoroughly acquainted with these matters, nor perceives the weightiness of it all, nor takes this to heart, have intentions to be faithful? all of this must be known, considered, and experienced in order to be conscious of one‟s calling.

secondly, there must be some knowledge of one‟s aptitude for this work. a fundamental knowledge of divine truths and thus being satisfied with a speculative knowledge of these is not sufficient. rather, one must experience the power of these truths in his own heart, having been converted thereby. he will thus be able to speak from his own experience. he must also have the aptitude to clearly express his thoughts, and must have a voice which is capable of being heard by others. even though the most qualified person must say, “who is sufficient for these things” (2 cor 2:16), one must nevertheless be conscious of some aptitude. shortly we shall consider this aptitude more comprehensively. 

thirdly, there must be an extraordinary love a) for christ and a desire to make him known; b) for the church to present her as a chaste virgin to christ (2 cor 11:2), and to cause her to shine forth with light and holiness to the honor of god; c) for the souls of the unconverted to snatch them from the fire, as well as of the converted to strengthen, comfort, and continually provide them with spiritual food.

fourthly, one must be willing to deny all that is of the world, such as honor, material goods—yes, even life itself. if someone is of low social status and wishes to become someone of renown or to acquire material goods by way of the ministry, his objective is entirely wrong. he would be much happier as a shoemaker, for in my opinion there is no man more abominable than an unregenerate minister who uses the holy things of god to his own advantage.
fifthly, there must be a great desire for this work (1 tim 3:1). there must be continual stirrings to give oneself to the lord by way of this work, and there must be a concern about whether or not one is called. there must be anxiety when ulterior motives are perceived in the heart which in turn causes one to entertain the thought to refrain from this work; or when the heaviness of the task, and a sense of inability causes one to look up against this work, engendering a desire to be relieved from this work, as with moses and jeremiah. the stirrings will nevertheless persist and overcome the objections. this in turn will give him more liberty before the lord and he will find himself more willing than beforehand because by the objections he will have a clearer view of the motives of his heart. then his heart does not condemn him, but rather convinces him of his sincerity in this matter.

by these and similar arguments one can ascertain his internal calling.from, the christian's reasonable service, volume ii, 122-123.

 why i plan to go to the last “together for the gospel”





when the fella’s announced the first together for the gospel (the conference not yet known as t4g), i decided to travel down with my pal, challies, to see what was up.

i recall being pretty surprised at a guy named mahaney. those were some long introductions! dever with his book endorsements and crowd surveys was as expected. i had not heard mohler before, nor duncan. both were a delight. but, the real joy was when the four dudes would sit together right after somebody preached and talk about the sermon. they were modelling something quite wonderful… taking the word and, as the puritans put it, “improving upon it.” not so much making the sermon better, but helping the truth to settle by pondering and discussing it. 

also, the chairs were too close together. and does anybody have footage of sproul going to town on the dude from australia that took a picture of him with a flash only one minute after someone had just announced no flash photography?

the highlight of that first trip was the 25 canadians standing around a room in the galt house introducing ourselves to each other. that was a first meeting for many relationships that last to this day. and that little gathering of canucks grew into something we really looked forward to at each conference. t4g was always great at finding us a spot to meet and we were delighted to make introductions. there were hundreds of canucks at our last breakout. 

two years after that first conference we were back and things had gotten quite larger. one thing i always appreciated about this meeting was that numbers were not announced. i have no idea how many people were at anything. it didn’t matter. that was not the point. the point was to gather together with gospel-believing brothers and sisters from across the globe in order to build relationships, be strengthened in our faith and to try and keep the main thing the main thing. 

mark dever is a friend of mine. i love him a lot. and his gregarious, open-handed approach to this conference (and life!) were so shaping. with that openness came risk and sometimes things did not go as planned, but that is fine. unless you are the kind of person who has to control everything. 

every two years i would hem and haw about going back. it is a bit of an ordeal to cross the border, arrange accommodations and pay for it all in american dollars. we are not a huge church and i am cautious about using money saints have donated to pay for things like this. still, the lord seemed to make a way to go back every year. i have been at every one. 

the 2020 t4g was supposed to be the first father-son conference for me and my boy. he had been asking to come for years and we gave him that trip as a christmas present. yeah, that christmas. the one right before covid. so, will and i watched t4g ’20 from our basement. not quite the same thing. but, it was something. 

when mark and lig announced 2022 would be the last conference, i was of mixed emotions. at first, i was quite sad at the thought. so many good connections made, so many relationships strengthened, so many good conversations and wonderful preaching moments… i hated the thought of losing that. 

but, then i was relieved. not for me, more for the guys. for whatever reason, it seems like everybody and their brother hates “big eva” and somehow lops t4g into that… whatever that is. 

if one was able to simply take this conference for what it said it was - a gathering of people who love the gospel - there was so much to be gained from it. the celebriti-ism and nonsense that marks so much of evangelicalism was always pushed back. i mean, guys like me want to hear piper and sproul and macarthur. but, we are also thrilled to listen to the ed moores and bobby scotts of the world, those faithful pastors of smaller works who are little known outside of their local churches. in fact, some of the greatest blessings to my own soul have come from the unlikeliest of sources. 

so, why i am planning to go back for the last one? not for the nostalgia. i mean, it doesn’t take much to make me cry anymore, so i will likely weep like a baby at the last song. but, that is not why i plan to go. 


i plan to go so i can see old friends, in particular, fellow pastors who stay faithful in the ministry. (ask any guy who has been pastoring for as long as me how much it means to have long friendships with faithful fellow pastors!) so, i will try to connect with guys like wiley, trent, mez, clint, steve, ryan, justin, mark, dan and a gazillion others. 
i plan to go so i can be refreshed in my love for god. as a pastor, few things are as encouraging to me as sitting under the word of god and taking in all the hard work of another servant of the king. i will go eager, ready to be rebuked, encouraged, edified and strengthened. 
i plan to go so i can be sung to. i love the gift of singing and i will admit to finding special encouragement from thousands of voices declaring the truth around me. it is difficult to put into words how meaningful this is.
i plan to go in order to sing. see above. i want to do my part to bless the brothers and sisters around me.
i plan to go so i can have more fellowship with my staff. they will be there and we will be able to debrief sermons, peruse the bookstore together and enjoy some good food. 
and i plan to go because i want my son to know what all of this is like. god willing, he will come with me and we will do all of it together. 


nobody asked me to write this post. i am not trying to convince anyone else to do something they do not want to do. but, i am happy to stand with many others and say how much this conference has blessed my soul and helped my ministry. and i am happy to stand with all who are there, together, for the gospel.

grace fellowship church is now accepting applications to our second pastoral internship. unlike our first class (held over five months through the brunt of the covid-19 lockdowns), this session will run from september 13, 2021 to december 6, 2021. we are accepting two interns for this 12 week session and applications must be submitted by july 31, 2021. accepted applicants will be notified by august 13, 2021.

interns are required to meet on site at grace fellowship church on monday mornings, plus tuesday through friday workdays (9-5). in addition, interns are required to attend all the public meetings of grace fellowship church and other evening and weekend meetings connected to their internship as assigned (hospital visits, counselling sessions, etc). 

the internship includes personal mentoring plus ministry involvement and exposure. however, the brunt of the internship consists in assigned readings in the areas of pastoral ministry, spiritual development, baptist church life (ecclesiology) and bible proclamation (preaching). the interns will submit a written paper each week interacting with these readings. these papers form the basis of a weekly group discussion on the topics assigned. 

applicants should be men who have or are nearly completed seminary training and intend to pursue full-time pastoral ministry. they will demonstrate good leadership skills, a wide and warm-hearted christian love for others and a zeal for the people of god. existing pastors looking for a useful sabbatical program might also consider applying. there are no age restrictions. 

applicants have until july 31, 2021 to apply.

more details:


the interns will meet on monday mornings (9am-1pm) with the staff elders of grace fellowship church to review the previous sunday gatherings, work through a particular text together, consider various pastoral situations and discuss their reading from the previous week. these sessions are led by pastor martin. 



interns will join the staff meeting on tuesday mornings, as well as the regular elders' meetings, as observers. 



on friday afternoons, the interns will meet with the staff elders for the weekly sermon preview, service previews and final preparation for sunday.



much of the other office time through the week will be devoted to reading and writing. weekly papers must by submitted by 5pm each friday. 



interns are expected to apply for membership at grace fellowship church (if not members already) and attend all services of the church. they will also be invited to attend certain other meetings as observers



each intern will be assigned certain ministry leaders or members of the church to interview and learn from. 



each intern will be remunerated (a stipend paid out over the course of the internship) and supplied with books for the assigned readings. 


more details can be sought by contacting pastor steve kim.
