    wayne hausknecht has been making fine custom doors and
        furniture in tucson, arizona since 1981.
 
i recently sold
      the restored adobe building that was my shop, put all my tools in storage
            and after 38 years plan to take a well deserved sabbatical while
    i design and build a new studio.
 
september 28, 2021
my sabbatical has evolved 
        into retirement. 
        be safe everyone.
