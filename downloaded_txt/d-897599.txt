culinary synaesthesia
[02 aug 2009|08:38pm]





so, this morning i half-glanced at frank o'hara's lunch poems on the coffee table and for a second i thought-- what if the "lunch" in the title referred to the poems themselves rather than the circumstances of their composition.  i've been thinking about this all day: if various poems, books, etc. were food, what sort of food would they be? o'hara's lunch poems would be, i think, black and white cookies, quintessentially postwar new york, popular, animated by contrast. marx is roasted root vegetables, turnips or, more likely beets.  langland is, obviously, a ploughman's, margery kempe is rice pudding with a twist, cardamon pods, perhaps.  troilus and criseyde is figs, romeo and juliet is blancmange or anything with almonds, really, the canterbury tales are some sort of roast fowl, i believe, though i'm not quite as clear on that, the sherlock holmes stories are licorice allsorts, and do androids dream of electric sheep is most certainly sushi (uni nigri comes to mind).and so on and so forth.  i have to go play quizzo now, but what do you think?

dear lj braintrust:i'm looking for a place to stay in berlin for two nights at the end of next week.  my budget is about 75 euros per night, and hostels are fine (though i'd prefer not to pay that much if i am going to stay in one).  any suggestions?actually-- if we're in for a penny let's go in for a pound: you have 48 hours in berlin.  you are me.  you like churches, beer, quirky museums and food markets.  you don't have very much money.  what do you do?

lot 1974: stuart family.  an extensive and interesting collection of portraits of royal personages of the house of stuart, statesmen, naval, and military commanders and clergy; views of cities, towns, castles, churches, ancient buildings, arms, curious initial letters, etc. with descriptions in manuscript very neatly written, also sundry miscellaneous papers and cuttings relating to the stuart family, mounted and arranged in 2 vols. blue morocco, gilt edges, and a parcel of ms. papers and cutting sufficient to form an additional volume.this curious collection, relative to the stuarts, must have been the result of immense labour and enthusiastic feeling for the subject, nothing but the stimulus of ardent devotion could have accomplished the task.  the whole comprises a collection of facts, historical and biographical, for which it would seem to have required a life's application merely to have read the volumes from whence the extracts have been obtained, to say nothing of the time required for transcription.(it sold for 5p15s6d, or about £4,447.92 in today's money.  a fifteenth century manuscript of ambrosius sold in the same sale for 8 shillings 6 pence.  by contrast, volume of tracts printed by caxton went for an absolutely jaw-dropping £200.)

have i mentioned how much the victoria's secret pink line bothers me?eta: oh grosseta: the contact for the u of m licensing program is at kristen ablauf, at licensing@umich.edu, if any of you out there are wondering. it was the monokini that put me over the edge.eta: but at least it can be insipid and funny, as in the description for these pants, which notes that "bottoms can be cut off to shorten."  amazing!  for this special feature i would love to pay $44.50 for a pair of sweatpants.

06:10 saturday morning= espresso and sotheby's catalogues from 1938. # 06:23 my saturday styles: espresso at the bl and sotheby's catalogues from 1938. # 06:38 is waiting to see if anyone actually shushes the voluble group of preteens taking cell phone pics in front of king george's books. # 14:21 saturday night w laptop and a bottle of wine.  going to drink enough of the latter to convince myself to work on the former (hah! right.) #automatically shipped by loudtwitter

05:00 does not understand the mass impulse to queue up outside the british library before it opens in the morning. # 06:51 has discovered, when looking for a sotheby's catalogue, that in 1955, julia warhola, andy warhol's mother, wrote a book called "holy cats". # 07:40 has greek yogurt and honey to put in it. #automatically shipped by loudtwitter

18:14 enjoyed her celebratory baraklava. # 04:30 is listening to lady sovereign and wishing she had better speakers. # 08:08 everything is banal yet terribly complicated. # 11:33 sings a ballad of poor time management. # 13:59 jazz with the kidlets then b'day party?  the life of the mind is very tiring. #automatically shipped by loudtwitter

17:23 loves that gossip girl just made a sarkozy reference. # 17:54 wonders how she can be tired again already.  there was not enough day in this day! # 02:42 thinks being sick is so lame. # 05:56 ray charles + 10+2 hack = a surprisingly productive morning.  also, i hate the way i write after reading psychoanalytic criticism. # 09:57 @b00ke it's the written equivalent of talking with marbles in your mouth.  ps- how excited are you for chartier's talk on monday? # 10:13 @b00ke hee!  also, we need to get p, or at least z, to twitter. # 10:13 @b00ke come to think of it, i bet z is probably already twittering somewhere. # 12:37 is fascinated that nytimes has labeled something updated five minutes ago as "from the archive." # 13:08 thinks: your parents did not pay for your ivy league education in order for u 2 msg me in text-speak. #automatically shipped by loudtwitter

17:40 my tolerance for belgian tripels has notably decreased in the absence of golden monkey. # 05:06 @b00ke  i like that much better than walking by the stop and shop, 'cause i had the radio on. # 05:07 the line broke, the monkey got choke and they all went to heaven in a little row boat. # 08:09 @nickf4rr it also requires an incorrect and/or outdated timetable. # 08:10 is inappropriately delighted to be listening to ac/dc, black sabbath, et al in the british library rare books reading room. # 09:15 @nickf4rr nah. i've got setpa right at home. now if you want to talk about needless difficulty actually purchasing tickets... # 15:04 wants to see "the wrestler" this week.  anyone else interested? #automatically shipped by loudtwitter

02:29 @eamsish oh dear!  my friends in london freaked out after the bbc aired a louis theroux special about crime in philadelphia. # 04:10 is obsessed with frugal living blogs. # 04:34 is watching a man with a clipboard and possible a camera walk on the roofs of the houses opposite her window.  pretty sure he won't jump. # 05:04 has just realized the freezepop remix she's listening to was done by a friend from high school.  yes, she's 5 years behind the times. # 07:47 needs the catalogue of the manuscripts, not the catalogue of the catalogues of the manuscripts, argh.  a pox on sir thomas phillipps. # 08:09 @bookn3rd maybe if you stare at them long enough they'll turn into a cup of coffee? # 08:24 bibliography: when other people's secondary sources are your primary sources. # 13:06 @eamsish oh, i've been there (with the students, i mean).  but i bet *their* secondary sources don't have to be ordered from rare books. #automatically shipped by loudtwitter
