virginia dance center is awesome! we’ve tried two other dance centers in manassas and vdc’s non-competitive studio matches our needs the best. we love that they really get to know our daughter and we receive an end-of-year evaluation with recommendations. they are also very responsive with questions and my daughter has learned a lot while still having tons of fun!

virginia dance center is a phenomenal dance studio! our family has been taking dance classes at vdc for several years. the instructorsâ passion for dance provides an inspiration to my children. throughout the years, i have seen such growth in my childrenâs dance skills! vdcâs thorough training and constructive feedback has fostered a positive self-image and self-confidence in my children. additionally, the non-competitive atmosphere has cultivated strong friendships among the dancers!!

the vdc staff and teachers are incredible!â the teachers connect with the dancers and show them kindness and support while helping them achieve personal goals.â the staff is always friendly and willing to help.â my daughter has made some beautiful friendships and has gained some of the most amazing role models through her 9 years at vdc.

i have had 3 daughters dance at va dance center over the last 16 years.â they offer high quality dance instruction that is age appropriate in a wholesome environment.â their storybook dance recital each year is a beautiful and artistic way to showcase the dancers talent as well as entertain the whole family.â i especially appreciate the owner and instructors’ concern for the well being of each child, appropriate costumes and music selection.â my oldest daughter attends college and was easily accepted into the dance company at her university where she is minoring in dance.â would highly recommend.
