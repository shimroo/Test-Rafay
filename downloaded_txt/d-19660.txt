fibre optic telephone & internet service
real fibre service to your doorstep
 with mnsi’s new fibre optic telephone & internet service, you’ll have access to the most
                        advanced,
                        high speed, all optical network in windsor. with crystal clear telephone quality and

                        download and upload speeds available, you’ll be able to
                        enjoy the best that the internet has to offer without the wait...

                        select neighbourhoods in windsor have already been fitted with mnsi's own high speed fibre
                        optic infrastructure, with more being upgraded soon. unlike the cable company's
                        "hybrid fibre" which still uses the same old fashioned copper coaxial cable technology, or
                        the phone company's "fibre to the node" service which still uses yesterday's copper phone
                        lines, mnsi's advanced network will run an actual fibre optic line
                        right into your home.
