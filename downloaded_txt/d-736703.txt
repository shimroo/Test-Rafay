fall is here!



the leaves are falling. they are changing colors daily. it's beautiful. i love fall! the colors,smell,weather. summer is great but as i have said many times before i get bored so easy. luckily we live in an area where we have beautiful seasons. another thing i love about fall is the festivals. this weekend we'll be going to the pumpkin festival. i start thinking about the pumpkin festival during summer=) i love all the crafts,things for the kids & all i have to say is pumpkin ice cream my friends!! it's sooo yummy! so excited fall is here i thought i'd give my blog a new look. you like? ty & shannon's birthday was last week. (tyson's is the 25th & shan's the 26th) it's a crazy week for us. my little boy is now 6 & my baby girl is now 3. i just can't believe it. it goes by too fast! well, i wanted to post since i haven't forever & a day lol! but i am determined to get back to blogging. i miss it!have a wonderful day friends!!

vacation here we come...



in just 3 days we'll be layin' on the beach. to say i'm excited is an understatement! the first week we'll have family with us & then the second week will be just the 5 of us. so kinda the best of both worlds=) i apologize for the lack of posts. between planning this trip & everyday mommy stuff i rarely have time & when i do my mind goes blank. when we get back i'll hope to be posting more often. i'm also hoping our internet service works down there & maybe i can post some pics during our vacation. our condo has internet but every year it never seems to work for one reason or another. no matter what i'll be taking lots of pics to be showin off=)) well, i have lots of packing & cleaning to do so i gots to get goin'!big big hugs,court♥
