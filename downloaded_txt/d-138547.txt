never lark nor eagle: a fighter pilot's story
a novel by ray castagnaro


never
lark nor eagle: a fighter pilot's story,
the novel by ray castagnaro, is about yanks in
the raf during the battle of britain, their transfer to the american
"eagle squadron," and their eventual transition to the u.s. army air
forces. the story continues with dangerous test flying at muroc
 lake, california, then the
exploits of the "fourth but first" fighter group in korea. the reader witnesses
counterinsurgency in the jungles of the philippines,
espionage in 1950s saigon, and hypersonic test
flying at edwards. it climaxes with the electrifying, but often overlooked air
campaign over vietnam.
as told through the saga of one extraordinary american family, the story of the
most exciting period in aviation history is told with historical accuracy,
passion, and humor.

never lark nor eagle: a fighter pilot’s story

a novel
by
ray castagnaro 
 

never lark
nor eagle: a fighter pilot’s story, is historical fiction about the career of usaf fighter pilot
carl “bing” morro and his adoptive family, spanning the years 1938
to 1978. the tale, epic in proportion, was too extensive to fit into one 600
page volume.
col dean e.
hess, usaf (ret), the prizewinning author of battle hymn, read an
earlier version of the manuscript and was delighted with its realism,
historical accuracy, exciting aerial action, and humor. col. hess flew air
force fighters in both world war ii and korea, and has attested to the
credibility of the book’s chapters spanning those two periods, which are
coincident with his own career. the same manuscript was also reviewed by the
late lt gen chesley peterson, usaf (ret), who was astounded over how a child of
the 1950s through 70s could have “gotten” what it was like to have
flown the p-51 mustang and the f-86 sabrejet. both men are depicted briefly in
the story as a tribute.

my research took over twelve
years, including my six years flying the air force f-4e phantom ii fighter. the
investigative work for all aspects of the story is consistent in its attention
to detail and accuracy, and has involved my operational flying with vietnam era fighter pilots, as well as
interviews with veterans from world war ii and korea. this has afforded a realism
simply not attainable by "non-participatory research." as they say: i
have walked the walk.

i believe my novel will appeal to
educated readers with an interest in history as well as to others who have
simply lived through the periods depicted in the story. the attention garnered
by news coverage of the gulf war and the current war on terrorism (as well as
the success of a&e and the history and discovery channels) reveals a public
captivated with the tactical air weapons of the modern battlefield. never
lark nor eagle provides a fascinating story that traces the etymology of
some of today’s aeronautical wonder weapons, through the fictional career
of a man who helped develop them and their tactics.

the substories within the novel
are all true. i have woven them together within the fabric of one fictional
family's story to bring them to light.

please enjoy the novel. i look
forward to hearing from readers.

the reviews are starting to come in from readers!

an epic for the jet age,
january 25, 2003 
    reviewer: shu mookerjee, dallas, tx 
if you've
ever wondered what it's like to be behind the stick of a combat aircraft, read
this book! the dogfight scenes are so realistic, i could almost feel the
g-force pinning me to the chair as i was reading. the author, a former fighter
pilot himself, uses stripped down prose peppered with air force lingo to paint
a taught picture of aerial combat.

but ultimately, "never lark nor eagle" is a great story that follows
the life and times of a fighter pilot through forty years and three wars. carl
"bing" morro, the story's protagonist, is a charismatic and likable
hero who has the potential to become as an enduring a character as james bond
or jack ryan. yet the author is careful to keep morro grounded in humanity. we
watch him grow from a cocky young kid to a battle-scarred combat officer, all
the while retaining his same likeable charm throughout the book. the supporting
characters are as richly drawn as well. they will definitely evoke an emotional
response. one character irritated me so much, i kept waiting for him to get
shot down! this is the level of skill by which the author pulls you in. you
actually care about these people, and that keeps the pages turning.

the story is an engaging blend of action and drama set against an amazingly
accurate historical backdrop. 

take it for a test flight.

 enroute to operation iraqi freedom, july 26th,
2004
lt col
wayne wolverton, ca, usar

i just
wanted to let you know that i thoroughly enjoyed reading your book.  i
finished the first volume while here at fort mccoy. 
the second volume is in my other bag back at my unit, for the trip down to fort bragg
and overseas.  i especially enjoy when you get into the details of
describing military traditions, procedures and uniforms - very w.e.b.
griffin-ish.  one question  -that little ditty that carl and freddy
sang in england,
"i'm looking over, the white cliffs of dover ..." - did you make that
up yourself, or was it something folks actually sang?  either way, very
clever.
===============================================================================================================

reviewer: tony ifasi, new york, ny

... i think the book is great. i see you've used some names from the past as
characters, and other personalities. pretty neat. so far i am enjoying it. the
problem is for some reason it gets into my subconscious, and i dream that part
of the book as a character or a witness of the action. i wake up exhausted.
robert ludlum does the same thing to me... i must admit the dog fights were
intense... i can picture this as a movie.

===============================================================================================================
dick hausheer, millington,
 nj - february 19, 2003,


compelling!!!!
a
fascinating history of the development of american fighter aircraft from wwii
to the present, told in the form of a novel. ray keeps the story moving by not
dwelling too long on individual incidents. you stay glued to the book to see
what is going to happen next. very light reading. good fantasy, suitable for
young and old readers alike.

this actual aircraft was in the 335th fighter squadron "chiefs" of
