pharmacychecker research







not made in the usa
the global pharmaceutical supply chain and prospects for safe drug importation
many consumer products clearly state where those products are made. not so for prescription medications. where our drugs are made and where their main ingredients are sourced affects drug safety, affordability, availability, and even national security — concerns that have come to the fore as a result of the global pandemic. yet there is too little transparency and too much misinformation surrounding the supply chain of the drugs we take. “not made in the usa” investigates and details the country of manufacture and the source country for active pharmaceutical ingredients among widely used, brand name prescription drugs.
