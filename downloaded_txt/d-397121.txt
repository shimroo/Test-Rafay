welcome to the st. laurence anglican church community



the st. laurence anglican church acknowledges treaty 7 territory; the ancestral and traditional territory of the blackfoot confederacy (siksika, kainai, piikani), the tsuut’ina, the îyâxe nakoda nations, the métis nation (region 3). we acknowledge the many first nations, métis and inuit peoples whose footsteps have marked these lands for generations. we are grateful for the traditional knowledge keepers and elders who are still with us today and those who have gone before us. we recognize the land as an act of reconciliation and gratitude to those whose territory we reside on.
