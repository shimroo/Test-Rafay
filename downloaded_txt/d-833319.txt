fundraiser  for  teaching facility





 fundraiser:  wildlife office, triage and teaching facility      the rainbow wildlife rescue (rwr)  continues to grow - beyond our own walls in fact. in light of the recent  affiliation with the tarleton  state university r.e.a.l. (real-world experience applied to learning)  program we have accomplished one of our main goals to expand our  wildlife education program. the opportunity benefits all those involved  and we are very excited! beginning this fall the rwr will offer  internships to students participating in the r.e.a.l. program.    wildlife rehabilitation is a  volunteer service offered to the state; there is no official funding  available. rwr operates from a private residence that is basically a  very old (1945) small, 2 bedroom house.  presently, one room is utilized as a  wildlife nursery and another one is used as an office. the electrical  system is taxed and circuits blow on regular basis.   as rwr grows so does the number of public  visitors who often arrive unannounced and at all hours of the day and  night. in short, rwr is in desperate need of physical expansion to  allow for a formal office and proper animal care wards.      fundraiser:  wildlife office, triage and teaching facility                 please  click above donate button to contribute to the wildlife office  fundraiser! every person donating more than $25 will receive a free  gift!     rwr explored 3 solutions:   1) move to a bigger place                        2) close the rescue                        3) get an affordable office separate  from the residence and the animal care wards (by law, we must keep the  public away from animals being rehabilitated)   solution #1 is not presently viable,  neither is solution #2. that leaves option #3 and the purpose of this  letter.  rwr has researched portable buildings and  determined that this structure would adequately suffice and be a  tremendous benefit to our cause. it is 12x24 feet in size and will  cost $5,000.here is an example (click on the  thumbnails to view a larger version of the image):                                      fundraiser: wildlife  office, triage and teaching facility                                    please click above  donate button to contribute to the wildlife office fundraiser! every  person donating more than $25 will receive a free gift!       the interior and electrical tasks could be turned  into project opportunities for shop classes. we are exploring community  involvement such as this.  this office will provide space for basic office  furniture, equipment, and a table with a chairs for interning students. a  portion of the building will be separated and used for emergency triage  area for new arrivals of distressed animals. one wall will be nursery  incubators and cages with critical heating pads.  the goal is to raise $5000  to purchase the building and explore classes or groups that are  interested in the interior projects including electrical and hopefully  some plumbing.  the rainbow wildlife  rescue inc is a 501(c)3 nonprofit charity organization and all donations  are tax deductible. everybody that donates  more than $25 for this "wildlife office, triage and small teaching  facility" fundraiser will receive a free gift!      free  gift for donations over $25 !              15 seconds mini-rice-buddy   the mini-rice-buddy provides 30 minutes of  soothing heat! microwave for only 15 seconds! re-use as often as you  wish!            please click  above donate button to contribute to the wildlife office fundraiser!  every person donating more than $25 will receive a free gift!        here  are just a few ways you can use your mini-rice-buddy: emergency   heat source for chilled animal babiesquick hand  (or feet) warmer for those icy wintry dayssoothing  to touch and knead for sore handsgreat for  the "pain in the neck" and to loosen up other muscle tensionskneading  the mini-rice-buddy gives nervous hands something to do (helps stop  smoking, fingernail biting etc) and a lot more!

can i keep it?





 i   found a wild baby animal! can i keep it?    by birgit sommer may, 2010     a common call received by the rainbow  wildlife rescue is, “i have found an abandoned baby or injured wild  animal.”  the most common  questions asked are, “what do i need to do with it?”, “what  can i feed it?” and then the most dreaded question “can i keep  it?”    that's where my job gets tough because  the answers are often not the ones people want to hear. the law  people that find a wild animal are very  excited about it and typically show it off to friends and family and  share pictures too. sooner or later one of those people or maybe a  neighbor will not like it and call law enforcement. as a result the illegal animal will most  likely be confiscated and euthanized. you will have to pay a hefty fine  and end up with an entry in your records.    not to mention the heartbreak and devastation many folks  go through because they have grown attached to the animal. wildlife laws are made not only to  protect native wildlife, but to also protect the general public.  in almost every case, keeping a  wild animal is illegal. native wildlife species are protected by state  laws, federal laws, or both.    to keep a wild animal in captivity for  any length of time, for any reason, requires a special permit. most  cities and many counties have passed local ordinances that prevent  individuals from keeping wild animals in captivity.  songbirds and birds of prey are protected  by federal law and have fines of $15,000 up and jail time. nests and  feathers of songbirds and raptors are protected as well.             diseases  even as a baby, these animals can be carriers of a  large number of zoonotic diseases and parasites communicable to humans  and household pets.  diseases such as rabies, lyme disease, roundworms  and tuberculosis are just a few. if you or any member of your family is  scratched or bitten, that animal is required to be euthanized and tested  for rabies, because tests on live animals are not possible. what does "wild" really  mean?  have you ever thought about the difference between  wild and domesticated animals? domesticated animals such as cats and dogs  seek human company and enjoy to be petted, cuddled and played with. they  depend on their human owners for food, housing and leadership.    wild  animals are considered wild because they are species that have not  been domesticated and therefore have a natural fear of everything that's  physically bigger than them, including us, their biggest predator. it  doesn't matter if you raised the animal from his first day of life, they  have different instincts than domestic species.  this will become a factor as they mature into  an animal that can be very hard to manage and very high maintenance. the  cute baby animal you wanted to save with great intentions is now in  danger of being confiscated, killed, relegated to living in a cage, or  even harming someone.  there is also a tremendous and painful  emotional separation that can occur - not just for you, but for the now  confused animal! it just isn't fair and it derives from a selfish  desire. we must think "long term".     wild babies people trying to help wild animals sometimes  receive serious injuries. many expect an animal to recognize their kind  intentions and love and do everything in their power to convince the  scared animal to not be afraid. yet that fear is the key to their  survival, instilled in their genes throughout evolution.  sometimes young animals become imprinted and  dependent up their human captors and if released back into the wild may  become a nuisance or simply die because of the human interference in  their lives that prevented them from learning critical survival skills. in addition, wild animals deserve the best possible  care which requires expert training and knowledge considering that each  species has specialized needs. orphans require individual diets and  formulas to grow strong and healthy.  they need to learn survival skills, how to  recognize and find food, recognize predators, how and where to establish  their living quarters before they are released back into the wild. most  young animals need to be raised in the company of their own kind for  proper social and behavioral development.  letting go     a  lot of folks who ended up caring for a wild animal had plans to release  the animal once it is grown or has recovered from its injuries but where  not able to do so because they have grown too attached and are not  capable of putting the animal's needs before their own desires. wildlife rehabilitators however have an  advantage when they return their residents to the wild - they have years  of experience in letting go and are happy for the animal. it's a  privilege to return nature's very own.  they are not ours. wildlife rehabilitators do  their job selflessly for the animals, not their own feelings, gain or  entertainment.      enjoy wildlife, but leave animals to their natural  habitats. not only for the animal’s well being, but for human safety.  allow wild animals to live the way they were meant to live, wild and  free. to make a long answer short: no, you can't keep it!  if you really care please learn how to help, when to help, and when  maybe not to help. sometimes "help" can be a death sentence.    disclaimer: the information provided in this  article is the property of the rainbow wildlife rescue. the rwr holds all copyright  interests in such material, unless specifically indicated. permission  to reprint is given with credit to the rainbow wildlife rescue and noted  authors.

facts and stats about rabies





 faqs about  rabies in erath county, texas 1.  what exactly  is rabies? answer:rabies is a  contagious virus that can cause death in people and certain  animals  and is nearly always fatal if not treated in a timely manner.   2.  how is  rabies transmitted? answer:                   the rabies virus is usually transmitted through  the saliva  of an infected animal, most commonly through a bite. the  virus can be  transmitted from animal to animal, from animal to human,  and on rare  occasions, from human to human. another way  of transmitting the virus, even  though highly uncommon, is for saliva  or brain tissue from a rabid  animal to get directly into the eyes,  nose, mouth or open wound of a  person or animal.  however, contrary to common belief, you can’t get  rabies from the  blood, urine, or feces of an infected animal.  during my survey, i noted another  misconception about rabies  transmission. it is not true that  an animal can be just a  carrier of the rabies virus and transmit it to  another animal or humans  for weeks, months or even years.  according  to the cdc, "no person in the united  states has ever contracted  rabies from a dog, cat or ferret held in  quarantine for 10 days."  before the rabies virus reaches the brain, the   animal does not show any symptoms, according to the cdc. the animal does   not appear ill during this time, called the incubation period, which   may last for weeks or months. during this time period the animal can not   transmit the virus to another animal or person. this is the reason why   animals that have bitten a human are held in quarantine for 10 days.  as the cdc states, " only late in the  disease,  after the virus has reached the brain and multiplied there to  cause an  encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) does the virus move  from the  brain to the salivary glands and saliva."  3. what   animals are most likely to have rabies? answer:                   all mammals can get rabies. it is most common in   un-vaccinated household pets such as dogs, cats and ferrets as well as   in livestock such as cattle, and wild animals like skunks, bats,   raccoons, coyotes and foxes.   small animals  like mice, rats, squirrels, and  even opossums, are almost never found  to be infected with rabies.  according to the centers for disease  control and prevention, bites by  these animals are usually not  considered a risk of rabies unless the  animal was sick or behaving  abnormally and rabies is a major problem in  your vicinity.  4. how  common  is rabies in erath county? answer:                   officially confirmed rabies cases from 2000 until   today include according to the texas department of state health  services  infectious disease control unit:   year rabies cases confirmed  in variant   2000 24 23  skunks, 1 cat skunk   2001 27  27  skunks skunk   2002 8 6 skunks, 1 goat, 1 horse skunk   2003 10 8 skunks, 2 dogs skunk   2004 4 2 skunks, 1 bat, 1 cattle skunk, bat    2005 5 3 skunks, 1 cat, 1 cattle skunk   2006 2 1 skunk, 1 dog skunk   2007 4 3 skunks, 1 cat skunk   2008 6 3 skunks, 2 dogs, 1 raccoon skunk   2009 5 3 skunks, 1 cat, 1 raccoon  skunk   all animals except 1 (the bat  in 2004) contracted  the virus from an infected skunk.   5. how can  i  tell if an animal has rabies? answer:                   the symptoms are not easily recognized because  other  diseases display similar symptoms. pets infected with the rabies  virus  act in unusual ways. be alert for changes in behavior.  a dog that  is  friendly may avoid people. mean dogs may act friendly to strangers.   animals may become aggressive, make strange noises or erratic movements,   and attack other animals or humans.  they may have trouble walking,   drinking, swallowing, or chewing.  it may not be able to close its   mouth, and may appear to be choking. if you see an animal acting like   this, call the local animal control agency right away.  6. what  should  i do if i had contact with a possibly rabid animal? answer:                   prompt treatment is required to prevent a rabies   infection. first, flush the bite or wound area with water for at least   one full minute. follow up by washing with soap (or detergent if soap is   not immediately available) to remove saliva containing the virus. then   apply a disinfectant such as rubbing alcohol, bleach, or iodine  tincture  directly on the wound and under skin flaps to stop the rabies  from  being absorbed into the body tissue.  then get to your doctor or  an  emergency room as soon as possible.   7. how is  rabies diagnosed in  animals and humans? answer:                   a direct fluorescent antibody test (dfa) is used  to test  the brain tissue of animals suspected to be rabid.  however, the  dfa  test can only be performed after the animal has died. for humans,   several tests are required to diagnose rabies. samples of body tissues   and fluids - saliva, spinal fluid, serum, and hair follicles - are   tested for signs of the rabies virus.  positive results from one test is   not proof of rabies, all tests are required for diagnosis.  8. can  baby  animals have rabies? answer:                   babies born to a healthy rabies-free mother will  be rabies  free at birth. babies born to a rabid mother will most likely  have  rabies, because it is exposed to the mother’s saliva. these babies  will  probably not survive long enough to go out into the world. teach  your  children to never touch wildlife. call the authorities or your  local  wildlife rehabilitator if you find a wild baby animal that seems  to be  orphaned and in need of human intervention.  9. how do i  protect myself and  my pets from rabies? answer: have a veterinarian vaccinate your dogs and  cats  against rabies. by law, you need to do this every year, or every  three  years, depending on the type of vaccine used. keeping your pets  vaccinated protects you and  them. keep pets away from  wildlife and don’t let  them wander loose through the neighborhood.  avoid contact with wild animals and with dogs  and cats you do not  know. do not try to hand-feed wild animals and do  not keep them as  pets. do not touch sick or injured animals. call  and report  them to the authorities.   10. how do i  prevent the  spread of rabies? answer:  be a responsible pet owner and have all your  pets  vaccinated once a year.   keep your pets  confined and supervised.  spay or neuter your pets to prevent  the  spread of unwanted and unvaccinated animals straying through your   neighborhood.  enjoy wild animals such as raccoons, skunks,   and foxes from afar. do not handle, feed, or attract wild animals with   open garbage cans or litter. do not leave pet food outside! do  not rescue wild animals or bring them into  your home. do not try to  raise orphaned wildlife. call animal control  or your local wildlife  rehabilitator for assistance.summary provide your pets and livestock with rabies vaccine  as advised by your family veterinarian. keep rabies pet vaccines  current. keep pets away from wildlife and don’t let them  wander loose through the neighborhood.                contact the proper authorities if you see an animal  acting strangely. never attempt to catch or touch the animal unless you  are trained. if your pet is bitten by an animal, call the animal  authorities and take your pet to the vet.  if a person is bitten by an animal (whether it is  from a wild skunk caught foraging in the trash or a nip on the hand from  a neighbor’s pet), clean the wound thoroughly and go to your doctor or  medical clinic for treatment. contact the authorities who will try to  capture the animal for testing or quarantine. keep contact information handy for notifying the  proper authorities about a possible rabid animal in the neighborhood. information and research provided by birgit sommer,  licensed wildlife rehabilitator in the state of texas and director of  the rainbow wildlife rescue.    sources:   http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/qanda/general.htmlhttp://www.dshs.state.tx.us/idcu/disease/rabies/http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/communicable/zoonoses/rabies/vaccfact.htm additional  information:                when it comes to rabies, ignorance can kill. not  just you or your pets, but innocent and healthy wildlife. raccoons are  the number one wild animal killed for rabies testing. dogs and cats top  the list of domestic animals killed for rabies testing. in both these  and other animals, the vast majority are found not to have rabies.  they must pay with their lives because people  have possibly been exposed to rabies by them. if these same people had  taken precautions against possible exposure to rabies, these animals  would still be alive. don't be responsible for the death of an innocent  animal. learn about rabies and learn how to protect yourself, your  family, your pets and our wildlife.  raccoon rabies is a strain of rabies carried  mainly by raccoons. raccoon rabies is rabies. it can be spread to farm  animals, pets and people through the saliva of an infected animal in the  same ways as other strains of rabies. raccoon rabies kills raccoons,  other animals and humans in the same way as other strains of rabies do.  the only difference is that it is spread primarily by raccoons.

project saving stephenvilles wildlife





i just got back from introducing project "saving stephenville's wildlife" to the city council. i hope it finds support and will go through the necessary channels to be approved. frankly, it's a nobrainer...saves the city money and spares the lives of animals. i cannot find a single reason that would speak against my proposal.this is what it is all about (and what i read to the city council):while at the local animal shelter i have observed our animal control officers bringing in traps with healthy adult raccoons and other wildlife, which are often needlessly euthanized.naturally, being licensed by the state to provide assistance to state owned wildlife, i started wondering if there is any way to save these animals without causing more work.due to facility restraints at the rainbow wildlife rescue i am not capable of offering to take all these animals in, however, i have come up with a solution that i am confident will benefit all involved.i am authorized to legally transport raccoons within 10 miles from where they were collected. we have ample and appropriate release sites that are carefully selected and within the legal limits. i am extremely diligent in matters of potential overcrowding and do not release more than 10 animals of each species at any given site per year.our plan is to install trail cams and microchip the relocated animals to assist in a state research project on relocation adjustment, as well as support the usda sponsored tvr (trap-vaccinate-release) program. this will provide a further service in vaccinating wildlife against rabies and providing effective data.to implement this effort the rainbow wildlife rescue would allow the animal control officers to drop off healthy trapped animals away from the public shelter at our clifton street facility, which is less than ½ mile from the shelter.i will provide a secure enclosed area that's easily accessible to the officers where they will simply leave the animal remaining in the trap and take an empty trap back with them, which will also be provided.i then will evaluate the animal and upon finding it suitable for release will proceed with the program as stated, or take the necessary steps to have the animal humanely euthanized.this will save the city and the officers time, effort, supplies, money and completely prevent physical exposure, handling and euthanizing these animals while a the same time providing useful information to science and research.i can accept raccoons, opossums, rabbits and squirrels for relocation. i will not accept skunks, foxes, bats, deer or coyotes.i am looking forward to your support and am prepared to implement the simple steps needed to begin.

wildlife rehabilitation in america





 wildlife rehabilitation in america what is a wildlife rehabilitator?a wildlife rehabilitator is a person licensed by their state to take in orphaned and injured wildlife for the general public, as required by the state. orphaned baby animals  will be raised properly and injured or ill critters are rehabilitated. your main responsibility is to the animals you are caring for. the goal is to get these animals back into the wild where they are supposed to be, and want to be. that's what it is all about...the animals remaining wild. wanting them to be pets is not what they want! documentary: wildlife rehabilitation in america part 1          working with wildlife is very different from working with domesticated pets. where it's ok to hold an orphaned kitten or puppy to comfort it when it's missing it's mother, it's not ok to hold a cottontail rabbit for example, because it can die of fear in an instant.keeping handling and human exposure to a minimum is vital for the animals' survival in the wild later on.how do you get the animals?we receive calls from people like you who came across an animal that appeared to be in need of human intervention. we often receive animals from the local animal control agencies, game wardens, businesses, police departments, sheriff offices, veterinary clinics and animal shelters.why do animals end up with a wildlife rehabber and what kind?animals end up with a wildlife rehabilitator for various reasons. it can be a baby squirrel that fell out of a nest, usually after a storm, and found by school kids; a songbird that flew into a window and has a concussion and needs a safe place to recover; an opossum mother hit by a car with living babies in the pouch that caring individuals saved and brought to us; a baby raccoon sitting next to his dead mother on the side of the road crying; the litter of cottontail rabbits whose mother fell victim to a lawn mower or a wild animal hurt by our dogs and cats...the stories are endless. documentary: wildlife rehabilitation in america part 2         what do you do with them?in the case of infant critters where a re-union with the mother has been ruled out, they will be raised and taught how to relate to others of their species, given a chance to develop their survival skills, know what their predators are, and how to find food and shelter before they will be released back into the wild.what about injured animals? do you have medical training?even though wildlife rehabilitators have to go through training and study as much as possible, they are not veterinarians and have to seek professional medical assistance in case of an injured animal, such as an owl with a broken wing or a deer hit by a car with a leg fracture; a raccoon caught by a dog covered in bite wounds; a squirrel with bb gun pellets in its back...again, the stories are endless.unfortunately not every vet clinic is willing or capable of assisting wildlife rehabilitators with these animals for various reasons.if  the injuries are too severe, the only option left is to euthanize the animal to shorten their suffering.   if the injuries are not life threatening, we triage the animal, provide everything that goes along with healing the wounds and providing the proper care, nutrition and housing until the animal is ready to be returned to the wild.  what else does a wildlife rehabber do besides caring for wildlife?another important part of being a wildlife rehabilitator is dealing with the public. once spring starts and the first animals of the season, usually squirrels, are being born, the calls are coming in about pink hairless babies found on the ground. there are a lot of caring folks out there that go the extra mile to help out that infant and take it to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator or wildlife facility.a lot of people attempt to care for these animals on their own and only call us when they see that their approach didn't work. sadly, at that point it is often too late for us to help.many folks proudly explain all the things they have done wrong, believing they did everything right, which doesn't make it necessarily easy to educate them without coming across as criticizing. busting old wife's tales takes a lot of our time, that is why i am here now.we often get calls from rude people that are trying to threaten or ridicule us, seem to enjoy grossing us out with the gory details of their hunting stories, or tell us they will kill the animal if we don't come right now and pick it up. fact is that most of us home based rehabilitators can't just rush out and drive around to pick up animals.who will take care of the critters we already have? the focus has to be on the animals already there. we are happy to take in critters, but we are so grateful when people can bring them to us. we simply don't have the resources to do everything they expect us to do, but the majority of people that call want to help and don't mind the transporting the critter.can i make a lot of money being a wildlife rehabilitator?most  wildlife rehabilitators these days are home based. we can't charge for anything  we do because these are state owned animals, so we survive strictly on  donations. if you are in this for the money you will be disappointed. it's a life style, a passion and a commitment, and most rehabilitators front the bills out of their own pockets and don't get paid  anything. some things just can't be weighed in money...but knowing at the end  of the day that you are doing the right thing is more rewarding than a fancy car to  most of us.wildlife  rehabilitation used to be more of a hobby than a profession back in the days, but times and laws  have progressed. the government requires us to be trained in order to obtain  the necessary permits, provide proper facilities which are subject to  inspection in most states, provide release sites, even pay for  our own pre-exposure rabies shots.fortunately, more national and international  organizations are working on research and studies benefiting our local  wildlife, and offer rehabilitators extended training courses.some  rehabilitators establish a wildlife center in their area, usually a nonprofit  based organization because the government does not financially support wildlife  rehabilitation. yet. that's why there are not many independent wildlife  facilities in america, most are connected to colleges or vet clinics, so paid jobs  in this field are still hard to find.how do i get  a wildlife rehabilitation permit?there are permits you have to obtain from your state for mammal rehabilitation. if you also want to rehabilitate birds, you will need a federal permit from the us fish and wildlife in addition to the state permit. that's for nearly all types of birds from songbirds to birds of prey.different agencies are responsible for issuing wildlife rehabilitation permits and requirements also vary from state to state. in some states the department of natural resources is in charge of wildlife rehab permits, in other states it's the parks and wildlife department or fish and wildlife commission. you will find direct links to each state's application on our website at www.wildlife-education.com .in almost all states it is illegal to take an animal out of the wild and attempt to treat it on your own, no matter what your motives are. even if you plan to release it later on back into the wild, it's most likely not going to happen if you don't know what you are doing.can everybody become a wildlife rehabilitator?as a wildlife rehabber you have to be a very strong and determined person. there is a lot of frustration involved when dealing with the public and administrative side of this vocation. it's about hard work, long hours, no weekends or holidays and never enough money, and also a lot of emotional and heartbreaking cases where you have done everything you can but still can't save an animal.all we can do then is to provide a warm, safe place for an animal to die. however, being able to work with wild animals that most people don't even get to see up close, to touch them safely, heal them, and see them be free again…that is a privilege to most rehabbers. knowing they made a difference and got this animal back to where it belongs is worth all the efforts, expense, and even the heartaches.how much does it cost?in addition to the required permits you will need a lot of items ranging from inside cages and incubators to outside enclosures and habitats. you'll be using medical supplies, syringes, nipples, wound care supplies, bottles, feed, blankets, towels, educational material, different formulas for different species, bedding, building supplies, volunteers, fundraising skills, time for education, and not to forget your own family and social life.  in other words, a lot!it really helps if you are good with basic business skills so you can be professional in what you do with the public, organize fundraising events and such.be proudsome folks find the idea of wildlife rehabilitation ridiculous or claim it's "messing with nature". these folks neglect to see that most wildlife related calls that require our human intervention are the direct result of unnatural conditions such as careless behavior of people, toxins, poisons, automobiles, guns, traps, lawn mowers, to name just a few. often we are confronted with animals that have suffered traumatic wounds and horrific injuries. some animals come in poisoned, shot, injured by cars and left for dead by humans. the stories and cases are endless and heartbreaking. that is called “messing with nature” and careless humans do it everyday, whether we mean to do harm or not.we, as wildlife rehabilitators, are dedicated warriors on the front lines between suburban development and natural habitat and are grateful for every bit of support we can get. thank you!
