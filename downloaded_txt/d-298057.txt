just some every day customer comments 
        about magnet paints. these are exact quotes from recent customer 
        interviews.



"i didn't think it was possible to buy 
        paint from 1500 miles away and save any money. we've always bought 
        locally. magnets prices still save me 55% over dupont centari even after 
        i pay the freight for a small order like 8 or 12 gallons."

"we sandblast and repaint every kind of 
        fleet you can imagine. we repaint
everything with magnet paints and are 
        very pleased with the results and the cost savings. i've
got about ten different companies trying to sell me paint,but 
        they can't beat what i'm already getting with magnet."

"we have over 35 cat excavators and we 
        usually buy paint from our local equipment dealer. magnet?s 4800 enamels 
        has twice the gloss of the dealer paint and we 
        saved over 9 bucks per gallon. heck i don?t 
        mind waiting 3 days for shipping. i?m sticking 
        with magnet! hey that?s funny!"
