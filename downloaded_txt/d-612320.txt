	 two by g.g. belli
	 
    






two sonnets by the 19th century italian poet, g.g. belli (also see here and here) - translations from anthony burgess's magical book, abba abba:


revenge 1


of all the bible stories that they tell,
this one to come is quite the most fantastic.
a sonnet being so damned inelastic,
i'll require two to tell it really well.
well, now – the exodists from egypt's hell
met the mad malechites who, dreadful, drastic.
ferocious, tastelessly enthusiastic,
fell on the hebrews, and the hebrews fell.

god made a memorandum. after all,
the jews pursued the then correct religion.
after four hundred years he called on saul.
"the malechites," he said, "deserve the axe.
spit the whole nation; roast it like a pigeon.
don't leave a feather on their fucking backs."

revenge 2

so in god's name saul went and waded in,
trouncing them in one horrible stampede,
goats, calves and all. mercy maybe or greed
or something made him save prince agag's skin.
samuel now prophesied about saul's sin!
"idolater, betrayer of our creed,
a holier israelite will supersede
your reign and make a holier reign begin.

bring me the prince you blasphemously spared."
tremulous as a fatted pig, that prince
stuttered – agag agag aghast, shit-scared.
the holy samuel did not blink or wince
but raised the butcher's blade that he had bared
and made a mound of malechitish mince.

all the sonnetti romaneschi

	 channel 84
	 
    



so here's the result of my recent customer discussions with verizon. as this is of interest to few, cut to the chase if you wish - it's at the bottom.



some background: i watch almost no tv, and am old enough to remember when it was free. thus the idea of paying for it has always seemed foreign. for a time when i worked for a cable co. (as internet editor), i got full cable for free. i watched the sopranos, loved it, and basically nothing else. when i left that company, i figured someone would step up and offer the choice of just getting hbo, and nothing else. or just one show from hbo. sort of like the internet. until that time came, i'd never actually pay for tv.

i now pay for verizon fios. why? i had a two-year contract with them for fios internet, and when it was up, i was told my monthly price would increase by some not insignificant amount. but,  if i took the "triple play" option - adding tv to the existing bundle of net and home phone - with current promos i'd actually pay less than if i were to just renew net and home phone.




an offer i could not refuse. i accepted the tv, and -- apart from a few biggies, like the world series and the presidential debates, sotu, etc. -- used it barely at all. my kid briefly got into some of the "rustic" entertainment including "call of the wildman," but we soon tired of the passive tedium of the medium.




anyway, i have this excellent friend dan who keeps talking about fifa and manchester united and rooney and rinaldo of madrid and balotelli and frankly he managed to make it sound interesting enough that i began to think it would be nice to have channel 84. in my market, that's fox soccer. not soccer plus, just soccer. my humble verizon service - the low end, of course - blocks the channel, but offered me the option to subscribe, though it didn't say what it costs. i figured i'd call to find out, and from that call came this conversation.




that conversation, blogged, turned into a tweetfest with verizon, further morphing into 1.5 hours of phone time with two very pleasant verizon support people, michael and bernardine.

michael tried very hard, once he understood my request, to find a way to help. the problem as i saw it was, all i want is this one channel, why can't they add it, and it alone, and bill me a buck a month and bob's yr uncle?

the problem apparently is that in the corporate universe, no customer shall be so gratified. i could only choose to move up to the next package, called "extreme" - in which case my tv would not only receive channel 84 but also a buttload more channels i had no interest in, for a mere $15 (before tax) upgrade to my monthly bill.

i explained to michael how it is. how i do not use tv, but might enjoy some soccer if it didn't cost me over $100 a year for the privilege of watching. he proceeded in the most engaging manner to attempt a series of elaborate maneuvers worthy of olympic diving competition -- backflips, inward dive 3.5 somersault in the tuck position, armstand back 2 somersaults, 1.5 twists in the free position, and more. at one point, he thought he had it. he thought he'd managed to give me extreme with no change to my contractual obligation -- there was nearly a whoop of joy from this enthusiastic and friendly young man, until, at the very last moment, the agony of defeat emanating from the massive corporate computational network told him in no uncertain terms that the customer was going to have to pay $15 more a month or nada.




i felt sorrier for michael than one might imagine. i tried to comfort him, to assure him that i really don't watch tv, have no use for tv, am probably better off without access to channel 84, as it would just consume more of the short life left to me (i'm no spring chicken) than i can afford. but michael was not down for the count. he thought there still could be a way to do this, but it would take a higher power. i said fine, and was soon speaking with bernardine in california. bernardine sounded completely pleasant, nothing like any formidable higher power.

i explained to her how it came about that i simply wanted to know what it cost to sub to channel 84, but after an hour was still discovering that her giant corporation could not, in fact, either give me an answer, nor satisfy the request, but was -- at least michael was -- heartbroken at its lack of success.

bernardine asked if she could look at the matter, and in short order she returned to say she could offer me extreme, the package, for $6.72 a month. this was managed under some complex 12-month discount by which my bill is actually $15 + tax but i get some sort of $10 off deal that ends next march.

at this point i told her that i might consider it, even though i only wanted the one channel, but i'd only do so if she annotated the account to indicate that in 12 months i can go back to my non-extreme status and to my current monthly bill, minus the $6.72, no questions asked. she agreed, and i agreed. i am now extreme. talk about power. the new package was available on my tv nearly immediately. bernardine offered to call me in a week, and i said that would be fine. we wished each other a happy valentine's day. for one with such power, she seemed quite sweet.



yet i wonder: if verizon can implement entire packages in the blink of a remote eye, why not one single channel? i still do not have an answer. the system is telling me i can subscribe to a channel, but when i ask how much, i get baited and switched. "nooooooooooooo," it tells me, "you can't have one little teensie-weensie channel, but you can have a whole bunch of them!"

why?

if it's a technical issue, then put it in layman's terms. end users will get it. something too small for the giant to handle? that would be of interest. if none of the above, then it might, just might, be a greed issue. if so, well, buy some gumption and own up to that. consumers are bent to consume the redirection of their substance at the expense of their wiser discretion.




can marketing ever get real? if a customer wants to buy something, and you won't sell it to them, why not tell them why not? why do you always need to convince them they want something much bigger, far in excess of what they in fact want? is it un-usian to ask for something small? is it demeaning to gratify small wishes? must american consumers always be presumed to live in hells of infinite desire?

eventually the corporates will discover that the fulcrum has shifted. what we desire, no matter how humble, can be within our grasp, without their help.

so i'm grateful to bernardine, and to michael and the verizon tweeters, and to agent marilyn whose robotics kicked this into high gear. grateful less for channel 84 than for the glimpse into the wide world of scripts, pitches, elaborate gestures and figurative maneuvers of corporate theater. it's a jungle in there. i'm in it up to my $6.72, and i mean to get out. but bernardine told me to check: a better promo might await in march 2014.

marilyn: that is associated with your account.



tom: other contact # 9-- xxx-xxxx



marilyn: this is correct.



tom: my question is what is the cost of fox soccer - not fox soccer plus, but channel 84, which used to be part of the basic package of fios tv channels.



marilyn: one moment while i check for you.



marilyn: thank you for continuing to hold. i am still working on your request and i will be back with you in a few moments.



tom: ok, i'm still here



marilyn(12:40:14): thank you for your patience. i am still working on your request and will be back with you shortly.



tom(12:40:36): yes



marilyn(12:42:06): i am sorry to keep you waiting. i am still working on your request and will be back with you shortly.



marilyn(12:43:11): i show that you would have to upgrade your tv package.



marilyn(12:43:37): you now have prime tv, you can upgrade to extreme tv.



tom(12:44:10): yes,but i don't wish to do that. i simply wish to subscribe to that channel.



tom(12:44:47): when i go to that channel, it offers me the opportunity to subscribe, but doesn't say what it will cost.



marilyn(12:45:17): i apologize for any inconvenience.



marilyn(12:45:47): you can also add the sports package for $11.99 per month.



tom(12:46:53): in other words, you are saying that i can't subscribe to this one channel, although it seems to offer me that option. i must upgrade to something else, which i don't want, which will cost me another > $100 a year. this is what you are saying?



marilyn(12:47:38): i can understand your frustration.



marilyn(12:47:38): thank you for your patience. i am checking on your question for you.

marilyn(12:49:18): thank you for continuing to hold. i am still working on your request and i will be back with you in a few moments.

marilyn(12:51:04): i apologize again for any inconvenience.

marilyn(12:51:29): you can also upgrade your bundle package.

marilyn(12:52:24): by paying $15.00 more per month.



tom(12:53:20): you are saying i only have options of paying a lot of money, instead of what i want, which is to pay a small amount of money for one station. i do not watch any of your channels. i basically don't watch tv at all, except for very focused, limited items. you are telling me that my only option is to pay you in excess of $100 per year to see the one little thing i wish to see. yes or no?

marilyn(12:56:10): this is correct.

marilyn(12:56:36): unfortunately, you will have to pay to upgrade your service or add the sports channel.



tom(12:58:00): agent marilyn, it's not your fault. please do not apologize or tell me that you understand. this is about a giant corporation dealing out packages to suit itself, not its customers. this is the way big business works. i am very sorry that i ever added fios to my services.

marilyn(12:59:51): do you have any further questions i can assist you with today?



tom(13:01:45): not for you. please feel free to share my view of your services with your marketing people. verizon is as bad as comcast. i won't be a customer for very long.

marilyn(13:03:26): thank you for choosing verizon, we appreciate your business. if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us again.



your session is now closed.

thank you, have a nice day.

	 a thoughtful graf about aaron swartz
	 
    




françois de la rochefoucauld once observed that it’s not enough to have great virtues; one must use them with economy. as i listened to the tributes to aaron swartz in highland park and new york and online, this aphorism came to mind. swartz had skipped out on the lessons taught by the american high school—the lessons in cynical acquiescence, conformity, and obedience to the powers that be. he was right to think these lessons injure people’s innate sense of curiosity and morality and inure them to mediocrity. he was right to credit his “arrogance” for the excellence of the life he lived. but if nothing else, these lessons prepare people for a world that can often be met in no other way; a world whose irrational power must sometimes simply be endured. this was a lesson that he contrived never to learn, which was part of what made him so extraordinary. it was swartz’s misfortune, and ours, that he learned it too late, from too unyielding a teacher. it cannot serve society’s purpose to make a felon and an inmate out of so gifted and well-meaning a person as aaron swartz, and thus he was a victim of a grave injustice. but it bears remembering that the greater injustice was done to aaron swartz by the man who killed him. yang
