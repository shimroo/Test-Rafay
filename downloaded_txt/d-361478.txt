how it works?















 



micro vortex generators (vgs) 



what are they and how do they work? 



micro vortex generators are small aluminum blades placed in a spanwise line aft of the leading edge of the wing and tail surfaces. they control airflow over the upper surface of the wing by creating vortices that energize the boundary layer. this results in improved performance and control authority at low airspeeds and high angles of attack.

our testimonials 










						i purchased the vg's for 114a rockwell commander and had them installed.  we fly out of high altitude airports like santa fe (saf).  

we have made two trips in the summer with temps increasing around lunch time.  what a great difference the vg's made. no mushing feeling in the yoke or and climb rate was greatly increased. before we were lucky to climb at 400 feet per minute while have to be very careful with the yoke.  

now we climb at around 600 to 700 feet per minute with no feeling of stalling.  what a great product.  thanks for the safety it adds to our aircraft.					


robert and jo harrismicro vg kit - rockwell commander 114a - nov. 2016 






						"simply incredible! i was doing steep turns at 50 mph and without vgs i’d have precipitated an accelerated stall. i couldn’t believe how responsive the ailerons were at that speed.it‘s like a completely different airplane in the way it feels and handles. stalls are much more placid and control response is there all the way".					


dick smithowner of cessna 180 / captain for alaska airlines - oct. 2015 






						thanks for all the help anni, might i add that the vgs have been absolutely phenomenal. they are on my aeronca chief and many of our "outback" strips are very short.  i have never lost any in flight, but in this case i was at a station (ranch) parked in the open when we had an incredible hail storm, golf ball sized hail. it knocked off three vgs, but fortunately there was not as much fabric damage as there could have been. i picked up the three vgs from the grass below the wings, so don't even need the spares in the kit.					


ian harvieowner of aeronca chief - dec. 2016 






						"charley, now i know why you had that little smirk on your face when you told me i would like the way it flies with vgs!. what a dream!. yes, it stalls slower, but the nice part is the way it handles. now it's sweet and gentle!!"					


verl scheibeowner of scout 8gcbc (used for the faa certification flights) - dec. 2016 






						pa-12 oy-cll has micro aerodynamics vortex generators. not only was the generator kit the most complete and easiest kit to work with i have ever tried, it also transforms the aircraft from good to spectacular. excellent low-speed control and a very secure feeling, even low and at 30 knots on final.

frequently asked questions 














do i get a gross weight increase ( gwi ) with the installation of a micro vortex generator kit on my airplane?

micro vgs provide certified weight changes on a select few models.models that include gross weight increase for take-off:cessna 310r / t310rcessna 335cessna 340cessna 340acessna 402ccessna 414acessna 421bcessna 421c models that include zero fuel weight ( zfw ) increase:piper seneca iicessna 310r/t310rcessna 414acessna 402c







how are the vortex generators attached to the airplane?

we use loctite® aa 330™ adhesive to attach the micro vortex generators. this is the same adhesive used by boeing aircraft company for many aerospace applications. our experience has been that only bird strikes produce sufficient force to knock off vortex generators in normal operations.







how do micro vgs work?

micro vortex generators are placed in a spanwise line two to fifteen percent aft of the leading edge of the wing. they control airflow over the upper surface of the wing and the tail surfaces by creating vortices that energize the boundary layer. this results in improved performance and control authority at low airspeeds up to the critical angle of attack.a micro vortex generator creates a tiny vortex in the airstream over an airfoil. this vortex energizes the normally stagnant boundary layer of air on the wing and tail surfaces. an energized boundary layer is more resistant to flow separation than a stagnant boundary layer. the result is that airflow “sticks” to the wing and control surfaces better, providing greater lift, which results in greater control in flight at slower airspeeds such as take-off and landing.







how long does the installation take?

installation using the provided illustrated installation manual can take as little as 6 hours and up to 14 hours depending on the number of surfaces on which the parts are installed, and how many total parts are in the kit for a specific aircraft model.it will take your mechanic approximately 3 hours to install the templates on the aircraft and double check the measurements. the remainder of the time is gluing each micro vortex generator in the cut-out of the template, and cleaning up any excess adhesive that may squeeze out under the base of the micro vg when pressed in place. some aircraft models also contain strakes which are installed with provided hardware.here is a video of an installation:

installing micro vgs on landing light lens

cessna 182 wing with micro vgsmicro vortex generator(s) can be installed directly on the landing light lens with the provided loctite® aa 330™ adhesive. if it falls on the landing light lens frame, the vortex generator(s) may be moved laterally the shortest distance necessary to clear the obstacle. the foot of the vortex generator may be trimmed, or shimmed as required as long as the blade remains intact.

is the vortex generator kit compatible with other stc's?

yes. we cannot, of course, test every possible combination of stcs for compatibility with our stc. however, our stc allows the installer to determine compatibility with other stcs on a given aircraft. the installer can perform an operational flight check per far 91.407(b) after installation of the micro vg kit to determine if there are any adverse characteristics created by the installation of vgs along with another stc.







micro vg falls partly on the inspection plate cover of the underside of horizontal stabilizer

glue the portion of the micro vortex generator that falls directly on the inspection plate to the cover, without moving the part fore/aft. the rest of the vg will not be glued to the aircraft.
