shakespeare on jealousy



jealousy and the suffering it inflicts on lovers is at the heart of shakespeare's later romances, cymbeline and the winter's tale. few moments in shakespeare's plays are as intense as that in which posthumus comes to believe that imogen has slept with iachimo (cymbeline, 2.4). although they bring us to the brink of tragedy, cymbeline and the winter's tale end with the defeat of jealousy, and so they are considered comedies.  this is not the case with shakespeare's best-known exploration of the "green-eyed monster" -- othello. read on...

imagery of disease in hamlet


in hamlet shakespeare weaves the dominant motif of disease into every scene to illustrate the corrupt state of denmark and hamlet's all-consuming pessimism. images of ulcers, pleurisy, full body pustules, apoplexy, and madness parallel the sins of drunkenness, espionage, war, adultery, and murder, to reinforce the central idea that denmark is dying. read on...

themes in the tempest




"the great and striking peculiarity of this play is that its action lies wholly in the ideal world. it differs, therefore, from every other work of shakespeare in the character of its mediation. our poet, in most of his dramas, portrays the real world, and exhibits man as acting from clear conscious motives, and not from supernatural influences. but here he completely reverses his procedure; from beginning to end the chief instrumentalities of the poem are external; its conflicts and solutions are brought about by powers seemingly beyond human might and intelligence." j. d. snider. read on...

why is king leir important?



the story of king lear and his three daughters is an old tale, well known in england for centuries before shakespeare wrote the definitive play on the subject. the first english account of lear can be found in the history of the kings of britain, written by geoffrey monmouth in 1135. however, it is clear that shakespeare relied chiefly on king leir, an anonymous play published twelve years before the first recorded performance of shakespeare's king lear. read on to find out more about leir and see side-by-side versions of leir and shakespeare's masterpiece.
                                        


 



what did shakespeare look like?



                                           the stratford bust, located on the wall of the chancel of holy trinity church at stratford-upon-avon, is the oldest and, along with the droeshout portrait, most credible of all the known images of shakespeare. but there are many representations of the bard that have been handed down throughout the centuries, each with its own fascinating story to tell. 




 


shakespeare in print: the perils of publishing in elizabethan england



during shakespeare's lifetime elizabethan playwrights cared little about seeing their work in print. only the rare drama was actually intended to be read as well as performed. writers would usually sell their plays to the theatrical company which staged the performances, and if the company committed a particular play to paper, it would create only one copy - the official copy - in the form of a prompt-book. a prompt-book was a transcript of the play used during performances, cluttered with stage directions, instructions for sound effects, and the names of the actors. if a play was printed for a reading audience, it was often without the author's consent. unprincipled publishers would steal the prompt-book, and sell copies for about fivepence apiece. read on...

richard burbage: the poet maker



there are no records of any significant tributes to shakespeare by his fellow actors and writers at the time of his death. the great eulogies praising the sweet swan of avon appeared much later, in the first folio of 1623. the situation was quite different for shakespeare's friend and legendary actor, richard burbage. when he died in 1619 the nation mourned and eulogies poured forth from distraught writers whose characters would surely die with him. the shock and sadness over burbage's passing may be the key to our understanding of why so little was written on shakespeare's death just three years earlier. read on...

the fascinating stage history of othello



many of shakespeare's plays have fallen in and out of favour throughout the centuries, but othello has remained one of his most popular. one performance of othello, produced in 1660, starred an actress by the name of margaret hughes in the role of desdemona. this production is of particular importance because it marked the first time a woman was accepted on the english stage. before this, all the characters, whether male or female, were played exclusively by men. read on...



 


entertainment in elizabethan england



                                           in elizabethan england, during the times when plays were not completely outlawed, going to the theatre was the favourite activity of the masses. when disease ravaged london, actors would travel across the english countryside, entertaining farmers. there were also many days devoted to feasting, such as mad day, midsummer day, and ascension day (just to name a few), when people would drink and make merry. dances were popular, whether you lived in london or in a small town, and so was getting together at the local pub for sing-alongs. read on...

out, out, brief candle!
 life's but a walking shadow, a poor player 
 that struts and frets his hour upon the stage 
 and then is heard no more.
macbeth, (5.5), macbeth

"there is a magic in the expression "brief candle" which i have never known any one to deny. what is the secret of it? a candle is a commonplace enough object; in itself it is not a poetical thing; it is something useful, something with regard to which the idea of use and ownership naturally arises; it stands low down, as an inanimate thing, on the scale of images which culminates in man. yet, as shakespeare has used it, it is a central image in a consummate bit of poetry." arthur fairchild. read on...
