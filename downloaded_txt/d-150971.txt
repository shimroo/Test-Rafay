estimate your repayment amount with  our loan calculator
our loan calculator helps you estimate the repayment amount based on the expected fees and cost of the loan. people usually talk about the annual interest rate calculators or apr calculators, but you should focus on the fee you will be paying for the loan, which on average, ranges from $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed and should pay back your loan on time. then any annual interest rate will be irrelevant.
note: different lenders have different rates, and the annual percentage rate (apr) for payday loans also varies from state to state, so the loan estimate is subject to change at any time. be sure to discuss all related information with your lender before agreeing to accept a loan.

frequently asked questions






                                    how much can i borrow? 







                                        you can borrow from $100 to $1,000 but there are limits established in each state that greatly differ. some states limit the maximum amount to $500. check your state website or ask your lender about maximum allowable amounts. your income is a prime determinant of loan amount and approval.
                                    






                                    if approved, when will i receive my funds?

                                    





                                        if your loan request is approved, you will likely receive the money within one working day. for example, if you request in the afternoon and get approved, you will receive the money on the next business day. it is possible if your request is approved very early in the morning that you will receive your funds later that day. but, ask your lender.

                                    






                                    how much interest will i pay?
                                    





                                        payday loans are regulated by state law; therefore, the annual percentage rate (apr), depends on the state from where the loan is borrowed. these loans are fee-based loans, ask your lender what your fees are, and you will know exactly what you owe.
                                    






                                    how do i repay my loan amount?





                                        the repayment is automatically withdrawn from your bank account on the due date; just make sure you have the required balance in your checking account. however, there can be other loan repayment options as agreed between you and your lender. ask your lender what options they offer as well as other loan options you may consider (like several months to repay).

disclaimers

notice: this disclosure is being provided to you pursuant to our terms of service with google®, inc. it is not required by any federal, state or local law. our lenders may offer you a loan with an apr as low as 200% and up to 900%. the apr on a small dollar, short term loan represents the amount of your loan, cost of the loan, term of the loan and repayment amounts and timing. loans on the lower end of the apr range may be for a larger loan amount and for a longer term. loans on the higher end of the apr range may be for a smaller loan amount and for a shorter term.


an advance of money obtained through a payday loan or auto title loan is not intended to meet long-term financial needs. a payday loan or auto title loan should only be used to meet immediate short-term cash needs. refinancing the loan rather than paying the debt in full when due will require the payment of additional charges.



depending on your credit needs and desire to pay your loan off quickly, your lender may only offer you loans with an apr near the high end of the range noted above.
this is an expensive form of credit. a short term loan should be used for short term financial needs only, not as a long term financial solution. customers with credit difficulties should seek credit counseling or meet with a nonprofit financial counseling service in their community. you are encouraged to consult your state’s consumer information pages to learn more about the risks involved with cash advances. state laws and regulations may be applicable to your payday loan.
if you do not pay your loan according to its terms, your lender may: charge you late fees, send your account to a collection agency, report your information to a consumer reporting agency which may negatively affect your credit score, offer to renew, extend or refinance your loan, which may cause you to incur additional fees, charges and interest. we are not a lender. only your lender can provide you with information about your specific loan terms and apr and the implications for non-payment of your loan. ask your lender for their current rates and charges and their policies for non-payment.


legal disclaimer: the owner/operator of this site is not a lender or affiliated with a lender in all states. this website offers a free service that attempts to connect consumers with lenders who may have loans for them. loans are not available in all states, and approval is not guaranteed. loan amounts, rates, and terms will vary depending on each lender and consumer qualifications. lenders may conduct credit checks that could affect your credit score. loan decisions may take longer if additional verification or documents are required.

   
notice: payday advances should be used for short-term financial needs only, not as a long-term financial solution. customers with credit difficulties should seek credit counseling.
