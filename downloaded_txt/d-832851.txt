welcome to prejean winery! we hope you'll be a part of our story




prejean has been a family-owned and operated winery for three generations. our first vineyards were planted by jim and elizabeth prejean in 1979, and we opened our doors in 1986.  we have been making estate-grown and produced, award-winning wines ever since. we produce small-batch vintages crafted with care by our winemaking team. we work thoughtfully with each season's growing conditions to produce consistently high-quality wine.




































we want to welcome you to our tasting room and invite you to share in our love of wine. it's important to us that our customers feel at home when they visit. we like to take our time with each tasting and provide profiles of the wines being tasted, or trade stories over a glass of your favorite vintage. we offer an array of different wines, from bone-dry, full-bodied reds to bright, nuanced dessert wines, and we're here to help you discover what you like best.




our owner, tom prejean, often says that wine tells a story: the soil in which the grapes grow, the hands that prune and tend them, and the inclinations of the winemaker all infuse the wine with particular perspectives and tastes. you, the tasters, are the most important part of the process. you are the readers of the story.
