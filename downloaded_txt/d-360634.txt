welcome to esu 7esu 7 serves students, ages birth to 21 in school districts of seven counties from its offices at 2657 44th avenue, columbus, nebraska. we walk behind our schools to keep them moving, beside them to help them stay focused and on track, and far enough in front of them to not only see where they are going, but to anticipate their needs.
