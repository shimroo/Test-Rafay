obscurities of the prayerbabies

 facebook 
  
spreading lemon-butter harmonies over
toasted guitars, with double-choc bass and
drums on the side, the magnificent four – ian
birdwheel-frights, paul dalby, dan harvey and
nick thorpe concoct a heady brew of country,
blues and gospel, washed down with a snifter
latin, disco, rock, pop and whatever else
happens to be on offer at the time.
whether performing at a festival with 30-voice
gospel choir south of the river, administering
and overdosey-doh to a crowded inner-city pub;
or luring party goers of all ages onto the dance
floor, the prayerbabies inevitably win over their
audiences with their sly humour and previously
inconceivable arrangements of oddly familiar
songs.
