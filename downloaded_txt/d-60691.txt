                my options broker has options research tools but they just aren't good enough.our tools are built by self-directed investors for self-directed investors. we have spent over 25 years building every tool you could need to find, compare, analyze, and manage your options trading. we show option analytics, returns and management ideas that your broker doesn't. we use these tools to trade everyday - and wouldn't dream of trading without poweroptions.

"[poweroptions] is a complex, deep, fully featured and built-out site, in my view...everytime i think of a feature that would be nice to have on poweroptions, it seems like i find it the next time i'm exploring the interface...also, the one-on-one coaching, wow i do like this feature. overall you've just created an awesome product here. i can figure it out, and hopefully as i learn more, use it to good effect to maximize my returns and limit risk. thanks for creating this. i've been looking for something like poweroptions for a long time.
