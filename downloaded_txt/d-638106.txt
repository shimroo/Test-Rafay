the disgruntled autoworker and observations newsletters 
                      were written by uaw member, and gm 
                      employee doug hanscom (retired 03.31.09). their purpose was to inform 
                      and educate the union's membership about the devastating effect 
                      the uaw international executive board's joint partnerships with gm, ford & chrysler corporate executives were having on  international and local union politics, and on working conditions in assembly and parts plants nationwide. the once adversarial uaw morphed into a (sissified) go along to get along union. in time the ieb became full-fledged partners (tratiors) of the corporations much to the chagrin of many local union officers and members; thereby forcing some officers and members to form dissident movements new directions, soldiers of solidarity and autoworker caravan, to name a few, which unsucessfully challenged corp/ieb policies and programs implimented in  plants and forced on  local unions. 
a major consequence of the partnerships was rampant nepotism and favoritism in the selection and appointment of people to fill the dozens of shop floor positions created by the partnership's policies and programs that at first fostered envy, then resentment and in some incidences hostilities between appointees and members with more seniority or more qualifed for said positions. often with an assist from plant management, the local union's pro-partnership incumbents quickly learned to use their newly created appointee army as a campaign tool to ensure the longevity of the pro-partnership caucus in future local elections, thereby rendering the membership's influence in their local and international union moot.                    
while my newsletters were instrumental in helping to unseat pro-partnership, ergo, corrupt union officials in baltimore's local, our success was quickly undermined by meddling uaw international officers, in many incidences with the help of their corporate partners in the plant. membership representation took a back seat to the partnerships. our local was just one of many around the country that faced interference by international officials and their corporate partners. some of their stories are in the pages below. the lesson learned is; unseating corrupt local union officials is futile, which brings to mind a military idiom, and that is to remedy corruption in the locals, one must cut off the heads of the snakes at the international. of course i don't mean literally, but the crux of all that is wrong with the uaw is the single party slate that has occupied the ieb since the uaw's creation in 1937. unless they are unseated or dealt with in the same manner they've dealt with rogue locals and dissension, they will continue to supersede the will of the membership.
 free speech violation & precedent setting victory 
 in october of 06, my free speech rights were compromised in the gm/uaw local 435 wilmington, delaware assembly plant. management reprimanded me for allegedly violating plant rule 29, “the making or publishing of false, vicious, or malicious statements concerning any employee, advisor, the company or its products.” i believed the reprimand was unwarranted and unjust, and used as a tool to silence me. i did not circulate another newsletter out of fear additional bogus charges  could lead to my dismissal. i had to demand a grievance, and experience taught me that uaw international and local reps will deliberately drag out a resolution to prolong my silence. to follow my two year quest for justice that resulted in a precedent setting victory, begin with the newsletter that started it all, read "gobs and yum yums" here.
