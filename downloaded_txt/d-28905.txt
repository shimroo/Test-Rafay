the masonic magazine on freemasonry and research into freemasonry made by freemasons
ps review of freemasonry is the oldest, most popular and famous freemasons’ online magazine written by master masons of a grand lodge of ancient, accepted free masons.







masonic curiosities: origin of the word freemasons
the first-known use of the word freemasons - in the form free masons - occurs in city of london letter-book h of 9 august 1376, though the word is in fact deleted in favour of mason. masons and freemasons were interchangeable during the 15th and 16th centuries and freemasons were generally meant to denote hewers or setters of freestone, masons being used to embrace all stoneworkers. ashmole in his diary wrote that he was made a free mason and referred in 1686 to the "fellowship of free masons". james anderson when writing his 1723 constitutions did not use the single word - freemasons - once. whatever the reasons, the 1723 constitutions contain approximately 126 references to masons, 12 to free masons, 10 to free and accepted masons, 9 to free-masons, one to accepted free masons and none to freemasons. and such is the tenacity of tradition that to this day the most of the constitutions are addressed to free and accepted masons and not to accepted freemasons. the earliest-known anti-masonic leaflet, of 1698, warns the public against "those called free masons" - almost certainly what we now know as speculative freemasons.

craft in spirit by julian rees
pilgrimage: a journey towards light

after the prayer in the first degree, the aspirant is led round the temple by the deacon in a clockwise manner, past the master in the east, and halting at the junior warden and senior warden for an examination.

in times gone by, in all pursuits of self-discovery and self-improvement, as well as spiritual quests, a pilgrimage was necessary. in the ancient world, the deities who controlled certain areas of life were unable to operate outside those areas. their power to favour or to destroy only operated within their own area. so a man from the mountains who found himself in the plain and was in need of divine help, had to make a pilgrimage back to his place of origin in order once again to be one with the deity controlling the mountainous regions. pilgrimages therefore are journeys with a sacred or spiritual intent, and since the whole of freemasonry is a journey, we have here a little pilgrimage, a part of that total journey.

 the importance of plotâs natural history of stafford-shire 1686
by rw bro yasha beresiner ll.b.


this volume contains the earliest recorded account of accepted masonry and is considered the most implicit report on the fraternity available for the period at the end of the 17th century. it is printed in paragraphs 85 to 88 inclusive, on pages 316 to 318 of the tome.this text is referred to as the plot abstract. its importance lies with regard to its content i.e. the summary of the legendary history, the description of contemporary freemasonry, and the criticisms of the fraternity and as to the sources from which plot may have derived his information, most importantly, what he refers to as the âlarge parchment volum they have amongst them . . .âthe purpose of this article is not to analyse the text and its content but rather to identify and clarify the reasons behind the importance of this volume in the context of masonic bibliography and history. continue reading »










researching freemasonryin the 21st century:opportunities and challenges
by prof. pierre-yves beaurepaireprofesseur d'histoire moderneuniversitã© de nice sophia-antipolis

masonic academic research today has 
reached a turning point. carried on for decades by academics belonging to the 
masonic order or philosophically near to it, masonic scholarship continually 
sought out legitimacy from university and scholarly authorities. 

the research 
centres, chairs, seminars, and applications for high level international 
projects have multiplied, often with the support of masonic grand lodges. 

in 
parallel, these obediences created, welcomed or financed their own research 
institutes or conference centres. they understand the importance of their 
heritage: archival materials, pictures and artefacts represented a powerful 
support for the organization, illustrated by the often remarkable public 
artistic exhibitions.

however, the assessment remains mixed.
masonic studies remain isolated and still suffers from a recognition 
problem. it is therefore collectively that we need to think of the question of 
the bonds which still link masonic research to the patronage of grand lodges and 
to all kind of masonic institutions. 

there also exists an equally difficult 
second challenge: the ritual invocations to georg simmel or jã¼rgen habermas 
aside, how can we integrate masonic studies into research on public space, 
social networks and networking, history of ideas, studies of individual 
trajectories or of the birth of a political culture for latin masonry (what do 
you mean by "latin"? latin america? not clear for english-speaking audience), 
without making lodges and their members a simple pretext, but by considering them 
as such and for themselves? 

the positivist, factual, chronological history of 
freemasonry has undoubtedly its own interest. it constituted even a necessary 
stage. but from now on masonic research must not only integrate the academic and 
professional rules of a researcher in the humanities and social sciences, but...

geometric properties of masonic symbols - sacred geometry

the synchronicity of the universe is determined by certain mathematical constants which express themselves in the form of 'patterns' and 'cycles' in nature. mathematical and geometric constants are confirmation that certain proportions are woven into the very fabric of nature. recognising the significance of this simple fact offers us the means to understand how and why such matters were considered sacred. they and everything around us, are the product of the delicate balance between chaos and order.a collection of research papers by bro. william steve  burkle kt, 32â°, scioto lodge no. 6, chillicothe, g.l. of f.&a.m. of ohio.

a guide for the new esoteric freemason by bro william steve burkle kt, 32â°, kcrbe

the body of freemasonry is comprised of many types of individuals whose masonic pursuits vary according to that individualâs personality and interests. freemasonry has been very aptly been compared to a complex tapestry composed of many colorful overlapping individual threads which taken as a whole form a larger picture.  brother mason pratt developed  a list of different âbrandsâ of freemasons based upon behavioral characteristics which included: âsocialiteâ, âhistorianâ, ritualistâ, âphilosopherâ, âmasonic lawâ, âsymbolismâ, and âcollectorâ. i would add to this list the brands âcharitableâ and âfiduciaryâ. i suspect that most of us can think of brothers in our own lodge who fit one of these diverse profiles.
esoteric freemasons usually fit into one or more of these âbrandâ categories, although âhistorianâ, âritualistâ, âsymbolismâ, and âphilosopherâ are the most common. every initiated freemason however is a potential esoteric mason, since all freemasons seek illumination (light) through the initiation process. it is this quest for light revealed through the comprehension of hidden spiritual knowledge which distinguishes the esoteric freemason and defines esoteric masonry. 
esoteric freemasonry is not for everyone, not even for everyone who receives the gift of illumination. this is in no way a reflection upon the character or works of masons who for various reasons find themselves disinclined to pursue the esoteric path. unfortunately, there are many masons who pronounce that there simply is no esoteric content at all to be had in freemasonry, even though masonic ritual is ripe with evidence to the contrary.

all about freemasonry - for non-freemasons
freemasonry  is one of the world's oldest secular fraternal societies. freemasonry is a society of men concerned with moral and spiritual values. freemasons are taught its precepts by a series of ritual dramas, which follow ancient forms, and use stonemasons' customs and tools as allegorical guides. the essential qualification to become freemason is a belief in a supreme being. a freemason's duty as a citizen must always prevail over any obligation to other masons, and any attempt to shield freemasons who as acted dishonourably or unlawfully, or to confer an unfair advantage on other free masons is contrary to this prime duty. the freemasons refer to those who are not freemasons as "cowans" because in architecture a cowan is someone apprenticed to bricklaying but not licenced to the trade of masonry.

all about freemasonry - for non-freemasons
freemasonry  is an esoteric society only in that certain aspects are private; freemasons state that masonry is not, in the 21st century, a secret society but a "society with secrets". some freemasons describe freemasonry as a "confidential" society in contrast to a secret society. most modern freemasons regard the traditional concern over secrecy as a demonstration of their ability to keep a promise and a concern over the privacy of their own affairs. lodge meetings, like meetings of many other social and professional associations, are private occasions open only to members. the private aspects of modern freemasonry deal with the modes of recognition amongst members and elements within the ritual. in reality, freemasons are proud of their true heritage and happy to share it, offering spokesmen, briefings for the media, and providing talks to interested groups upon request. on this site curious non-masons can find out the real secret lives of the freemasons as far as what are the secrets of freemasons.
