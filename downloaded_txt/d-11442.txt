bakers tend to have a list of 'must haves' they want to bake for christmas. for me,

          i always like to make this fruit cake. i just love the combination of nuts and dried 
          and candied fruits with barely enough cake batter to hold it all

          together. if you have ever made a british fruit cake you know that

          what really sets this cake apart is how we repeatedly 'feed' (brush) the cake 
          with alcohol

          over several weeks. this

          gives the fruit cake a subtle alcohol flavor and a  moist texture, plus it

          also acts as a preservative so the cake can be stored for ages and ages. of course, the

          step of repeatedly brushing the cake with alcohol means we have to make
          it well in advance of christmas. but is that so bad? with all the hustle and bustle of

          the christmas season, doing our baking several weeks in advance can

          only be a good thing. 





 
this fruit cake recipe is adapted from nigel slater's 
      excellent 'the kitchen diaries' and it is by
      far the best one i have ever made. it is jammed with dried fruits (raisins, currants,
      dried cranberries and/or cherries, dried figs, prunes, dried apricots, 
      etc.) and candied
      fruit and/or peel. if you're not familiar with candied fruit, it's preserved fruit that has been

      dipped several times in a concentrated sugar syrup. nuts are also

      included as is ground almonds (you can buy prepackaged ground almonds or 
      you can just take blanched almonds and process them until finely ground in 
      your food processor).  


finally, if you are an

          avid fan of fruit cakes and want to make them other times of the

          year, it might be a good idea to pick up extra candied fruit during

          the holiday season as it can be hard to find once the christmas season
          ends.
