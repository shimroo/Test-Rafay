**************************************************************************


the patented traeger feed systems have  proven to be reliable since the early 1980's.  

the 20th century has seen a dramatic change in central heating systems, from wood and coal, to oil, to heat pumps and natural gas, and back to wood again. today, nearly all central heating systems are dependent upon electricity, natural/propane gas, or oil as a fuel source. the convenience of these modern heating systems has not come without their price tags and certain realities. dependence on non-renewable energy resources over the past 50+ years has taught us that: 

1. the supply of oil and gas is limited and non-renewable.
2. electricity, oil, and gas costs will increase as supplies decrease.
3. if we remain dependent on these sources of energy, we will definitely face an energy crisis again!
4. if we don't learn from the past, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.
5. we must look to central heating systems that utilize renewable energy sources.
6. the upward spiral in use of non-renewable energy resources reduces these supplies and increases the costs of use.
7. use of these diminishing resources also causes adverse effects on our environment and our fragile eco systems.

wood furnaces burn a renewable resource; yet they require hard work to stoke, and typically are not very efficient, neither with heat transfer nor combustion efficiency (emissions). 

around 1980, traeger industries(mt angel, oregon) developed the first residential corn & pellet fired stoves and furnaces. designed to meet coming air quality standards these corn & pellet fired units performed effectively and efficiently without the negatives of a typical wood furnace. these early units have developed into corn & wood pellet stoves, inserts, furnaces, and boilers that are the most efficient renewable resource burning appliances manufactured today. 

for years corn has been 'the alternative fuel of choice', especially in the midwest using traeger furnaces. in addition to corn & wood pellets, other seeds & grains, plus numerous types of renewable biomass fuel burn efficiently in the traeger units. 

a variety of traeger furnace models are available ranging from 70,000 btu(gbu-070)up to 400,000 btu(model gbu-400). residential, commercial, and industrial models are available. we also have a 85/150,000 btu boiler.
if you are thinking of central heating with a renewable biomass energy product, remember the name traeger. 
****traeger model gbu-130****
the gbu-130, can be set from 50,000 to 130,000+ btu, giving it a wide range of heating for larger homes, shops, and commercial uses.

the gbu-130 can be installed 'upflow' or 'downflow' and, if height is a factor, set in a 'lowboy' configuration. domestic hot water option is available to save money on your hot water while you heat your home.

(tpb150c) traeger corn-fired boiler
****************************************

traeger industries and american energy systems (aes) are two of the original manufacturers of the modern corn and pellet stoves. today there are many manufacturers (and many have fallen by the wayside), but the original traeger feed/burn system and aes countryside still endure as the safest and most durable biomass burners on the market today. 

our stoves are capable of burning shelled corn which is commonly used as animal feed. corn as fuel is not as crazy as it may sound. it is already being processed into ethanol used as a motor fuel and blended in gasoline for hotter, cleaner burn---and less exhaust pollution. (they will also burn other grains, cherry pits, and wood pellets,  too!)

most of today's pellet fuel is made from compressed wood waste; but down the road, the ability to pelletize or burn other types of organic, biomass waste (agricultural by-products such as peanut shells and walnut shells) promises a changing future for pellet stoves. and while all of today's brands of pellet stoves are capable of burning premium quality wood pellets, only the patented traeger and aes countryside burn systems are designed with the future in mind. 

the patented traeger and aes burn  systems were developed to accommodate these high ash content, lower grade(and lower cost) fuels. what this all means is that our corn and pellet stoves are ready to handle the fuels of the future, as well as, today's low-ash fuels.

the convenience of clean, easy to handle fuel presents a practical alternative to those who have lost some of their youthful enthusiasm for the more "physical" aspect of handling cordwood. but fuel innovation and convenience are still not appealing enough to overcome the lack of a realistic fire (high intensity "blowtorch" flames have plagued other brands of pellet stoves from the beginning). 
our used earth stove corn and pellet stoves feature 'the natural fire', "wide flame" look of a real wood fire. our flame is unmatched by the unnatural flames of other pellet stoves. this makes our corn and pellet stoves the natural choice for even the most discrete fire watchers. 

traeger stove technology was manufactured in the u.s. by earth stove of tualatin, oregon. earth stove manufactured a wide range of models to fit every application. the traeger corn furnaces are manufactured by pinnacle stove sales of bc.

traeger corn/pellet technology: 
the best built 
the best fire 
the best safety features 
the best warranty 
the best fuel versatility 
the best history
