reservoir intelligence is gathered and interpreted by a team of experts unparalleled in the industry using innovative technology and a unique, integrated process. 















 




 



                    petrophysical analysis                
the intelligence required to make profitable decisions.



                                                                                learn more                                     




 







 




 



                    reservoir engineering                
optimizing development of conventional and unconventional reservoirs. 



                                                                                learn more                                     




 







 




 



                     geological modeling                
get a more detailed picture of what's happening in the reservoir.



                                                                                learn more                                     




 















 




 



                    completion engineering                
the reservoir is not homogeneous, so your completions shouldn't be either.



                                                                                learn more                                     




 







 




 



                     core analysis                
essential for determining oil and gas potential based off the experimental results of core samples.



                                                                                learn more
