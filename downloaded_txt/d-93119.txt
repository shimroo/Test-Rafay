day 11 - 12th october party preparationsafter a very rough night of pain and dizziness and nausea not alcohol induced, but very scary passing out and being so disorientated, i got up late and feeling very emotionally sapped. it was however party day and the community of preparations was just abuzz. the weather was just amazing and the front garden really came together with lights and flags and tents and tables and chairs and a stage. 
my small job was to get some parking signs done, that i did manage to do in my compromised but getting better state.  tbc

day 9 - 11th octobertoday i had a visit from my friend sara and a great chat catching up on old times and all the things that have happened since. so nice just to sit back and catch up in the great weatherdid a bit of tetris packing and discovered i can bring home a quintessence and still be within my weight and size allowance :-)had a small bite to eat when mum and julian and susan came over then we headed off to see charlotte‚Äôs studio. got to meet some of the other cowgirls and take home a few sentimentals. such a beautiful and inspiring place to work.came back to charlotte‚Äôs for a bit then headed back to where mum was staying to spend some time with her and go through the dress up combinations-still unsure :-/. then had a cuppa catchup with another old friend emma, in another new house with another new baby. love how we all are growing up. only seems like yesterday that we were young and reckless.then a shower and back off to charlotte‚Äôs to meet up with all the people in town for some delicious thai and got to see kobi and meet his new boyfriend. i am so proud of how our society is changing and the people are being themselves. sometimes it takes bravery and sometimes it is just the most comfortable thing - tonight was one of those. love my eclectic, open family.after midnight again, but that is only by an atlanta clock :-)

day 8 - 10th octoberhappy birthday to my sister, nephew and uncle today. such a special day to be here in the us, even though kobi was a few hundred miles away.woke up sometime shortly before 10am after another great night‚Äôs sleep and mostly just sat around all day on the back patio in the dappled sunlight organising the party, talking to family across the table and on facetime, a little bit of work, lots of tea and the great company of tates and dad and moira and nat.charlotte received her birthday gifts scattered across the day and it was a great day just to hang out and enjoy all the giving.i had some opportunity to try out a few outfit combinations for saturday and to help others with theirs, ¬†so it was like being a 3yo and playing dress up. :-)¬†also tried to see how much i was going to fit in my suitcases and boy do all my kids and michael‚Äôs stuff take up a lot of room. still hoping to bring back a quintessence.got ready and went to a great restaurant at a big square table with a family (& significants) gathering of 14 people. quite an achievement!!! and a wonderful celebration for uncle julian and charli.home again for some work and hopefully an earlier night than i have been having.

day 7 - 9th octobera lovely solid sleep and being woken up to an amazing home cooked breakfast by jem. awesome.took a nice long artistic warm walk around atlanta on what used to be the rail trail. the artwork along the way was spectacular. stopped half way for some yoghurt and fruit and then headed back to jem‚Äôsgot to hear a little of maria jamming with a double base then charl and nat left. jem, maria and i dropped in at the love is art warehouse before heading off for some last minute birthday preparations.hung out at jem‚Äôs later and talked to family and listened to maria writing a new piece of music. üéºtook the dogs for a run in the park before nat and michael came over to catch up for dinner before their hinder concert.started out at a cuban resturant, but ended up going to a really great thai, mostly because i confused cuban with cajun. :-/ thai was really good though.dropped nat and michael at masquerade for concert then we went to this crazy adult house of halloween terror. omg what an experience perhaps not fit for all ears in this forum. then home again for a cuppa before heading out again to pick them up then home to charlotte‚Äôsby then it was happy birthday charlotte. üéâ decided to give her her present and she seemed as excited about it as i was. :-)another late night for me, so at 2:45am i will say goodnight and i miss my family back home.

day 6 - 8th octoberwoke up early to the pleasant sound of my mum enjoying the company of her brother and sister-in-law. such a treat for us all, but unfortunately the weather did not behave how we would of liked, so we had to make some plans other than sitting on the beach all day.first stop was breakfast at the ‚Äòhole in the wall‚Äô maybe called 'surf shack‚Äô or something, but enjoyed some bacon and eggs amongst some interesting southern company. actually, the funniest thing was listening to julian and susan having to go through all the culinary decision of ¬†breakfast.then off to the shops we went to get some more things for the extravaganza on saturday night. first 'world market‚Äô that did not have the jewellery that i was looking for, then off to marshall‚Äôs which let me down big time. i only ended up buying 3 small tops before we had to rush home to pack and get ready for my flight to atlanta.a very quick shower, pack and cup of tea and we were off to the airport. a short flight and i was met in atlanta by charli and nat and then off to decatur to meet jeremy for dinner.it was great to see jem and catch up on how things were going and the lamb kabob was just amazing - next time i will get some flavoured rice.then around the corner to eddies attic and to meet jem‚Äôs girlfriend, maria, before she headed onstage for her performance.she sounded truly amazing. such a smooth holding voice that any youtube clip does not do justice to. the next band (surprisingly the only one i got a photo of - probably because i was not really paying attention) was pretty ordinary, but the feature act snel was a young girl group that were actually quite good. -¬†(addendum go some pics of zara sky and snel :-))then off to another bar for some dessert, and back to jeremy‚Äôs for a chat and a late night to bed‚Ä¶. here i sit at 2am and i‚Äôm going to crash in bed after a very long day

day 3 - 5th octoberafter a pancake breakfast made by my mum, we spent most if the day chatting and lying in the beach.i did a lot of swimming as the rip was not nearly as strong as yesterday. the water was so warm and the waves were great to swim in. at one point i thought i would go for a surf, but they were all shore breakers, so not really worth it.we also discovered that one if the nests we were watching hatched last night and we missed it. about x80 turtles, so maybe some more stragglers tonight.then we all got ready for the opening night of the art show. amazing how all these straggly beach woman can clean up.the show was great. lots of cheese and wine and some amazing artwork. i also found a cute boutique store and bought some awesome shorts with 70% off.ofter the show we all went out for dinner and i had way too much to drink, but some yummy pork an prawns and scallopswhen we got back, charlotte and i stayed up late watching for turtles, but they never came before we needed to crash in bed.
