rockinfreakapotamus/globalfreakapotamus fanclub get together!

august 7-11, 2002 was the rockinfreakapotamus' 2nd annual get together!  it was in toronto, ontario, canada.  half the people who attended the 2001 global in michigan attended the toronto one also.  we got to go inside for a special live acoustic set with the band...at the edge 102 radio station.  later on that night...20 of us got into the live at much music interview with the band too.  the fanclub had the best standing places, and it was definetly a great experience for all of us.
next global is in england at the v2003 festival, and then one sometime after august in california.
