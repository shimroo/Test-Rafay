pricewaterhousecoopers uk has a term for the housing market: “slowth”





by john fowler, big4.com august 20th, 2010
(blog) stagnation plus inflation is “stagflation”
breakfast plus lunch is “brunch”
you have very likely heard of these common blended words.
now pricewaterhousecoopers (pwc) uk introduces “slowth” into housing lexicon, which is not what the urban dictionary defines as “slowness. generally sloth-like behavior, especially of computers or co-workers” but presumably a blended word of “slow” plus “growth”.
in this case, slowth has hit the uk housing market.

kpmg extends consulting depth, buys grant thornton supply chain practice







john fowler, big4.com july 19, 2010
we have not seen many acquisitions come through for kpmg us, but there has been growing rhetoric about the need for big four firms to get back into the consulting business.  see this article right from kpmg’s global site, which says….”for some time, the big 4 accountants have been keen to make the point that they're more than just auditors. less than ten years ago though, three of them exited the market for consultancy services. fast forward several years and they're back en masse - and seemingly more assured than before.
