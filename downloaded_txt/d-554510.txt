experience the local service difference.




personalized fit matters.with so many available brands and styles, finding the right running shoe or orthotic can be a challenge. ensuring the correct fit in your running shoe or orthotic can improve your performance, make your day or experience more comfortable, and - most importantly - prevent injury. our knowledgeable staff provides a custom-fit experience to every customer. it’s the local running store difference that you won’t find from a big box retailer. here’s what you can expect from our custom-fit process:we check your arches.  we have you stand on a tool that uses temperature-based technology to reveal visible results of you arch profile while also looking for overpronation or supination.we check your gait. we look at your knee alignment and watch you walk to determine what support and stability you need in your shoe or insole.we measure your foot. we measure you properly for the correct length and width to get you in the right size for you.we will show you a selection of shoes from your favorite brands to choose from that will be the best fit for you.

“working 12-hour shifts in a hospital does a number on your feet, legs, knees, and back…never did i think i'd need to go to a running store, but i am glad i chose this one and on top of that, it was incredibly efficient. don't always believe the hype about a certain shoe, go see these experts and they will help you find what works best for you! highly recommend.”— emily m., ken combs customer
