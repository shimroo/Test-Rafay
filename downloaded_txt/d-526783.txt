el rocío del pilar inscrito bernard








que hermoso jardín esta en frente de mi. lleno de rosas de todos colores. tantos son los colores que forman un matiz de belleza incalculable. también veo muchos pilares hechos de mármol. estos pilares son de diferentes alturas y tamaños.paredes de pilares, bancas hechas de pilares. pero lo mas hermoso de todo es que los pilares todos tienes hiedras llena de rosas. que se forman como si estos pilares estuvieran forrados de un tapiz celestial.   la temperatura aquí esta fresca y agradable. tan agradable que se puede notar el rocío en todo. en los pétalos de rosa, los pilares, las hiedras. el rocío hace que todo luzca como una pintura. que vista mas hermosa…   me siento en una banca para poder relajarme con esta belleza cuando noto que el pilar que esta a mi lado tiene un nombre inscrito. be, e, ere, ene, a, ere, de, bernard…   el rocío del pilar inscrito bernard es el más bello de todos los rocíos en este jardín sideral.

¡mi rocío!








abro mis ojos al nuevo día. un día hermoso lleno del bello calor del sol. y mientras su luz me alumbra solo tengo un pensamiento en mente.   ¡rocío!   como mi ser te extraña.   mi pelo anhela el toque de tus manos. así como una llanura siente el viento cuando la acaricia.    mi oído anhela el sonido de tu voz. así como si fuera mágico se apodera de todo mí ser y me paraliza.   mi nariz anhela tu esencia. así como la fragancia del perfume más caro del mundo.   mis ojos anhelan tu imagen. así como aquella imagen de un ángel sideral que acaba de bajar del cielo.   mis labios anhelan el toque de tus labios. así como se anhela el dulce más delicioso.    mis manos anhelan el toque de tu piel. así como no pudieran vivir sin tu existencia y han nacido solo para tocarte.   mi piel anhela el toque de tu piel. así como si el destino los hizo contiguos y fueron predestinados a estar juntos.    mi corazón nació solamente para latir por ti. tu aliento es el aire que respiro y moriría sin el.   te amo con la ternura de un niño, con la intensidad de un millón de soles, con la inmensidad de la galaxia, con la pasión de mil amantes.   es imposible poder expresar con una sola palabra como yo me siento cuando te tengo conmigo. aunque se quede corta, solo una palabra es la más justa para expresar mis sentimientos exactamente como lo siento…   y tomando todo la que he dicho previamente yo tomo esta palabra y conjugándola en una oración yo digo:   te amo rocío.

a lovely day








a lovely day by: robert a bernard jr.   the day is incredibly gorgeous and full of life and light. the clear blue skies and the lake are extremely translucent. so translucent that i could see then full of life as i glimpse at the fishes swimming. even thought the sun is at its mid point and it is very warm, the day wanted me to feel comfortable and sent the wind to keep me cool. the wind carries the aroma of every single flower in the field and combines it into this collage of scents which lifts my spirits and sends my soul into a cosmic journey.   i hear the sounds of birds singing all around me as if in celebration of this beautiful day. as i taste the sweet nectar of a fruit i realize that all my senses are united as in sync with this heavenly feeling. my skin feels the touch of the wind. so soft, so serene, so peaceful, so gentle that i feel i am been loved. my eyes are bearing witness to the most magnificent scenario in the universe. and i found myself to be captivated by the splendorous beauty.   everything is moving in such a way as if it is in sync with this un-hearable music. as if nature had arranged it to be just perfect. there is no need for music and yet my ears feel it. the wind helps it. i am in a deep trance.   i look around and see everything in my surrounding to be just so. i feel peace, tranquility, serenity and loved…   i feel loved!   my heart beats inside me as if it is speaking its own language. in its language of love it tells me that i am in love.   could it be that the feeling that i am under right now might be just this?   love!   is it possible that everything around me it's just a little brighter because i am in love?   or is that everything around me knows that i am in love and joined together in celebration of such love?   as i finish my fruit i lie down on the grass and place my arms under my head as for comfort and i look up at the sky.   what a gorgeous blue sky…   i can see the birds flying over me as they sing their amazingly beautiful songs. they melt my heart as i hear them sing and see them flying together. i can see the clouds in the sky way above. they appear as soft patches of cotton.   white as snow!   i still feel the wind caressing my skin. every single hair in my body feels the wind's caress. i have such a tingling sensation that warms my soul. i realize that my body is part of this heavenly concert as i hear the beats of my own heart go… thump, thump… thump, thump… all in tune with the harmonious ballet from nature.   i hear the sounds of the water as it hits the rocks at the bottom of the precipice.   what an amazingly beautiful waterfall!   i raise myself just so slightly until i am sitting straight so i could have a good appreciation of such a splendor. the mist from water helps keep everything around here green and lush with life. it looks as if everything has an all day round dew which helps keep everything cool.    this is heaven!   as i lay back down i turn my face to my side and i can see that she is still sleeping.   what a stunning site it is!   i can hear the peaceful breathing coming out of her nostrils.  i can see how her body weaves at the rhythm of her breathing. i can see her hair spread on top of the grass as if it was a black silk sheet.   her face convinces me that i am truly in heaven since she looks like an angel resting. he beautiful red lips are so radiant and inviting.   they are so tempting. mmm…   i immediately close the distance between my face and hers until our lips are so close. my heart beats faster and faster as if anticipating what's to come.    the touch of her lips to mine!   i kiss her… and as i kiss her i realize that she is kissing me back. she woke and with her eyes close she kisses me. it is such a passionate kiss that her arms could not resist my touch and they surround me in a heavenly hug.   what a tender hug!   for a brief moment our lips put distance between them and we can see each others faces. her deep chocolate eyes make me want to swim in them. and i can not help but to smile at the though that the sparkle i see in them it's because of me.   "hello my angel" she says while my heart melt as i hear such words.   her voice is so sweet and lovely that i close the distance between us once more for a hug.   and as i am hugging her i whisper in her ears "hello my beautiful heavenly angel"   i can feel her heart beat in her chess as i hug her.  as i lay back down she places her beautiful head on top of my chess while my arm wraps around her back. i kiss her forehead as we both take the scenery in.   i am so lucky to be able to share such a gorgeous site with the love of my life. we feel as if we were one person.   "i love you so much my love" she says.   i kiss her forehead once more. "i love you so very much my love" i reply.   as beautiful as this place is, it will never ever be complete without your beauty. i could not bear to spend any day without you my love because everyday with you gets better and better.   today is more beautiful that yesterday and tomorrow will be more beautiful than today.   just because you love me as much as i love you.   i love you!   i will love you until the light of all the galaxies, that ever existed, are extinguished.   and i will always love you for ever and ever… my love.

my true love








my true love by: robert a bernard jr.   it is a beautiful morning and the amber color sky reaches far into the horizon. i am sitting on the tall grass looking to the horizon as the suns honors it with their beautiful light. the grass feels as if i am sitting in the main chair of an auditorium made in the clouds as to prepare me for a celestial masterpiece.  the wind is moving through the tall grass as if brushing it, preparing the scenery for a beautiful brand new day. the clouds are moving across the atmosphere as if cleaning the sky blue so it would be clear. the air feels pure and full of energy. as i sit there observing; this sight reaches far into this stunning horizon.    at last i can see the two suns rising in synchronous. what a sunrise! these beautiful stars are breaking through the horizon and they are becoming more and more visible. the morning dew is shining with anticipation as if welcoming these heavenly stars with open arms.    such a beautiful site makes me feel as if i was truly in heaven. i can see these beautiful stars slowly rise higher and higher as if they want you to appreciate their beauty and they don't want you to miss a minute. knowing that for the observer the site was well worth the wait as the celestial couple makes their appearance. these stars are forever together under an invisible bond. and only their careful motion shows you their passion for each other.     the cool night air is slowly been replace by the warmth of the suns. the tender warmth from these suns penetrates my skin and warms my heart. i can not help but to smile, as i feel this sensation. i relax my back and allow myself to rest completely on the glass. this way i am stretch out on a bed of soft heavenly crimson grass.    yes i am in ecstasy with this overwhelming sensation that over takes all my senses. i take it in and it reaches every corner of my body. as i close my eyes, for a brief moment i am one with the universe. i can sense it, feel it and be one with it. this allows that instead of viewing this heavenly body, i can feel the beauty deep inside me. i can feel its beauty.    is it possible to mentally perceive a physical beauty? i know i am…   at this moment i open my eyes and i can see the big blue sky. no sign of clouds. the clouds really did their job because the sky is radiantly beautiful. i still feel the wind as it caresses me and bring me the sense of love through my whole body.    unexpectedly i see a slight fog surround me. it feels nice and cool as if it is hugging me. it brings a feeling of peace and affection to my being. in the middle of this fog, a figure slowly starts materializing in front of me. i rise to a sitting position so i can examine better what is going on. the fog is concentrating on a specific spot in front of me and it is forming into something. i am trying to figure out what is it but i can not tell. i feel paralyze with ecstasy and curiosity.    what is this figure?   the fog is moving as by an invisible wind and condensing more and more. every particle of the fog is moving in a way that it appears as it is taking a specific location within the form. and as every particle comes together in one spot, it starts to take its form.     i see… could it be?   the more these particles come together the more this form is becoming more and more human in appearance.   is it human? is it celestial? is it angelical?   is an angel!   i must be in heaven after all is what i thought after i finally saw what was in front of me. it was the figure of the most beautiful woman i have ever seen in my entire life. she is so beautiful! i can really see her now.    it's a beauty angel!   her hair is as black as a beautiful night sky. it shines as if it contains all the stars of the universe. all of a sudden she starts to slowly kneel in front of me and her knees touch the soft crimson grass behaving as a pillow. now as she is sitting in front of me, our faces are right across from each other.    she looks right into my eyes. her eyes, i am absolutely paralyzed with their splendor. it's like looking upon the deepest clear blue ocean. through that clear liquid pool i could almost see the deepest parts of her soul. what a heavenly soul it is!  surprisingly i notice that her lips are moving but i am unable to hear. i am not sure if it is because i am in shock of such a sight or paralyze with delight. her lips are soft, wet, hypnotizing, alluring, tempting. i see them moving but all i keep thinking is touching them, kissing them, tasting them.   spellbind as i was i tried to hear what she was saying but instead i keep feeling the wind on my ears. i can hear the wind! i can really hear the wind speak…    but what is it saying? why is it that i can not understand it?   she gradually raises her right hand and placed it on my left cheek as she looks right into my eyes with a warm and tender look that makes me feel love. her touch is so soft, gentle and full of love. by its meager touch it caresses my soul. it almost feels electrifying, as i could feel her thoughts and feelings through her simple touch. and as her face approaches my face her voice is starts to become coherent. out of the wind sound, the words start to form just as she materialized out of the fog. the sound of her voice is as if it's been carried on the wind for long distances and only now is able to reach my ears.  she looks at me, in a soft spoken kindhearted voice i hear "hi my love, is it you?"   not understanding at first what she was asking. i realized what it was when i hear the words coming from my lips.    "yes, it is me my love".   i know now that she is my true love!   she said "i have been looking for you all my life" i said "me too"   she said "i have been searching for you all through the universe. i have looked high and low and have gone through a lot of adversity on my quest to you. against loneliness and sorrow, just when i though i would never find you and when i was about to give up… you appear"    she smiles with the most stunningly tender smiles i have ever seen. our faces are so close to each other at this point that it was completely impossible to avoid our lips to meet for the first time. they came together slightly touching each other as if in a dream. the touch of our lips made us feel alive as we can feel our blood pumping. the mutual desire was unavoidable, our hands completely wrap around each other and we can feel our warmth.    time stops and everything around us stops with it. the birds stop in mid-flight. the grass stood frozen in its place. the wind stops in its perpetual journey. nothing matter but the touch of our lips and the passion that brew inside us. i can feel us as one. for a moment i could not tell which one is my skin and which one is lover's one. i can feel her skin as if it was my skin. we are part of each other now. and as a feat of a psychic nature i can hear her thoughts in my mind. i can feel her thoughts.    as i feel the beauty of the universe… we are one!   our lips slowly and with difficulty separated from each other. as if they wanted to be join for all eternity. then she slips down, puts her tender head on my chest as i sit there holding her on my arms. stroking her long beautiful black hair observing how soft it is, i take her beautiful scent inside me. i close my eyes and take as much of her as i can. her right arm is on my back and her left arm is caressing my chest. i take a look at her face and notice that she looking into the horizon.    i say "i will never get tired of looking into your stunning face for ever and ever my love. and i will not stop caressing you until the end of time."  her cute face turns towards me and with a slight moan she hugs me tightly as she says "and i will never ever let you go my cherub. you are the air i breathe. you are my reason for living."    i can not believe i found her. i finally found her. my true love! this is the being i have been looking for all my life and the one that i want to spend the rest of my life with. to be able to find a person that loves you as much as you are able to love is very hard. to be able to find that special someone that appreciates you because it took just that much more effort to be able to find you take a special feat of destiny. and here she is my destiny…     my love with all the beauty in the universe i always felt that something was missing. like a massive gap inside of me that even though i can enjoy the riches and beauty of the universe, i was unable to feel complete, to share with that special someone, to say to this person that i love her. now i am whole. now i am complete. now i can say that i love you my angel. and that i am looking forward to stoke your hair, caress you face, touch your skin, hug your body, kiss your lips and love you for the rest of my life…    because you are my life's one and only true love…   for this i love you my love!   and with that said we both stand up and unconsciously start hovering over the ground.   could it be that the magical feeling we are experiencing is causing this effect?  could it be that the universe is happy that our love has finally come together? could it be that this is how it feels to be love by your love one? could it be that this is what it feels to be in love? to fall in love?   i am not certain of the answer, all i know is that we are finally together.    as we come closer and closer to heaven and we can only be seen as a remote start in the curtain of the heavens. we can see all the constellations of planets and stars. we can admire the beauty of nebulas and gas giants as we fly by them. we both look at each other and though that now that we are together, we can really enjoy the beauty of the galaxy because we can share it with each other.    as my body is lay there on the grass, lifeless, motionless, soulless…  and you examine my lifeless face; one can not help but notice an unusual expression on it… you can see softness, peace, tranquility, happiness, tenderness and an incredible amount of love.   goodbye my planet! goodbye air, water, grass, sky. forever goodbye my body!   hello my life, my destiny, my angel, my true love…

el anhelo








for spanish speaking readersque tortura es este sentimiento que rebosa desde muy dentro de mí sin esperanza de poder desahogarme en ti...anhelo tu mirada sin esperanza de ver tu cara en frente de la mía.anhelo tus manos sin esperanza de tenerlas entre las mías.anhelo tu toque sin esperanza a sentir tu piel.anhelo la fragancia de tu pelo sin esperanza a su presencia.anhelo tu abrazo sin esperanza a sentir tu piel.anhelo tu pecho en el mió sin esperanza de sentir tu corazón latir.anhelo tu aliento sin esperanza de sentir tu aroma.anhelo tus besos sin esperanza a sentir tus labios.anhelo tu cuerpo sin esperanza a tener tu calor.anhelo tu amor sin esperanza de ser correspondido.te anhelo mi amor con toda mi alma y todo mi ser.te quiero…

the flower...








today i was searching for a beautiful flower to show you what i feel. i search and i search, unable to find the most beautiful one of all. then, when i was about to give up i came across this one. and even though it was the most stunning out of the other ones i have seeing, i recognize that it felt short of my expectations.then i realize the reason i was thinking this way is not that this flower wasn’t pretty enough, is that among all the flowers in the world, you are the most beautiful one of all.

my love








it’s another day of my life and i feel yet again a big void inside me. it feels like only yesterday that lay my eyes upon your beautiful face and saw myself in your eyes.oh, what beautiful eyes, as sweet as a sea of chocolate. your eyes are as beautiful as a big shining star in the darkness of space. it was only yesterday that i lay my eyes on you hair.oh, what beautiful hair, as beautiful as a rose vine which moves with the wind. your hair adorns you beautiful face as a gorgeous crown of roses would adorn you stunning face. such a face as you would witness in the company of an angel of heaven. a beautiful angel sent from the heavens to me. as i approached you beautiful creature, my body felt as it had never felt before. what could this be that i feel weak in the knees and can not contain my feeling to kiss your beautiful lips? oh, what beautiful lips, as sweet as the sweetest nectars given to man by heaven.as we kiss, my suspicions were all confirm because it was the most beautiful kiss. you kiss was filled with sweetness, caress, tenderness, passion and love. such is this kiss to the most fortunate man on earth by an angel from heaven.as we kiss and we wrap our arms around each other i experience heaven. the feeling where everything stands still, all sounds fade away, where everything and everybody disappear and it is just me and you. consume in the passion of our feelings. taking all of you aroma with me as i breath deep. oh my love i was very hard to leave you. so hard!now i wake up every morning and my spirits are down because i don’t have you here with me. because i can not feel your touch or you caress or your body next to mine. i can not feel your lips touching mine or your aroma. and i feel that i get asphyxiated as a man would in the lack of air.  i need you my love, i want you with all my soul and i can not wait until the next time i can touch you skin, hug your body, kiss your lips and feel you next to me.i am just a mortal man desiring the divine.desiring an angel… desiring you!my love…
