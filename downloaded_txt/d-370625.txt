	 stealing water from the lake michigan basin
	 
    

it is my honor to have been asked to serve our state as a member of a legislative council committee that is examining whether or not the fresh water of lake michigan should be allowed to be shipped to areas outside of the great lakes basin. it would seem to me to be a mortal sin to risk the future of the greatest source of fresh water in the world for the purpose of profit, but apparently somebody has enough influence in madison to have the legislature reexamine this already answered question. by the way, the folks in brown county that are going to be the beneficiaries of manitowoc’s water live in the lake michigan basin. i think it was governor lee sherman dreyfus who said that if someone outside the state of wisconsin wants our water, tell him or her we sell beer.  the governor was a little simple in his summary, but not too far off the mark.

	 veterans' day
	 
    

this past saturday morning, veterans’ day was celebrated with a very traditional commemoration ceremony at the veterans’ memorial across from evergreen cemetery on north 18th street.  there were the usual and appropriate remarks from veterans and other dignitaries, but what made the event so poignant was the presence of the family of a young, local man, very recently killed in action.  this family reminded everybody that those dying for us in iraq and in other active duty around the world are our mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, neighbors and friends and not some strangers that we’ve enlisted to do the business of freedom.  we owe our veterans everything.  let’s make sure we take care of them.

	 retail rumors 1/6th true
	 
    

after hearing false stories regarding his own demise, mark twain quipped that "...the rumors of my death have been greatly exagerated".  the same is true with rumors circulating regarding a huge retail demise in manitowoc.lowes in not closing.charcoal grill is not shutting down.newey's is not closing it's doors.hobby lobby has no intent of ceasing business.family dollar, too, is doing very well, thank you.unfortunately, both for the employees and for faithful customers like myself, the word i received from the store manager at big lots is that the manitowoc store is closing as of january 15, 2006.  it appears the closing is part of a system-wide effort to increase profits.  the store manager also mentioned that big lots' lease terminates on january 15th, hence the choice of that date for shut down.we will miss big lots and the associates who served us there and hope they quickly find new employment.  big lots has been an appreciated business in manty since 1994.  thanks for the friendly service and amazing array of merchandise at great prices!

	 aquatic center funding
	 
    

my planned redesign of the city of manitowoc’s 2007 budget to deal with the unfair and unfunded storm water utility mandate placed upon the city by the state of wisconsin will in no way affect the common council’s ability to fund their planned share of the aquatic center park.  our families need and deserve this facility for their summer recreation.  as a matter of fact, i completely endorse and encourage the common council’s continued support of this great project.

	 stormwater utility dead
	 
    

at a time when citizens should be reveling in our new-found economic successes such as the developments at harbor town center, the growth of manitowoc cranes and ice, burger boat, koening-vits, tramontina and orion energies, the near completion of the brown county water pipeline and mpu’s new generation facility, the advent of the elegant new 100 maritime place professional office building in our downtown, and the extension of quay street through to the carferry facility, our citizens are worried about yet another mandated task put upon them by the state legislature for which they will have to pay the bill.   this is horribly unfair!  last  year, a storm water utility with its associated fee was included in the executive budget plan for 2006.  however, there will be no storm water utility in next year’s budget, nor in any budgets in the foreseeable future.  it is my intent to bring forward an executive budget plan for 2007 that is sustainable, with no looming structural deficits, and that does not include a storm water utility or its associated fee as a funding source.  according to the wishes of the vast majority of businesses and individuals in our community, the costs associated with the storm water mandates will remain imbedded in our local property taxes, a method of paying for the mandate that is popular and deemed fair by most people.       this same communication will serve as an urgent request to senator joe leibham and assemblyman bob ziegelbauer to author legislation to provide equity for city-based businesses and property owners in regard to storm water clean up.  right now, virtually the entire burden of reducing the pollution carried by storm water is placed on city dwellers, causing their responsibility and financial burden to be much higher than others living in wisconsin.  clean water is every one’s responsibility and if the state’s mandates included all businesses and all citizens, not only those existing in cities, costs would be more equitably distributed and much lower on an individual basis.

	 happy birthday manitowoc county!
	 
    

on this auspicious day of july 8th, fresh from celebrating our nation’s independence, this centennial birthday celebration marks not only the one hundredth anniversary of the manitowoc county historical society (one of wisconsin’s oldest), but also the beautiful structure we stand before today, the manitowoc county courthouse.  the courthouse, constructed in the beaux arts neo-classical style, is an elegant and magnificent edifice that graces downtown manitowoc.  it is the city of manitowoc’s great fortune that our forefathers had the compelling foresight to not only locate the courthouse in downtown manitowoc, but to create such a significant and striking structure that has been preserved these 100 years.  and for that, i applaud the county of manitowoc for taking care of and maintaining the courthouse these many years, preserving its authenticity.  the refined beauty of the courthouse, albeit on a smaller scale, is on par with the grandeur of the statehouses in madison and washington.  it is an edifice in which the citizens of manitowoc can take much pride.  it is a landmark, both local and to visitors alike, and is the anchor for manitowoc’s downtown historic district.  recognized by the united states department of the interior on the national register of historic places, the manitowoc county courthouse gives integrity to the whole of manitowoc’s historic district.   the manitowoc county courthouse, is a part of who we are.  aside from our few celebrated centenarians in town, it predates most of us and may outlast most of us.  it certainly outlasted several mayors during the construction phase.  mayor william rahr was in office when the 1902 resolution calling for a “more commodious and convenient courthouse” was passed, while mayor william kemper was in office when the construction was underway, and mayor henry stolze, jr. was in office when the building was finally dedicated.  as mayor of the city of manitowoc a century later, i am thrilled that our forefathers had the presence of mind to commit to such a distinguished, polished and cultured structure to represent manitowoc county.  richard florida, author of the “the rise of the creative class”, and a national speaker regarding the importance of creativity and its effects on the economy, extols the value of an authentic downtown.  an authentic downtown creates an identity for the city, bolsters the psyche of her citizens, and draws visitors from afar to visit her.  the beauty and grandeur of the courthouse, and an authentic downtown, appeals to our values and tastes, and even our sense of pride.  it can also affect the choice of those entrepreneurs and businessmen considering manitowoc for relocation, with an ultimate positive impact on our local economy.  it’s incredible to consider the lasting impact that decisions made 100 years ago have on today’s economy.  chief wampum, indian friend of the early settlers, to whom a monument stands even today just off broadway street, would have espoused the philosophy of seven generation thinking.  that is, how will a decision made today affect those who live seven generations from now?  clearly, the county officials making decisions about the location and design of the 3rd and current manitowoc county courthouse were touched with the wisdom of chief wampum.  as the center of county government, and an important architectural structure exemplifying manitowoc’s historic district, the manitowoc county courthouse has achieved, on many levels, the success of seven generation decision making.  chris tegen, a native son of manitowoc, served as architect for the historic project.  mr. tegen is also credited as the original architect of other memorable facilities in the city of manitowoc including holy family hospital, schuette bros. dept. store, the dempsey block of north 8th street (where beernsten’s is located), cleveland school (currently martin’s college of cosmetology), the old jefferson school, and the luling school (currently the mckinley administration building).   perhaps mr. tegen derived inspiration from climbing roefes hill (current site of lincoln high school) to gaze at a panoramic view of  the once-rustic city in a simpler, less developed time.  a mural, depicting just such a view circa 1882, still graces the interior wall of the courthouse.   we are fortunate that progress, and her sometime companion haste, did not destroy this rare glimpse of manitowoc’s past.  and so it is, firmly rooted in the past, that we go successfully forward.  it is, therefore, with great pleasure that i commend and congratulate manitowoc county and her citizens for the care and maintenance of this jewel, this diamond on the lakeshore, the manitowoc county courthouse.happy 100th birthday manitowoc county courthouse!

about me

name:  mantymayorblog 
location:  city of manitowoc, wisconsin, united states 
elected mayor in 1989, i am currently serving my 6th term as mayor, the longest-serving mayor of my hometown, manitowoc, wisconsin. by virtue of office, i have served as chairman of the city's plan commission and as a commissioner of the manitowoc public utilities since being elected 16 years ago. knowing that low cost energy and water drive the success of a community, i have taken a keen interest in our community owned utility, and am recognized as one of the most knowledgeable local elected officials in the electric energy area in the state and nation. 
i realized that the city of manitowoc needed a healthy combination of both tourism and manufacturing to become an economic force. since  election in 1989, i have worked energetically and positively to give manitowoc its new found status. it has been said, 
"mayor crawford's leadership and boundless energy have infused the city of manitowoc with a recharged and progressive attitude while manitowoc remains one of the lowest taxed cities in the state of wisconsin. he continues to guide the city down the path of progress and continues to be respected as a city leader."
