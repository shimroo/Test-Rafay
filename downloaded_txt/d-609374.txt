membership in the tennessee association of alcohol, drugs and other addiction services is more than a purchase of services.it is also an investment in a philosophy - in a cause. it is a shared belief that alcohol and drug abuse are treatable and preventable; that the availability of quality treatment and prevention services to all tennessee citizens is important; and that by joining together, we can do more than we can do individually.join our community of advocates, peers, addiction counselors, treatment providers and more!
