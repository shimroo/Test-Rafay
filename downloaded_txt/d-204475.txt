royal r. rife













original documents and history about the american inventor of advanced microscopes and plasma ray frequency devices.














this website has for many years contained the world’s largest repository of documents about the scientist royal r. rife. recently acquired new materials warrant creation of a totally new resource for your study and enjoyment.we are proud to offer this extensive library of historical sources, and have strived to reorganize it for ease of use. many files are now downloadable in pdf format. it is our hope that this site will inspire future scholarly investigation and research into the rich history of this extraordinary scientist.there are thousands of pages of documents in the collection, so not everything will be available at the initial launch of this new site. we are working to add materials as quickly as possible, so do check back often!______________________________________a quick note about document authenticity and older transcriptions. we have discovered that a few documents previously thought to contain original historical text, may actually not be accurate copies or transcriptions.wherever new transcriptions have been created for certain files available at this website, we have tried to follow professional standards for transcribing historical documents as best as possible. in accordance with good practices, some misspellings or unreadable words have been clarified using brackets [] inserted directly into a transcription. in no instance has original material been changed, or interpretive comments added. for more information on good practices, please see accepted professional guidelines here, here, and here.the following sections are available at this site, with clickable links:journal & magazine articles - this section offers articles published during rife’s lifetime about his work and inventions.laboratory & clinical reports - these documents include rife’s laboratory reports of frequency emissions he found effective against pathogens, as well as other lab notebooks and clinical reports.rife era technology - this entirely new section offers technological and research materials from rife’s era which are contemporaneous with his work, especially in the fields of microscopy and microbiology.correspondence - this section includes currently available letters and telegrams between rife and his colleagues, dated 1929-1974. there are several pdf files, some of which are still under reconstruction. because many extant letters were of poor photographic quality, they have undergone processing to remove hash and other extraneous non-text markings. occasional transcriptions of handwritten letters and margin notes that were difficult to read, have been added to the files.interviews - transcriptions of talks and interviews with rife and his colleagues, including the 1970s interviews by dr. john hubbard.court cases - this section offers documents from the 1939 beam rays cases, including newly acquired complaints, filings, and affadavits. more cases will be added in the future.newspaper articles - a selection from hundreds of rife-era newspaper articles are offered here. under construction.miscellaneous documents - includes rife’s birth and death certificates, and other documents difficult to categorize.technical & patents - these documents from various sources include reports on, and circuit drawings of plasma ray devices created during the rife era. also listed are rife’s patent documents, and related patent awards to other inventors.microscope/optical blueprints - blueprints of microscopes and drawings of optics are included in this section.crane & marsh articles - this section contains articles written by john crane and john marsh, dated from 1953 onward. under construction.images - a selection of the best of many available pictures of rife, his colleagues, and equipment. under construction.more resources - this page offers a listing of additional resources available outside this website. it includes clickable links for accessing videos, books, and other online sources.

all too often history has shown how outstanding men have been misunderstood during their life time only to be discovered and honored posthumously. we hope we can see dr. rife given the accolades he deserves soon. - dr. robert stafford, november 1959.copyright 2021-2024
