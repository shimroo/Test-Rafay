kultureckewhat you are looking at above is "die alexanderschlacht" ("the battle of issus," 1529), depicting alexander the great's defeat of the persian darius in 333 bc.  as painted by albrecht altdorfer, this world- altering battle depicts even the cosmos's joining in the combat.  altdorfer was the leading representative of the danube school of the northern renaissance and served on the town council of my favorite german city,  regensburg.  allegedly the middle east, the backdrop for the painting is really altdorfer's danube- alpine landscape, where the sky really does look the way it's shown here.  altdorfer's work is featured throughout my site.  more art and biography about altdorfer here.
