we really want children in this area to experience the wonderful things that carol joy holling camp has to offer.







your support is valued

we understand that you have a deep desire to make a difference in your community, your church, and your world. we also know that it can be overwhelming and intimidating to choose the right place to give. we believe in giving our donors choices in the ways they want to give to us, to be thanked in the way they want, to stay involved in the way they want, and to see the impact of their gifts.
