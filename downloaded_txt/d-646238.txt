expert witness – pain management & anesthesiology
dr. robert h. odell, jr. is a stanford and ucla trained practicing anesthesiologist and pain management physician, board certified in both.  as a fellow of the medical scientist training program, he received his ph.d. in biomedical engineering from stanford university in 1974 and his md degree from stanford in 1976. he completed his residency in anesthesiology at ucla, and served as chief resident at harbor/ucla medical center in 1982.  he is a diplomate of the american board of anesthesiology (1983), american academy of pain management (2001), the american board of pain medicine (2007) and the world institute of pain (2008) as a fellow of interventional pain practice.
as an active clinician, dr. odell has been practicing anesthesiology since 1982, and pain management in the las vegas and phoenix areas since 2001.  his clinical practice is a mixture of clinical anesthesiology, interventional pain management, and a revolutionary approach to neuropathic pain (including peripheral neuropathies) using a combined electrochemical block technique which he helped to develop.  he has also been retained as an expert witness in the anesthesia and pain management fields and has consulted in a wide variety of cases.
he assisted in the development of a neurodiagnostic test used in the clinic to detect the level of the pain generator in neck and low back pain.  he has extensive experience with a wide variety of non-interventional and interventional acute and chronic pain management techniques, including vertebral axial decompression and electroanalgesia.  his most recent publications include the “anti-inflammatory effects of electronic signal treatment”; pain physician 2008; 11:891-907 (nov/dec edition), an abstract presentation to the american society of regional anesthesia (asra) on “combination electrochemical therapy (cet) to treat patients with diabetic neuropathy”, and “new technique combines electrical currents and local anesthesia for pain management”, practical pain management 2011; 11 (5): 52-68 (june 2011).
