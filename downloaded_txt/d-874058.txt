						the staff was energetic and created a fun-filled, unforgettable moment in time.  crew chief, doug ewalt, was reliable, communicative and always eager to meet our needs and visions.  we will definitely be using fantasy world and doug ewalt in the future!"

						the weekend went well and all of the fantasy world activities were a huge hit. the staff that helped run each activity were professional and accommodating, and that gave me one less thing to worry about. 

from figuring out contracting to the actual day of the event, working with fantasy world was a great experience and i hope to do more work with you and fantasy world in the future! 

thanks again

						just a quick note to thank you for the outstanding service provided last weekend for the 10th annual pancreatic cancer action network 5k walk/run on pennsylvania ave.
 
please thank sarah. she did a wonderful job.
 
the event was a great success, the client is super happy and they raised a lot of money for pancreatic cancer research. what more can you want?
 
it was great working with you again and we look forward to the next time.

						i hope you each got a relaxing day yesterday! the night went lovely and guests truly enjoyed themselves. it is always a pleasure to work with hardworking vendors that care and i am lucky to be surrounded by each of you. 

occasions: kate and brittany: you girls rock! it was smooth and wonderful, and i am lucky to work with such good friends of mine. thank you for your hard work! 

heather + the amazing mellon team: thank you! it is seriously a pleasure to work in your beautiful space. thank you so much for being so patience! i will say we made record timing on 1:57am! ðŸ™‚ xo- until next time!

						it is always a challenge to come up with something that will keep 3 generations entertained and happy but you knocked it out of the park! 
 
i appreciate all the help you gave me in the planning phase and for your suggestions.  you were right on about all of the games you suggested.  the mechanical shark was a tremendous hit and got a wee bit competitive for the stuffed shark winning prize!  i think the dual racing cars came in as the second best game.  there were waiting lines most of the time for the cars, although the strike-a-light was really popular too.  
 
i got lots of kudos for this event.  having the ability to sit and chat, play games, and/or just watch others at play kept everyone busy and entertained.  it was the perfect mix of "something for everyone". 
 
and, despite all the food we  had, the cotton candy and popcorn machines were also hits. 
 
i enjoyed working with you and the staff at fantasy world who helped make this event fabulous.  and thank you for working closely with the event people to get everything organized.  the layout was perfect!   it will be really hard to top this event in coming years!  we will definitely use you again and look forward to some new games tossed into the mix.					


linda p. 






						thanks to you and your very professional team for helping us pull off an awesome event! i so appreciate your patience with apl and our very long process to make yesterday a reality.

everything went off without a hitch and was just as you promised. the level of integrity you showed in delivering exactly what we discussed -- down to the last detail -- is something that is critical to our organization and goes a long way to helping me recommend fantasy world entertainment for future events here at johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory.

above all â€“ we had fun working with you and our staff members had loads of fun yesterday! what a great business you are in!

thanks again

						hi doug-
 
just wanted to say thanks again for working with us again this year. the tables were a big hit once again and hope to use you guys again in the future. please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything from me.
 
thanks,					


evan 






						amelia,
 
thank you so much for the great staff you sent yesterday.  they were wonderful and the alligator was a hugh success.   i attached a picture of it in the atrium, it was amazing and the children were so excited to see it and to ride through it!!! 
 
have a merry christmas and a happy new year					


deirdre 






						katelyn, nitti and i from s. college wanted to thank you for being a part of our sienafest this year!
the in-line extreme air and water balloon game were a hit with our students and were definitely a highlight of our weekend. rajaee was awesome to work with and we appreciate him working well with us and our facilities crew!

we hope to see you on our campus for future events!

best,					


kelsey and kate  






						just a follow-up to a merry christmas event.  your team was great this year.  it was good having familiarity with greg, we could just dig right in and he knew what was up.  also, not sure how many of the team was the same as last year or not, but they were more engaging this year than last.  so kudos to them.

the train was killer this year, much better than we have had in the past.  it was crowded so we ended up having someone walk in front of the train clearing a path.  we want that next year.

big baller was a hit again!  and kapow had long lines the whole time.  

would you believe we had over 18,000 this year.  year 1 â€“ 5,000.  year 2 â€“ close to 11,000.  and this year over 18,000!!!

we are excited and i hope your guys had a good time again.  i will reach out first of january to try to get some things on hold for next year.

						your people did a great job.  wanted to thank you again for that.  the children, and my adults truly enjoyed the amusements.  thanks again.
