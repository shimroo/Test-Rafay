          my new 'lazing' piano etude is good for teaching how to play major and minor 7th chords in different inversions. also it drills a syncopated rhythm. the sheet music comes bundled with the little preparatory piece as well. called 'learning to laze'.

          in this video, we discuss what musicians can expect to earn when licensing their music to film and television. we cover the differences in compensation for reality tv versus network tv shows, and explain how music supervisors typically have a pre-set budget that they allocate for music needs. we also discuss the ability to negotiate higher rates, but note that supervisors often have limited flexibility within their established budgets.

          a good reminder that external markers may not be present during growth. the proof is in how we feel on the inside and what others gain from our presence.

          new youtube video: planning larger groupings in strategic piano practice

in this video, i talk about:
- why strategic piano practice leads to way faster progress
- actual (very extended) examples from f√ºr elise and from my own music
- the reason for planning larger groupings in strategic piano practice
- expansion into 2 measure sets and beyond
- not getting stopped in your tracks if you don‚Äôt know how to plan larger groupings yet
- what it means to plan larger groupings
- marking vertical lines for every 4 measures or so
- marking diamonds for every 8 or 12 measures or so

          as songwriters and music professionals, it‚Äôs crucial to recognize the deeper emotional layers that connect songs to the human experience. abraham maslow famously identified six universal human needs‚Äîsurvival, safety, love, belonging, recognition, growth, and self-transcendence‚Äîthat apply to every individual. these needs are fundamental, guiding our desires and decisions.
when crafting a song, tapping into one or more of these needs can create a powerful emotional connection. whether it's the search for safety or the aspiration to leave a lasting legacy, writing lyrics that resonate with these shared human experiences helps the listener feel seen and understood.
in music, addressing these needs allows us to create songs that transcend time, connecting deeply with audiences on an emotional and universal level. üé∂

          the role of a symphony orchestra is simple: to serve. serve our art form, our loyal audience, and our community. yet, some argue that orchestras should not give free concerts. i believe they are missing the point. here's why. üëá

an orchestra's mandate is to serve on three fronts:

üéµ serve the art form: we invest deeply in the music with unwavering commitment.

üíñ serve our existing audience: we play concerts that move people‚Äîchanging their emotional state.

üèõÔ∏è serve our community: we provide opportunities to gather, celebrate, mourn, and share. 

i've been reflecting on the words of philosopher michael sandel, who argues that our democracy depends on shared spaces where people of all communities come together. he writes:

"the more things money can buy, the fewer the occasions when people from different walks of life encounter one another. we see this when we go to a baseball game and gaze up at the skyboxes or down from them, as the case may be. the disappearance of the class-mixing experiment once found at the ballpark represents a loss not only for those looking up but also for those looking down."

symphony orchestras are often considered cultural "skyboxes" reserved for the elite. but if we are truly here to serve, we must break out of that box and meet our communities where they are.

let's serve through free concerts, big and small, indoor and outdoor. let's show up for our cities‚Äînot always behind ticket prices or stuffy concert halls- through genuinely shared experiences. doing the right thing will attract the public and private money necessary to make this a reality.¬†
