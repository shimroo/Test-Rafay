						neely henry reservoir is located in northeast alabama on the coosa river, near the towns of gadsden and ohatchee. just off i-59, the reservoir envelops 11,235 acres and extends 77.6 miles from the dam upstream to weiss dam. generally a river-run lake, neely henry fans out toward the dam to offer more open water. sandwiched between weiss lake (a.k.a. "the crappie capital of the world") and logan martin, neely henry is one of the best-kept fishing secrets in alabama.
