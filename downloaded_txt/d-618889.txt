student research & teaching opportunities
we encourage psychology majors to participate in conducting research after completing (or waiving) psych 100. the best way to find a research experience that fits you is to check out what kinds of projects are going on. if you are interested in learning more about conducting research, contact a faculty whose projects or area appeals to you. many faculty members are actively seeking students, and will be happy to talk to you about how you might fit in.
