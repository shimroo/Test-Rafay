welcome to hillside nursery










paeonia japonica





hillside nursery is a small nursery located in western massachusetts specializing in the propagation and production of lady-slipper orchids (cypripediums) and woodland wildflowers of the temperate forests of the northern hemisphere. since 1989, we have been developing propagation and cultivation techniques for this unique group of plants in an effort to make these plants more available to the public.as a small nursery, we're committed to a hands-on approach with the work we do and to taking the time and care needed to grow and ship high quality plants that are hardy and ready for the garden.we are pleased to offer this beautiful collection of plants for your shade garden. our plants are raised in 100% nursery conditions...never wild-collected!
