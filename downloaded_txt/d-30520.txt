bad received it's first star site award, 1 january
1998, after only 12 hours on the web, from dogpatch, one of the earliest dog agility sites.


"i love it! what a great site, you should be very proud!
  right now i have it marked with a "new" icon so people
  will know it's a new page, but it will get a star once the new
  icon comes off. which also qualifies you to display the dogpatch
  star site award, which is attached to this message. congrats on
your first site award, you deserve it!" mary jo sminkey of the dog agility page.
"i've found the coolest agility website in cyberspace.
you must go check it out!" bud houston of just for fun
"you have a great web site. i hope more performance dog
sites approach their web presence with such creativity and humor.
. . . i've known for a long time that beardies are quite special.
i had an agility student about ten year ago with a beardie that
weaved so very fast, and learned to do so in only about two weeks.
in those days we didn't realize how fast weave poles could be
done. but these days when i train my dog i train for the performance
of that beardie so many years ago. i'm waiting for one of this
breed to take it all in national competition." bud houston of just for fun
our bad website won first place
at the 1999 bcca nationals both from the specialty website judge,
scott gormley, and in peoples' choice. many thanks to karen norteman
who designed the prototype and gretchen blackburn for our outstanding
logo! scott gormley, art director of internet world, a weekly
publication devoted to news of the internet computer community,
judged the site from new york city. before he assumed the art
director's position in 1997, scott worked as a special editor/graphic
designer for gannett suburban newspapers, and was acting assistant
art director for usa weekend.
* * * "bad was founded by
libby myers-buhite, out of a desire to network beardie people
who were active in agility. while geared toward beardie owners
and enthusiasts, the site provides a nice model for other clubs
and organizations who may want to develop user friendly and informative
websites. 3 stars." sandi
dremel of the dog infomat
