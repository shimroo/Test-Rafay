									we had a fantastic experience, and the staff and hotel are amazing. we arrived late at night and were met with a lady so nice and accommodating! she told us about places around to see and got us set up with a wonderful room along with our dog.
during our stay, the great service continued from our housekeeper and all. at checkout, everyone was great, and the manager, kiana, made sure that our stay was wonderful and looked forward to seeing us soon again which we will!
thanks days inn for the wonderful staff, rooms, service, and beautiful hotel and view along with being pet friendly!!

									we were there the weekend of 9/20/19-9/22/19. we had a beautiful lower room floor that give a spectacular view of the sunrise. this was our third visit at days inn and we will be booking for next june here shortly. the rooms are always very clean and you get plenty of towels without having to ask for more. the front desk staff are great i requested to check in around 12-1pm and our room was ready which was great since we had such a long drive to get there. again i can't say enough good about days inn. thank you for our stay and see you in june.
