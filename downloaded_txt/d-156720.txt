  what’s it like to teach for america?

      





[i exit] the doors with a sense of peace and fulfillment from the work i did that day…teaching is hard, but what other profession allows you to work with young people every single day and support them on their life journey?


      
  nick, memphis corps

  






the best decision that i've ever made in my life was doing tfa in baltimore and becoming a teacher, hands down. i met my kids and it sounds really cliche, but as soon as i started teaching, i just fell in love with them and recognized that they're the leaders the world so desperately needs.


      
  berol, baltimore corps 

  






something that i continue to love about teach for america is the fact that there is this audacity that we can make a difference and we’re not just going to talk about it, but we’re going to put some teeth behind it.


      
  marcus, metro atlanta corps

  






working with the students gives me joy and hope in a way that nothing i've ever done does. i’ve been through a lot this year in my personal life. and on my worst days, even if getting out of bed is the hardest thing in the world, that connection with my students feels so whole.


      
  cassie, colorado corps

  






i was a student in chicago public schools and today, i’m creating opportunities that i didn’t have as a student. when we keep our students first and we keep their goals in front of us, i think we can do nothing but be successful.


      
  fareeda, chicago-northwest indiana corps

  






i remind my students that if we nurture our value of education and continue our thirst for knowledge, no matter what obstacles we face, we can and shall overcome. i want them to hold on to infinite hope.


      
  ayo, memphis corps

  






for many of us, what started as a two-year commitment has turned into a lifelong mission. whether in the classroom, or in union and system leadership, or work in education technology, you see a passion among our alumni to do whatever it takes to eliminate the inequities our children face every day.


      
  paymon, bay area corps 

  






i appreciated teach for america for preparing us to be flexible … they gave us the basics to feel grounded but also that creativity to branch out and do what was best for our students and community.


      
  maria, jacksonville and central florida corps

  






i joined teach for america because i want students to know that growing up in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities is not something to be ashamed of or a liability. growing up in such communities—as in my case—can be the driving force for their personal, academic, and professional success.


      
  yanely, metro atlanta corps

  






it is important for me as a man of color to be a force in the education movement because many of the decisions made that impact students in under-resourced communities are not made by people who reflect the backgrounds and experiences of those in the communities the policies most directly affect.


      
  kwame, massachusetts corps

  













      
  take the first step

    

teach for america's goal is the biggest and brightest possibility for every kid. our superpower is launching determined people like you into mission-driven, future-shaping careers that start in the classroom.
