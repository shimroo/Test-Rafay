the national center for hearing assessment and management (ncham) at utah state university provides support to early hearing detection and intervention, (ehdi) programs throughout the united states. ncham helps ehdi programs ensure that children who are deaf or hard of hearing (dhh) are identified through newborn, infant, and early childhood hearing screening and receive the diagnostic and early intervention services they need. to achieve these aims, ncham provides programs and professionals with:

technical assistance
training
access to information about evidence-based practices
partnership opportunities with national ehdi systems of care organizations and other key stakeholders, including those that represent and/ or serve families with children who are dhh.
