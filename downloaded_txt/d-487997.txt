farewell to jing







i have made the difficult decision to close jing. it has been a joy to run a successful practice in louisville for over 10 years. between new motherhood and my expanded responsibilities as the outpatient mental health clinic coordinator at the va, this decision comes with much personal and professional consideration. 



i will continue to maintain the pure encapsulations site and crane herb pharmacy for those who would like to continue using those services. 



the louisville area is rich with well-trainined acupuncture providers, and i urge you to choose someone who is nationally board certified. a listing of qualified providers can be found at http://www.nccaom.org/find-a-nccaom-certified-practitioner. 



it has been an honor to have been part of your healthcare team.  be well!

big news at jing!





i am excited to share that jing will be closed for maternity leave beginning in december 2013 through february 2014. for several months we have stopped accepting new patients, and will continue to serve current clients only. additional changes may be on the horizon, and i will update as soon as possible. i am happy to provide a referral to other qualified acupuncturists in the area while i am on leave.  thank you to all for the good wishes i have been receiving during this exciting time!

changes at jing






i am excited to announce a shift in clinical focus beginning december 2012. i was recently named the louisville veterans administration medical center’s first doctor of nursing practice in the mental health and behavioral science services, and will be helping our heroes throughout the va hospital.

what this means for jing is restructuring into a more focused practice. we now specialize solely in mind-body issues that can be treated with acupuncture, oriental medicine, psychotherapy, herbs, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, and other integrative healing strategies. with an emphasis on pain management and emotional wellness, jing will only accept new patients seeking treatment for mind-body conditions, and will continue to see established patients for any new or current health condition.

i am grateful to those of you who have entrusted me to facilitate health and healing over the years, and i remain committed to delivering premium integrative services through 2013 and beyond. beginning december 3rd, 2012, i will be scaling back my clinical hours at jing. online appointment scheduling will continued to be offered through genbook, and the tentative schedule through january 2013 will be monday and wednesday 5:30pm-8:30pm and saturday 10am-4pm.

i look forward to working with all of you through the holiday season and into the new year.

best!

gua sha vs. graston





the acupuncture profession absoloutly allowed gua sha to be repackaged and reallocated to pts and dcs. after reviewing extensive research and practice updates at the pacific symposium this weekend with dr. arya nielsen, phd, i realize i have been under-utilizing this powerful modality. get ready!

 gua sha vs. graston: "originality is nothing but judicious imitation . the most original   writers and creators borrowed one from another."        - voltair...

while breast cancer awareness month may be over, the battle is not bound by dates on a calendar. here is a small self-care primer i presented a few years ago on acupressure points to increase immunity and decrease side effects from treatment. enjoy!

paleo, primal, caveman nutrition resources





primal living is as old as dirt.  there has been plenty of buzz on this style of nutrition which promotes eating local, whole foods that can be killed with a spear or picked out of the ground. some of the lifestyle catch-phrases include:

"eat dirt" 

"live long, drop dead"

"eat like a predator, not like prey."

"let food be thy medicine and let medicine be thy food."

"eat like a cow, look like a cow. eat like a cougar, look like a cougar"

“eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch and no sugar.”

when someone asks us about optimal diet, particularly for allergies, autoimmune, and inflammatory pain disorders, this is our first go-to recommendation. as with any nutritional plan, it must be tailored to the individual based on age, gender, health status, and practicality. after reading dozens of books, websites, and research articles on the subject, here is a list of some of our favorite resources to get you started:
