no more video posts here!





dear beyond salmon readers,

if you want to know when i make new videos, please subscribe to my youtube channel and click the bell button if you want e-mail notifications of new videos (it's right next to the subscribe button).  i will not be posting them on this blog any longer.  it's just too much social media for me to maintain (youtube, facebook, instagram, and a blog is too much).  i actually forgot to post last 2 months of videos here and only realized when one of the readers contacted me asking if i was ok. 

blogger was a great platform when i started with it over 15 years ago.  but now 99% of the people who view my work are on youtube.  when i travel, i take notes on restaurants, and those kinds of posts will occasionally continue to appear on this blog.  but my regular video content will now only live on youtube.

thank you so much for your support!  you make it possible for me to do what i love and there is no "thank you" big enough to express my gratitude.

-helen
