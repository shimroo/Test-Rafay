what our guests have to say:








 my friends and i did the 3hr trip last saturday and it was soo much fun!! johnny was our guide, he was entertaining and knowledgeable. all of the staff were awesome, we will definitely be returning for an overnight trip some day. - anthony cowell









our guide, taylor, was great about giving instructions and encouragement.  we always felt safe, which was an important thing for us.  the company provided tons of water on our raft, which was great since it was a very hot day.  we had a great time and would (and will!) happily raft with dra again.- laura steenson









great folks and super fun trip!  our guide millie was wonderful-she made it fun and adventuresome but i still felt safe/looked after.  they also have wet suits which made all the difference in the world b/c of all days we were there it rained! - lannah bernard
