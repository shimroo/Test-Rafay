what our customers
are saying 












"the sight is very solid and very lightweight. i also really like the 15 pins over 19. customer service was amazing as well. i'd highly recommend this for anyone looking for a sturdy lightweight pin sight. makes it much easier to see and stay zeroed in on the target. if i had to use pins it would be a viper sight."

"great sight for a great price! viper makes perfect sights for my hunting bows. if you're looking for a sight that's not made with cheap plastic you'll be pleased with this one. easy to adjust and illuminates well. very reliable!"

"honestly, viper makes the best archery hunting sights and accessories. the quality is the best and the material is very strong and sturdy. i've been using their products for years on the hunting fields and never had to replace anything."

"i love the micro adjustment feature, easy to adjust and very well made. would highly recommend, once set up i actually shot my best score at bow shoot in years."

"amazing hunting stabilizer! i immediately noticed the reduction in my pin float. i am prepping for a fall pronghorn hunt. the reduction in pin float has really tightened my grouping out past 50 yards. product is simple. you can easily add on another if you want more weight. made in the usa!"

"love viper archery products. they design nice products at a fair price compared to other manufacturers. i have a few of their accessories on my target bow along with two of their stabilizers - really good stuff."
