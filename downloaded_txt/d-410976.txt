welcome to the gem shavings website, a lignetics company.  we began operations more than 35 years ago as a provider of bulk shavings to the local horse industry.  since that time, we've expanded our product line and our focus on customer satisfaction to become the west coast's leading provider of packaged shavings, bulk shavings and sawdust.  we have one baling facility in western washington and one in oregon.
at gem, we take exceptional pride in the quality of our products and the level of our customer service.

see what makes us different - both in product quality and customer satisfaction. 

gem premier baled shavings are available in farm, ranch, and pet stores throughout the west, asia, and the middle east. 

available in both large animal sizes (from 7.5 to 12 cubic feet) or small animal (press pack) sizes. 
the gem baling process is unique.
