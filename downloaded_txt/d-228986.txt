welcome to rabbit rehomerabbit rehome uk allows rescue centres and individuals to enter details of 
rabbits in need of new homes. rabbit lovers can then search for rabbits to 
adopt. we are not organising 'adoptions online' you will need to contact the 
rescue centre to find out about their homing policy. this site is not intended 
for breeders to advertise deliberately breed litters or for breeders to find 
'stock'. the rabbits here are looking for loving homes as pets. more about us
