 play in the travel league is more competitive than in the house league and requires a greater commitment, but emphasis is still on player development. the travel season runs from the first week in may to the first week in august. games are played once a week, with a given age group always playing on the same night of the week. for example, u10 teams always play on friday evenings. the travel commitment is modest with half the games home and half the games away (all travel is within wny). parents wishing their children to play soccer at the high school level are strongly encouraged to consider the travel program as it will help to provide them with the necessary skills. learn more about our travel program »
