2024 raw
                           material shortage
                           updates




update: 01/20/2025
situations
                           have improved with most products, however
                           scattered shortages still persist with
                           some raw materials used in the composites
                           industry which can cause longer than
                           normal lead times for us to obtain certain
                           products. we try to maintain ample
                           inventory in our warehouse.
                           we
                           will contact you if this affects any order
                           you have placed. thank you for your
                           understanding.
