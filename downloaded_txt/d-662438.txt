featured work by kathleen & jim












mangroovin' table
one of our latest efforts is a 4 foot long rustic table featuring manatees and turtles. our technique includes a lot of airbrushed acrylic paint along with standard brush work to tighten up edges and detailed areas.
metallic paints and other refractive materials are used in strategic areas to enhance the illusion of shimmering water. the table top has a rough finish which adds to the depth and texture of the final painting. a final coat of gloss polymer epoxy coats the art which gives the piece the ultimate underwater look.




kathleen airbrushes soft tones on swimming baby turtles.




jim adds detail to mangrove roots jutting out from the main art giving the image a stronger 3d effect.




the final mangroovin' table top ready for its closeup! it features 2 hand carved drawers.
available for $3800. measures 40" long x 16" wide x 31" tall.

we recently began a large commissioned piece from an avid sailor who owns a classic 1970s sailboat here on captiva. on board was a folding galley table need was in need of a seaworthy sprucing up.
















a rough concept was agreed upon that centered on a swimming sea turtle. quite a few base coats were added for the underwater tones needed.






the heavy detail work begins with lots of masking to facilitate all the airbrushing required for bringing the fish to life. subtle gradients brushed in give deep dimension to the sealife.
















with most of the detail work finished, it's time to go back into the art and add small details, perform touchups, strengthen shadows and highlights to bring it all together. with any luck, we'll get a ride on the boat!
