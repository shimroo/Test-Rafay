cob-industries manufactures pipe freezing equipment, pipe plugs, argweld weld purging equipment, pneumatic tools and industrial specialty tools. request information.










pipe freezing equipment
pipe freezing is an effective and efficient method of isolating sections of pipe for repair. this is done by freezing the contents of the pipe to create an ice plug. this eliminates the need to drain long sections of pipe and reduces shut-down time. pipe freezing or “ice plugging” was first used by the us navy in the 1940’s and is now a common practice in building maintenance and countless applications in the piping industries










pipe plugs
cob industries manufactures and distributes pipe plugs, pipe stoppers and test plugs for just about any application so let us help you determine the right type/style of plug for your situation. when someone calls us about pipe plugs, we basically need to know the answers to a few questions in order to determine what type of plug would be the best option…what size?, what does the plug need to hold back, how much back-pressure?, and how long is the plug going to be in place? other issues (chemicals / temperature, etc.) may have to be considered as well.










weld purge equipment
the argweld® product line offers high quality, cost-effective solutions for all types of weld purging applications. this includes pipe purging systems for fast, effective purging and oxygen-free welds, the best-selling purge monitors in the industry for accurate readings of o2 levels, and other equipment related to weld-purging and high-purity welding such as water soluble purge film, trailing shields, backing tape and flexible welding enclosures.
