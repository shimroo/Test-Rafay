 scarlet 
monte - malcolm norton / magic tao what 
a proud moment! yes my trick has now gone world wide! my dear friend costas at 
magic tao liked it so much he wanted to release it through magic tao. my deepest 
thanks and appreciation for making this such a success!the 
scarlet pimpernel strikes again! a 
master of escape & disguise the scarlet pimpernel escapes time and time again; 
he exchanges places with his guards and finally, vanishes completely!the 
first phase goes as follows; placing one of the guards off to one side to keep 
a lookout. the scarlet pimpernel is contained within his jail cell (your hands) 
between two guards. before your audience's very eyes, the scarlet pimpernel escapes! 
 all that's left inside your hands are the guards and the card first placed 
down is the on the run pimpernel.  the second phase, after running amok, 
the scarlet pimpernel is caught again. after placing him between the two guards 
in your hand, he once again escapes!   the guards capture the scarlet 
pimpernel for a final time; leaving all three guards with him, within a blink 
of an eye he escapes. place the three guards, which were once four cards, into 
your spectator's hand. the scarlet pimpernel is free! completely gone, only to 
turn up wherever you want.
you 
                                are supplied with everything needed, including 
                                streaming video instructions, and patter for a 
                                'monte' style routine.
