the associated retired aviation 
		professionals was formed in early 1997.  its
		members include former 
		military, civilian, and aviation professionals who are committed to independently 
		investigating the mysterious crash of twa flight 800 on july 17, 1996.






introduction



	cdr. william s. donaldson, usn 
	(ret.),  challenged the official ntsb position on the cause of the crash 
	of twa flight 800 in a series of letters to james hall, chairman of the ntsb 
	between april 1997 and december 2000.  during those four years, cdr. donaldson 
	worked with other retired aviation professionals, including some previous crash 
	investigators as well as persons inside the ntsb investigation itself.  
	cdr. donaldson has extensive experience as a naval crash investigator and he 
	and others concluded that the ntsb's explanation of the center wing tank explosion 
	was not credible.  with the help of these other concerned aviation professionals, 
	cdr. donaldson produced an extensive report on the cause of the crash.  
	the initial interim report was delivered to the house aviation subcommittee 
	on july 16th, 1998. since that time a great deal of new information has surfaced.
	



information 
	uncovered in early 1999 now shows that twa flight 800 could have been shot down 
	by one or more shoulder-fired missiles. the fbi was briefed by military missile 
	experts in the fall of 1996 that flight 800 was well within the range of a shoulder 
	fired missile.  the fbi conducted a covert dredging operation for stinger 
	missile parts between november 1996 and april 1997.  cdr. 
	donaldson brought this new evidence to the house aviation subcommittee in testimony 
	on may 6, 1999.  unfortunately, the major media and the congress are content 
	to swallow the official line without question. 


this website is dedicated 
	to cdr donaldson's outstanding leadership in searching for the truth.
