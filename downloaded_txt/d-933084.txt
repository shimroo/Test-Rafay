orchestras play more than 400 engagements per year.
a call to peter duchin entertainment ensures that your event will be handled
with the professionalism, personal commitment, expertise, and style the name
"duchin" represents. 
duchin's background is a remarkable mixture of show-business and high
society. his mother, marjorie oelrichs, was the daughter of a socially prominent
newport and new york family and a celebrated style-setter in the 1920's and
1930's. tragically, marjorie died of complications in childbirth shortly after
peter was born in 1937.
heartbroken, eddy duchin asked his good friends, averell and marie harriman,
to care for his son peter. peter was raised by the wealthy statesman and his
wife while eddy toured with his band. he later served with distinction as a
naval combat officer in world war ii. the beautiful and tragic story of peter's
parents is wonderfully told in the 1956 movie, the eddy duchin story, starring
tyrone power and kim novak.
as a youngster, peter began playing music with his father. later, he played
in bands at eaglebrook and hotchkiss schools in new england. he continued to
develop his love for music at yale, where he received his ba in music and french
literature. he also attended the sorbonne in paris where he studied composition
with the widow of the distinguished french composer, arthur honegger.
during a two-year tour with the us army in panama, he played in the us army
band and helped form a jazz orchestra that performed to great acclaim in panama
city, throughout latin america and on the ed sullivan show.
when duchin returned to new york, he embarked on a highly successful studio
career of over 26 recordings. in 1962 he opened with his band in the maisonette,
at the st. regis hotel, which quickly became the most successful supper club in
town. in 1964 he took on the job as musical coordinator for president lyndon
johnson's inauguration.
after this prestigious event, he and his band went on the road for their
first national tour.  on his return he organized peter duchin orchestras and duchin entertainment,
which has provided top quality music and entertainment ever since peter recently released his first book,  "ghost of a chance: a
memoir" through random house publishers which is now available in
paperback.


read some of the wonderful comments on this work...
"i was captivated by "ghost of a chance" - it's a great read.
and i'm delighted peter is sharing his terrific reminiscences. he's at the top
of his profession and has led a fascinating life. peter is as good with words as
he is with the ivories. his father, eddy; myself; and jackie gleason were great
pals. this book brings back memories of very special times."
~~frank sinatra~~
"a wonderful life, but peter did not have it all. his book will surprise
you. a must."
~~lauren bacall~~
"peter duchin's glamorous story is about absent fathers, surrogate
mothers, and dwelling on the edges of money and power in a tuxedoed world."
~~gay talese~~
"off the scales! a lively memoir that amuses and instructs about a
society of privilege."
~~george plimpton~~
"peter duchin's "ghost of a chance" is engaging and
entertaining, a jeroboam of vintage champagne that never loses its fizz."
