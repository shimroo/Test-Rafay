the kingdom of
				cambodia

cambodia is a land of superlatives.
				the
				ancient ruins of angkor
				rank amongst the world's most magnificent archaeological
				sites. the capital city
				phnom
				penh exudes
				
				history, as well as offers up some superb
				dining and a full-on
				nightlife. as yet
				unspoiled islands dot the cambodian coast and
				quaint little
				provincial
towns
				sit amongst strikingly beautiful countryside. and all
				this stands in stark contrast to the
				killing fields,
				toul sleng museum
				and other reminders of the khmer rouge regime. yet the khmer
				people impress visitors as some of the friendliest, most
				welcoming people they have met. the ubiquitous khmer smile is
				legendary, as is cambodia hospitality.  














siem
				reap angkor
 



nestled
				between rice paddies and stretched along the siem reap river,
				the provincial capital of siem reap city serves as the gateway
				to the millennium-old ruins of the angkorian-era khmer empire.
				designated a world heritage site by unesco, the
				angkor archaeological park
				encompasses dozens of temple ruins including bayon, ta prohm and
				the legendary angkor wat whose artistic and archaeological
				significance... (more)

phnom
				penh
 



a
				mixture of khmer hos-pitality, asian exotica and indochinese
				charm await the visitor to phnom penh. situated at the
				confluence of the mekong river phnom penh is a city of more than
				2 million and the county's commercial, economic and political
				hub.
				bistros and boutique
				hotels line the riverfront,
				smart little
				silk shops and art
				galleries dot the side streets and the city still enjoys a
				dusk-to-dawn
				nightlife... (more)

sihanoukville
 





sihanoukville is cambodia's pre-mier
				beach town, sporting warm tropical gulf of thailand waters,
				miles of
				sandy
				beaches and a dozen unspoiled tropical
				
islands. the town is also a travel hub for other coastal
				towns. sihanouk-ville is a beach/party town, the
				beaches
				offering umbrellas and thatch roofed
				
				eateries, 24-hour
				bars
				and everything from a laid back beach chair on otres to an
				endless party vibe on ochheuteal... (more)

kampot
 



kampot
				city is of quite different character from sihanoukville. kampot
				is an old provincial capital of quiet lanes and colonial period
				architecture, a bit worn but radiating a quaint, welcoming,
				small town ambiance. it is a place to get a taste of provincial
				cambodia. use the city as a base to explore the surrounding
				countryside and as a stepping stone to
				kep,
				bokor and
				southeastern... (more)

				kep
 



kep
				area from the turn of the century through the 1960s kep was
				cambodia's premier beach town, drawing holiday-makers to its
				breezy shores. these days kep is known more for its oceanfront
				crab shacks and relaxed tropical atmosphere. a few short,
				picturesque slivers of sand dot the shore including kep beach
				where many of the
				guesthouses
				and
				restaurants
				are clustered. though probably on the cusp of significant
				tourism development... (more)

islands
 





while sihanouk-ville is still
				cambodia's most popular beach spot with locals and tourists
				alike, the islands off sihanoukville's shore are quickly
				becoming a destination in their own right. cambodian islands
				have an undeveloped, laid-back charm not easily found elsewhere.
				while many of the islands are covered in jungle and almost
				completely uninhabited, others have lovely stretches of... (more)

koh
				kong
 





koh kong city is the capital of koh
				kong province, a comparatively small provincial town sitting
				near the international border crossing with thailand. many
				travelers see koh kong only briefly as they pass through, but
				that is changing and the province is becoming something of an
				ï¿½eco-destination.ï¿½ to the north and east of the city, the jungled
				cardamom mountains cover much of the province, offering
				trekking, dirt... (more)

				battambang
 





even though battambang is one of the
				country's largest towns, it has a very lightly touristed,
				provincial atmosphere. much of the architecture is colonial-era
				with traditional shop-houses lining quaint narrow lanes. as you
				leave battambang by road, the scene quickly becomes one of
				villages and rice paddies. the nearby countryside harbors
				several
				
picturesque old
				pagodas, angkorian era ruins... (more)

				angkor guide
 





the
				angkor archaeological park is
				home to the magnificent khmer temple ruins of angkor, including
				the legendary 
angkor wat,
				bayon and dozens of other ancient
				ruins of the angkorian-era (9th-13th century) khmer empire. the
				park encompasses more than 400 square kilometers just outside
				siem reap city in northwestern cambodia and is a world heritage
				site. the temple ruins of angkor contained within the park... (more).
