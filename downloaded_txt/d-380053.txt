recycling






the amount ofwaste created by central ohio residents and businesses is staggering.in fact, every resident generates an averageof9 to 10 pounds of waste each day, and about half of that material is sent tothe county landfill. with only so much landfill space available, it’s more important than ever that we reuse, recycle, compost or divert as much as we can.
the city of columbus will launch weekly residential recycling collection the week of june 12, 2023. the expanded service supports climate action plan goals to achieve clean neighborhoods and a healthy environment for all residents.
to help residents prepare for the changes, we have developed a fact sheet(pdf, 332kb) and q&a document(pdf, 423kb) that will assist with some of the most common questions.
