weekly meeting schedule (spring 2024)









mln-geewhiz: dashboard for multilayer network generation, analysis, drill-down, and visualization is live!
      

cowiz or covid wizard: interactive analysis and visualization of covid-19 data using multilayer networks (or mlns) [4500+ hits from 20+ countries]


mln-dive: lecture series archive held in 2022 

research opportunities: it lab is always looking for reu students (undergraduates who are 
		  citizens, us nationals, or permanent residents of united states) to 
		  work on various implementation projects and dashboards. please take a 
		  look at the dashboards and if you get interested, please contact me by 
	    email. others, interested, can also reach out to us. 
welcome to my research and teaching home page!

		my computer science research has spanned 40+ years (starting in 1975 at tifr, bombay, india) based on the philosophy briefly outlined below. my teaching philosophy and the courses i have taught can be found under the teaching tab.		  

		 the information technology laboratory or it lab (part of the cse 
		 department at uta) is actively involved in research and development on 
		 all aspects of information technology: big data analytics, mining, 
		 machine learning, optimization, scalability, and information 
		 fusion/ibtegration.

		  the vision of it lab can be summarized as:
		  
carry out both fundamental theoretical and practically applicable research & development
interact and collaborate with industry/govt/federal agencies and 
			academia for identifying fundamental problems
provide a viable migration path (transition) for integrating new techniques/solutions into real-world systems/applications


		  i am seeking industry collaborators and project partners to pursue 
		  solutions to problems that are of interest to dealing with large, 
		  diverse data types. i am 
		  interested in transferring technology currently available at it lab to 
		  real-world applications.
		  i am also interested in applying novel ways of teaching to maximize 
		  student participation and learning, understanding, and practcal application of concepts!  


bpc: it lab wishes to recruit under-represented groups (females, 
	        hispanics/latino, african-americans, ...) for stem (science, technology, 
	        engineering, and math) research at both the graduate and 
	        undergraduate level. please contact me using the email below.


 if you would like to know more about the it lab and how to 
	    collaborate with us, please email your cv and your ineterests


motto:   complex data analysis: load data.analyze.visualize.share.interact.learn!                  

please look around and enjoy!
