the history of racing in north georgia has given rise to many notable names and talented drivers such as lloyd seay, roy hall, jonathan davenport, bill elliott, and chase elliott. while most of georgia’s early pioneers such as seay and hall honed their skills by running moonshine around dawsonville, georgia, the next generation of talent is starting out just a few miles to the south in cumming, ga.north georgia quarter midget association (ngqma) was built in 1995 and has held multiple regional and national races in its almost 30-year history. the club provides an exceptional facility for kids ages 5 to 16 to grow their race craft and also learn life skills that will help them no matter what path they choose to pursue in the future. past nascar driver reed sorenson and current nascar drivers corey heim and austin hill call ngqma their home track. in 2022, nascar joined usac to become one of the sanctioning bodies of quarter midgets, thus making ngqma a nascar youth series club. join us as we kick off our biggest year yet in 2025!
