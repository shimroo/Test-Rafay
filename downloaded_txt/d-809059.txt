sleepababy is a collection of classic lullabies sung in a female solo voice, just as if mama or grandma were singing your baby to sleep. no horns, strings, or bassoons distract from the simple resonance of voice. singer/songwriter margaret lange has rocked many babies to sleep through the years, and she shares her experience with parents and caregivers in her lullabye collection, sleepababy. the collection is being mastered and will be available soon.  please check back.
