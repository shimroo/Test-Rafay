                                        many of the flowers lining store shelves for valentineâs day have been gifted at romantic dinners. but what happens to the flowers that went unsold? a new study from the university of georgia explores how flowers can be repurposed as food ingredients, offering a more sustainable way to use blooms that might otherwise be discarded. âwe are looking at what happens the day after valentineâs day to those flowers,â said uga college of agricultural and environmental sciences researcher anand mohan.

best by vs. sell by: uga food safety expert explains expiration dates

                                        checking expiration dates is second nature for many consumers, a routine part of deciding whatâs safe to eat. but those dates often indicate peak quality rather than actual safety, leading people to throw away perfectly good food out of caution â wasting both meals and money in the process. between 30% and 40% of the food supply in the united states is wasted, according to the united states department of agriculture. a portion of that stems from consumer misunderstanding of food labels, said carla schwan, a food safety specialist with university of georgia cooperative extension.
