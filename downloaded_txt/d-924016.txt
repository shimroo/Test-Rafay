notes from the podcast:
in associations, a tricky truth of the matter stays: no one is excellent. this acknowledgment sets the phase for a phenomenon i’ve occur to contact the “near miss” phenomenon, wherever apps and social encounters introduce us to opportunity associates who tick most of the bins yet feel to tumble just shorter in specified places. in these gaps, several of us, armed with the greatest intentions, fall into the trap of believing we can mildew, form, and finally ‘fix’ these in close proximity to misses into our great lover. but here’s a vital intervention: prevent. just prevent.
this approach, even though typically embarked upon with the purest of intentions, is fraught with pitfalls and destined for poor outcomes.
why the fixing mentality takes hold

then there is the allure of playing the pro, in which the determination to fix is pushed by a motivation to showcase superiority, information, and leadership. even though asserting a function and demonstrating private development know-how can be empowering, imposing these features on someone as a kind of romantic relationship advancement is ineffective and typically counterproductive.
the scenario versus correcting your companion
making an attempt to deal with someone presupposes that they require fixing – a presumption which is not only presumptuous but can border on the obnoxious. it’s necessary to query the validity of the wanted adjust: is it genuinely effective, and much more importantly, is it sought immediately after by the husband or wife?

furthermore, the severe fact is that most of us aren’t as adept at facilitating alter in other people as we may consider. efficient, long lasting adjust demands a nuanced being familiar with, capabilities, and patience—qualities that are experienced domains relatively than own obligations.
summary: embrace, don’t take care of
in conclusion, the journey in direction of fostering a healthier romance is paved with mutual respect, acceptance, and unconditional like, not a relentless pursuit of reworking your partner into an idealized edition. when the impulse to resolve may stem from a spot of really like, its execution can lead to resentment, a loss of individuality, and, in the long run, a fractured connection.
so, instead than aiming to fix your partner, concentration on developing a foundation of aid, comprehending, and regard that celebrates your imperfections and strengths. after all, the most enduring interactions embrace, relatively than endeavor to erase, the flaws that make us human.
