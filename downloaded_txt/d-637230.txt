it is with incredible sorrow that we share the passing of our dear friend, talented artist, and founding member alexandra broches. alexandra was a light at hera gallery for 50 years. in 1995, alexandra represented hera at the ngo forum on women of the fourth united nations world conference in beijing.  her moving artwork evolved over the years, culminating in her latest project "letters and pictures from a box" uncovering her family narrative. her work is in the collections of the philadelphia museum of art, hasbro children’s hospital, providence, ri, technic, inc., cranston, ri, cornish associates, providence, ri as well as private collections.it is difficult to picture hera without alexandra. it is because of her hard work, passion, and dedication, that we have arrived at our 50th anniversary. we looked forward to celebrating this landmark with her by our side. though she will forever be missed, alexandra's life's work and memory will live on in the spirit of hera. we are accepting donations in alexandra’s honor with the intent of establishing a scholarship in her name. to donate, please see the link below.
