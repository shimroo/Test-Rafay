academic excellence for over 50 years

 
worcester prep is warm and supportive, a close-knit community where teachers know every student on a personal level and parents know their children will be nurtured as well as challenged. the school attracts an average of 500 students from maryland, delaware and virginia.  from pre-k to grade 12, worcester prep has earned a reputation as an academic leader since 1970, but the value of a worcester prep education reaches beyond what’s learned in the classroom. with the support of dedicated teachers and motivated classmates, students graduate prepared for the challenges of college and success in any field they choose to pursue. the school's renowned college counseling program, competitive athletics, and vibrant arts program are just a few of the highlights that sets them apart.  this combination of academic excellence, character development, and personal encouragement is worth the investment from families who want their children to become their best selves.
