          get to see a larger, more detailed image of scenes from our club layouts. 
 whether
          novices or old-timers we tend to take the hobby seriously as ho and n
          scale model railroaders. maybe it's because--at the end of the
          day--we have once again connected with the delight and enjoyment of
          a hobby for men and women that often started in childhood, but can
          last a lifetime. we hope you'll discover just some of the magic as
          you visit this site and learn more about the club. model railroading
          truly is the world's greatest hobby!
