pet urns offer a personal connection with a pet even after passing. animal lovers tend to view their pets as part of the family, with personalities and charms as distinct as any playful child, eccentric aunt, or curmudgeonly grandfather. so, when a pet passes, the grief is often just as real and the sorrow as acute as if a human family member had passed away. personalized pet urns are one way to help deal with sorrow in the loss of a pet.we know not all pets are of the canine and feline variety. while we have a wide selection of dog urns and cat urns, many of our memorial boxes for pet ashes can also be used for hamsters, rabbits, birds, and other not-as-furry friends.like cremation urns for people, pet urns come in an assortment of designs, materials, and sizes. following are descriptions of some popular types of urns for pet ashes that perfect memorials offers.wooden pet urns - wood urns vary from being a solid wood or composite material, both available in many wood finishes, including maple, cherry, oak, mahogany, and walnut. metal pet urns - bronze, brass, pewter, copper, and aluminum are some of the materials used to make pet urns in various styles and sizes. from traditional grecian shapes to statues, metal pet urns feature finishes in polished and brushed metal as well as cloisonné, mother of pearl, and colored enamel. ceramic pet urns - these delicate pet urns feature diverse, artistic imagery in designs limited only by the imagination – from timeless urn shapes to exquisite figurines cultured or simulated pet urns - cultured pet urns are formed from manufactured substances, cold-cast, and fashioned to look and feel like stone, ceramic, or other traditional materials. simulated pet urns are available in varying colors, sizes, and shapes. the most popular designs include dogs or cats in baskets, figurines of varying breeds, as well as garden rocks. the extensive line of pet cremation urns carried by perfect memorials also includes biodegradable pet urns and pet photo urns to showcase your favorite photo of your animal companion.how to choose the right-sized pet urnthe rule of thumb for choosing a pet urn size is that for every pound of healthy weight, you should have at least a cubic inch of space, and it's better to err on the side of too much space rather than too little. many people will include a favorite toy or their pet's collar in the urn when there is extra room.many of our pet urns have space for personalization. be sure to check the product details on your urn of choice for availability, or start with our engravable pet urns if customization is important to you.
