a history of innovative learning
a pioneer in nontraditional education, coastline college opened in 1976 as the first campus-free college in the united states - distributing learning opportunities throughout our communities in orange county, california. many years before the internet, coastline introduced distance learning via television. over the years, the "college without walls" added three brick-and-mortar campuses - in newport beach, westminster, and garden grove - and increased its distance learning offerings with hybrid and online classes.

military times: best for vets

coastline was chosen again as a best for vets college by the military times. coastline's military programs department has been named a military friendly school and a best for vets school annually for almost a decade.





what our students are saying
"i'm writing as i reflect on my experience taking distance learning courses with coastline college... grateful for the impact it has had on my future and passions. while serving with 1/3 marines in kunar province in afghanistan, i was able to complete correspondence courses in psychology and biology... these courses were not only convenient and flexible, but they also allowed me to continue my education and pursue my passion for learning even in the midst of a combat deployment." -tyler, coastline graduate
