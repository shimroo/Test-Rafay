welcome to clayton and the 1000 islands


where the tradition continues…
clayton’s tradition of charm and hospitality began more than a century ago when the 1000 islands region was the playground of the nations most powerful. now that tradition is embraced by a new generation of visitors…a tradition we invite you to experience firsthand.
clayton is the quintessential river village, a jewel of a peninsula surrounded by the magnificent st. lawrence river, nestled along the northern edge of upstate new york and minutes from the canadian border. come and soak up the small town atmosphere. you’ll find quaint shops and galleries, nationally known museums, and outdoor activities ranging from fishing to golfing, diving, kayaking to hiking that all within walking distance. for those who like life in the fast lane there is a one mile go kart track nearby.
be sure to stop for a bite to eat at one of clayton’s many restaurants. watch the boats go by from the deck of one of our river front eateries. unwind with a leisurely gourmet dinner; or grab a quiet bite to eat at a cafe or pizzeria. have a sandwich wrapped to go and picnic at one of our beautiful parks. don’t forget to stop for ice cream!
there are a variety of accommodations available in clayton. stay in a charming bed and breakfast right in the village, or try camping at one of the scenic state parks or local campgrounds that line the river. pamper yourself at a luxury resort, settle in at a friendly family motel or spend the week in one of many cottages located along the river shores that will leave you refreshed and ready for another busy day on the river.
we invite you to join us for a fun-filled family vacation, a romantic getaway, or an international adventure. we promise an experience you’ll always remember, in a glorious setting you’ll never forget!
