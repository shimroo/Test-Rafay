new release
aspects of relational practice
this book sets a framework for supporting new child and youth care 
	practitioners to be developmentally aware about the limits of what they 
	should be trying to achieve with young people and families. it tempers the 
	impatience and feelings of incompetence that haunt many practitioners in the 
	first year of child and youth care experience.
the information about threshold concepts will guide more experienced 
	practitioners through the difficult path to accurate empathy and strength 
	awareness, which in turn begins the transition into deep relational 
	connections that are the key to the skill set of a mature practitioner. 
	supervisors will also benefit from awareness of the developmental roadmap to 
	structure the scaffolding of strategies to build an expanded view of oneâs 
	professional self and intentions for the transitioning, treatment focused 
	practitioner. 
mature practitioners can learn deeper relational frameworks and increase 
	âselfâ development in relational practice. it will also assist mature 
	practitioners to be effective mentors to less experienced colleagues. 
supervisors will find this book to be a valuable reference for creating 
	developmentally useful plans for staff improvement, as well as a personally 
	challenging read to evaluate their own practice. 
administrators will gain a stronger appreciation of what a 
	relationally-based program is, as well as how to create this type of program 
	for their agency.
