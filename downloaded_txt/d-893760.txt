international stormwater bmp databasethe international stormwater best management practices database (bmpdb) is a repository of bmp field studies and related web tools, performance summaries, and monitoring guidance.  initiated over 25 years ago, the original focus was urban stormwater bmps (stormwater control measures). through the support of long-term partners, the project has expanded to develop additional resources related to both urban and agricultural runoff, treatment and management.  separate databases are accessible on this site for urban stormwater bmp performance, agricultural bmps, stream restoration bmps, and urban runoff quality characterization (national stormwater quality runoff database). special resources have also been developed for department of transportation users through the dot portal. all of these resources can be accessed through this website, with the most developed tools available for urban stormwater bmps.to be placed on a contact list for project updates, contact us.
