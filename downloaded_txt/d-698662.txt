my kids have been playing on this for years. we have 4 kids, and all of them have had their time on the swing or the bars. this product is designed very well and is highly durable. this provides our kids a way to get a ton of energy out on a rainy day and with as much as we get here in seattle, this gets lots of use. still looks as good as new after 5+ years. i lost one of the rings that hold the swing hooks in our remodel and i called their office, spoke to herbert and he sent us new rings right away. great service after the sale, and it's made in america! you'll be happy you bought this usa-made product.

my son has autism and seeks vestibular movement constantly. we purchased the rainy day indoor net swing and set it up in his bedroom doorway. he was 4 years old when we bought it and is now 7 years old. there isn’t a day goes by that he doesn’t use his swing. he has mastered it!! he amazes me with what he can do with it. he loves it dearly as do i. it has been the best thing we have ever purchased to help my son and his autism needs. thank you for an amazing product!!
