				of the above courses may be conducted at your location, anywhere 
				in the world. the above courses can be customized in length and 
				content to fit your site specific needs, for the type and size 
				of scaffold which you use. for example, if the client only needs 
				system scaffold training, the course can be tailored for system 
				scaffold. or if more than one day of practical hands-on is 
				required, that can be done. sti has been conducting professional 
				scaffold training for over 20 years, including all 50 states, 
				the caribbean, china, africa, and the middle east. call us for

				working scaffolds needed at the client's plant under the 
				supervision of our instructor. 

				13.  refresher training:  retraining is recommended every five years.

				trainer course (without taking the course) for $1000.  this includes all trainer 
				materials for both the competent person and the user only courses 
				(videos & pdf slide presentation on a usb flash drive, manuals and guides).  
				however, without attending the course, the individual would not 
				be certified to issue sti certificates.

		frequently asked questions
 
what 
		course do we recommend? 

		the training should be appropriate to the type of scaffolds and scope of 
		work the attendee will be involved in.  the five day course 
		(modules 1-5) is our recommended course.  for even more training, 
		the 80 hour course includes a week of working with the students at your 
		facility building real scaffolds in your environment for actual use.  for those who need training 
		only in basic frame, tube & coupler, and system scaffolds, the three 
		day course (modules 1-3) could be a good fit. for those who 
		need an overview of powered suspended scaffolds (spider baskets swing 
		stage) in addition to basic  frame, tube & coupler, and system 
		scaffolds, the four day course is a good fit. 
 
what is 
		the minimum to cover the mandatory osha training requirements? 


		that depends upon the scope of work (e.g. inspection, 
		erection, or modification), and the types of scaffolds involved.    
		the training should be appropriate for the scope of work the attendee 
		will be involved in.  the topics osha recommends in 1926.454 
		and appendix d for frame, tube & coupler, and system are covered in 
		classroom fashion in module one. this course is the minimum for inspection of 
		scaffolds.  basic erection is covered in module two.  for 
		those building larger scaffolds, the design and loading in module three 
		is recommended.  more advanced assembly is covered in module five.  
how much "hands-on" training is required by osha?   
osha does not mandate a specific 
		number of hours. the hands on should be custom tailored for each company 
		according to the employees’ experience, types of scaffolds to be used, 
		and scope of anticipated work. the are 25 different types of scaffolds 
		covered by 1926.452, so the training should be specific to the type 
		used. for example, one employer might have experienced workers who erect 
		only frame scaffolds up to two levels, 
		then call a scaffold company to erect larger scaffolds. the amount of 
		hands on training should reflect that limited scope.  another employer 
		might use all three types  (frame, tube & clamp, and system) on 
		taller scaffolds. the 
		amount of hands on should then reflect that scope.  module two 
		covers basic scaffolds up to two levels high.  module five covers 
		more advanced assembly including hanging scaffolds, knee outs, truss 
		installation and stairway installation.  our 80 hour course also 
		covers hands on assembly at the customer's location in real 
		applications. call to discuss.
can you send an 
		instructor to our site and conduct a custom course for our employees? 
		
yes, sti has been conducting training 
		all over the world for over 25 years.  we can provide training 
		pretty much anywhere on planet earth.
what about 
		refresher training?
osha does not mandate a specific time 
		period but our recommendation is to be retrained every five years.
 

                                                                                      
		osha§ 1926.454 training requirements.
		this section supplements and clarifies the requirements of § 
		1926.21(b)(2) as these relate to the hazards of work on scaffolds. 
		(a) the employer shall have each employee who performs work while on a 
		scaffold trained by a person qualified in the subject matter to 
		recognize the hazards associated with the type of scaffold being used 
		and to understand the procedures to control or minimize those hazards. 
		the training shall include the following areas, as applicable:  
		(1) the nature of any electrical hazards, fall hazards and falling 
		object hazards in the work area; 
		(2) the correct procedures for dealing with electrical hazards and for 
		erecting, maintaining, and disassembling the fall protection systems and 
		falling object protection systems being used; 
		(3) the proper use of the scaffold, and the proper handling of materials 
		on the scaffold; 
		(4) the maximum intended load and the load-carrying capacities of the 
		scaffolds used; and 
		(5) any other pertinent requirements of this subpart.

dec 2008 train the trainer class

   
the december students 
		below rebuilt the big tube & clamp scaffold after 
		hurricane ike had blown it over.


these december students below were 
		just hanging around (joking).  it is a good experience to feel the 
		suspension in a harness.  
the swing stage allows a gradual lowering 
		until suspension is obtained without impact.
