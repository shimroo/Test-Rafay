introduce the guest – show the value 


collect information about the guest. the listener may not know all his regalia and services to his homeland, but you need to “advertise” the guest for a few sentences so that the listener would say to himself: – “yes, this is an interesting guest, you need to listen.”
be sure to tell why you decided to invite this particular guest (just because you like him or it is your friend – not an important answer, you need to justify the benefits for the listener). even if this is your childhood friend, about whom you know everything, it doesn’t matter. for the listener, he is just another guest.





what is podcast?podcasts are regular audio shows that are available to listen to on demand. as a rule, podcast episodes are united by a common theme, format and composition of the hosts.did you know?you can often find a comparison of podcasts with radio. but podcasts are about radio in much the same way that youtube is about television.
podcasts everywhere!all you need to listen to podcasts is headphones in conjunction with a smartphone, computer, tablet, or even a watch (for example, apple watch). speakers of varying degrees of intelligence are fine too.

it is also important to understand the psychology of dialogue: it should be interesting to both, and not only to you. therefore, finding out in advance the interlocutor (his biography, awards, projects, etc.) is a good tone for the presenter.
if finances permit, hire an editor who will find guests and information about them, but at first you can do this yourself.





🎸 🎼 🎵 there are many different podcasts. these can be history or physics lessons, audiobooks, entertainment shows, discussion of games and gadgets, analyzes of life situations, autoreviews, stand-up comedy, audio series and crime investigations.
short, long, conversational, narrative, calm, musical and active. everyone will find the topic and format of the podcast to their liking.

at the very beginning of the podcast, announce what the episode will be about and what your goals are with the episode. brief but clear.

for example:âthis issue is calledâ how politics changes people, âand in it we will try to answer the questions: what kind of psychological portrait should a successful politician have? what is the age for political flourishing? how do habits and outlook change after 10 years of work in politics? “

this will be caring for the listeners and will also set the pace for the release so that both the guest and you will have the same understanding of the conversation ahead.
