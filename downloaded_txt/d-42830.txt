“how wonderful it is that no one need wait, but can start right now to gradually change the world!” 



anne frank 







 











the anne frank center usa honors anne
frank, her family, and her words by
providing transformative education in grades 4-12. 



participants in our programs make personal connections between learning and their lives through performing arts, customized workshops and presentations, and encounters with nature through our living memorial of anne frank trees. our vision is to grow communities across the united states that prevent bigotry, antisemitism, racism, and discrimination.

what we do 





 



the anne frank center usa offers theatrical performances for schools, introducing new generations to anne frank. in 2022 and 2023 our plays reached more than 50,000 people in 21 states. in 2024 we are on pace to increase the reach of our theater program by more than 30%.  







in-class workshops bring the arts directly to students in title 1 schools.* “the art of self discovery” and “from bystander to ally” are currently offered to students in title 1 schools in new york city. we plan to expand the program in 2025.
*title 1 schools receive federal funding to assist students from low-income families. 



 







 



our sapling project spreads hope for the future. sprouted from the original european horse chestnut that grew outside of the secret annex, anne frank trees are now thriving at 17 sites across the usa and counting. 





our programs are offered together or as separate experiences. learn more, or request a program.
