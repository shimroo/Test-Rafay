real customer service
part of our mission is to provide excellence in  service, and we are passionate about our mission. we believe that we must all work for a better world, and our part in it is to support you and your mission. we do that by pledging to be right beside you every step of the way with the best customer service you have ever experienced. our customers use words like "refreshing", "informative", "patient", "unparalleled" and "tremendous" when they talk about the support they receive from us - but we think that providing the best service we can is our responsibility, so we just call it real customer service. don't take our word for it, though: take a look at what our customers say about our support & service by checking out our testimonials.



affordable for all nonprofits
organizations of all types and sizes use fundraiser, but our target customers are small, mid-sized, and growing organizations, so we work very hard to keep our software both powerful and affordable. all three of our programs can be purchased or leased, and we offer the most flexible interest-free payment plans in the industry. with our low prices and built-in growth path, fundraiser software is the ideal choice for organizations that are looking for an affordable option that will grow with them. view pricing
