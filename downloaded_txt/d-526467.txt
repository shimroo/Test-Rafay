	 on the nature of reality
    


in case you didn't realize, our world is a giant hologram.   "the idea that we live in a hologram probably sounds absurd, but it is a natural  extension of our best understanding of black holes, and something with a pretty  firm theoretical footing. it has also been surprisingly helpful for physicists  wrestling with theories of how the universe works at its most fundamental level."now, take a closer look at this hologram.  its mighty pretty.and finally, gross gigantic and/or evil insects, to give you nightmares!

	 best 'ring in the new year' article every....
    


...for your enjoyment, depression, anger, and hopefully motivation, i bring you:reality bitesby ken mondscheinwe are people of this generation, bred in the most hedonistic society the world has ever known, housed now in over-mortgaged tract homes, and looking uncomfortably to the world we leave to our children. we were born in the days when the soviet union was the evil empire, a college degree was the ticket to the middle class, and being born american meant that unlimited opportunity was your birthright. we saw the soviet empire fall, and realized that we had geared our entire society to prepare for a war that no one had dared fight.our college degrees hang on our walls, but though our mental horizons have been expanded, our economic opportunities have not. we were told that success does not matter if you are black or white, male or female, and while the political successes of barack obama, hillary clinton, and even sarah palin seemed to vindicate this philosophy, it does not obviate the fact that opportunity for all still means that most of us are doomed to lives of obscure mediocrity. the dot-com boom and bust, the current depression, the unwinnable wars in asia, all have convinced us the truth of the anthems of our youth. we are here now, and we are not entertained.future historians will note that american society peaked in the late 1960s. culturally, this is a foregone conclusion. we listen to our parents’ music and call it "classic rock," a canon that can be approached but never surpassed. when we think of art, we think of warhol and rothko. our top-selling cultural products have names like "star wars" and "star trek"—nostalgic baby boomer dreams that one day man will dance amongst the heavenly spheres, whereas in reality we have come crashing down, icarus-like, in fiery debris. after the sun-bright baby boomer generation flared into supernova, it collapsed into a black hole.we knew all this long ago. we were called the "slacker" generation. but how could we not be, after free love turned to aids, we saw peace commodified and sold for junk bonds, and realized the calls for "revolution" were nothing more than the mewling of infants begging to be indulged? our coming-of-age movies were "reality bites" and "fight club." our famed irony and sarcasm were not a sign that we value nothing: they were self-defense in a world where nothing is valued. this is the world the baby boomers, the so-called flower-children, have left us: a world poisoned by me-firstism, by nimbyism, by i-got-mine-ism. our parents' generation has rebutted the hard work and sacrifice of our grandparents with short-term thinking and situational morality justified by excel spreadsheets.we grow into middle age not surrounded by prosperity and security, but by our doubts and fears. even as the rich have gotten richer, we have seen our standard of living fall. the middle class is barely reproducing itself, bifurcated into those barely treading water and those on an endless paper chase after useless honors. our hopes have been dashed, our dreams sold for firewood to keep warm and hold back the wolves for one more night.i should end this essay on a note of hope, or at least a call to action. such would be the traditional coda. however, i cannot find it within me to do so. the myth of progress is dead; all we have to look for is a mediocre world of diminished expectations. somewhere along the way, someone might have tricked us into caring or having hope, but we have come to realize that the current "crisis" is not the result of a great country hijacked by a cabal of free-market capitalists: it is, in fact, the new baseline. things are not going to get better; all we can do is hope they will not get worse. we take from this the great lesson learned by abused children everywhere: it hurt less when we didn't care.taken without permission from corporatemofo.com

	 i told you so.....
    


food riots, tax rebellions by 2012...trend forecaster, renowned for  being accurate in the past, says the man who predicted the 1987 stock market crash and the fall of the soviet union is now forecasting revolution in america, food riots and tax rebellions - all within four years, while cautioning that putting food on the table will be a more pressing concern than buying christmas gifts by 2012.gerald celente, the ceo of trends research institute, is renowned  for his accuracy in predicting fut more..ure world and economic events, which will send a chill  down your spine considering what he told fox news this week.celente says that by 2012 america will become an undeveloped nation, that there will be a revolution marked by food riots, squatter rebellions, tax revolts and job marches, and that holidays will be more about obtaining food, not gifts."we're going to see the end of the retail christmas....we're going to see a fundamental shift take place....putting food on the table is going to be more important that putting gifts under the christmas tree," said celente, adding that the situation would be "worse than the great depression"."america's going to go through a transition the likes of which no one is prepared for," said celente, noting that people's refusal to acknowledge that america was even in a recession highlights how big a problem denial is in being ready for the true scale of the crisis.celente, who successfully predicted the 1997 asian currency crisis, the subprime mortgage collapse and the massive devaluation of the u.s. dollar, told upi in november last year that the following year would be known as "the panic of 2008," adding that "giants (would) tumble to their deaths," which is exactly what we have witnessed with the collapse of lehman brothers, bear stearns and others. he also said that the dollar would eventually be devalued by as much as 90 per cent.the consequence of what we have seen unfold this year would lead to a lowering in living standards, celente predicted a year ago, which is also being borne out by plummeting retail sales figures.the prospect of revolution was a concept echoed by a british ministry of defence report last year, which predicted that within 30 years, the growing gap between the super rich and the middle class, along with an urban underclass threatening social order would mean, "the world's middle classes might unite, using access to knowledge, resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest," and that, "the middle classes could become a revolutionary class."in a separate recent interview, celente went further on the  subject of revolution in america."there will be a revolution in this country," he said. "it’s not going to come yet, but it’s going to come down the line and we’re going to see a third party and this was the catalyst for it: the takeover of washington, d. c., in broad daylight by wall street in this bloodless coup. and it will happen as conditions continue to worsen.""the first thing to do is organize with tax revolts. that’s going to be the big one because people can’t afford to pay more school tax, property tax, any kind of tax. you’re going to start seeing those kinds of protests start to develop.""it’s going to be very bleak. very sad. and there is going to be a lot of homeless, the likes of which we have never seen before. tent cities are already sprouting up around the country and we’re going to see many more.""we’re going to start seeing huge areas of vacant real estate and squatters living in them as well. it’s going to be a picture the likes of which americans are not going to be used to. it’s going to come as a shock and with it, there’s going to be a lot of crime. and the crime is going to be a lot worse than it was before because in the last 1929 depression, people’s minds weren’t wrecked on all these modern drugs – over-the-counter drugs, or crystal meth or whatever it might be. so, you have a huge underclass of very desperate people with their minds chemically blown beyond anybody’s comprehension.""when cnn wants to know about the top trends, we ask  gerald celente."— cnn headline news"a network of 25 experts whose  range of specialties would rival many university faculties."— the  economist"gerald celente has a knack for getting the zeitgeist right."— usa today"there’s not a better trend forecaster than gerald  celente. the man knows what he’s talking about."- cnbc"those who  take their predictions seriously ... consider the trends research  institute."— the wall street journal"gerald celente is always ahead of the curve on trends and uncannily on the mark ... he's one of the most accurate forecasters around."— the atlanta journal-constitution"mr.  celente tracks the world’s social, economic and business trends for corporate  clients."— the new york times"mr. celente is a very intelligent guy.  we are able to learn about trends from an authority."— 48 hours, cbs  news"gerald celente has a solid track record. he has predicted everything from the 1987 stock market crash and the demise of the soviet union to green marketing and corporate downsizing."— the detroit  news"gerald celente forecast the 1987 stock market crash, ‘green  marketing,’ and the boom in gourmet coffees."— chicago tribune"the  trends research institute is the standard and poors of popular culture."—  the los angeles times"if nostradamus were alive today, he'd have a hard  time keeping up with gerald celente."— new york postso there you have it - hardly a nutjob conspiracy theorist blowhard now is he? the price of not heeding his warnings will be far greater than the cost of preparing for the future now. storable food and gold are two good places to make a start.

	 dulling the pain....
    


…inspiration can be found in the most unpleasant of places.  somehow, i find inspiration in the handbasket that this world, and more close to home, america, is going to hell in.  now, you all know ol’ hobbsy here loves his conspiracy theories.  most of em are a total crock of shite, of course, but often you can find a good chunk of reality in each one.  a nice, sizeable schmere of a$sf*cking that all of us, the little people, receive on a daily basis.  and  the real fun about it is, you never notice how much you’re getting screwed until you start paying attention to the screwballs.   its all about the distractions, people.  i for one am as guilty as just about anyone.  slugging down a few beers every night to dull the pain of awareness, the pain in my rear-end that makes me walk as funny as malach at a cowboy convention.  the pain of awareness coupled with the inability to enact change.  mmmm, soothing distractions.  flip on the television, and it’ll all go away.   watch a bad episode of heroes, indulge in a mediocre episode of fringe, laugh at the abuse dished out by gordon ramsay.  dream of fame with the boys of entourage.  fantasize about a whole new world by getting lost, and a whole new enemy, with a whole new secret agenda of a$sf*cking.  now, granted, some of this content of entertainment is worthwhile, its intelligent, it makes you think.  i support that, in moderation (the distractions, that is).  but, as i’ve heard it somewhere before, the world is the wool pulled over our eyes, the ballgag in our mouths, and the table we’re bent over on.   celebrity seems the best distraction of our days.  just a bunch of other people who get paid to distract us, and get paid a lot, and the next thing, we’re not obsessed with their work of distraction.  now their lives become our entertainment.  hell, they don’t even need to get paid anymore – just pick a random bunch of suckers and put their lives up for public disdain.  americans go mad for it, read their people, e, perezhilton.  drool over the pain and dismay of others, in order to dull the pain of our own.  all the while, we could be dissecting the lives of those people we ‘elected’ to run the world we live in.  put them under the microscope and really see what the hell they’re up to.  see if they’re worth the money we gave them, pay them.  find out exactly how many counts of societal rape each one is guilty of.   and like i said, i’m as guilty as the next guy.  i was smart, i was less distracted, i was aware.  and i’ve slipped back.  i get involved in political debates, and find myself feeling stupid.  i don’t know as much as i used to.  i haven’t paid enough attention.  and i’m waking up again.  the pain isn’t nearly as dulled by the beers and wine, the tv and movies.  i’m getting more and more pissed off.  and i think we all need to do it.  stop being distracted.  and, on top of that, stop being myopic and self-involved.  dammit, we’ve got a million causes to choose from, and each cause has a million different groups working on it.  and yet nothing gets solved.  i think it’s time to show what a real new world order can be.  because, i’ll tell you know, we’re getting raped again.   which brings me to my actual point.  i want to that just me for her post, because it woke up a part of me that’s been napping for a bit.  and it reminded me of something i saw, not too long ago.  and i thought, hmm, how convenient.   so, let’s talk about fema.  as justme covered, fema has the power to take control.  complete control over any domestic area where unrest is occurring.  they’ve got their concentration camps already set up.   they’re ready for us to go nuts.  hmmm, ready……..ok.  here’s my little nugget of news for you all.read this  this little nugget was sent to me on september 24, 2008, by one of my agents in the field, and i found it an interesting little read.  for the first time since the civil war, us troops have been have been deployed within the us.  that’s right, right here in the good ol homeland.  this type of deployment  has been prohibited in the us since the civil war, and i quote: (the only exceptions being that the national guard and coast guard are exempted, and use of the military on an emergency ad hoc basis is permitted, such as what happened after hurricane katrina).  and this may not be temporary.  please, read the article.  it’s a little eye opening.   then, consider this.  in just the last week or two, our financial systems have gone insane.  just bloody nuts.  people are freaking out everywhere.  interestingly enough, we aren’t really hearing about this in the news, but people are committing suicide and murder left and right.  and suddenly, a few minor articles pop up about how the financial crisis is, in fact, driving people crazy.  please, take a quick look at these two articles that came up yesterday.on comcaston cnn   those on high are beginning to wonder when this lovely powder keg of a nation is going to go pop.    now, just ponder, if you will, how convenient it is that a nice little military brigade has been deployed within the us border.  how lucky it is that we have fema and its little camps.  and start to think how much of a surprise this financial crisis was.  was it?  or, is this just another piece of the puzzle, of the plan.  is this just another fabulous example of the damnation of the people brought on by those in charge.  are we getting a$sf*cked again, against our will?you tell me.labels: apocalypse, conspiracies, fema, fight club, malach's assless chaps, red dawn

	 its been awhile.....
    


...so, its been a while.  about 10 months.  sorry, folks.  but i think i can get back in the game.  i've got lots of changes to make, and actual work to do, and i'll do it.  however, i've been inspired by warren ellis, and his site, which is now a daily addiction for me.   i think i'll follow suit.so, today's fun facts in.....conspiracies:you know i love it when conspiracies abound!!!  thanks to justme on the wand of wonder for this link.  now, go here and learn!!!science:probably the most amazing thing i've seen in a while, this island near the ivory coast is like the galapagos, has species of flora and fauna that exist nowhere else, and looks like that planet that ren and stimpy got stranded on!  go look!and, along with that, we have the eye of the earth!  creepythinking about the future, here's the long now foundation, and the 10,000 year clock.  get some goddamn perspective people.  a good point was made on this site, which i'll paraphrase:  remember the last 30 - 50 - 80 years, people talked about 'in the year 2000...'  there'll be flying cars.  we'll all be rich.  robots will work for us.  blah blah.  we'll, we've passed the year 2000, and no one has a future date to think of.  there is no 'in the year 2025...'   nothing.  we need a concept of future.  i feel that awareness has improved immensely in my time on this planet.  people actually think about our impact on the world, the ecosystem, the future.  but not enough!!!  we need to bring this back.  so, apparently this clock will do that! the long now also has a great links page which i'll delve into.  and, this fantastic essay by brian eno, which inspired the whole foundation, apparently.  which also brings us to the longplayer, an installation that plays music, and will play music for the entire millenia, and never repeat itself.  i know what i'm going to listen to when i get home.aliens:aliens are coming to set everything right.  no, really! i'm sitting here all obsessed with december 21, 2012, and all the while i should've been paying attention to october 14, 2008.  one day to go....what's that, you ask?  why, yes:   they're coming tomorrow!!!art:the art of noticing - pay attention people!!!if a photo takes 100 years to reach exposure, you'll never get to see it.don't shoot the puppy - whatever you do, do not move!attack boston - now, i love graffiti, and i love the use of stickers for graffiti.  here's some fun one's i've been seeing around town.  enjoy.politics:acorn??  really????rightwing nutjobs get a voice too, right?  well, thanks to this chick, i've got the loverly pictures you see above and belowentertainment:in entertainment - i like that show heroes.  so, why does it suck now?  good ideas here.mike tyson exists.  that should be proof enough that this country went wrong.for daily reference, these freeks blog about everything, and every ten seconds!!!oh, yeah, and marsha brady.                         what?labels: acorn, aliens, brian eno, october 14 2008

	 consumer radicalism
    


i’ll use the line again. ‘never mind what they’re selling. it’s what you’re buying.’there is a way to do it. small ways in your day to day to not give your dollar to the man. and there are more and more ways opening up every day.if you’re like ol’ hobbsy here, you’re not a big fan of the big corporations that run our country. not a fan of the war for oil, and the insanely inflated gas prices. not a fan of the chemical-laden food that is mass produced and sold to you. (here’s some food for thought. we use manure in our gardens because it helps things grow. animal feces is good for plants. try using human feces, and it will kill everything. ever wonder why that is? perhaps its because animals like cows eat natural things like grass and corn, and humans eat mcdonalds and mountain dew and things that never would exist in nature). the corporate run american system is poisoning you and raping you of your hard earned dollars, and you and bending over, dropping trow, and sticking your wallet in your ass so they can easily do both. you are buying into what they’ve told you to.now ol’ hobbsy here does everything in his power to keep his hard earned dollars in the hands of his peers, rather than forking it all over to big business. granted, its relatively impossible to do this 100% of the time, but here are some of my methods that help me to sleep at night.gas: i do not give my money to exxon, mobil, shell, or any of the major companies. i simply refuse. the less people who give them money, the less they’ll have to charge for their stinking gasoline. look at the escalated gas prices, especially since that date i refuse to mention. there is no reason for it, except that they can. phone companies: here’s one of the most amazing scams they’ve come up with in some time. cell phones are all the rage, and these huge companies can pretty well charge you whatever they want, and rope you in with cool gadgetry. t-mobile, sprint, at&t. huge corporations who have cornered the market. or have they. ever heard of working assets? started in 1985 as a small company with ethics, working assets gives a portion of all income to various charities, such as greenpeace and doctors without borders. i’ve used them for 15 years. when i joined, you even got a pint of ben and jerry’s free each month for a year. they used to only do local phone, but now they do cell phones as well, and i’ve got a damn cool gadgety phone just like you! the company has raised over $50 million dollars for charitable organizations, and also promotes social activism. in each bill are a number of petitions that you can elect to add your name to, and various socially conscious books that you can buy if you’re interested. just add it to the bill. their website features act for change, the social activism portion where many political and social causes are featured so you can be informed and get involved. all this from a phone company. and my bill is no more than anyone else’s. organic food: folks, there are a few easy points i can make here. one is, take a look at the ingredients of many of the things that you consume. good god! what is all of that stuff? its chemicals, kiddies. things that man created in a lab. things that really have no place in food. soda like coke can rot through the dashboard of your car when spilled, but you drink it down into your sensitive little tummy. ever wonder why we can use animal manure to fertilize a garden, but human feces will kill all the plants? because there is nothing natural in there. ever wonder why so many americans are obese? there’s your answer fish bulb! and the almighty they only know what sort of mind control chemicals are used in pop-tarts, coke, lay’s potato chips, et al. let me tell you, once you start eating more natural foods, you can no longer enjoy these chemical cocktails. you can taste the filth. now, i know you are going to start whining at me about costs. yes, organic and natural foods are currently more expensive. why? because they are no longer the main staple, but a niche market. however, the more of us who purchase this sort of product, the cheaper it will get. the reason all that other food is so cheap is because there is no food in it! it is cheaply manufactured chemicals. and don’t complain that you can’t get your favorite products either, because you’ll find a brand of cookies just like oreo’s that aren’t just crap. support you local farmers and small mom and pop companies that are making real food. walmart: department stores make me sick, and walmart is the king of nausea. i can in no way give this company any of my money. i have been to a walmart once, only once, in the desperate need for a cheap vacuum. and i regret that to this day. we all know the poor practices of this company, and if you don’t, look it up. my hatred for walmart started with the censorship of music, as they only sell acceptable cd’s and alter cover art that they do not enjoy. people should never buy music from department stores. yes, its cheaper, generally, but they only sell certain things, and if everyone shopped at department stores, they’d put real record stores out of business, and you’d lose the ability to find interesting and experimental artists (yes, this argument is out of date with the internet and itunes, but i still feel it has validity). walmart is pure evil, and no one should ever shop there.folks, there are many other ways that you can refuse to support the big corporations, and i welcome your ideas. share them with me, and with others. fight back against the corporate government, and support your local businesses. use your dollar as a weapon. use every weapon you have. this is how we will reach true freedom.-hvw
