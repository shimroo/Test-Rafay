the city of chicago pipe band is a musical ensemble of bagpipers and drummers who strive to look good, sound good, and have a positive experience.

established in july 2003, we are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization consisting of three developmental levels:

• young beginners learn pipes or drums growing from students into players in our academy program

• players gain invaluable experience as performers and competitors with weekly instruction in our grade 4 ensemble

• experienced pipe band musicians are challenged to our highest standards in the flagship grade 2 ensemble
