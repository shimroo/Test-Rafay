your personal tailor
true quality knows no compromise. and in the case of a tailor-made suit, that means achieving a delicate balance of multiple critical details. each matched perfectly to the person who’ll be wearing it. because as well as fitting you, a tailor-made suit must also befit you.

what we do best
nothing is as personal as a suit. “if it doesn’t suit you, it’s not your suit.” or, as oscar wilde put it: “be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”
this is the reason why at domhoff travelling tailors we believe in personal contact. visiting your home or office, so we can we can provide the best possible advice. finding that perfect balance between the transitory nature of fashion, the timelessness of tradition and the stamp of your particular personality.
see you at your home or at your office.
