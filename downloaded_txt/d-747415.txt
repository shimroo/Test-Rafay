catch more fish!
the original b2 squid line of soft plastic fishing lures are based on the secret weapon commercial fishermen use.
whether you are looking for a saltwater lure, freshwater lure, halibut lure, salmon lure, marlin lure, bass lure or trout lure, the world famous original b2 squid line of soft plastic lures are for you.
these versatile lures are offered in 5 sizes and in a variety of colors including triple glow, one of the best glows on the market. they can be drifted, trolled or jigged for any number of different saltwater or freshwater game species.
successful techniques have included drifting the soft, lifelike, solid-bodied fishing lures on a spreader bar, trolling them behind a flasher along with chunk bait, and rigging them in a daisy chain. we offer our original b2 squid bodies ready for you to rig, or pre-rigged with hook or jig head.
