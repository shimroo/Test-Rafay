the best things in life have only one thing in common:
they are unique…
laserperformance



















































the cascais is the ultimate rotomolded multi–purpose sailing dinghy. its versatility and innovative design brings together exceptional handling, speed and stability allied with its spacious cockpit and 3 rig/ sail versions makes this the ideal platform for all levels of sailors. we believe that rotomolded boats can be fun and the cascais is the living proof of this.







the laser is the world’s most popular adult racing class boat. true to box one design standards, each laser in the world is identical ensuring the best sailor on the water wins the race, not the boat. the laser is a challenging boat that rewards athleticism, subtle steering and trimming techniques, as well as the tactical excellence of the sailor. the laser is raced by young and old alike from the club level all the way to the olympics. the laser comes standard as a race version







one of sailing’s best-known brands, it is unmatched in simplicity and performance making it popular for all ages and abilities. designed as the ultimate beach craft, this maintenance free boat holds its resale value thanks to its robust construction, highlighted by hard chines and a flat underbody. the sunfish can be stored almost anywhere and is a snap to car-top, making it a popular international class and easy to transport to your favourite beach for family fun.
