worship at the peoples church is both personal and communal, formal and informal, intimate and casual. we recognize that people come to worship god in both joy and pain, faith and doubt, with laughter and with tears. our worship incorporates both meditation and celebration. please know you are invited to participate in any and all ways you feel led. our songs, prayers, words and actions are the works of imperfect people trying to worship a perfect god.during non-summer months, our early service at 8:30 a.m. is in the intimate mccune chapel and holy communion is served each week. our 10:30 a.m. service is in the sanctuary and holy communion is served the first sunday of each month. children's sunday school is offered during the 10:30 a.m. service as well. you are invited to watch a sermon or take a look at a worship bulletin for a glimpse of our worship together.
