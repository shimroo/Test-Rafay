broken melodies and deep grooves: listening at the limits of cuban music in miami 





broken melodies and deep grooves.by celeste frazer delgadosuch is the case in an ongoing series of albums released by miami-based composer and 
violinist alfredo triff and a shifting roster of collaborators, including vocalists roberto poveda, 
laugart, and nuviola. from twenty-one broken melodies, all at once (2001) to miami untitled 
(2013), triff and his ensemble dismantle all that is “customary” in the bolero and reform the 
“tissue of cultural values” that makes up cuban love songs. a violinist trained at the national conservatory of music in havana from age seven and 
later at cuba’s superior institute of arts, triff left cuba during the 
mariel boatlift in 1980 and made his living playing with a number of traditional cuban dance bands 
in new york city. he also collaborated on more experimental projects with jazz impresario kip hanrahan, who produced twenty-one broken melodies for release on his american 
clave label. every instrument on twenty-one broken melodies can be said to have “grain”: limbs 
palpable in the bowing of strings, hands slapping congas, lips pursed on the saxophone. as the title suggests, the album breaks cuban melodies into fragments, which, in fact, play consecutively. on the opening track, “skies north,” triff’s poignant, sustained bowing sounds like 
accompaniment stripped from some unheard song. conga interludes throughout the album 
play like solos unmoored from dance numbers. on “la sitiera” (“the farm wife”), the shiver 
and pluck of triff’s violin competes with the deep-throated vocals of new york–based, afro- 
cuban singer laugart as she sings a farmer’s plea for his wife’s return. but the wife will not 
return, triff’s arrangement suggests, and these fragments of melodies will never knit together 
again. in the mid-1990s, triff moved to miami, where he established himself as a subtropical 
renaissance man, serving for several years as the art critic for the miami new times; earning 
a doctorate in philosophy at the university of miami and joining the faculty at miami dade 
college; and hosting tumiamiblog.com, where more than eighty contributors engage in a lively 
forum on miami arts, politics, and intellectual life, which, of course, extends to cuba and the 
cuban diaspora. 
since his move, the philosopher’s music has grown increasingly concerned with miami 
as a generative site. the cover of triff’s second album, boleros perdidos (lost boleros; 2006), 
features a photograph of the interstate 95 overpass above sw eighth street, little havana’s 
main thoroughfare. boleros perdidos began as a live performance in april 2002 at subtrop- 
ics, miami’s annual experimental music and sound art festival, and expanded in may of that 
year into a monthlong series of concerts at hoy como ayer. a song cycle after the tradition of 
european art song, where a composer sets a series of poems to music, usually for one singer, 
boleros perdidos was composed for roberto poveda, a cuban singer-songwriter who came 
to miami via colombia in the 1990s. the grain of the voice is palpable in poveda’s impressive 
repertoire of rasp: from a nearly clear voice with a tickle in the throat to an intimate whisper to a whisky-soaked confession, to exhaling smoke or gulping for air. these lost boleros are, in fact, the unmaking of the bolero. poveda’s persona agonizes 
over the memory of a woman lost. at times, he forgets her as he goes about his business 
(“olvido” [“forgetting”]); other times, he feels he is losing his mind (“delirio” [“delirium”]); alone, 
late at night, he sings to her (“miami 3:00 a.m.”). at times, female vocalists laugart or nuviola 
double his voice, like an unshakable memory. or they sing solo, warning the lover, “duda tus 
certezas sobre mi” (“di mi nombre” [“say my name”]) and reminding him that words say nothing: “la palabra no dice” (“palabra” [“word”]). in the last track, on what promises to be just 
another night, he believes that she has returned at last, only to force him to confess his own 
delusions: “cómo puede ser que no existas?” (“otra noche” [“another night”]). on triff’s next album, dadason (2009), the dismantling of popular cuban dance music 
heralds new possibilities as the alfredo triff trio simultaneously plays and unplays cuban son. 
on the title track, the violin issues an invitation to dance that is rescinded by bebop sax and 
dirgelike bass. on “dadaochun,” a mournful classical violin questions the conga’s worship of 
the afro-cuban deity of sensuality. on “la balsa de duchamp” (“duchamp’s raft”), the conga 
evokes yemaya, the deity of the ocean, while the violin, bass, and sax stutter and spit, never 
coalescing into a coherent groove. having thoroughly deconstructed the bolero and the son, twin pillars of the popular cuban 
musical tradition, triff’s miami untitled (2013) shifts the terrain definitely to miami. though the 
song’s lyrics remain in spanish, the titles are now in english. the instrumental interludes, 
untitled on earlier albums, now map south florida geography: “everglades eventides,” “i-95 
north,” “key west’s last light of day,” “cutler glides like the water into sparkle,” and “south 
beach shootout” (a delightful duel between two tenor saxophones). also in english, the cd 
jacket promises, “a love story from a sunny land of vice, broken dreams and obstinate exiles.” 
in this love story, triff claims most of the vocals for himself, sometimes joined by his wife, poet,  and actor rosie inguanzo, often in a spoken-word style. 
yet poveda and laugart return on key tracks. the album centerpiece, “abusé (if you only 
knew how much i lied to you),” features poveda in an extended confession of his infidelity 
over a lively cuban son-jazz, punctuated again by triff’s shivering violin. a video for “abusé,” 
directed by luis soler, debuted at hoy como ayer in july 2014, along with live performance 
by triff and his collaborators of songs from his entire discography. soler’s video draws from 
surrealist conventions of juxtaposition, most notably using the slicing of pig flesh to suggest 
a gruesome punishment for the singer’s infidelities. but in a reversal of the singer’s admission 
of philandering as macho privilege, the video shows triff himself as cuckold, his wife inguanzo 
acting the part of philanderer, while her husband sits beside the bed, stirring his whiskey in 
resignation. 
over an insistent saxophone and conga riff, inguanzo listens to a confession by triff/poveda, 
whose images are interchanged throughout the conversation. the woman insists that the man/ 
men clarify what abusive acts he/they has/have committed. as the music swells, then stops, 
she laughs at his vague transgressions: “tu conciencia está maltrecha.” after a half-century of mutual accusations, forced confessions, and renunciations, laughter defeats the assignation of guilt. the litany of who abused whom is lost in a confusing swirl of shifting images.

how hernan bas pokes fun at conceptualism 





conceptual artist #20, (performance-based acting as his own receiver, he's seeking a signal from the airwaves for over a decade), 2023.alfredotriffhernan bas's show, the conceptualists at the bass museum of art, is an exciting spectacle.  conceptual artconceptual art refers to various artistic practices from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, emphasizing the concept (or idea) instead of the physical art object. since conceptual artists are considered art theorists, we need to unpack the theory.  a reference theory of meaning ... claims that the meaning of a word or expression lies in what it points out in the world. however, for this reference to become art, we need this "pointing out" to become aesthetic. then, one can say: art is the concept behind it. this is shown here in a rather direct and crude manner (chair, photo of the chair, and explanation appear as a whole). let's call this a first-order reference. "chair" (the thing + the thing's photo + the explanation) is the art/concept.conceptual art comes in different flavors. bas uses a second-order reference flavor. he presents the art/concept (first-order reference) and subverts it by folding it.  how? make it bounce onto itself.  the foldingin the conceptualists, the protagonist and his alter ego undergo a series of "conceptual tasks," which appear banal and purposeless. according to plan, this conceptual maneuver loops onto itself, pointing to its ultimate world referent: the artist, bas himself.  the folding happens via the painting's title. above, you see a painting minus its title. boxing is reduced to pillow fighting. the reference to the world is already there. but without the title, there's no reference folded back onto itself. we need some context. czech theorist jan mukařovský has an interesting thesis. what we take as "banal" remains a suspect choice precisely because of its preassumed hierarchy. mukařovský counsels looking at neglected things differently, that is, as (potential) redeeming notes, legitimate subjects of aesthetic investigation. use these glasses to look at bas' show. conceptual artist #36 (his site-specific wall drawings are created after a night's sleep in purportedly haunted locations), 2023let's take the painting above. the artist breaks from working on a crayon drawing on the wall (a bit of trompe l'oeil adds a certain je ne sais quoi). for now, observe how title and painting do not necessarily coalesce. they perform a conceptual dance. it's daytime (the semi-opened window proves it). the artist sits, hands dirty, on a disheveled bed. the reddish drawings are glued to the wall underneath the superimposition of the crayon drawing. he looks outside the painting (the painter? or the observer?). nah. he's self-absorbed. according to the title, does he just have this thing of doing site-specific art in purportedly haunted locations? weird. keep in mind mukarovsky (things are not what they seem). radical distancinghere comes ortega gasset's lesson in the dehumanization of art:the creators of new art give their works a dehumanized aesthetic by radically distancing themselves from the "lived" reality ... their daily existence (objects, spaces, living beings, inorganic beings): it is this radical distance in the gaze that allows them to make the leap from the "lived" reality to the "contemplated" reality.what's the radical distance? in phenomenology, "distance" means a lack of presence. from the perspective of conceptual art, one could retort that a lack of presence presupposes presence. using ortega's favorite metaphor, missing the trees from the forest presupposes the former. the retort from conceptual art: what if presence is absent? one can see a tree and yet miss it altogether. we need conceptual glasses. conceptual art comes in different flavors.  conceptual artist #18 (spirited for urban legends, he fabricates roadside memorials from which to hitchhike), 2023bas's painting title (above) suggests the hitchhiker standing at a "fabricated" memorial. is this young man really hitchhiking or—judging his demeanor—"posing," as it were? it looks too perfect: the trees, the clean, well-paved, sinuous road—is it really raining? the more one looks, the more open-ended everything seems. this conceptual maneuver is richer (and more fun) than kosuth's late 1960s modus operandi. bas' maneuver is so sleek and slippery that, in the end, one (after much cerebration) accepts the insoluble dissonance of conceptual back and forth. conceptual artist #24, (his multidisciplinary works are cultivated from the periodic table), 2023doesn't conceptual artist #24 folded-on-self mise-en-scène seem obvious? the artist's (bas') empty performance fulfills itself by automatically emptying itself—what ortega calls dehumanized, "contemplated" reality. his conceptual artist #28 recalls a passage from fin de siecle french in literature and sensibility, falling for the conceptual trap 😂someone by the name of douglas markowitz covered the show for the miami new times. here's a paragraph: every piece in "the conceptualists" engages in the melodramatic yet ridiculously unserious artistic discipline that one usually sees in parodies of the art world like the square or velvet buzzsaw. they all look somewhat alike, all possessing the same slim, androgynous build and gaunt complexion that has become a hallmark of bas' paintings. obvious craftsmanship and attention to detail aside, the series presents something rare in contemporary art: classically inclined, representational work meant to be purely funny.  let's see: 1. every piece?  2. melodramatic yet ridiculously unserious artistic discipline. 3. classically inclined, representational work meant to be purely funny.markowitz, leaving these puerile reductive concoctions aside, what are you talking about? conceptual artist #21 (his formative work, "prom night," marked the beginning of a career of works based on acts of disappointment), 2023doing the dirty workhere's a photo of bas in his studio (via the new times). it looks like he's actually "doing" the dirty work of painting faces, hands, flowers, balloons, etc. not outsourcing it! bas's art has grown technically and conceptually. he is not in 1894, amidst the apotheosis of nineteenth-century l'art pour l'art (oscar wilde still walking down tite street in chelsea, sane and free). stoically (decadents are stoic),  he adapts to our dull postmodern reality. the themes of the early 2000s reappear, but bas' self-referential mal du siecle appears filtered by a skillful—if florid at times—self-parody. his alter ego is now protean, witty, and less obviously effeminate.titlingconceptual artist #3 (chewing gum every working hour of the day, he considers "bubblegum alley" his archive)lastly, bas' paintings would not work without his titling style. take the painting above as an example: we see the artist blowing up a bubblegum ball and walls collaged with bubblegum. the title describes what the artist does and then reveals his objective—an over-the-top plan that throws off the balance between signified and signifier.(this last painting is bas's smorgasboard)  👇

¿qué significa ser un insecto?







alfredotriff"eres un insecto" es una diatriba. entomón: algo cortado en pedazos, parte artrópodo, ente rápido, sinuoso o volador, o anfibio, alimaña. la selección natural los ha multiplicado y son imprescindibles para el género de los vertebrados y por consiguiente para el balance del ecosistema. aunque nuestra existencia depende de ellos los consideramos como intrusos.
¿cómo imaginar un insecto? ¿cuál es su ser?
sartre separa el l'être pour soi exclusivamente para el ser humano. el l'être en soi (ser-en-sí) es designado como sans nuance, para la cosa. ¿y los animales y las plantas? heidegger repasa tres órdenes en los conceptos fundamentales de la metafísica: el humano o dasein,  formador-de-mundos (weltbildend), la cosa queda sin-mundo (weltlos) y el reino animal y vegetal relegados a pobre-en-mundo (weltarm). 
la ontología occidental está permeada de un antropomorfismo acrítico, incluso indolente. 
el primer obstáculo es que no somos insectos. kafka exploró la metamorfosis de gregor samsa, pero el análisis kafkiano termina presentándonos una cucaracha humana:

sintió sobre el vientre un leve picor, con la espalda se deslizó lentamente más cerca de la cabecera de la cama para poder levantar mejor la cabeza; se encontró con que la parte que le picaba estaba totalmente cubierta por unos pequeños puntos blancos, que no sabía a qué se debían, y quiso palpar esa parte con una pata, pero inmediatamente la retiró, porque el roce le producía escalofríos.debemos ir no "abajo" a la cucaracha, sino arriba, a lo abstracto que de común existe entre el insecto y el humano a nivel general del reino animal.
clarice lispector en la pasión según gh ofrece otra mirada:

la cucaracha con la materia blanca me miraba. no sé si me veía. no sé lo que ve una cucaracha. pero ella y yo nos mirábamos y tampoco sé lo que una mujer ve. lispector admite que no sabe cómo mira el insecto, pero que tampoco sabe como mira una mujer. en cuanto a mirada se trata equipara ambas miradas, ambas enigmas. ¿qué hay detrás de la mirada? es un problema difícil de franquear. 

pero si sus ojos no me veían su existencia me existía - en el mundo primario donde yo había entrado, los seres existen a los otros como forma de verse. y en ese mundo que yo estaba conociendo, hay varias formas que significan ver: uno mira al otro sin verlo, uno posee al otro, uno come al otro, uno está sólo en un rincón y el otro está allí también: todo eso también significa ver. la cucaracha no me miraba con los ojos sino con el cuerpo.en efecto, los ojos de la cucaracha pueden ver 360º a la redonda y contienen cerca de 2,000 lentes lo que les permite ver muchas cosas a la vez. del mismo modo no podemos leer la mente de otro ser humano, solo su comportamiento. la conclusión de que la cucaracha ve con el cuerpo es atrevidamente fenomenológica. la mirada puede tocar las cosas. lispector no tiene cuita de rechazar el insecto y examinar su propio rechazo. así deja atrás "siglos y siglos en el lodo". 

lo que yo veía era la vida mirándome. cómo llamar de otro modo a aquello horrible y crudo, materia prima y plasma seco, que estaba allí, mientras yo retrocedía hacia dentro de mí en naúsea seca, yo cayendo siglos y siglos en el lodo -era lodo y ni siquiera lodo ya seco sino lodo aún húmedo y aún vivo, era un lodo donde se movían con lentitud insoportable las raíces de mi identidad. 
con todo el ejercicio lispectoriano está lleno de obstáculos (incluso en esa difícil heterología que emmanuel levinas plantea en la cara del ser humano en tu totalidad e infinito). y surge la pregunta:

¿tiene cara una cucaracha?
la cara levinasiana no puede ser solo identidad. de serlo el acercamiento al otro que defiende el filósofo francés no sería más que un narcicismo solapado. por ello derrida criticaba esa idea ética de totalidad en levinas (en su ensayo violencia y metafísica): 

hay que tener cuidado con esto: este tema de la tautología concreta (no-formal) o de la falsa heterología (finita), este tema difícil se propone bastante discretamente al comienzo de totalidad e infinito ... si la negatividad (trabajo, historia, etc.) no contiene jamás relación con lo otro, si lo otro no es la simple negación de lo mismo, entonces ni la separación ni la trascendencia metafísica se piensan bajo la categoría de la negatividad. aquí llega la conclusión:  

de la misma manera que -lo veíamos más arriba- la simple consciencia interna no podría, sin la irrupción de lo totalmente otro, darse el tiempo y la alteridad absoluta de los instantes, así también el yo no puede engendrar en sí la alteridad sin el encuentro del otro.es decir, el horizonte heterológico nos está limitado estructuralmente. nunca puedo ser (absolutamente) otro.
lo que no inplica que no pueda serlo bastante.

tengo una cuenta que saldar con el gobierno





alfredotriffla última semana ha sido la hecatombe. no puedo hilvanar las ideas. la culpa la tiene la gramática. somos el pueblo. me siento como si estuviera en un pantano. las palabras flotan pero no se amalgaman. no se hacen oraciones, rebotan y se rechazan. yo soy el sujeto. lo que hago es el verbo. en este calabozo es el complemento directo. oigo mucho ruido y me está volviendo loco. me llevaron a un salón lleno de gente. me acusaron. son verbos, ¿no? ella me acusa. una jueza. una vieja abogada me quiere aconsejar. me habla de la pena de muerte. la muerte es el sustantivo. el gobierno, otro. el sustantivo quiere engañarme y hacerse pasar por verbo: matar. me llamo jared. tengo un uniforme naranja. naranja es palabra y también sustantivo y adjetivo. una fruta. la naranja mecánica de jared. le disparé a un montón de gente. un disparo en la mente de gabrielle. matar la mente. matar me sabe a menta. quieren cambiar la fonética, el peso de la gramática. la tiranía política. matar el verbo. el genocidio. el abecedario del voto. ¡el voto que presida con el verbo! yo soy jared, un sujeto que recuerda. llamé a ben y me despedí. en facebook escribí "goodbye friends". pasé por casa de michelle. necesitaba hablar con el verbo del verbo. gabrielle es el diablo. pienso que es hora de acabar con el gobierno. ¡qué infierno! no, dije: wassup. michelle se viró y apunté a la cabeza. no. solo la saludé. pero ya no me fio de ella. estoy solo. somos el pueblo. ahora recuerdo. a las 11:35 p.m. dejé un rollo de negativos en walgreens. estaba extenuado, afín a la víctima, buscando la lógica. llené el tanque de gasolina y alquilé una habitación en un motel. a la 1:45 a.m. manejando a casa de los viejos me tropecé de nuevo con michelle. es amable, pero no es confiable. quien confía se olvida, se distrae, se despista. de ahí la duda, luego el disparate, el engaño, luego la culpa y por último, el delito. la constitución no se equivoca jamás. nos convoca a cumplir. asumir qué somos. por ahí viene tierney. pobre tierney, al menos sabía de gramática. tierney es el pretérito perfecto junto a la preposición simple. un día le hablé de la constitución y me dijo: "no me interesa la cuestión, ni la política". en conclusión: un verbo que no existe. lo llamé tarde. estaba triste: soy jared. we had some good times together. peace, out.volví a walgreens a ver si tenían mis fotos. vi el reloj de la tienda (a menos que no hubiera un reloj en la tienda). pero ahí estaba, redondo con el borde negro. lo hube de ver a las 2:19 a.m. regresé al motel muy cansado y me metí en la cama. me hube de despertar sobresaltado. ¿habrían sido las 4:11 a.m.? fueron las 4:12. son las 4:13. vuelvo a facebook. subo las fotos: goodbye friends. necesito balas. a las 7 a.m. pasé por walmart. vuelvo a las 7:04. creo que allí compré el backpack y más municiones. o no fue allí. hube de comprar las balas a las 7:04 a.m. prefiero el pluscuamperfecto. me hubo de parar un policía. hube de decirle: "disculpe oficial". nada de interjecciones. nada de exclamaciones. nada de contracciones. el verbo evita las convulsiones. de momento, hubo de aparecerse el viejo. jodiendo como siempre. serían las 8 a.m. hubo de imperar el qué: que dónde estaba anoche, que qué me pasa, qué me creo, que voy a terminar enfermando a la vieja. contra el estado del qué presento la rebelión del no. le dije que no entiende, que no entendía. no es sólido en sus creencias. no comprende la importancia de la gramática. no repudia al gobierno. no es un patriota. me quiso lastimar. lo empujé fuerte: you’re full of shit! lo dejé cacareando. el sujeto tiene que llegar. el predicado con el verbo debe luchar.son las 9 a.m. somos el pueblo. estoy solo, tranquilo. todo está listo: tengo 31 balas con dos peines, un cuchillo, mi tarjeta de crédito, la licencia de conducir y $55 en la cartera. voy caminando cabizbajo, pensando y sopesando la verdad: matar al diablo. llamo al taxi. llamé al taxi. hube de llamar al taxi. ya llega. son las 9:41. we are the people. tengo una cuenta que saldar con el gobierno.

operáticos y sinfónicos, las vicisitudes del estreno de wozzeck de berg y kleiber en la habana 





cartel de jan lenica, 1970alfredotriffla capital europea se hunde en el gris siniestro, voces lejanas de batallones camisas-carmelita agitan al populacho. wozzeck fue mi ópera favorita antes de escucharla en vivo. no debía serlo, si se compara con otras que conozco casi de memoria de haberlas tocado tantas veces en “el foso” del teatro nacional. por ejemplo la tríada verdiana de los años 70 de la ópera nacional: “traviata”, “rigoletto” y “il trovattore”... o “tosca” de puccini. ¿bel canto? jóvenes al fin, nos divertíamos denostando el género. mofarse del bel canto era una moda y teníamos razones. la técnica de cantar engolado no parecía natural. invento florentino barroco/temprano de ideólogos aristocráticos, ese afán dramático se nos antojaba cogido con alfileres. cuánto tiempo perdido escuchando a compositores como lully, schütz y purcell —el mejor de los tres. jugaban ellos con técnicas dramáticas prescritas y soluciones greco-romanas abigarradas. todo tiene su explicación. a principios de los 2000 convoqué una discusión con dos connoisseurs ya desaparecidos: el doctor y sicoanalista juan márquez y el conocido abogado y pedagogo rolando amador. ambos miembros destacados del ambiente musical habanero de los años 50 tempranos*. aprendí que la habana tenía dos claques: los operáticos y los sinfónicos. los segundos desestimaban a los primeros como aficionados de segunda. ¿por qué? en la ópera la música es esclava del drama, pero no hay ni drama ni música. por lo fragmentado del resultado, por su hibridez, la ópera es “estructuralmente femenina” (pronunciaba el psicoanalista márquez); “... lo sinfónico, masculino”.** einen moment, bitte. los sinfónicos, sin saberlo, tenían las de perder: mozart, genio del género sinfónico era un fanático de la ópera italiana (¿habría ópera moderna sin “don giovanni”?). el dios sinfónico, beethoven, tiene a “fidelio”, compuesta ya en su madurez (si bien deploró la experiencia llamándola “un verdadero martirio”). schubert, figura cimera del sturm und drang tiene dos óperas (algo que conocen pocos músicos, pues casi no se tocan). aquí entra la figura de erich kleiber***, director de la orquesta de la ópera de berlín (staadtsoper berlin) hasta 1935, cuando abandona alemania. el célebre director terminó, por suerte para nosotros los cubanos, dirigiendo la orquesta sinfónica nacional (1943-1947).carpentier, kleiber y lam en la habana, años 40volvamos a la cena, cuando amador menciona el nombre de un cierto dr. sastre, profesor de derecho de la universidad de la habana por los años 40, musicólogo amateur y amigo personal de kleiber. fast forward a principio de los 60 cuando sastre —ahora defenestrado por los camisas-verde-olivo fidelistas, conversa con amador en la mansión tipo neomudéjar del primero, llena de perros, con enormes matas de mango y aguacate, en la calle castro en guanabacoa. kleiber compartió con sastre el meollo del estreno de la primera y única puesta en escena de wozzeck de alban berg en aquel berlín de la decadente república de weimar. las luchas de kleiber luchando con los músicos del teatro, el insoportable empresario nachod. los amigos del círculo de berg: el arquitecto adolf loos, jakob wassermann (novelista y editor de simplicissimus) y el compositor edmund eisler, que le cambiaron la vida. el apoyo incondiconal de schoenberg durante los ensayos. los chismes del amorío de mathilde (la mujer del padre del dodecafonismo) y el talentoso y suicida richard gerstel. los buenos ratos después del ensayo compartiendo cerveza negra en un bar de mala muerte donde tocaba el prodigioso violinista gitano abrai nicolescu, asesinado por la gestapo en 1939. ¡sólo serán tres ensayos! nachod llorando miseria, accidentes inesperados de tramoya, los cantantes olvidando las letras, el trompicón del barítono leo schützendorf (interpretando el papel principal) un día antes de la función. ¿y la noche del estreno? un público escaso, aunque vehemente. la presencia de los schoenberg, los berg, los webern (y sus respectivos alumnos), un karl krauss muy enfermo y el séquito de alexader von zemlinsky (mentor de schoenberg), quien había viajado desde viena para el estreno. wozzeck resultó un éxito.**** a través de aquella vívida experiencia del estreno de wozzeck, sastre revivió una época perdida para siempre. el cuento de sastre adquirió otra dimensión en una audición privada de wozzeck (mi primer gran encuentro con alban berg) con la orquesta sinfónica de ny con dimitri mitropoulos, en el estudio del segundo piso de la casa de mi maestro de violín radosvet boyadyief en el cerro. un invierno de 1981 decidí pagar una entrada costosa y escuchar la ópera por primera vez en vivo con la metropolitan opera bajo la dirección de james levine.kein haber fresse sie, kein wasser saufe sie.____________* la discoteca de música clásica de juan márquez en su apartamento de l y 23 tenía más de dos mil acetatos. tuve la oportunidad de esuchar muchos discos en esa colección durante los años 70 en la biblioteca nacional. el cuño rezaba: discoteca del dr. juan márquez.  **no hay homofobia en esta declaración. márquez era abierto de mente y lacaniano de entrenamiento. el crítico de arte miamense carlos luis, amigo nuestro de la época y miembro confesado de la claque sinfónica, compartía esta idea. *** erich kleiber no era judío. abandona alemania porque estaba desencantado con la política cultural de entartete musik. kleiber se inaugura en la habana el 25 de marzo de 1943, en el teatro auditórium dirigiendo la eroica de beethoven. el 19 de noviembre de 1944, kleiber inicia los llamados “conciertos populares de los domingos”, dirigidos a estimular el disfrute de la música entre un número creciente de espectadores. entre 1943 y el 24 de marzo de 1947 kleiber dirigió 80 conciertos al frente de la orquesta filarmónica de la habana, y 40 fueron primeras audiciones o estrenos.**** wozzeck inagura el camino atonal de berg desencadenando la revolución imprevista del dodecafonismo. berg representa el lado lírico de esa revolución.

yanke ¿qué fuéso? le dijte al carro ese. ñó qué mielda. tomaste demasiado. te lo dije. oye, tate tranquila que no es ná. no a pasao ná. mira el toyota ese, le apachurrajte el costao. al carro de nojotro no le pasó ná. no te baje. acabajte con ese, mira, tiene un asiento de niño atrá. ¡ay yanke! dale, móntate ya mujen, móntateeeeeee. sal de'pacio plis. ese es el carro de una mujen. ¿y qué? seguro que la tipa tiene seguro. ¿seguro? ¿no viste el asientico de niño ejcachao? oye, no joda máj yuneivi. ¿qué tú quiere? ¿que llame a la dueña a ven si baja y que me arrodille a pedíle peldón? ¡pa’qué bebijte tanto coño! yanke, contigo siempre ej lo mijmo. ah, no jodaj maj.
siguen gritando como locos. al rato cunde el silencio. por arte de magia yuesneivi piensa en esa madre que no podrá llevar a su hijo a la escuela al día siguiente. no se imagina que las probabilidades del universo concuerdan en su derivativa infinita en esa esquina de la 125 y la 14: dos mujeres con la misma entrevista en la agencia al día siguiente, y solo una de ellas obtendrá el puesto.

la habana, leo, dos encores, 1977





alfredotriffaño 1977: leo brower acaba de tocar el concierto de aranjuez para guitarra de joaquín rodrigo con la orquesta sinfónica nacional, dirigida por manuel duchesne cuzán. los aplausos son atronadores. después de dos salidas apresuradas, leo regresa acompañado por el director regordete (pareciera más un funcionario que un músico). saludan y acto seguido desaparecen por el lateral izquierdo. aumentan los aplausos, prolongandose por medio minuto. aparece entonces la delgada figura, vestida de negro, cuello de tortuga, pantalones campanas y botines lustrosos. se dirige al centro del escenario. la carota de pómulos salientes y labios gruesos adornada con espejuelotes negros de carey. pelo largo, negro y brillante. manos largas de dedos refinados acariciando el instrumento delicadamente. leo no toca la guitarra como otros virtuosos del momento: yepes parece violarla, julian bream la porta como si lo incomodara, john williams la exhibe cual condecoración militar. otro negocio con leo, embrollándose al maderamen, tanteando la tablazón entre pecho, rodilla y pierna. el brazo derecho se mueve como si dirigiera una sección invisible de violines; la mano pendiente de cada traste y rápidos ajustes a la clavija. afina. silencio absoluto. pespuntea los acordes del arreglo suyo de la fille aux chevaux de lin de debussy (tan original como el de heifetz para violín y piano). le sigue la melancólica la plus que lente. ahora leo otorga al silencio tanta importancia como el sonido. entre frase y frase, delicada cascada modal a lo escala slendro; elegancia neoclásica cerca del diapasón, y sul ponticello de pronta casi aleatoria de son montuno broweriano. la música fluye, cada frase pensada, cada nota cristalina. el intérprete desafía la gravedad y se eleva hacia las nubes, fuera de la habana gris y apuntalada, de represiones y concentraciones multitudinarias. a no ser por alguna que otra débil tos contagiosa, parece quevedianamente que soñamos. aquella noche y aquel encore brower-debussy, entre sacro y profano de notas arcanas y alquimia decimonónica en la oscuridad del teatro pudo ser la escena de éxtasis musical en una simple tela vetusta y oscura, imaginada por eugène carrière.

la pirámide de "guiza" y la esencia de lo conceptual  





alfredotriff¿que era el orinal de duchamp arte antes de ser “fuente”? aquí no se permiten truquitos. arte es investidura. la firma lo confirma. no todo firmante es artista y no todo artista firmante hace buen arte. el único vestigio de intención en el caso de “fuente” es la firma: “r. mutt” (que por cierto, no es el nombre de duchamp, sino la marca del orinal). in fact, firmar la firma de otro es una “falsificación” conceptual, que en 1917 resultó un acontecimiento llano. ya no. el paradigma del objet-trouvé duchampiano consiste en pleno movimiento: hacer arte al instante. de ahí que t. lapiza, artista conceptual (internacionalmente reconocido) presente su última obra, “guiza”. ¡sorpresa!, la galería david zwirner de nueva york presenta solo paredes desnudas. de acuerdo al dueño de la galería, “guiza” es una “representación mental de la esencia de la pirámide construida en 2,600 a.c. por mastaba de hemiunu”. ¡otra pirueta del conceptualismo! no hablamos de la pirámide real, tampoco una representación visual de la misma via foto video o pintura. se trata de la idea primigenia de la estructura.  un curador del instituto de arte de chicago ha expresado:resulta frustrante exigirle al público pararse frente a paredes en blanco imaginando algo tan abstracto como un poliedro macizo con base de 230 metros y ápice de 146 metros”.  sin embargo, la exhibición ha sido un éxito. el crítico pete wells ya reservó una hora para disfrutar la pieza él solo (el precio de la reserva, de acuerdo al brochure de la galería, es de $500 por 10 minutos y $1,000 por media hora durante los weekends de 9-11:59 am).         una pregunta importante. ¿cómo se colecciona “guiza”? el contrato de venta por 5 millones de dólares estipula que el dueño debe comprometerse a proveer un aposento de no menos de 20 metros cuadrados pintado de blanco pantone, 11-0206 tcx que aloje la pieza. el segundo acápite del contrato descarta cualquier intento de mentalización que no sea esencial a la pieza. ¿y qué significa esencial en el caso de “guiza”?el conjunto de propiedades de la pirámide sin las cuales la estructura no sería lo que es.¿y cómo medir "esencialidad"?mejor hagamos un recuento de lo que esa idea no podría ser: 1. una imagen de la pirámide tal y como se conoce el día de hoy. 2. la reproducción mental de una representación de la misma, sea via foto, video, ilustración o pintura.  3. cualquier idea que incluya un objeto o persona junto a la pirámide.lapiza incluso descarta el nombre de la pirámide como algo esencial a la misma. “guiza” ciertamente pudo haber sido bautizada con otro nombre. imaginemos que un faraón (mucho después de la muerte de keops) decide cambiar el nombre de la estructura de “guiza” a “eiptis”.  por cierto, “guiza” no está exenta del mismo problema de la conocida paradoja de teseo.asoma entonces la posibilidad que “giza” siempre existió hasta que un ente específico la imaginara. después de todo, la pirámide, siendo una figura geométrica es un a priori independiente de la grosera experiencia humana del cada día. volviendo al asunto de autoría. ¿no dice plotino en enéadas que "la forma existe en sí y por sí misma"?  guiza no es la única pirámide existente (aunque es la más grande y famosa). y si “giza” pudo haber sido concebida por más de una persona, ¿existe un autor único? hay algo aparentemente absurdo en que  “giza” sea coextensiva con cualquier posibilidad mental de manifestación. para llevarlo al límite, “giza” no existe como tal solo por haber sido concebida por alguien. existe, en tanto que posibilidad de ser pensada. y es por ello que de hemiunu la concibió, tal y como aparece arriba en la foto.

la dialéctica del humo







ivan cañás, lezama con tabaco, 1969. 
alfredotriff(este post fue publicado en noviembre 2010, lo traigo de nuevo por una conversación anoche, entre amigos, con tapas, alcohol y humo). abajo, lean el primer comentario a este artículo, del propio iván, ahora en otras esferas.___________________________
no se pierdan la exhibición lezáma inédito, de fotos de iván cañas en la main gallery del miami dade college, wolfson campus, salto directo a 1969 en la máquina del tiempo.

acercarse a la intimidad de lezama no era fácil. se narraba la subida por la escalinata hacia el orbe  hermético, sanctum sanctorum de la matriz origenista, recóndita e íntima biblioteca de tomos arcaicos, urna sacra de la fumarada, pupila insomne del oráculo. pero ni tanto, e iván cañas lo demuestra. el ojo curioso, invitador, intuitivo, aleatorio, buscando el esplín psicológico del sujeto. pero este no es lógico, sino poético, y en este caso el lente resbala. lo dicho no disminuye la labor del ojo que tira. cañas conspira, su sujeto tiene otros planes. lezama está cerca, demasiado. cañas ha dado con lo fortuito, y eso es "potente oportunidad, don exquisito".* el punctum de la camera lucida.

comprendase el límite que nos ocupa. siempre habrá distancia uno-y-otro, él-y-yo, sujeto-y-objeto, para eso son dueto. el problema de la foto es otro, ¿su dilema?, no-ser innata. ser es la cara redonda, frente de madrugada, de pelo cano rizo con brillantina, labios de película, patricia mirada, nariz gentilicia y bigote cuidado oliendo a café y tabaco. no-ser es el reverso del universo, osamenta del alfiler.

reducir la separación entre colón y refugio a su mínima expresión, "espíritu en fronesis",  melao del limen. de la parábola poética –el himen. nada fácil. ¿el lente? es invasión, pero estas imágenes cañeras presentan a lógos guiando el retículo. dixit, "ver como un buey" necesita un vehículo. o mejor, la presunta oposición tornándose sin trasdoblo de santos: lezama se mira en sí diáfano desde la luneta de cañas.¿cómo sabemos? un cierto espíritu otro transmuta el humo del tabac en pluma bucal. de ahí emana el alma del fondo. el asunto radica en la esencia del puro, la dialéctica del humo. cañas consigue entreabrir la vanidad espumosa envuelta en virutas "cual araña sonrosada que se traga el humo". 

hay una secuencia, mi preferida, de estos retratos deliberados fortuitos cañeros, en la que lezama cala el foco. o mejor, seduce y estimula el ¡click!, justo en el montuno de la película. el poeta, empero, se defiende, tabaco en mano, contra el báculo del tuerto –el imprescindible tabaco le sirve de escudo cilíndrico, de ejercicio patricio, de defensa ruy lópez. ¿de qué huye? sin duda, de sí mismo, del an-sich acullá del objeto pululando las esquinas habaneras, la sospecha del no-ser del todo 69 –tan solo 365 días, luego de la gran ofensiva. es entonces que el zumo nicotínico abre la llave y arranca del olvido la mirada inmanente y breviaria. sonríe el poeta e improvisa a tropel, extemporáneo e incoativo, nervio en excurso, discurso del éter.
cañas capta el mejor de los lezamas, sin estruendo, sin estupor, sin frenesí. el lezama absorto en la aléthëia de efímera bocanada, ligamento del tendón del verbo, la máscara de la fumada, batuta cromática de la mano orográfica. el lezama libresco en su castillo del morro, en su estancia de los vivos/muertos, de su ecclesia mística, de su consulado de virtudes._________________________
*las palabras entre comillas son tomadas de obras lezamianas diversas. lezama inédito, muestra de iván cañas,
centre gallery (edificio 1, 3er piso, salón 1365)
wolfson campus, 300 ne second ave.
hasta diciembre 17, 2010.
