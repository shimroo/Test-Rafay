the massachusetts senior medicare patrol (smp) program is part of a national initiative with a mission to reach, educate and counsel medicare and medicaid beneficiaries, family members, and caregivers on preventing, detecting, and reporting healthcare errors, fraud, and abuse. the ma smp program works in partnership with governmental, non-governmental, statewide, and local agencies, community-based and grassroots organizations, and a corps of dedicated and trained volunteers to activate consumers to become better engaged in their healthcare.
the ma smp program has the capacity to educate and counsel diverse populations across the state on the importance of understanding their health benefits and how to detect and report irregularities with their medicare summary notices, explanation of benefits, and medical billing statements. healthcare errors, fraud, and abuse not only cost american taxpayers billions of dollars annually but can have devastating health outcomes.
