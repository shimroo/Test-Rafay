there is a dreamy spell which hangs over this little valley.


-john preston arthur
located high in the blue ridge mountains of western north carolina, valle crucis continues to draw people as much today as it did in john preston arthur’s time. that spell cast long ago still lives on in the valle with an atmosphere that evokes days gone by with its pleasant climate, friendly people, and destination pastimes and pastoral setting.
only 8 miles from boone but a lifetime away, valle crucis offers visitors many unique experiences. from upscale accommodations and authentic appalachian food experiences  to downhome music and outdoor recreation, its quiet location is a balm for traffic jams and hectic schedules that allows escape from the everyday.
north carolina’s first rural historic district welcomes you to enjoy bed and breakfast inns, cabin rentals, a family retreat, tasty foods, curated art collections, outdoor pursuits, and historic destinations like the mast general store.
we hope you find this site useful in planning your next getaway.
