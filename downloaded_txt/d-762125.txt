introduction

this project was started long before ​centos or other projects were available. even if you do not install the core distribution, the addons, computational and unsupported repositories may be of use to you. the addons repository contains additional packages not included in a stock red hat distribution. the computational repository also includes additional packages, however, these packages are specific to scientific computing. the unsupported repository is a place where one time packages are put, they are unsupported and may change frequently.

news
puias linux is now known as springdale linux. the new logo is the springdale street sign, in honor of the road which runs in between the two campuses. * 32-bit builds are becoming difficult to build & maintain as upstream support drops efforts. expect that after springdale 7, or perhaps even for later releases of springdale 7, full & debugged 32-bit builds will become impossible.
