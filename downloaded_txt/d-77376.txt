why to buy?

  	
	today's  turbo kits have evolved significantly from products offered in the past, providing more efficiency and power than ever while still maintaining drivability and fuel economy. most turbo-equipped vehicles are also quieter due to the turbo itself acting as a sort of muffler. if you need more horsepower and torque without a lot of hassle, a  turbo kit is a great way to go and will accomplish this goal with minimal effort.  boost can become an addiction. if you have ridden in a car with a turbocharger then you have probably felt the incredible surge of power as the motor comes into the boost range. if you want to give your car the ultimate in power and acceleration,  turbos are the way to go. our selection of  turbos runs the gamut from entry level units to high performance screamers so you are sure to find the perfect  turbo somewhere in our lineup. whether on the street or on the track,  turbochargers will keep you ahead of the competition. 


did you know?


  	 while superchargers compress air by using your vehicle's crankshaft for propulsion,  turbo kits use exhaust pressure to spool the turbo, which draws in ambient air and forces it through to the intake manifold (usually going through an intercooler in the process). the result is a large increase in intake pressure and more power when additional fuel is also introduced into the combustion chamber. most  turbo kits will come with everything you need to completely install them, including a fuel management system. the turbocharger is essentially a compressor that is driven by engine exhaust. the exhaust spins an impeller with a turbine on the end that compresses air into the intake manifold generating boost. this design is extremely popular on modern vehicles, but its history goes all the way back to 1905 when a swiss inventor patented the first turbocharger. in the early years turbos were popular on aircraft engine because they helped negate some of the power loss form operating at altitude. today they are used in numerous applications from drag racing to long haul trucking. these little power boosters have really proven their worth.

faqs


q: how do you install a turbo kit?
a: turbochargers should be installed by professionals if you have no experience with turbo installations.  if you've done the basic bolt-on performance modifications to your car (intake, header, exhaust) and know your way around your engine, then you might be capable of doing the install yourself.  normal installation depending on the vehicle takes around 20-25 hours in most cases, but depends on whether custom work needs to be done.  the turbo manifold that comes with the kit replaces the factory exhaust manifold. the turbo doesn't replace anything assuming this is a turbo kit and not a turbo upgrade kit. the turbo is mounted to a flange on the turbo manifold. remember the turbo is spooled by the exhaust gases, so once the gases pass through the turbo manifold, it spools the turbo.
q: is there a pre-condition my vehicle needs to meet in order to be able to handle a turbo kit?
a: any vehicle can be turbocharged but you must consider whether all of the engine, driveline, and chassis parts can handle big power increases.  most aftermarket turbocharger kits for naturally aspirated cars recommend running no more than 6-8 psi to prevent engine damage. 
q: what do turbo kits come with?
a: complete turbo kits normally include the manifold, turbocharger, intake, down pipe, fuel management unit and all lines and hoses needed.  you need to purchase intercoolers, piping, blow-off valves separately in most cases, unless otherwise noted in our product descriptions.
q: what is a turbo kit?  why buy a turbo kit?
a: think of a turbocharger as a fan that is blowing compressed air into your engine.  the more air you give your engine, the more power your engine can give you.  the extra air adds oxygen so you can burn more fuel.  turbochargers are powered by the exhaust gases generated by your engine after combustion.  the time the turbo takes to spool up is seen by the driver as lag, or delay time.  the driver may mash the throttle, but the engine won't produce power until the turbocharger is up to speed.  the reason a turbo kit is such a great purchase is that it takes a tremendous amount of money and time to successfully increase the power of a naturally aspirated engine. expensive head packages, along with expensive bottom block parts, will surely put a dent in your wallet while only making meager horsepower gains. with a bolt-on turbocharger kit you can obtain instant, very dramatic horsepower gains with less time and money while still having the potential for upgrading. the whistle of a blow off valve, the roar from an external wastegate, and the burst of power that makes your engine feel like it doubled in size, how could you resist?
