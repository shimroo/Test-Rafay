whiting lab








the whiting lab of insect phylogenetics at brigham young university is focused on using genomic and morphological information to resolve phylogenetic relationships among insects at many phylogenetic levels. we are an active research group with ongoing research at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level. the overall goal is to use genomic information to unravel patterns of insect diversification and evolution.lab phone number: (801) 422-5363; address: 4045a lsb on the byu campus - provo, ut 84602
