environmental evaluation: onr part of joint effort to deploy data buoys across arctic ocean

in july 2023, the office of naval research (onr) partnered with the 144th airlift squadron of the alaska air national guard to deploy five different types of weather buoys across more than 1,000 nautical miles of the arctic ocean. such deployments are critical for maintaining the arctic observing network (aon), which provides observations for weather and ice forecasting and related research.
the 144th airlift squadron (the “arctic wolves”) and part of the 176th wing (the “arctic guardians”) conducted the flights on a c-17 globemaster iii aircraft. in addition to personnel from the 176th wing, participants included psc’s ignatius rigor along with professors and scientists from the university of maryland as well as onr reservists.

in memoriam of gary a. maykut, friend of psc and sea ice researcher

 gary a. maykut passed peacefully at his home on march 10, 2023. gary held the position of research professor in the department of atmospheric sciences at the university of washington from the early 1970s until his retirement in 2004. gary pioneered the numerical simulation of the arctic surface energy budget, specifically quantifying the 1-d accounting of heat by the ice cover. gary’s graduate work (1971) produced the highly-cited paper “some results from a time-dependent thermodynamic model of sea ice.” this work laid the foundation for how modern global (and regional) climate models do the “accounting” of heat by the arctic sea…

uw climatologist ignatius rigor collaborates with professor combining art and data to capture beauty, diversity of arctic ice

images of massive chunks of ice collapsing from greenland’s glaciers into the ocean have become emblematic of a changing climate and the need to drastically reduce global carbon emissions.university of maryland assistant professor of art cy keener is working to characterize some of these icebergs—capturing their unique identities and the ways they change as they drift in the sea.his collaborative “iceberg portraiture” series is part of an exhibition now on view at the national academy of sciences (nas) in washington, d.c., which keener created with landscape researcher justine holzman, climatologist ignatius rigor and scientist john woods. it’s the result of almost…

welcome, dr. astrid pacini!

welcome, dr. astrid pacini! astrid received her phd in physical oceanography from the mit-whoi joint program in 2022 and holds a bs in mechanical engineering from yale. 
she joins psc as a postdoctoral research associate and holds a 2022 nsf office of polar programs fellowship. astrid will work with dr. michael steele, examining the evolution of upper ocean properties in the arctic ocean’s seasonal ice zone. astrid loves field work and has spent time on various research vessels, but her favorite ship will always be the rv neil armstrong, where she spent six months during graduate school. at the psc, she is excited to continue mentoring high school and undergraduate students, and participating in outreach programs.

climate change: ‘last refuge’ for polar bears is vulnerable to warming



a new study finds that an area of the arctic ocean critical for the survival of polar bears is fast becoming vulnerable to climate change.




the region, dubbed the “last ice area” had been expected to stay frozen far longer than other parts of the arctic.




but this new analysis says that this area suffered record melting last summer.




the researchers say that high winds allied to a changing climate were behind the unexpected decline.

edge of pine island glacier’s ice shelf is ripping apart, causing key antarctic glacier to gain speed

june 11, 2021 – “we may not have the luxury of waiting for slow changes on pine island; things could actually go much quicker than expected,” said lead author ian joughin, a glaciologist at the uw applied physics laboratory. “the processes we’d been studying in this region were leading to an irreversible collapse, but at a fairly measured pace. things could be much more abrupt if we lose the rest of that ice shelf.”

some polar bears in far north are getting short-term benefit from thinning ice

september 23, 2020 – new research shows that kane basin polar bears are doing better, on average, in recent years than they were in the 1990s. the study, published sept. 23 in global change biology, finds the bears are healthier as conditions are warming because thinning and shrinking multiyear sea ice is allowing more sunlight to reach the ocean surface, which makes the system more ecologically productive.

first results from nasa’s icesat-2 map 16 years of melting ice sheets

april 30, 2020 – using the most advanced earth-observing laser instrument nasa has ever flown in space, a team of scientists led by the university of washington has made precise measurements of how the greenland and antarctic ice sheets have changed over 16 years.






“if you watch a glacier or ice sheet for a month, or a year, you’re not going to learn much about what the climate is doing to it,” said lead author benjamin smith, a glaciologist at the uw applied physics laboratory. “we now have a 16-year span between icesat and icesat-2 and can be much more confident that the changes we’re seeing in the ice have to do with the long-term changes in the climate.
