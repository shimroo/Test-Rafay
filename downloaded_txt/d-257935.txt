what i liked about my puerto school experience was that the scale was kept small and intimate. a philosophy is in place that focuses on the students´ needs. this is accompanied by a fully competent, profesional, committed staff of managers and teachers which creates a great learning environment

brian and his team of teachers are there to challenge you and help you to learn spanish for the long haul. this isn't a college language course with 20 other students, but an intense immersion into the spanish language, whether in a one on one situation or small group
reid w






i wanted to make sure that i attended a school that uses solid instruction that uses research-based techniques of language learning. when i saw that brian has a long history of teaching languages as well as a masters degree in the field, i knew that this was the school for me
