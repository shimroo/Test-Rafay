drnunley's marketing tips
weekly wisdom to fatten your profits!
*************************************

a plan for promoting an affiliate program

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

affiliate programs are a great way to earn a little extra money
each month working the internet. while some people earn up to
$1,000 or more per month, most who work affiliate programs
seriously land $200 to $700.

here's a brief plan for making money with these programs:

1. put a two or three line ad about the program in the signature
file of all your emails (that bit of info that goes after your
note). "sig" files are a powerful way to include a marketing
message along with your personal notes--probably the most
effective marketing tool of all.

2. get your own web site. it's hard to establish your own
identity and customer trust if you are sending people to a
generic site provided by the program.

3. place free ads on sites where other people are pushing
affiliate programs. these are usually the same folks who buy.

4. place paid ads in ezines. see charlie page's directory of
ezines for an updated list.

web site copy, press releases, and ads since 1996. his
talent and experience gets you results! get more tips

climate. so i lined up a team of excellent pro writers who
are willing to offer their best work at deep discounts.

they write your copy, i edit and improve it before sending it

don't rush marketing

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

marketing works best when it isn't rushed. the best advertising
media require you to place your order well in advance. great
designers, writers, and (especially!) tv production firms are
usually booked weeks into the future.

quality. as you can quickly see, you get better quality when you
don't rush your marketing. a top writer can take several weeks to
write your sales letter. we've worked 7 days a week to improve
the speed for good writing, but long copy can take a professional
writer several days of full-time work to complete. many expert
designers like to flesh out several versions of your ad, web site
look, or logo before deciding on the best. that, too, takes time.

price. planning your marketing well in advance can save you lots
of money. let's say you started planning this year's ad plan way
back in october of last year. today you would be taking full
advantage of advance ad buys, slack times for media, maybe be in
line to get cheap regional or remnant space in national
magazines.

more than anything else, planning your marketing well in advance
will help you avoid knee-jerk moves. most marketing efforts fail
because the owner pulls the plug too soon and starts a new plan.
insisting on taking your time will make your marketing more
consistent and effective.


now here's a plug for me. you need a quality press release to get
noticed by media and their massive audiences. i can write your
release for just $99. with that you get my more than 35 years of

weekly wisdom to fatten your profits!
*************************************

make your about page sell

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

it's interesting how many web site visitors quickly click to the
"about" page. this is the page that tells who runs the business,
where it is located, and why they do what they do.

with all the uncertainty some folks still feel about buying
online, it is only natural they want to find out more about the
business before they seriously consider buying the product or
service.

include your photo, a photo of your staff, or a picture of your
building on the "about" page. be sure to give your address, one
or more email addresses visitors can use, and a phone number.
anything less makes some people feel like you've got something to
hide.

the "about" page is also a good place to tell your story. people
love to hear about how you got started. they want to know what it
is you like about your business and how you work to help
customers. give people a good story and they will remember it
long after they have forgotten the particulars of the product
they came to see.

************************************

get a great theme--then don't change it

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

good marketing themes are one of those things that gets better
with age (i'm not talking about wordpress themes :-) a good theme
can be used for decades, gaining familiarity and power with each
passing year.

"the loneliest repairman in town," "less filling, tastes great,"
and "you're in good hands" all immediately bring to mind their
owner's brand.

make your marketing theme a single short sentence that tells what
you do and what main benefit you give customers. i like to write
two or three sentences, then take a pen and start chopping
phrases and words. eventually you can distill your thoughts into
a natural flowing few words.

be careful that you don't use trendy words that could go out of
fashion in a few years. you also don't want to be too limiting.
for example, "books at low prices" may not work in a few years
when your bookstore switches to carrying mostly videos and games.

use your theme on every piece of marketing: your web site,
business card, newspaper ads, ezine classifieds, even tv
commercials and invoices.

weekly wisdom to fatten your profits!
*************************************

sell with photos online

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

recently i found an interesting piece of real estate on the web.
i emailed the realtor to find out more about it. when he learned
i was interested, he used a digital camera to take photos of the
property. he then put them up on a web page with my name on it.

the whole process probably only took him a few minutes, yet he
was able to provide a customized advertising page directed to my
specific interests. that is targeted marketing at its most
powerful.

pictures are the classic way to sell a product. from cars, to
houses, to furniture, to gum, it is much easier to make a sale if
your marketing materials include photos.

try the personalized photo page approach for customers who can't
view your product in person. place a short descriptive caption
under each photo.

simple circulars trump brochures

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

one of the problems with brochures is they're often expensive to
print and they are usually out of date long before you give them
all away.

a one-sheet or circular can be the answer. rather than spreading
your info out over 6 panels of a brochure, put it all on a single
sheet of paper. print on both front and back if you like.

one-sheets are easy to produce, cheap, and no big sweat to throw
them out when they are outdated. put a big headline in at least
14 point bold print at the top. include a benefit for the
customer in your headline.

keep sentences and paragraphs short with frequent sub-headings.
this lets a hurried prospect scan through the most important
details of your offer. spice up your page with a simple graphic.

if you have a lot of information, think about putting it into a
booklet. booklets are considered to be more valuable and carry
prestige. people will toss a 12 page sales letter, but they are
likely to save a brochure.

check out the handy clickbook at bluesquirrel.com. it turns any
group of pages into a ready-to-staple booklet.

the 10-30-60 marketing rule

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

people often want to know how much they should spend on
marketing. there is no standard answer, but we do have some good
rules of thumb we can use.

the 10-30-60 marketing rule says to spend 10 percent of your ad
budget on untargeted marketing. your ads should be aimed at
everyone. the idea is to do a broad sweep across the public to
find a few people who will become interested prospects.

spend 30 percent of your budget on interested prospects. this is
targeted advertising to specific opt-in lists, postcards to
certain people in your industry, and mailings to people who have
called or emailed for more information.

finally, spend 60 percent on current and previous customers.
people who have already bought from you are by far the most
likely to buy again.

one of the net's biggest problems right now is there are so many
people who are jumping on that it is easy to forget to market to
our past customers.

michael patterson, sales manager at wpst and wnjo in new jersey,
recently wrote with some tips to make your radio ads more
effective.

he stresses each business must find a focus they are great at and
emphasize it.. the second aspect is frequency. "a business must
find a medium and dominate it. make it so that whenever a viewer,
reader or listener is in the medium, they get the message,"
patterson says.

he believes advertising does not create a need, it only answers
the desire or need. your ad has to be there when the listener
feels the need.

you don't always have to reach the actual decision maker.
instead, an effective ad can reach friends, family and co-workers
with the message that will work its way to the boss.

a few tips for good telephone selling

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

do you have to convince customers, bosses, or employees via the
telephone? ready or not, you're in telephone sales. even with all
the enthusiasm about the internet, most business still revolves
around the phone.

here are some quick tips for making your point more powerful.

talk clearly. use short sentences. talk loud enough but don't
over-modulate the mouthpiece (that's announcer talk for
distortion). this can be especially tricky when you're on the
cell phone in the car.

i learned a trick from a former newspaper reporter. "when you're
talking with a reporter and you want them to write down
particular points but not others, vary your pace. talk fast
through the points you don't feel are important, but slow down
and enunciate the important parts you want in print." the same
works for selling on the telephone.

leave the script behind. instead, jot down a few phrases that
remind you of your important points. ad-lib around these to keep
your pitch on track.

search engines look for content

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

more and more, search engine computers read your site. while
titles and meta tags can be important, your web page's copy can
make the difference in how your site is listed on major search
engines.

your copy needs to do two things:

1. your copy should include the words customers will use to
search for a site like yours. people also search with phrases.
you'll want to include those, too, in your copy.

concentrate on no more than five keywords and keyword phrases.
you can work in more than five, but it will keep you from
achieving our next point.

2. it does you no good to get listed high on search engines if
your copy doesn't interest and sell visitors when they find you.
we've all seen sites that were trying so hard to use their
keywords over and over that the copy didn't make sense. strike a
happy medium between keyword rich copy and copy that reads well.

"i'd like to help you sell!"

by kevn nunley
http://drnunley.com

want to get a leader in your field involved with your business?
offer to help them sell more of their product or service.

read the biography of any magnate of industry and you will find
lots of cases where he or she was approached by an enthusiastic
person wanting to help them sell. in many cases, that person went
on to become a key executive, affiliate, or supplier, becoming
very wealthy in the process.

helping other people sell their stuff is particularly easy on the
internet. find a great product or service that isn't being sold
widely. get permission from the owner, then put up a web page or
send out an email promoting the product.

i have often let people informally resell my services on their
sites, charging whatever they please. they may have a niche
audience i can't reach or a special personality that helps them
sell better than most.

promote your site offline

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

this is a great time to advertise your web site with offline
media. run a small display ad or classified ad on a consistent
basis in your local paper. go nationwide and repeat your ad in
cities rich with the kinds of people who would buy from you.

look for good deals on television ads in smaller towns, in
morning newscasts, and on cable. radio can also give you great
deals on somewhat targeted audiences.

for both radio and tv, it helps if your url is short and easy to
remember. repeat it several times in the commercial, especially
at the end. give the listener or viewer a good reason to look
your site up now before they forget the url.

if your advertising isn't working....it may be the product

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

i've seen some good folks pour a trundle of money into
advertising products and services, only to come up empty handed.
"the ads didn't work!" they said in exasperation.

if you try good targeted advertising, you keep at it for a while,
and yet nothing sells, step back. first take a look at your ad,
then at your product.

a product that is only slightly different from many other
products probably won't pass the "just noticeable difference
test." that is where you notice the difference, but it's not
different enough for customers to notice.

price is also an important factor. if what you're selling could
also be found at walmart, or staples, or amazon.com at a cheaper
price, your product or service had better offer a whole lot more
to support a higher price.

finally, your product or service may be too new--people just
don't understand it--or it solves a need few people recognize
they have.

get banners that work

by kevin nunley
http://drnunley.com

recent figures show internet ad banners now only get about one
person in 100 to click on them and go to the advertiser's site.
that is not nearly as good as banners once did, but it is right
in line with the response you get from other kinds of
advertising.

there is good news here. with some of the shine coming off
banners as an ad tool, there are many top sites in your industry
that are selling banners dirt cheap.

there are also good ways to make your banner work better:

* design your banner as large as allowed. bigger gets attention,
pure and simple.

* new studies show people take only one second to glance at your
banner. if you don't grab them then, you've lost them. your
banner should clearly state your offer, preferably with a graphic
that reinforces your message.

*don't take the soft sell approach. a banner that surprises,
shocks, entertains, or appeals to a strong special interest will
get more clicks.
