with the brood prevalent in central pa emerging this year, it's an auspicious time to tie up some cicada patterns.

i have fished the brood that emerges in scpa/md in 1987, 2004, and 2021 and took careful notes on emergence and fishing results. if you have never fished one of these 17 year broods, it's an amazing, sometimes frustrating, experience. generally, it has been my...

just a few pics from my trip last week to the bitterroot on montana. what an awesome place. my brother, a true trout sicko, lives out in hamilton so i had a personal guide/shuttle service. highly recommended. generally he'd drop me off in some ridiculously gorgeous place, point me in a direction and i'd fish all day then meet up with him in the evening when he'd suddenly catch a bunch of fish that i missed. i probably waded 15 miles of that river and never fished in the same place twice...

a few ears ago, maurice and i stayed on after the spring jam at penns creek for several days. we ended up hitting the start of the green drakes. always a treat and hard to walk away from the table when the game gets started. once the frenzied rush of guides and crowds hurried upstream, we had one awesome day by ourselves in a really fun, secluded stretch of the creek.

the fall season offers some great weather and outstanding fly fishing after the heat of the summer. trout behavior and hatches change during the autumn months, but there are plenty of angling opportunities if you know what to do. if you are looking at extending your fly fishing season this fall then join derek eberly and dave kile for a presentation on fall fly fishing in pennsylvania.
