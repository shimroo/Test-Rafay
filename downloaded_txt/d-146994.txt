is it time to get rid of my junk car?

                    by donna mccarthy
my co-workers teased me on a daily basis: when are you 
                      going to get rid of your junk car? i always answered them: 
                      i am not going to get rid of my car. i am not junking my 
                      car. i like my old taurus and i’m staying with it 
                      at all costs!
however, after getting stuck on the ny thruway in a 
                      heavy rain-storm, i started to dislike my car. the time 
                      had finally arrived to get rid of the car, to scrap the 
                      car, to remove my car from my driveway and from my heart. yes, i decided to junk my car! 
i knew i could not bring myself to sell my junk car. you 
                      won’t believe what i ended up doing: i contacted a 
                      non-profit to pick up my car. and i found out i wasn’t 
                      even so original - over 1 million americans rely on the 
                      free vehicle removal service of non-profits to get rid of 
                      junk cars.
i congratulated myself for being so brave and deciding to junk my car. however, it was very important to me to know that my car will benefit 
                      needy children. so i chose the automobile removal services 
                      from junk-yard.org - a non-profit car junk yard. i was very happy with their service: 
                      the auto removal process was very fast and there was no 
                      paperwork for the car disposal. 
after all, the vehicle removal process made me feel good 
                      about myself. someday, someplace, children will be smiling, 
                      thanks to my old junk car.
