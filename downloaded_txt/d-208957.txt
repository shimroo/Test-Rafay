cross trainer: 450 caloriesab isolator: 50 x 70lbsthis workout took approx 45 minutes.  i wanted to do more but got bored.  i think it is high time to take an fm radio for my workouts rather than read the tv's.  stare at the boob-tube for an hour and lose weight.  i like the sound-a-that!

well i haven't gone to workout for a number of days...almost a week and it is really killing me!!!  which is actually good.  it means that missing some days is now not acceptable.  before i could do this for a month and it would be ok.  hopefully i'll get to the point where it is a couple days and i feel the urge.menu:--------------lunch:1 minigo yogurt1 plate of fried rice1 packet of oatmeal1 bannana.i will workout this evening!!

- burned 330 calories on the cross trainer (~30minutes)- 120 repititions @ 60lbs on the abdominal isolatortotal time spent at the gym is roughly 1 hour.i would like to goto the new northeast club fit this friday just to have a look and see if they have any new kinds of equipment.  i have been to all of the locations in edmonton and everything is pretty much the same.  the northwest location is big and so it has some older equipment on the upper level.  the only problem with the northwest location is that it is pretty busy at 10:00pm.  since it is open 24hours i am guessing it gets the additional traffic.  i will no doubt stick to the west end location as it is dead around closing time.menu----------------------lunch:1 banana1 manderine1 package of oatmeal6 skewers of chicken breastsupper:1 plate of rice with lentil soup (dal)1 roti and some chicken
