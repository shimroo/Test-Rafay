my research focuses on the dynamics of evolutionary processes.  i am particularly interested in higher order phenomena, such as the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map, including modularity, and the evolution of genetic systems.  my work also addresses theoretical problems in evolutionary computation. 

i have also worked in conservation on maui as a part of what i consider to be an evolutionary biologist's professional obligation to preserve the products of evolution that bless hawai`i so remarkably.
