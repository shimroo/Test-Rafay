undergraduate minors
students pursuing baccalaureate programs at georgia southern university have the option to enhance their education by adding a minor to their primary major. while a minor is mandatory for bachelor of arts degrees, it remains optional for other bachelor’s degrees. students can select a minor from this list of available minor programs, which serves as a secondary field of study distinct from their major. declaring a minor can occur as early as the freshman year, and it’s recommended to do so promptly to allow adequate time for planning and completion. it’s crucial to consult with an advisor to ensure the chosen minor is feasible for their primary campus and degree program.
