shared.   since 1992, dwight and lesa lewis have worked as a team building their

and also grew up with horses and dobies.  dwight is from black rock, ar and grew up on 
his grandparents' 
cattle farm.   they met while attending college at arkansas state 
university.   dwight graduated with a degree in 
radio/television and has worked for sears for over 25 years.  lesa

accountant and 7 years in the veterinary pharmaceutical industry.

dobie kids!!  




"quality is like buying oats:  if you want nice fresh
oats you must pay a fair price.   however, if you can be satisfied
with oats that have already been through the horse, they come a lot
cheaper."     author - unknown
