read more about welcome kate, omar and aron















the department of linguistics at the university of maryland plays a leading role in the largest and most integrated language science research community in north america.
our top-ranked department combines current theoretical research in phonology, syntax, and semantics with state-of-the-art experimental research in language acquisition, computational linguistics, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics.













our research
connections between our core competencies are strong, with theoretical, experimental and computational work typically pursued in tandem. here new ideas develop in conversation, stimulated by the steady activity of our labs and research groups, frequent student meetings with faculty, regular talks by local and invited scholars and collaborations with the broader language science community.
