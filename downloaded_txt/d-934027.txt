it’s such a relief to know that my mom’s nearby and are in such caring hands. i have full confidence that blue skies homes will cater for the needs of my mother. i’ve seen how professional they interviewed us and assessed our needs. the facility was designed to be as warm and home-like as possible.

my mom has been hard-working for so long, and i’m happy to share that she receives the care she deserves in blue skies homes. every day, she’s liberated from doing house work, her meals are prepared for her, and there are programs for her socialization. safe to say, this place is highly-recommended!




jo jenkins

i cannot recommend blue skies homes enough. the staff are great and very helpful. they are always available and attentive to the needs of the residents. the meals here are nourishing and tasty as well. this is a great place to live.




willie crouch
 /  mira mesa, oceanside

















 

kudos to the staff and entire management of blue skies homes! i know taking care of a bunch of seniors with different needs and sometimes demanding attitudes is very challenging but every caregiver faced us with a smile and compassionate attitude. i might not say this very often, but i’m thankful to be here!




noah anderson
 /  san marcos












 

i cherish the intimate community we have here in blue skies homes. i found lasting relationships here. we bond over our delicious meals, on day trips, and with arts and crafts. i also value the independence and privacy we have in this facility. although we’re tight-knit, i’m glad that these are still maintained.




amanda chambers
 /  mira mesa, oceanside












 

this place is changing my dad… he’s so much happier and radiates with satisfaction! he’s been welcomed to the community ever so warmly last month, and continues to enjoy the group activities. i’ve also noticed how he’s been socializing better now.

have any questions?




how does your facility compare with the larger assisted living communities?
in general, our facilities offer a more personal experience with a much higher level of caregiver interaction than is typically offered by the larger senior living communities. many people prefer the home-like atmosphere of a board and care to the more institutional environment of the big facilities.

are you able to take care of a wheelchair-bound resident?
yes, our caregivers are all experienced in wheelchair transfer techniques and can address all the needs of a wheelchair-bound senior citizen.

do you accept hospice residents?
yes, we have a hospice waiver and we are experienced with hospice residents, whether they are on hospice when admitted or placed on hospice at some point after admission.

what items can we bring?
all residents are encouraged to bring personal items and small furnishings, pictures, etc that are familiar and may even be treasured. our rooms are furnished, but if you prefer, the existing furniture can be removed and replaced with yours. if you have a favorite chair, we’ll make room for it.
