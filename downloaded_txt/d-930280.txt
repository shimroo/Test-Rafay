empowering and expanding campus outreach ministries under the authority of the local church.











our mission at campus outreach is to glorify god by building laborers on the college campus for the lost world. our interdenominational ministry network targets strategic college campuses around the world.   our desire is to see students experience a relationship with the lord, to be trained and equipped to serve as christian leaders for the next generation. we believe the best way to achieve this is through a biblical model of evangelism and life-on-life discipleship, and this has been our focus since our founding in 1978.   campus outreach serve was formed in 2019 as an equipping, resourcing, and serving agency that will help the entire co movement respond to global churches requesting help in building leaders. as we "empower and expand co ministries under the authority of local churches", we will reach more students, develop more laborers, and deploy more leaders.
