about ems
in 1978, ucla established its own emergency medical services (ems) as a response to the ever-growing campus and its increased demand for emergency medical care. initially, ucla police officers responded back to the police station, jumped in the ambulance and responded to medical aid calls. in the early 1980s, student employees started staffing the ambulance. since that time, ucla ems has since grown into one of the most prestigious collegiate basic life support emergency medical service programs in the country.
