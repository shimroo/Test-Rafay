who we are we are an affiliated american kennel club (akc) club located in washington county, maryland.
the home of mdkc is the mason dixon hall, a home that is the result of dedicated members working through the years toward a vision that is now a reality. this heated, air-conditioned building was constructed and donated to the ag center by the mason and dixon kennel club in 1995. 
we recently added non-slip rubber flooring to the building, and we also have a large outdoor area totally fenced in for training. you’re invited to come and visit this wonderful facility at the washington county agricultural education center 7313 sharpsburg pike, boonsboro, md.
