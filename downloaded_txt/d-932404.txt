 introduction  




		    the signal processing systems section (formerly
		    called circuits and systems) covers
		    the theory and applications of signal processing,
		    including high-level system design.


		    
 presentations 

this link
			will direct you to some slide presentations which are used to
			introduce the group to starting msc students.
			
			also have a look at the 
			ieee signal processing society 
			youtube video channel for more general information on signal processing.
		    


		    signal processing theory includes array
		    signal processing, estimation and detection,
		    sampling theory, graph signal processing, convex
		    optimization, distributed processing, machine
		    learning and tensor analysis. we also cover
		    electromagnetics theory.  regarding high-level
		    system design, we have a specific focus on spiking
		    neural network platforms.

		    

		    application areas include audio and acoustics,
		    wireless communication, radio astronomy systems,
		    distributed sensing from space, biomedical signal
		    and image processing (mri, ultrasound, ecg), image and
		    video analysis, and
		    computational platforms for autonomous driving
		    (e.g., radar sensor fusion).

		    

		    the main goal in our research program is to provide
		    a sound mathematical framework for the analysis and
		    synthesis of problems in the complete trajectory
		    of problem analysis, signal processing model,
		    algorithm design, mapping to a digital hardware
		    architecture or embedded system, and including
		    system engineering.

	








research highlights




the moonshot
	    project (in combination with lunar zebro) aims to place
	    a swarm of rovers on the moon, doing useful stuff such
	    as looking for lava tunnels or creating a radio telescope.
	    








	    for autonomous driving, gps is probably not sufficiently
	    accurate or reliable. the 
	    supergps
	    project aims to demonstrate
	    a road-side solution that can achieve cm resolution.
	    here
	    is a 2020 magazine article about it.
	    the project published a nature
	    paper in nov. 2022, which was also covered by
	    ieee spectrum.
	









	    radio astronomy is an interesting application area for array signal processing.
	    we developed a new image formation tool called 
	    prifira,
	    inspired by sparse bayesian learning.

research





				the sps group participates in four msc tracks in electrical
				engineering: msc telecommunication and sensing systems, msc
				signals and systems, msc microelectronics, msc computer engineering.
				we also take students from msc biomedical engineering.
			    








			    sps consists of 9 professors and about 40 researchers.
