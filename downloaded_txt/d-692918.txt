“if you can eat it, you can grill it.”

— elizabeth karmel













the original grill girl.elizabeth karmeli am a southern cook, food and drink fanatic and the original grill girl. my first career in food marketing and public relations introduced me to weber grills and i fell in love with outdoor cooking—grilling and barbecue! i created girls at the grill in 2002 to show women everywhere just how fun and delicious it was to cook and entertain outdoors. it is a man’s domain no more! since then, i went on to write cookbooks, create award-winning kitchen and grilling tools, spread the gospel of grilling, barbecue and southern food through restaurants, food writing, speaking engagments and direct experience with carolina cue to-go.  like a good southerner, i am a big baker too! i invite you to sauce, smoke, sample and sip all the tasty goodness that lives here, here at girls at the grill, and carolina cue to-go.
