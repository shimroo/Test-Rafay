*******************************
brit documentary uses actor to play "young james oberg" in secret soviet space archives!!
 amusing new stage in my television career – “conspiracy”, a program series created by channel5 in london, has created a dramatic reenactment of some of my discoveries of 'missing cosmonauts' photographs way back in the 1970s, and this involved showing an actor playing me being shown into a soviet-era archive where "i" was allowed to inspect hidden photographs. they used some young geeky-looking guy with a moustache to play me -- too bad george clooney was out of their price range.
 it was fun working with them on this but i had no idea they would do the reenactment. it was pretty fanciful, but it's never been done for me before, so i got a kick out of it. here's a shot of the real me from the episode, and of the faux-me.
  
it's a british production company and there's no word on when it airs in the us [it's already aired in britain]. it's called "conspiracy" -- episode 9, faking the moon landings", and spends two thirds of the hour debunking theories the landing was faked, with some recent interviews with conspiracy-promoter bart sibrel and a very clear video of buzz aldrin punching him in the face some years ago. it then segues into claims the russians faked some early flights, or covered up disasters, and i come on as an expert debunking the stories that some italian radio amateurs heard dying cosmonauts in secret broadcasts. then they spend about eight minutes describing my discovery of the 'erased cosmonaut' forgeries [with the actor's dramatization of me turned loose in a soviet space center storeroom], and then a dramatization of nelyubov's drunken brawl that led to his expulsion from the cosmonaut program and eventual suicide -- again, cute, and wildly fanciful.

october 17, 2014 jim’s speculation on mission of x-37b [comments]

my own theory, based on long philosophical discussions with air force space strategists [connected with my writing the us space command's "space power theory" in 1999] is that the vehicle is testing and exercising "local situation awareness" sensors designed to overcome the surprising blindness that military space operators can't reliably detect enemy attempts to approach, interfere with, attach to, or even penetrate us military space objects.
 
what has been needed are on-board sensors that can 'hear', 'see', 'smell', and 'feel' indicators that unwanted visitors are operating near, on, or inside our satellites.
 
such sensors -- gas sniffers, optical systems, short-range radar/lidar, broad radio spectrum detectors, etc -- would be activated and then tested by deploying small 'friendlies' in the near-vicinity of the detection web, and determining the detection threshold of various instruments.  
 
such activities would not be observable from the ground.
 
you would most certainly not want adversaries to know how well, or not, you could detect interference attempts.

                "in the early 1990's, a bitter russian pun reflected people's disenchantment with soviet space budgets. as hundreds of locations around the country were restored to their pre-soviet names, the joke was that the 'kosmodrom baykonur' would also be given its authentic name -- henceforth it would be referred to as the 'baykadrom kosmodur'. russians i told it to either laughed uproariously, or glowered in angry frustration. it's a brilliant russian-language word-play meaning, essentially, "stadium where space fools compete in lying to each other."

                  to say the ends of national strategy are inextricably 
                  political, yet the means or dimensions of 
                  strategy are not limited.” he goes on 
                  to define six or seven things that make up 
                  a grand strategy, and concludes by saying, 
                  “to date, only james oberg’s space 
                  power theory [now out of print with an expanded 
                  version in preparation], a comprehensive effort 
                  commissioned by the united states space command, 
                  approaches the requirements laid out above.”

"wow! in a world devoid of critical thinking and awash in meaningless 
            sound bites, this mr. oberg 
              is like a breath of fresh air. if 
                i ever realize my goal of becoming earth's 
                dictator for life, i promise to empower mr. 
                oberg with the authority to go around slapping 
                any news people caught spreading nonsense 
                or found culpable in the dumbing down of america." --
