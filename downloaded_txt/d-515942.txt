how can we help? - our offer



 







development of a management strategy for your fortune





 



we combine your personal requirements and our high-precision approach
large private fortunes or foundations are an asset class of their own and require a targeted, robust, transparent and implementable wealth management strategy, which can serve as a guideline. that is why we start with a thorough analysis of the individual framework conditions. we will work together with you to prepare an optimal wealth management strategy. our experienced capital market specialists will then take care of the implementation in order to do justice to you and your fortune.

regular and transparent management





 



we enable you to focus on what is really important
having a complete and up-to-date overview of all assets is indispensable if you want to make informed and optimal decisions about your fortune. you will need to keep an eye on your bank accounts, real estate holdings, company stakes and other assets to be able to intervene in time, if necessary. if, however, you do not want to deal with daily administration and management tasks, our experts will be happy to step in so that you can focus on what is really important in your life.
let us discuss your options.

prepare your legacy





 



secure wealth for future generations
what is the optimal way to transfer my fortune to my heirs? what should i keep in mind when i want to establish a foundation for a purpose which i have long held near my heart? what should i do to protect my fortune in an emergency? it is important to consider these questions in time, as it may take some time to implement a potential solution.
we will be happy to discuss your options.

invest your wealth and select suitable partners





 



invest wisely to protect the capital
you are looking for an advisor who is able to develop not only a wealth management strategy, but also the necessary, overarching implementation concept. someone who monitors this concept regularly, continues to develop it further, provides you with access to the best wealth managers world-wide and is able to answer questions such as these:

what is the best way to manage different asset classes, both at the individual asset-class level and combined?
what are the advantages of passive and active implementation concepts, respectively?
how many managers will i need for the different tasks?
which wealth managers are best suited to my specific needs and goals?

learn more about our convincing concepts.

advice on real estate projects and company stakeholdings





 



return-oriented investments
when interest rates are low, investments in real estate and company stakeholdings may become more important and help to achieve satisfactory returns at an acceptable risk. would you like advice and support on this issue because you do not yet have sufficient experience? or are you looking for a discrete intermediary to get access to attractive properties or a potential buyer for one of your real-estate holdings? or are you perhaps interested in a cooperation with private equity, infrastructure or impact investment partners? let us discuss the options.

sustainability aspects





 



ensure sustainable growth
your goal is to create a sustainable basis for your family fortune or your foundation in order to secure and increase the capital across several generations. in addition, you are looking for concrete answers to ecological, ethical and social issues which may directly and indirectly affect the management of a large fortune. since you have your own opinions on what is “right” and feel that some definitions of sustainability are a bit vague, you want to establish your own guidelines on how certain values and criteria should be taken into account.
