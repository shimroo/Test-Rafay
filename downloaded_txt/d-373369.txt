kakuro puzzles are similar with crosswords, but instead of letters the board is filled with digits (from 1 to 9).
the board's squares need to be filled in with these digits in order to sum up to the specified numbers.
you are not allowed to use the same digit more than once to obtain a given sum.
each kakuro puzzle has an unique solution. good luck!
