about me
 








welcome to the ship shape marine of kentucky website 


i refer to myself as the “head doctor” because, i don’t just sell raritan products, i service and support them as well.


some services i offer are:


installation of toilets.
installation of both type i and type ii marine sanitation systems.
installation of holding tanks.
repairs on all raritan toilets.
service and repair on raritan purasan and lectra/san sanitation systems.


got a type ii sanitation system or holding tank odor problem? i can help you out with that as well.
i also offer parts and repairs on u-line and raritan ice makers.
my area for service, installation, and repair is all of kentucky, southern indiana, and northern tennessee. my services are not limited to this area however, if the client doesn’t mind the added expense for travel.
and, no matter where you’re located, we will meet or beat anyone’s prices on raritan products or parts.
 





my motto: “if i can’t do it right, i’d rather not do it at all.”
