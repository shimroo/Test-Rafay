i have a question on one of my characters. when i insert a glyph it turns green. what causes this.

reply 


i don‚Äôt see that happening, so i can‚Äôt really answer. i assume the glyph instals, right? it might be a change from some addon or a graphics glitch or some setting somewhere. as long as the glyph instals properly i‚Äôd suggest you just enjoy the show. üôÇ

i was just wondering how long would it take for you guys to have mop talent trees up after mop comes out

working on that right now. just finished the discipline priest pve build, have the s. priest pve build up, and the priest in mop post covers talents, abilities, etc. feel free to comment about any of the builds.

under the holy paladin pve guide, there is a small typo.
it‚Äôs under one of the racial benefits list, for blood elves.
‚Äú8 years‚Äù.
sorry for being nit-picky.
other then that i enjoyed most of the articles i burned through in an hour, i will more then likely return to read more in the near future(tomorrow, lol).
[heh. thanks for the nit-picking, i‚Äôll fix it now. and thanks for the nice words. -rog]

i was wondering my druid was having a hardtime in pvp any suggestions? mostly instant death kills from warlocks. is this a glitch or just that hard to attack with my feral melee druid.

reply 


hey dude, 
the quick and dirty almost answer is that you have to know your abilities and the ‚Äòlock‚Äôs abilities well. if you know what he can do then you can position yourself to counter or avoid it. well played feral‚Äôs are pretty tough. make sure you have the build and gems and then check out this arenajunkies guide. i think it will answer all of your questions.

nice work on the website and the guides. i use the class leveling guides on my leveling characters and the talent trees help a lot when i have absolutely no clue whatsoever what to put my next talent in.

wanted to let you know, that you helped a lot of people with this website‚Ä¶..it perfect,clear and easy‚Ä¶just g on. one thing that might be of help, especially to players like myself that play casually but still want to get good geared avatars would be a guide to the numbers and caps. wowwiki has helped me a lot, but the notion of caps, how to know when they have been hit, how to reach them and how to avoid wasting enchantments and buffs unnecessarily would be great. i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm not the only one with this gap in my knowledge.

thanks for the excellent guides. i‚Äôve been playing for 6 years now and still find something new every time i log on.  one thing that might be of help, especially to players like myself that play casually but still want to get good geared avatars would be a guide to the numbers and caps.  wowwiki has helped me a lot, but the notion of caps, how to know when they have been hit, how to reach them and how to avoid wasting enchantments and buffs unnecessarily would be great.  i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm not the only one with this gap in my knowledge.

so,
i finally got to 85, still trying to learn more about this world, questing i got down pat.  dungeons pretty good at the dps consistantly in the #2 slot for recount.  would like to get into doing some battlegrounds, but dont even know where to start.  any help?

reply 


level 85 pvp is ‚Ä¶ interesting. you have a mix of brand new people in questing gear along with heavily geared, very experienced people. teamwork (in the random groups) ranges from pretty good to hilarious. some people are there to win, some are there to smash face, others are there to collect whatever free honor they can get without participating, and there are even a few bots. sometimes things click and it‚Äôs a blast. 
so first: accept the fact that you‚Äôre going to get killed. alot. and that the other guys will win, often.
pvp requires a lot more survivability, movement (escapes,) and crowd control than leveling or dpsing.
try to talk to people in your guild (or join one) and see if you can get someone to help you out.
talk to a tailor (i assume you‚Äôre a mage, from your name) or visit the auction house and buy the appropriate ‚Äúvicious‚Äù set of pvp gear. that will give your enough resilience to survive a hit or two.
try your best to always fight in teams, never alone.
practice as much as you can. 
we should have pvp guides up soon (but not this week,) with builds, gear, tips, etc. 
have fun!
