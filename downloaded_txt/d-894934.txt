welcome!  look around my website to see the glass beads and jewelry that i create, the things that inspire me, and what’s for sale in my online shop.i live in nevada’s high desert at the base of the ruby mountains, and my work is very much “nature-inspired.”  i enjoy a back and forth play between metalsmithing and melting and manipulating glass in a torch flame to fabricate art jewelry.  collectible handmade beads and finished jewelry pieces are available in my online shop.
