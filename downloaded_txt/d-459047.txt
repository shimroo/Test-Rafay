everyone in the united states should benefit from living in a community of opportunity, equity and well-being.





capital is our greatest vehicle for impact  



the low income investment fund (liif) is a nonprofit community development financial institution (cdfi) that mobilizes capital and partnerships to expand access to funding for more americans. we invest, partner and advocate based on our belief that high-quality affordable housing, early care and education, educational opportunities and good jobs are key to individuals’ and communities’ well-being.













we forged a strategic, mission-aligned partnership with stewards of affordable housing for the future (sahf) and national affordable housing trust (naht). the strength of this partnership makes us even better equipped to build, protect and preserve affordable homes as together we create communities of opportunity across the country.

our cutting-edge capital strategies include financing tools and grants for our focus areas of affordable housing, early care and education, and community facilities. our innovative programs are complemented by strategic partnerships that create strong communities.
