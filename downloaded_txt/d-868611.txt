homesick
by alli rogers
i put out my first record in 2005 and have spent most of this last decade touring, writing, and recording. i loved making those records and am grateful to the friends who stood beside me in the studio to help me bring them to life. if you're interested in hearing more you can check them by going to spotify, apple, amazon, or anywhere else you might be listening to music.
