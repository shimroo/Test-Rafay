see what makes mercy such a special place










meet katelyn, a volunteer with over 400 hours served at mercy

“for me, mercy embodies many small moments of hope and strength. i am reminded of so many sweet faces that have humbled me with their gentleness and kindness despite the many struggles these individuals endure that threaten to harden and embitter their hearts.mercy keeps me coming back because the patients represent the resilience of the human spirit. most of all, my time at mercy continues to confirm the reality that true healing in our broken world is incomplete without the hope that is the finished work of christ."

patient testimony: carlton

“i get my medical and dental services at mercy, which has had a big impact on me. but most of all, it’s the support and care that i get at mercy that makes a difference, especially when i’ve been in crisis in my life. i’m 12 months sober right now and thankful to have a place like mercy for my health needs. i refer a lot of people to mercy, and i try to serve my community because of what places like mercy in this city have done for me.”

patient testimony: dory

“if i had one word to describe mercy it would be grateful. it’s like a family there and i know if ever need anything, all i have to do is call.i have a real connection with the doctors there who have helped me greatly over the years. mercy has coordinated care for me countless times and it’s not an exaggeration when i say that i wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for mercy.mercy is a place i tell all of my friends about and many of them are now also patients and have come to appreciate the wonderful and caring people there.”
