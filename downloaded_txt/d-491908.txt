workforce services division

the workforce services division (wsd) is charged with three primary goals to ensure that workforce development in montana remains strong and growing.

montana employers understand the labor market and have a skilled and ready workforce that meets their needs, today and tomorrow.
montana workers understand the job market and have access to skills development opportunities and job search assistance services.
