odinâ is your full speeding ticket protection device.â  it detects police laser and radar up to 5 miles away, giving you advanced warning of speed traps.â  in addition,â odinâ scrambles police radar and laser speed detection devices.â  odin includes 1 year of our ticket rebate, a 3-year warranty, and if you’re not completely satisfied, you can return it for a full refund in 30 days.
                                              description
theâ ewd (early warning discriminator) & tsr (traffic sensor rejection)â prevent false alarms by eliminating signals emitted by safety sensors on many newer vehicles. you can rest assured that when odin alerts you to the presence of police radar, they are near!

super clear oled display
                                                the screen is clearly visible in all lighting conditions, so you won’t have to squint, move your head or lose focus in any way from the road.
full 360â° radar and laser detection
                                                full, 5-mile detection of all bands and frequencies used by police, including k, ka, super wide bands and all lasers. this radar detector uses micro-scan. it enables our detectors to scan 2-4 times faster than any other detector, which gives you a 100% probability of detecting pop radar. this technology is unique to rocky mountain radar detectors. in addition, we have eliminated x-band detection. this allows us to prevent false alarms and to increase k and ka band sensitivity.
undetectable to police (detector detectors)
                                                odin radar detector and laser detector incorporates a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (mmic), which reduces internal signals from leaking out of the antenna by up to 1/1,000,000 (one millionth) of previous levels which makes the unit totally undetectable to police. you can’t detect what’s not there!
radar/laser scrambling
                                                police detectors need to get multiple readings sequentially in order to display a valid speed to the officer using the radar/laser gun. when odin detects a speed detection device, it floods the signal with additional signals making it impossible for the speed detection device to get an accurate reading.
