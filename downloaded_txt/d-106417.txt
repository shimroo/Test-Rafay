edible plant specialists



























fiona’s pick of the monthcoffeecoffee plants are best used as foliage specimen plants indoors or outdoors in a hot sheltered spot as a feature plant in a tropical garden. in summer, the plant will have fragrant white flowers smelling of jasmine.coffee plants do best in filtered sunlight. they don’t like full sun and are not wind or salt tolerant. a good potting mix will provide the ideal growing media. provide plenty of moisture and nutrients as coffee plants are heavy feeders. prune the tips in late winter to maintain the desired size and shape.
