testimonies

"thank you for your kind and gentle
        touch in dealing with such delicate 
       heart and soul matters." (sonia,
        clients
        say) 

"george 
       is very flexible and truly caring" (tish, clients
        say)

"here is 
       what is hard for me to say without tears. thank you for so changing 
       my life. you manage to say things in a way that helps us to 
       understand without feeling judged or condemned. you have given (my 
       husband) a better understanding of who i am and permission to move 
       his mother out of first place in his life."

"you have taught us the skills to 
       effectively commuicate with each other and in doing so have brought 
       us much closer together."
        (peter and kathy, clients
        say) 

"i have found george to be an extremely
        insightful counsellor."
        (s.
        d., clients
        say)

"george is a very trustworthy man and has 
       many years of experience and wisdom in the area of counselling. it is 
       with conviction that i recommend george as a highly skilled and 
       trained counsellor." (rev. andy l., clients
        say)

 "what
        is important is that you did inner healing. in previous counseling 
       they threw out a lot of stuff (deliverance) but there wasn't a lot of 
       inner healing." (testimony from intensive
        therapeutic retreat)

"so the precision in dealing 
       with what has to be dealt with is a nice part of this - jesus leads 
       just exactly to the spot that needs to be dealt with. it gets dealt 
       with and then you are to the next spot."  
       (rev. paul white, feedback
        on an intensive therapeutic retreat)

 "i
        recommend george as a counsellor. he is a wise man with much 
       experience." (father bill comerford)

about
        my marriage counselling / therapy

christian
        marriage counselling

marital
        therapy -
        focussed
        on bonding and the love connection. 

christian
        marraige retreats

marriage
        counseling retreats - also focussed on  bonding and

christian
        premarital counselling


pre-marital
        counseling - package focussed on enhancing bonding, 
       assessing the relationship and understanding personality differences.

i believe that
        marriages are worth saving if they are safe and life-giving; that 
       individuals are worthy of love and respect and that therapy needs to 
       provide a safe emotional place in the session and in the marriage for 
       both partners.

        george

office location: 1454 dundas st. 
       east, suite 123, mississauga (toronto), ontario, canada. l4x 1l4

office is on the second floor of a mall that is just 
       east of dixie and on the south side of dundas.

phone counselling 
       or skype - georgehartwell: fee of $120 per 60 minute sessions pro-rated
        for longer sessions.

retreats: 
       when you may come to toronto for a few days or a week and
        receive 6 hours of therapy per day it is considered an intensive 
       therapeutic retreat.  it is more effective than weekly sessions 
       for discovering key insights, understanding the interaction of 
       personality with marriage and making significant changes. 
       nonrefundable deposit is required when booking a retreat.

 


retreat fees 
       and phone counseling fee: is $120 
       per hour. 

couple sessions: couple
        therapy fee is $180
        per 90 minute session.  i
        suggest the 90 minute 
       office session to overcome the frustration many couples feel after a 
       50 minute session where issues may not be either fully aired or 
       resolved.  one person can leave feeling misunderstood and a 
       couple can feel there is not enough progress.

payment:  cash 
       or check (on a canadian bank), or money order in person.  credit 
       cards are processed in advance by paypal. 

discounts  
       negoiated for those in financial need..

christian
        marriage retreats

my christian marriage retreats are exclusively for one 
       couple; involve only private therapy sessions not group work.

marriage counseling at a marriage retreat often 
       results in the marital bond, intimacy and passion restored at a depth 
       not possible in a group setting.






feedback
        from 
       marriage retreats

vern and mary said: "the
        non-threatening environment enabled us to open our hearts and minds 
       to see our situation in a more positive way. george's 
       professionalism, and acute awareness of communication is positively unique."

ed and may say: 
       "we found our marriage retreat with george to be freeing. we are 
       on a new path and direction with the tools that can heal us and 
       change us."

emile and mark: 
        "after our sessions, we felt we had forgiveness, peace and a 
       direction for the future."
"george brought us through our 
       sharp pain and hurt, and took us to a place that allowed us to heal, 
       to forgive each other and most importantly, to let jesus christ into 
       the center of our marriage."
