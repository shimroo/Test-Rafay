“cmykyle” made more sense in 2000.that’s when i bought this url, back when print media was a much bigger thing, and cmyk—cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, the components of four-color printing—was part of my education at the prestigious missouri school of journalism. i was among what i call the “last gasp” of journalism education—and the media world at large—that behaved as if the internet didn’t exist. after spending a couple decades slugging it out in print media (primarily at the a.v. club and the onion), i switched to developing podcasts, tv, and film. i also do a whole lotta copywriting, and if you want to talk about band names, i’m your guy.print media may be much diminished, but storytelling hasn’t gone anywhere. that’s my specialty, no matter the medium.
