“the faculty and staff in early childhood have been amazing, and are so nurturing. our daughter loves going to school every day and is learning so much. the teachers have also been welcoming to our younger daughter who will be a little dragon in the fall—she can’t wait to join her big sister at harford day.”
– alumna ‘98 & parent ’32, ’34



 
“one of the most impactful life experiences for our family has been being part of the harford day school community. because the school embraced our son's uniqueness, challenged his mind to grow, and taught him vital lifelong skills…, we had the privilege to watch him flourish not just academically, but emotionally, socially, and physically as well. for this incredible experience, we will be forever grateful.”
– parent ’23, ’26, ‘28



 
“hds has been such a wonderful school and experience for our whole family. enrolling our son was one of the best decisions we have ever made. there is no greater investment than in the future of our children! every person we interact with has the best interest of the children's safety and learning in mind.”
– parent ‘26
