"last sunday" poetry reading, february 23, 2025

two award-winning illinois poets, kathryn p. haydon and sharon martina, will be featured at brewed awakening (and on zoom) on sunday, february 23, 12:30-2:00 pm. as always, there will also be an open mic. there is no cover charge and no charge for a zoom ticket from here. this event is sponsored by the illinois state poetry society and brewed awakening, 10 west quincy (directly across the street from the metra station). please, if you attend in person, support the venue by purchasing a beverage and snack. we are giving a nod to national haiku month, but neither the featured poets nor those  who read at the open mic are limited to japanese forms.

kathryn p. haydon is an award-winning poet and the current poet-in-residence at brushwood center at ryerson woods. her haiku and poetry have been published internationally in leading journals such as the heron's nest, humana obscura, wales haiku journal, presence, and many others. kathryn's most recent poetry collection, unsalted blue sunrise, was written on the bluffs overlooking lake michigan over the course of 365 daily walks to the shore. a speaker, facilitator, and the founder of sparkitivity, kathryn writes and speaks widely on creative problem solving, learning, and the secret strengths of the outlier thinkers she calls deep souls. she has written several chapters in edited volumes, hundreds of articles, has a column in psychology today, and is the co-author or author of seven books. her latest book, a love letter to deep souls, is currently being released serially on her deep soul strengths substack. kathryn earned her ba in spanish and latin american literature at northwestern university, and her msc in creativity and change leadership from the acclaimed international center for studies in creativity at the state university of new york.



sharon martina is a retired mathematics teacher living her best life in the northwest suburbs of chicago when not traveling the world. reading and writing haiku became her means of coping during her father's year-long hospice care in 2021/2022.  her newfound passion allows her to meld her love of people, nature, and photography into moments of startling clarity. she has had more than 120 haiku published in the last three years in numerous national and international journals and anthologies, including akitsu quarterly, the heron's nest, modern haiku, frogpond, blithe spirit, hedgerow, prune juice journal, kingfisher, presence haiku journal, wales haiku journal, #femku journal, cold moon journal, autumn moon haiku journal, scarlet dragonfly, tsuri-doro, haiku girl summer, failed haiku, haikunetra, trash panda, under the basho and tinywords.  she owes much of her success to her haiku society of america membership, the haiku foundation website, several amazing mentors, and several longstanding, equally amazing workshop mentees. sharon's awards include honorable mention in the san francisco international haiku competition 2024; honorable mention in the british haiku society contest 2024; 2nd place in the ito en art of haiku competition 2024; honorable mention in the haiku foundation monthly kukai contest, january 2023; third place in the ito en art of haiku competition 2023; 2nd place in the haiku foundation monthly kukai contest, october, 2023;  3rd place in the haiku foundation monthly kukai, june 2022.
