php - created a nested html unordered list from an array



php function get_array_keys_ul will create an nested html unordered list string of the keys of a given array. makes best sense with literal keys, e.g. $_post:/** * creates recursively a nested html ul of array keys. * @param array $array array * @return string nested ul string */function get_array_keys_ul($array=array()) { $recursion=__function__; if (empty($array)) return ''; $out=''."\n"; foreach ($array as $key => $elem)   $out .= ''.$key.$recursion($elem).''."\n"; $out .= ''."\n";   return $out;}found here

sebastien tellier - "divine"



france this year, bit the bullet, and actually entered a decent tune into the eurovision song contest - sebastien tellier's "divine", which is produced by one half of daft punk.in any case, the eastern european countries all voted for each other, which resulted in some instantly forgettable russian entry winning.anyway, here's the video:

ordb



via itwire.coma database of open relay email servers, provided until late 2006 as a voluntary service to help email administrators block spam, has suddenly re-activated but is returning every address queried as being on its blacklist.administrators of email systems should have stopped querying the database (relays.ordb.org) in december 2006 when it shut down, but some failed to do so. that was no problem until today, queries were simply rejected, but now the address of any email server presented is being returned as an open relay. this results in the querying system rejecting all incoming mails from that server.
