company overview




we are carparts.com.
as a technology-driven ecommerce company, we are dedicated to improving the way drivers shop for the parts they need. operating for over 25 years, we offer over 1 million high-quality automotive parts and accessories, establishing ourselves as a premier destination for drivers seeking repair and maintenance solutions. our fast, easy-to-use mobile friendly website and app place the customer at the forefront of our operations, building a seamless factory-to-consumer online shopping experience.
our vision, “empowering drivers along their journey,” underscores our mission to simplify the often stressful experience of vehicle maintenance and repair. our growth strategy encompasses initiatives aimed at delivering value to both customers and shareholders.
optimizing our supply chain is a key pillar in our strategy. our company-owned national distribution center network brings top brands and manufacturers directly to consumers, cutting out brick-and-mortar supply chain costs. with brand and factory-direct self-distribution, we offer a wide selection of new, quality auto parts for car repair, maintenance, and collision as well as accessories - all at competitive prices, including our own private label brands.
strategically placed warehouses across the country ensure we are close to our customers. we’ve enhanced logistics and supply chain management by opening a new semi-automated facility in las vegas, nevada, optimizing operational efficiency, reducing last-mile transportation expenses, and enhancing customer service through expedited delivery. we have also refined our ecommerce experience and marketing strategy, focusing on mobile app enhancements, content creation, and fostering direct customer relationships. these efforts aim to position carparts.com as the ultimate destination for vehicle maintenance resources and product purchases, improving customer acquisition efficiency.
lastly, we take pride in the global team that keeps carparts.com running. together, we continue to achieve remarkable milestones - strengthening our commitment to our customers by continuing to transform the way drivers shop for auto parts.
