where do you go when you have combination, sensitive skin, that is prone to both breakouts and extreme dryness? to anastasia at spa radiance in cow hollow! i have seen her for facials, peels and waxing she has never disappointed. after years of not knowing what to do about my problem skin, seeing anastasia for a few months has put my skin on the road to recovery. she also keeps my eyebrows constantly on point! plus she has that russian grace and know-how that i really trust in my skincare expert! love anastasia and spa radiance, superior treatment at a fair price for a san francisco spa.

i am an avid massage lover and this was my first time actually getting a massage in a san francisco spa. i had a deep-tissue massage and it was fantastic. the front desk staff were friendly and helpful and the waiting area was tranquil and relaxing with free amenities including dried fruit, tea, lemon-infused water, chocolate covered almonds, etc. the massage was fantastic and my masseuse helped get out knots i didn’t even know i had. all in all it was a great experience and i will definitely be back.

think of angelina umansky at spa radiance as the olivia pope of facialists. adult acne? hyperpigmentation? rosacea? she’s got you covered.




san francisco chronicle style section, september 2015
























 

i love spa radiance! i have been going here for over ten years and i keep coming back!  there is no reason to go anywhere else!  i have been to many different san francisco spas and no other place compares. i try and get at least one massage a week at spa radiance.  i regularly get facials and i am always able to rely on anastasia to transform my skin. anastasia has years and years of experience and it is very obvious when she works on your skin! i love this place!  there is a very wide selection of quality skin and makeup products to choose from for at home care. five stars for spa radiance!!!

there isn’t a spa i like better!  spa radiance has become my home away from home.  whether it’s a massage or a facial, i know i can come here and be transported to a relaxing place and leave looking radiant and fabulous.




natalie cole | client since 2005
























 

i have been coming to spa radiance for over 8 years and my skin has never looked better! i seriously look at least 10 years younger. angelina and her staff are so high-end they know exactly how to guide me through the various treatments for optimum results. i will always keep coming to this spa as long as i live in san francisco!
