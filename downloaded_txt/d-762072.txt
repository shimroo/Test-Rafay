hammeredhinges.com was started while trying to fill a need for unusual and authentic early american hardware when i owned the furniture company silver light editions. i wanted to source a "made in america" supplier for truly hand made cabinet hinges and hardware for kitchen and bathroom furniture.
we did not want plain jane everyone-has-it hardware that was stamped out a thousand at a time, all looking exactly the same, so we began to design and manufacture our own forged hardware. other customers saw our hardware and began to ask if it was available to the public. and, from that experience came hammered hinges! 
please note that we now offer some hinges that we purchase pre-made. we offer this (still fired & forged) product as an alternative to the completely hand forged line.
we pride ourselves on supplying a unique product which we trust will give our customers years of satisfaction!
