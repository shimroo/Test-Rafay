jackson christian provides our community with infant- 12th grade education in a safe and secure faith-based environment. our mission is to lead students to love god by providing a quality, values-oriented education in a christian environment.
we believe our choice of school is among the most prominent decisions we make for our children. these are the formative years that provide the academic and moral foundation on which children develop into adulthood.

we strongly encourage you to schedule a campus tour where you will have the opportunity to tour our academic and athletic facilities, meet our students, faculty, and administrators, and observe classroom instruction.
