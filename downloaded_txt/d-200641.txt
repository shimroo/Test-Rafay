oh nancy





nancy pelosi pulled the "rip up the president's speech" stunt last night.

oh, nancy ... what a childish move. not a good look.

i'm not a fan of trump, but her behavior is abhorrent as well. this reminds me to spend even less mental energy on politics and focus on my own life. so, in that respect, "thank you" donald and nancy, for reminding me that d.c. is filled with clowns who couldn't care less about me.
