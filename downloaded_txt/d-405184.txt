star trek's captain picard on earl grey tea





i've never been a fan of the liquid perfume that's better known as earl grey tea, but of course we all like what we like. here's a short clip in which captain picard, of star trek: the next generation, professes his fondness for it. which leads to the obvious question - what would kirk drink?

slow motion tea time with alan rickman





our most popular video post here at tea guy speaks, and one that we feature from time to time, is a clip of actor alan rickman taking his time over a cup of tea and then doing some actorish type grimaces and gestures and whatnot. if he seems to be moving slowly do not adjust your dials. it's part of the portraits in dramatic time series, by david michalek. more at his web site.

puppet sings everything stops for tea 





the puppet pictured here apparently has something of an up and coming singing career, at least on youtube. the song dates back to at least 1935, when it was performed by one jack buchanan. it was also recorded in 1972 on an album by long john baldry, on which rod stewart and elton john appeared.
