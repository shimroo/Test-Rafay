welcome

                        to showcasing derby and derbyshire. on this website you
                        will be able to feast your eyes on the largest
                        collection of photographs of derby and derbyshire on the
                        internet.
                        as you start to look around the many pages available
                        here, you will discover that not only are there hundreds
                        of high quality photographs to view but there is also a
                        mountain of historical information for you to digest.
                        there's a huge range of ideas for places for you to
                        visit not just in the city of derby but in derbyshire
                        and the midlands.










as
                        well as being able to view traditional photographs there
                        are also very wide-angle (up to 360°) panoramic
                          photographs, which allow you to see areas as
                        though you were actually there. 360 by 180 degree
                        virtual reality photography, have a look at my world
                          wide panorama photographs which feature derby and
                        derbyshire.
night photography, which shows how different
                        things look with out daylight, this is a side which you
                        may take for granted.




then
                          & now photography, which is a unique way of
                        being able to see how things change over time. then
                        there is an ever-growing selection of old
                          photographs of derby showing how the local area
                        used to look.
                        i have an ever growing collection of local videos
                        featuring derby and derbyshire, lots of which are now
                        recorded in hd quality. have a look at my video channel
                        on youtube : comedyhunter










this
                        is a non-commercial site built and maintained by local
                        photographer andy savage. i was born in derby,
                        derbyshire, england and although i may not be that old i
                        have witnessed a lot of changes to derby over the years.
                        by using my photographic skills, website design
                        experience and a lot of research i have created what i
                        think you will agree is a very informative website about
                        my city. it features exclusive information and
                        photographs that you will not find anywhere else. 




the
                        photographs you will see are all taken using a digital
                        camera (unless otherwise specified). most of the images
                        are larger than you will see on most websites yet they
                        still load in very quickly. at the end of the day this
                        site is for the normal 56k modem user, if you
                        are lucky enough to have an adsl/cable connection then
                        you may like to view my broadband
                          enhanced section which has been designed for
                        people with broadband internet connections.










if you
                        have any information relating to any of the pages on
                        this site which you feel others may like to read then
                        please let me know, i can never know each village in as
                        much detail as the people that live in them. 
                        so every piece of local knowledge will help to make this
                        a better website. please get in touch using the
                        'feedback' option on the left side of this page.

 history
  


 



derby
                        is the only city in england to be given its name by the
                        danes. if it weren't for the vikings invading in ad873
                        the name would have been northworthy . northworthy was
                        captured by the vikings to become part of danelaw and
                        renamed deoraby, or place of the deer to signify
                        the great deer-herds that roamed the derwent valley.
                        this is why the derby crest is a buck-in-the-park, this
                        crest can be seen all over the buildings of derby. 
                        the saxons recaptured deoraby in ad917 but the danish
                        name remained. no one knows for sure when or why the
                        name changed to derby (pronounced 'dar-bee').  



 



 






for
                        those people that do not know derby's location, you will
                        find a location maps link on the left side of this page.




unfortunately
                        a lot of derby's history has been lost forever but a
                        wide variety of it remains for us to enjoy today. this
                        website will allow you to see the many wonderful
                        architectural achievements which derby has on show.










this
                        derby website is by no means a substitute for getting
                        out of your chair and going to have a look at these
                        places for your self, but if you would like to spend
                        some time here then it will be time well spent. the
                        historical information detailed here is drawn from
                        either my own knowledge or collected from varying
                        sources such as information plaques, leaflets, books and
                        videos.



this
                      website is primarily aimed at three different categories
                      of people, firstly those people in other countries that
                      wish to see what england is like. secondly for people that
                      used to live in derbyshire but have now moved to another
                      area of england or another country completely.










and
                        finally for those people in derby that like to see areas
                        they might not have been before or may not even know
                        about and to let you know historical information about
                        the places and buildings.
                        derby has changed considerably in the last few years, so
                        if it has been some time since you visited or perhaps
                        you now live in another country i recommend you have a
                        look at my photographs.



on
                      this site you will be able to look at the photographs i
                      have taken while out and about in derbyshire,
                      staffordshire, nottinghamshire and leicestershire. because
                      i was born and raised in derby most of the photographs and
                      historical information will be focused on derby but the
                      other areas are still worth featuring.










over
                        the years i intend to cover every village in derbyshire
                        but this may take a lifetime.
