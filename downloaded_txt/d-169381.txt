frequently asked questions, answered!
do you have questions or concerns about your oral health? do you want to learn more about specific dental treatments? well, the fastest way to get the answers you need is by giving us a call! of course, we understand that not everyone has a flexible schedule, and some people prefer to research online. that's why we've compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions from our patients in williamsville. read on to learn more or contact our office if you don't find the information you're looking for!



			how do i get emergency dental care?
if you're experiencing a dental emergency, reach out to our office immediately. we can help you get the necessary treatment as soon as possible. our office typically offers same-day emergency visits to ensure you receive prompt care.
keep in mind that if your emergency involves difficulty breathing or swallowing, or if you have a dislocated or broken jaw, call 911 immediately and visit your local emergency room. while the er may not be equipped to handle dental cases specifically, they can relieve discomfort and stabilize your condition until you can receive the appropriate dental treatment.
remember, many dental emergencies are signs of serious dental issues. to prevent emergencies, schedule regular checkups with our team every six months.

			how much does a dental checkup & cleaning cost in williamsville?
in williamsville, the cost of a dental checkup and cleaning typically ranges from $100 to $200. this price can vary based on factors such as the dental office, the specific services included in the checkup, and whether you have dental insurance. a standard checkup generally includes an examination, professional cleaning, and sometimes x-rays.
if you have dental insurance, your out-of-pocket costs may be significantly lower, as many insurance plans cover preventive care. for a more accurate estimate and to understand what is included, it's best to contact our office directly and ask about their specific pricing and services.

			what is the best way to find a cosmetic dentist?

			first, you'll need to do some research to ensure the practice can meet your specific smile goals. start by reviewing the cosmetic services they offer. check if the dentist has completed additional training in cosmetic dentistry, such as courses from the american academy of esthetic dentistry. look for a practice with credentials and services that match your needs. 

			what to do if you canât afford a dentist?

if you can't afford a dentist, there are several steps you can take to make dental care more affordable. one of the best ways to reduce long-term costs is to stay on top of preventive care. regular checkups and cleanings every six months can lower the risk of tooth decay, gum disease, and other problems that require more expensive treatments.
dental insurance can be a great tool to keep out-of-pocket costs low. however, if you don't have dental insurance or find it too expensive, check our special offers page to find discounts on the services you need. these options can help ensure you receive essential dental care without breaking the bank.
