[0:04] we are facing the man-made disaster of global scale.
[0:16] climate change, habitat loss, pollution and falling insect numbers
[0:18] threatening the collapse of civilizations
[0:19] and the extinction of much of the
[0:22] natural world. plastic pollution in every
[0:26] river and ocean contaminate our food and
[0:28] kill hundreds of thousands of sea birds
[0:30] and animals every year. greenhouse gas
[0:36] emissions are rising in the last 30
[0:39] years we've lost rainforest areas the
[0:41] size of south africa which are vital for
[0:44] trapping and storing excess carbon. but,
[0:49] it doesn't have to be like this...
[0:55] with the right knowledge we can make a
[0:58] difference. with the right research we
[1:01] can plan another future for our planet
[1:03] and, at bangor university you can play
[1:06] your part in doing just that. by studying
[1:09] the potential of waves and tides, for
[1:11] offshore renewable energy aboard our
[1:13] university research vessel....
[1:15] by researching honeybee behaviour and
[1:17] habitat restoration techniques at our
[1:19] university farm and reintroducing native
[1:22] species to improve pollination... by using
[1:25] internet connected devices to guide
[1:27] action on air pollution and emissions,
[1:29] nitrate levels, soil quality and solar
[1:32] energy.  that's why i chose to study at
[1:36] school of ocean sciences. of natural
[1:38] sciences, of computer science and
[1:41] electronic engineering. at bangor
[1:44] university in north wales,
[1:50] discover more about living and learning
