scottobearday 20,318day 3 prompt - bot-dogtonight, we are watching lisa frankenstein, and i found it entertaining for a diablo cody flick. the unliving, yet animated thing holding a wiener is pretty appropriate, actually. #doodle #stinktober2024 #stinktober #day3  @chrispiascik #lisafrankensteinhttps://www.instagram.com/p/dahwpxrscze/?igsh=mxh5zdc5c3prynh1dq==

scottobearday 20,313: witchy and kittywe had a lovely duck date day today. we visited the @kittycitycatcafe, @blueridgeindiemarket, and the local nursery together to breathe some outdoor air and get some little treats in the form of lovely art and vegetation suitable for autumn. (images of those to come sometime in the near future, no doubt.)we passed on old salem days because it was just way too crowded, even as an outdoor venue. next year is a definite goal, though.#doodle #witch #cat #autumnvibesüçÅ #autumnhttps://www.instagram.com/p/c_6vquumu8r/?igsh=mwuxajg3bjc2b2hzcg==

scottobearday 20,312we started watching the sleepy hollow tv series last night, and it has been surprisingly entertaining thus far. the first three episodes are oddly star-studded with folk i enjoy as secondary characters (clancy brown, orlando jones, john cho), and although it has very little to do with the original story (or the actual sleepy hollow location in new york), it has a rather entertaining premise.i figure this will be nice seasonal filler to lead us up to halloween,  at least. note‚Äîthe doodle is based on the more classic headless hessian tossing jack-o'-lanterns from a black horse, rather than the decapitated rider on a pale horse swinging an ax.of course, ichabod crane looks nothing like the classic version of that character, too. this is tv, after all...i hope they keep clancy brown for a while, fun seeing him in a mentor role to the modern-day lead character. #doodle #headlesshorseman #sleepyhollow #halloween #washingtonirving #ichabodcranehttps://www.instagram.com/p/c_3jpsgoed1/?igsh=ogl4ewr2mhllyjm4

scottobearday 20,311found this old drawing of a pumpkin dashed off back when i used a palmtop before the days of smartphones with a stylus. i think this was done about 20 years ago, give or take. so i guess you could subtract ~7300 days or thereabouts from that number at the top.different times, back then. i certainly prefer now to then. married life in virginia is certainly more my speed than being a single person in florida. prior to the clie, my drawings were on a monochrome device, with even lower resolution. the original doodle was jaggy, but i upscaled it years ago, and i have no idea where the more pixilated version is now. perhaps i will stumble over it sometime later. #doodle #pumpkin #2004ish #sonycliehttps://www.instagram.com/p/c_1rg69rvxi/?igsh=zxjraddjnzblbtq0my brother and me, easter, on or around day 1490 or so. (today is 20,311), bro, left, showed up around day 750.  note my groovy teardrop peace sign necklace and his amazing ash-blonde hair. even i was dishwater blonde in a captain kangaroo-style bowl cut (which was the fashion on the time) not shown, my matching jacket that went with the pants, channeling herb tarlick before wkrp ever aired. #atlantastreet #brotherlylove #fashion #oldphotos #folkservice #easter1973https://www.instagram.com/p/c_15wagsy8r/?igsh=zxz2bhd0bm56b205

scottobearday 20,299the in-laws are here, which means we are watching the virginia tech game. (it's the first game of the season, versus vanderbilt, the first time playing them in 30+ years.)it should be a good day. tech is favored to win, and that, in turn, should put them in a good mood. :)i see the miami hurricanes are playing the gators later, but i am not as tied to them as the folks are to their teams.#vt #hokies #vanderbilt #virginiatech #doodlehttps://www.instagram.com/p/c_v1hkjxywu/?igsh=mtgwy3k3bwxmadm5zq==
