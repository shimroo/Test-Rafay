                introduction and information. 


zetatalk leads you through the vast amount of
          information being relayed by the zetas in answer to questions posed to
          their emissary, nancy lieder. 
zetatalk answers cover such subjects as
          portents of a pole shift and how this
          relates to the transformation in
          process; how life in the aftertime
          following this shift will be different from today; the self-centered
          or service-minded spiritual orientation
          of humans as well as aliens from other worlds and how inadvertently
          giving the call to aliens can put you in
          touch with one group or the other; how visitations
          can be more easily interpreted when spiritual orientation is
          understood; how visitors from other worlds
          are watched by the council of worlds, which has set rules
          regulating their behavior; why we are only gradually getting
          acquainted with our visitors from other worlds, and what will allow
          the awakening to occur faster; to what
          extent the government is aware of and
          interacting with the alien presence; the true nature and reason for
          the hybrids being developed by the
          zetas to merge the best from both zetans and humans; why aliens can
          disappear and move through walls, and what both physical and spiritual
          density changes will be like in the
          future; what the zetas have to say about our science
          theories; what the zetas as students of human nature have concluded on
          what being human means; and straight
          zetatalk about our myths. 

love may have a blooming going into the shift, as it
            ought, those with great love in their hearts responding to the
            realization that little else matters.
