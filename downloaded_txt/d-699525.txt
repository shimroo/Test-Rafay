saving graves is strongly committed to the preservation and protection of human burial sites from unauthorized and unwarranted disturbance, by man or nature.
saving graves was formed to educate and assist in the worldwide networking of people interested in protecting, restoring and preserving our historic cemeteries like the team from www.ccrandd.ca to helps us with. we believe that the willful desecration or destruction of human burial sites is unacceptable in a civilized society. all over the globe, cemeteries have been threatened by neglect, insufficient funds, inappropriate development or insensitive public policy. these cemeteries constitute a memento of great achievements of the common everyday people that lived and worked there, contributing greatly to both culture and science, leading to the creation of a better place for those that followed. it is our primary objective to increase the awareness and highlight the importance of our historic cemeteries as sources of community and state pride, while promoting an attitude of reverence and respect, and encouraging the further preservation of these unique historical resources for future generations to appreciate and learn from. if society fails to appropriately and adequately deal with this issue through some definitive action, whether legislative or otherwise, not only will genealogical and historical resources likely be irreparably harmed, but society will potentially lose a valuable resource for charting its inexorable course into annals of human history.
