jacksonville free healthcare clinicvolunteers in medicine is a top-notch free healthcare clinic, providing high-quality healthcare as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible while maintaining our overall mission to provide healthcare for all who need it. our volunteers live by the credo that healthcare is a human right and not a privilege, and our medical teams have expertise in many healthcare fields to serve the growing needs of the working uninsured. many of these services have not been available to the working uninsured in the past, and we are proud to offer them to our patients at no cost. volunteers in medicine's outstanding healthcare services are possible through the generosity of the physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, office staff, and students who volunteer their time and expertise to our free healthcare clinic. in addition, we are a teaching site for physicians, nurse practitioners, and other health-related educational programs, plus we offer volunteer experiences to those interested in exploring medical and health-related careers. we aim to be the leader in the delivery of high-quality healthcare for the working uninsured and a model program for community-based integrated healthcare.
