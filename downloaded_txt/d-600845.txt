what others are saying…















i needed a specific screwdriver for a speaker i was fixing, so i went to pc land to see if they had one that fit. not only did they help me find a screwdriver, but within fifteen minutes i was out the door with my speaker fixed. the two people at the store were extremely friendly and helpful.- luke c.















i bought new parts for my computer to upgrade it but was too afraid to do the installation myself. the folks at pc land were more than happy to do it for me and their service was quick, high quality, and friendly. now my gaming pc is more powerful than ever and i couldn't be happier with it! they even talked me through a problem i had later over the phone. their help is much appreciated and i highly recommend them!- amber m.















this place is great! i came in to get one of the keys replaced on my macbook and it took the employee 2 seconds to replace it. the price was extremely affordable and i didn’t need an appointment which is great because i have chaotic work hours. the employees were so kind and helpful. highly recommend!!! - kelsey t.















if you want your parts right then and there pc land is a great option awesome group of people helped me so much and very knowledgeable might i ad even offered to help me build my pc right then and there so whether it's diagnosing your pc or buying new parts check out pc land- elijah c.















computer was randomly freezing and shutting down. as a computer does, it refused to crash in the store after running for days, but they told me to come back in if it happened again. when it started crashing more consistantly i came in and they were able to make a couple repairs after seeing the issue. got it my computer back the same day with no additional charge for my return visit. easy to work with and more than happy to expain what was wrong and what to look out for in the future!- mason b.















i love going here! they are the absolute best about their service. whether i need to buy something or repair something, they also make sure i am knowledgeable about my purchases/repairs. i also feel like the fee they charge for service is completely fair due to how much work they are putting in to assure that everything works. love this place and will continue to come here!- caroline l.
