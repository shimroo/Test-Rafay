welcome to crra.org 





mira announces new website
this crra.org website is no longer active, but is being maintained as  a historical record for the connecticut resources recovery  authority (“crra”).  
on june 6, 2014, public act 14-94 established the materials innovation and recycling authority  (“mira”) as the successor authority to  crra.  as of this date, mira assumed control of all of crra’s assets,  rights, duties and obligations.

=====================================================================

on june 6, 2014, governor malloy signed public act 14-94, which  establishes the materials innovation and recycling authority (“mira”) as the  successor authority to the connecticut resources recovery authority (“crra”).  pursuant to this new legislation, mira will  continue to provide solid waste materials management services, with a focus on  the development of additional resource recovery, recycling, and processing  enterprises on property owned by the authority and the attendant redevelopment  of the connecticut solid waste system.

the evolution of crra into mira will not disrupt any of the  authority’s business or business relationships.   as specified in public act 14-94, mira has assumed the rights and  responsibilities of crra in accordance with section 4-38d of the connecticut general  statutes, which addresses the transfer of functions, powers and duties from a  department, institution, agency or authority to a successor in a manner which  assures continuity.   section 4-38d essentially  provides that mira replaced crra as of the effective date of the legislation, and  that

all orders or regulations of crra remain in full  force and effect as orders or regulations of mira;
mira is substituted for crra in any outstanding  legal proceedings;
contracts, rights of action or matters  undertaken or commenced by crra will now be undertaken and completed by mira  under the same terms and conditions;
the officers and employees of crra are the  officers and employees of mira; and
all property of crra is the property of mira.

what this means for crra’s municipal and private customers,  contractors, vendors, service providers and employees is that you are now a  stakeholder in mira in the same way you were a stakeholder in crra.  mira will be conducting an ongoing review of  how these relationships are memorialized and will be following up as necessary  with any specifically required notices and documents.  in the meantime, please call me if you have  any questions or require specific documentation to continue your existing  business relationship under the governance of mira.  until notified otherwise, mira’s business  address, contact persons, phone numbers and email addresses are the same as  previously used by crra.   
sincerely,
