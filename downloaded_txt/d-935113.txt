everyday giving

do you have a desire to make a positive difference in the world but
don't feel you can because you aren't currently rich or famous?


do you feel so overwhelmed by everything you have to do that supporting
a friend or cause you feel strongly about seems impossible to fit into
your schedule?

you don't
have to be rich, famous or retired to make a difference in the world
everyday!
what thoughts come to
mind when you think of a philanthropist?

you are probably thinking of a very rich person that gives millions of
dollars to charitable causes. this person might even have a staff of
employees that investigates and recommends the specific causes to
donate money to.
although the individual you have in mind is a philanthropist, you don't
have to be rich to be one yourself. take a look at the following
definition:
                                    philanthropy

(n.) love to mankind; benevolence toward the whole human family;
universal good will; desire and readiness to do good to all men.
become an everyday
philanthropist now!

an everyday philanthropist is someone who gives unselfishly everyday
toward the good of their fellow man (and woman). giving money is not
the only way to show love, benevolence and good will. there are many
other ways for you to do this that requires little or no money. so
don't let your lack of being a multi-millionaire keep you from
improving the world we live in.

testimonial

i love
receiving
everyday giving. as the president of a national health agency local
chapter, everyday giving lifts me out of my traditional way of thinking
and reminds me there are many ways to contribute and be giving. it also
reminds me of the opportunities i have outside of my work to make a
difference.
