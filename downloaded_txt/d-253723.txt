many of our infant gifts are also appropriate for children and visa versa. church babies are a perfect gift for children who have grown past the baby bonnet size. in days of old when families worshiped together, if the children became restless, grandmother took the handkerchief from her pocket and tied it into a church baby. if dropped on the floor it did not make noise and disrupt the sermon. later, the baby is tucked away and on the wedding day the stitches are removed and the handkerchief is carried by the bride. any one of our five bibles are appropriate for most children. for a sharper picture, click on the picture for a larger view. if you would like to hear the poetry, please call us at 1-800-768-2197.
