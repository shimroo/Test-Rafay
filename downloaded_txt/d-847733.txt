welcome to the secretariat

















the secretariat’s mission is to manage and support the university’s bicameral governance system consistent with statutory requirements, the university of waterloo act, the by-laws and regulations of the board of governors and senate, and good governance practices.
we provide support services for the board of governors, the senate and their committees and ensure membership is duly constituted and bodies receive materials that support informed decision-making.  we ensure that decisions taken by senate, board and their committees are available to the university community and provide advice to senior administration and board leadership so that the process of decision-making is clear, efficient and effective.
we also support the work of faculty, staff and student relations committees which are the primary venues for collegial employee/employer and student relations activities.  we maintain the library of institutional policies and support committees and administration in the process of development and renewal of policies.
the secretariat ensures impartial support and guidance for the various quasi-judicial processes as outlined in institutional policies, agreements and practices related to faculty, staff and students.






our greatest impact happens together

the university of waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the neutral, anishinaabeg, and haudenosaunee peoples. our main campus is situated on the haldimand tract, the land granted to the six nations that includes six miles on each side of the grand river. our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the office of indigenous relations.
