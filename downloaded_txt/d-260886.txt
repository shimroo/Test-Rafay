one of the best hostels i've ever been to! felt super safe but still social and the free breakfast was much needed in such an expensive country! views from the rooms were amazing and there was so many social areas/meeting rooms/games rooms. also super super clean which was perfect!

one of the best hostels i stayed at. very organized with letters on each bed, locker, and towel. very clean. free breakfast was great before heading out for the day. staff was very helpful with recommendations and had a pamphlet with a bunch of activities you could sign up for. right down the street from ski rentals and a paraglide company. the ping-pong table and foosball was fun, ended up playing some with other guests. their kitchen has lots of stuff. they have places to work.

this hostel is clean, friendly and well-run. the facilities are well-equipped and are tended to on a daily basis. it is not a party hostel- in fact, there is christian literature 'witnessing" to people tucked away around the hostel which, while i am of a similar faith, thought was surprising and maybe a little inappropriate for a hostel. it is definitely not a place for young people who want to party. that hostel is in another part of town. however, despite my age, i love to get out, find a local pub,

15 chf for laundry was very expensive, but other than that, great facilities. shared bathrooms are somewhat small, though.
