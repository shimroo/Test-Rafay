camping in connecticut by the day, week, month or season! 
enjoy a campsite on our ten-acre, spring fed lake, and join the activities in our large recreation hall or at the lake. all campsites are appropriately equipped and the lake is well stocked with fish.
in addition to swimming and fishing, there's plenty of opportunity to go hiking, pitch horseshoes, surf the internet, play bingo, or just sit back and relax. planned activities include: childrens games & activities, bingo, pig roasts, pot luck suppers, treasure hunts, and live entertainment and dancing.
whether you're after a weekend getaway or an rv seasonal site, you'll find water's edge tops! kids love it too. we offer plenty of activities to keep the kids busy.... fishing, boating, dances, swimming, hayrides, etc. we also provide free park-wide wifi so you can keep up-to-date with email and stay in contact with your social networks.
we are group friendly, providing a dedicated group camping area (our "safari field"), shared pavilllion and shared firepits. we are also pet friendly, providing a spacious dog park (our "bark park") so that your pets can stretch their legs too.
the water's edge campground season is april 15th - october 15th. leashed pets are also welcomed throughout the park. fishing at water's edge is "catch & release".
