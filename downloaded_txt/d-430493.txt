nomadic gatherings by 
		michel guntern


the revised online edition of 
		nomadic gatherings has been upgraded for mobile devices, with a new collection of specially 
		selected 'nomadic 
		photos' to illustrate each page.
chapter 1 - taking off:
		to japan, where so much of japanese 
		life seemed uniformed with rules, rituals, and ceremony; keeping grace 
		and saving face. i bowed; they giggled.
chapter 2 - 
									kimchi and gold medals:
		the olympic ceremony was on in seoul, and 
									the event was being transmitted live to the 
									on-board television above the driver.
chapter 3 - 
									little sister:
		taiwan was a brief stop en-route from seoul to hong kong. they found it 
		amusing that i was heading for china.
chapter 4 - 
		colonial gateway:
		between the modern financial offices of central hong kong, old trams 
		trundled along des voeux road. no-one stood still. i had to get a 
		visa for china.
chapter 5 - 
									china travel:
		buying train tickets in china can often be a problem with five-day waits 
		and people camped at the station. and what if you can't speak the 
		chinese language?
chapter 6 - 
									the northern capitals:
		japan invaded manchuria in the early 1940s, and the soviets followed in 
		1945. some of the dome-shaped architecture still remains from the 
		russian period.
