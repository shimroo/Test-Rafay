time will tell what will come to and from
      paraverse dot org, or simply the paraverse as i think of this, my 
      first website.  at present our priority is publishing, for the 
      emergence of economical print on demand  allows quality work too innovative 
      for large publishers to bet on (with offset, the publisher must print 
      large  runs to bring the price down) to be published at a decent price for the first time 
      in history.  soon, publishing will become a free world, with authors 
      calling the shots, as it should be.   as our own publishers, we do 
      not need to tour, when we  at least, i  would prefer to save our limited 
      global resources and stay home to write.  we can put our books out 
      into the world and prove they have a readership without relying 
      upon the chance encounter with the right agent or editor.  and we are free 
      to produce books in english liberally strewn with chinese characters or 
      boasting delightful (rather than academic) footnotes taking the lions 
      share of the text, without being over-ruled by a gutless publisher who 
      cannot imagine readers liking such things.  in short, we may target bright 
      readers without submitting to academic or market tyranny.   
      publishing is only a decade behind music.  (after 7 years in business, we, 
      or, i -- for "we" are still a one-man operation -- feel that lag.  
      despite a rave review for one book by the top person in the field and some 
      other fine reviews by top academics in limited circulation journals, the 
      mass media, including npr(!) have yet to introduce, much yet review  
      any of my 
      books.   

      i was almost immediately picked up by the major media in japan when i 
      wrote there in the 1970's- to 80's..  knowing my work appeals to a broad, 
      albeit intellectual, readership, our conclusion must be that the major media in 
      usania does not employ people capable of judging books by their content, 
      for otherwise there is no explanation for what they do and do not review. 
      readers with connections are invited to use them. 

if you (like me) are disgusted with the crap on the nyt 
      nonfiction best-seller's list -- at present (may-june, 2009) a right wing 
      radio host is number one, for lack of competition) please do not assume, as i once did, that 
      the problem is a lack of good books.  there are any number of truly creative books out there. surely, 
      my books are not an exception. we do not 
      know about them because the review establishment is either too lazy to 
      read and select books for themselves, so they leave it up to their 
      connections, or they are, like their radio counterparts, happy with being 
      wined, dined and, perhaps worse:  on the payolla. (maybe i exaggerate 
      and the only problem is that i do not spend much time doing publicity. my 
      question to true book-lovers is this: should one have to do much 
      publicity? do book-review editors not have a responsibility to 
      introduce good books to their readers, whether or not publishers court 
      them?) 

      who can be surprised to see print newspapers start to 
      fold?  they make all sorts of excuses -- blame google -- but if you 
      ask me, the main reason is simply laziness. they overlooked what might interest their 
      readers.  if they overlooked me, who else have they failed to report 
      upon?

paraverse press hopes it will soon prove 
      to be the rule rather than the exception, that self-publishing will be 
      seen in the same light that self-producing other forms of art are viewed 
      rather than considered an exercise in vanity.   please note that 
      the author-publisher like the self-produced singer-songwriter has chosen 
      to exercise his or her freedom to create and is not necessarily a 
      second-rate artist who could not find a conventional press. that 
      press, as far as i can judge, no longer exists. i am told by academic 
      friends that even with academic presses they get precious little editing 
      help.  if that be the case . . . why not do it yourself?

i am independent not by choice but because 
      the greater good of literature now demands it.

please visit 
       paraverse press, the place for all who seek creative non-fiction that is not
      journalism, and participate in the pod revolution.

       

paraversingparaversingparaversingparaversing

so, where does the word paraverse 
      come from? almost a quarter century ago, i tried to put a piece of prose 
      into poetry and found that i could not settle on any single version as 
      the best.  the prose in question came from japans records of ancient 
      matters, the line where the male deity observes that he has a 
      part in excess and nowhere to put it, while the female deity observes 
      she has the opposite dilemma.   i thought of my dozen or so poems as
      paraverses, and only came to use the verb "to paraverse" years 
      later.  the variations on the single 6-character sentence from the  tao 
      te ching found on the welcome page were also done about this time, and 
      show that this art need not confine itself to verse.   after paraversing 
      scores of ancient japanese poems for fun, i began to translate haiku in 
      earnest and this, finally, taught me that paraversing was not mere play 
      but, surprisingly often,  the only way to bring out the multi-faceted 
      meanings of the original, without losing the wit through excessive 
      explanation.  (googling teaches us that the common(?) paraverse was born 
      in science fiction, but i did not know that when i first coined the term.  
      luckily,  the paraverse has room enough for all of us.)

unlike most games, where a solution once 
      achieved is worthless, a good paraverse is true literature, a keeper.  
      follow the  paraversing link to learn 
      more and, if you wish to do so, participate. or see the book-length 
      exposition published in 2009, a 
      dolphin in the woods.

pre-publication 
      comments 

 from haiku: keigu 
      (the authors haiku name) is not interested in making yet another 
      collection of masterpiece haiku.  he would create an exhibition of sea 
      cucumber [namako] and haiku or, to put it another way, a museum of poetic 
      language.   saibara tenki, host of informal on-line haiku 
      pub ukimidô.  (publishers note:  
      the book includes a full explanation of why poetry demanded sea cucumbers become sea slugs, 
      and, to compensate, some information on the nudibranch! )

from literature:
      uke namako (the japanese title) is the 
      most touching, fun, erudite, and altogether enjoyable thing i have read in 
      ages. it is also the most intelligent approach to japanese poetry i think 
      i have ever seen.  liza dalby, anthropologist and 
      author of 
tale of murasaki (and other fine japan-related 
      fiction and nonfiction, including kimono and geisha)
from 
      science: 
      it's amazing; i absolutely love it. i've 
      spent many years studying my little friends and have always felt that they 
      have been unkindly maligned or forgotten. the contrast between japanese 
      and european literature on cukes [sea cucumbers] couldnt be greater . . . 
      alas, the divide between science and literature, even in terminology much 
      less in theory, is quite vast at points and i admire your blending of the 
      two in a deep and satisfying way.   dr. alexander kerr, 
      habitat evolution biologist, james cook university). 
if you think
      this is something, see the reviews!
