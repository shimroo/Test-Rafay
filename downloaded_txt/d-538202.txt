bim skala bim formed in boston, ma as a ska rock band that was influenced
					by the bands in england’s 2 tone movement, as well as the music of the clash, ub40 and bob
					marley. bim’s infectious boston blue beat
					sound—a mix of upbeat 2 tone ska, rock n roll and a pinch of
						calypso—with a substantial reggae undertone led them to be one of the premier bands
					kick-starting the third wave of ska in the 1980s. other bands quickly followed their example
					resulting in a lively scene in boston and much of the united states.
