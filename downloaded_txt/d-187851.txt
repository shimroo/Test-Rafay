university chorus










the benjamin t. rome school of music, drama, and art provides a singular preparation for choral conductors and organists in service to the church, the nation, and the world. our enthusiasm for the study of choral and organ music springs from its unique position at the intersection of language, history, theology, and music. a thorough immersion in liturgical, theoretical, and historical studies converge with superlative standards of musical performance to provide an unparalleled platform for training highly motivated student musicians to thrive in significant positions.
we invite you to explore our program offerings in the linked pages below. inquiries for the master's program should be addressed to associate dean patrick tuite, tuite@cua.edu.
an audition is required for all sacred music area graduate degree programs.
