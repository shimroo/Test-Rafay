maurice whan '24                                                                                                                                                    communications
                                                                                            









ncc has felt like a home away from home as i have formed beautiful friendships that will last a lifetime. my experiences at ncc have changed me into a more independent and driven young woman. i have been able to put my aspirations first and dedicate myself to my future.

alexis brown '23                                                                                                                                                    funeral services
                                                                                            









our college is a small representation of the best of our country and society and is made up of people and families with positive values and willingness to help others in any circumstance, which for me has been a beautiful and very positive experience.

fausto castillo '22                                                                                                                                                    psychology 
                                                                                            









i know so many people who have success stories from attending northampton community college. i knew going to ncc was my best and smartest option.

kaitlyn seawood '23                                                                                                                                                    journalism
                                                                                            









being able to connect with people from different walks of life just fascinates me. every psychology class has given me a better understanding of how to connect with people.

rebecca james '21                                                                                                                                                    general studies
