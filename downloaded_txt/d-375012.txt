the musical rainbow program 

the musical rainbow program develops musicianship. children begin at age three. by the time they are in grade three they are able to read and write music notation, play bach, beethoven and mozart on the recorder, will have a good ear for music and will be able to sing in tune. they will also have a good idea as to which musical instrument they may want to learn as they grow older.  through singing songs, playing simple instruments and having lots of fun with the music games children children don't even realize how much they are learning about music. once they have graduated from the purple level of the program they are well prepared with many basic musicianship skills in order to begin private study in voice or on an instrument.
