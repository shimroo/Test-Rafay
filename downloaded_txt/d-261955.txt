rock 100 & top 40



                    find out how your favorite song or artist performed on the billboard charts between 1954 and 1991, courtesy of new orleans area author jim quirin, whose book,  
                rock 100, is the definitive ranking of the top 100 hits from each of those years.  just type in a song title, an artist's name, or a year.  there are even links 
                to listen to them.   if your song didn't make the rock 100, but did make the top 40 in 1954-2000, you can find out how well it did by searching the top 40.

airchecks

                    airchecks capture the essence of a radio station's sound. they are recordings of radio programs, highlighting the disc jockey and his presentation, 
                    the radio station's promotions and audience builders, and just enough of the music to give you an idea of what was on the station's playlist at the time. 
                    just added: more from bob walker and traffic reporter sgt. t-ben boudreaux on post-katrina wtix-fm.

random rants

                    random rants let jd blow off steam on almost any subject. he's an old, white guy, so who knows what he'll say? but he's also a radio guy, used to 
                    minding his language, so you don't have to worry about that. this is a new feature which may or may not last. it won't hurt to try one.
