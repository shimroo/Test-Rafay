i promise one can have fun without a computer, phone, or tv...wait, really???





it's been forever since i posted here. i'd love to say it's because i didn't have time, but endless online shopping excursions or browses on expedia dreaming of vacations beg to differ. this morning is a bit different though.

i have a facebook page. years from now, when i'm reading that sentence, i will probably chuckle the same way i do about having had a myspace page (noteworthy is i believe that is still active...i should check that out). and this morning, i'm considering deleting all social media.

someone i know from high school posted an amazing internet article on facebook relating to our generation. the generation stuck between the hippies of the 70s and the millennials in the 90s. reading it made me nostalgic. i'm sure part of that is because i'm getting older and am prone to feelings of nostalgia much more frequently now. but there is more to it.

i do remember going and being so excited to gather with friends in the computer lab to play the oregon trail. i remember playing the first nintendo...the one that would freeze up. the one that you would have to blow the dust out of the cartridge. the one that had the most basic of games. and ohmygoodness, was it awesome or what?!?

what i recall even more about my youth that the awesomeness of technology, was the lack thereof. i remember being sent outside after breakfast with my sister to play. we took some barbie dolls...lovingly kept inside trash bags (no joke!). sometimes we took nothing.

and...we...played.

we didn't just play, but we survived. and thrived! we had to find our own creativity. we made up games. we rubbed weeds between our hands to get the seeds out to see who could fill a pail the quickest. we played in lake p.i.t.a after a big rain (appropriately standing for pain in the a**) with no shoes on. we played in the barn on our property that was at least 100 years old and falling apart. we crawled on bales of hay in our neighbors barn and pretended the high stacks were forts. i remember my shoes getting stuck in the mud outside and when my feet slipped out, i ignored it and kept playing anyway. i remember going to a friends house and walking in the woods down to the creek, where we swung from a rope across that creek. i remember my mom inventing the game "first bounce fly" which was a childhood favorite for my sister and i. i remember gathering around the tv at night once per week to watch rescue 911 and america's funniest home videos. on saturday mornings, we got up early and watched cartoons until my parents awoke. and that was all the tv we watched. my childhood was filled with sunburns. it was filled with koolaid. and i mean the packages that didn't contain sugar, you had to add it yourself. my mom would only add half the sugar and it was still delicious. i'm from the generation that still had convenience stores owned and operated by the older folks who didn't have air conditioning and delighted in our uncertainty at which pieces of penny candy we would buy with our newly earned dime. we had bubble gum cigarettes that blew flour out the bottom. no one balked at the message it was sending. it was funny and i grew up knowing cigarettes were bad. i just thought the things were cool.

what will the memories of today's youth be? will they have any? a generation spent on a smart phone, playing angry birds and tweeting that they went poop today. a generation that is either the bullied or the bully on social media...it's rare to be stuck somewhere in the middle. i was bullied in school. i was made fun of daily, and to a point where i even contemplated suicide at times. i cannot even imagine what the youth of today battle from bullies. pictures and harassment on facebook, it scares me to think of what my own child will endure at school.

and the youth of today, will they actually have any memories of their youth? is there anything in their life that brings them inner joy without it being manufactured in a game or on a computer screen? will they understand that happiness comes from within, not from how many likes a post gets or how many followers one has on twitter?

i've never been overly popular. i will say that i found my niche in the military, where i had a nice amount of friends in boot camp and beyond. even still, my friends list on social media has always remained under 200, and even still that seems to be too many in my opinion. do today's youth understand what a real friend is? do they understand it isn't just about someone liking your post sometimes? that it's a bond between two or more people? i would never survive in the youth of today. i'm sure it's because i just have a different mentality, but my world doesn't revolve around those things. sure, i got trapped in the newness of posting everything on social media. i aired my dirty laundry, thinking that anyone but me cared what was going on. i find that i'm even still guilty of this sometimes today, although on a lesser scale and definitely not as often as before. today, i value privacy more than advertising everything to any millenial bored enough to read it. i have this blog, hidden in the world because it's only for me. and that's enough.

today, and hopefully for many days to come, the tv is going off. games and phones will be put away. do i really need them anyway? my child has asked that we go outside and play. that's what we will do. we will go nowhere, but we will have so much fun doing it.

and maybe, just maybe, he can have some of the awesomeness in his childhood that i had in my own. i hope i can be that good of a mom.

in memorium

sometimes people cannot understand the bond between man and animal. those people didn't know my bootsie bear and me. i still miss him every day, and celebrate every anniversary. my heart still aches, but somehow life has gone on. my bed feels empty at times, but my dreams keep his memory alive. i cannot wait to see you again sweets, and i love you more today than yesterday. i'm sorry you were sick, and i'm sorry i couldn't make you better. but i promise with everything in me that i will never forget you and i will always always love you.  ~~love, mommy
