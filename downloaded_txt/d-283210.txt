"isadora’s work continues to be relevant and universal. her dance, with its heartfelt, passion-driven movement, expresses the energy that flows through all living things.  when i first witnessed the beauty of duncan dance, i was overcome by the discovery that a dance this free was available to me. today, a new generation of dancers is breathing its own powerful vitality into isadora’s timeless choreography. "
