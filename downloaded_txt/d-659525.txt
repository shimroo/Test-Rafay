remembering billy causey
noaaâs office of national marine sanctuaries mourns the passing of billy causey, the first superintendent of florida keys national marine sanctuary who passed last week at the age of 81.
causey was an important contributor to the installation of the original mooring buoys at east and west flower garden banks in 1990. he also brought his expertise in installing moorings in the florida keys.






missing sofar spotter buoy recovered
in june 2023, the sanctuary research team installed a newâ real-time sofar spotter buoyâ (yellow object in photo) at east flower garden bank.â this new buoy provides wave height and wind speed, as well as temperatures from the surface and at reef cap depth.â it is a great tool for both staff and visitors to assess current offshore conditions.â 
on september 11, 2024, this spotter buoy was dislodged by hurricane francine and went wandering in the gulf of mexico. fortunately, the gps beacon was still active and we could track its movements through the sofar dashboard.
by september 18, the buoy had looped back around to the sanctuary and the research team, which was already offshore at stetson bank, was able to make a late night run to west flower garden bank and retrieve it. now, we'll have to refurbish the buoy a bit before it can be redeployed.
thanks to all who have been following along as we tracked the buoy and tried to recover it. it was quite an adventure!






new sanctuary poster 
check out the flower garden banks national marine sanctuary poster in theâ noaa office of national marine sanctuariesâ 50th anniversary save spectacular posterâ series. it's all about us!â 
while fgbnms is best known for its beautiful coral reefs, they only account for a tiny fraction (2%) of the entire sanctuary. the majority of sanctuary habitats lie deeper beneath the waves in an area known as the mesophotic or "twilight" zone. scuba and remotely operated vehicle (rov) technologies allow us to explore and learn about all of these areas.
our commemorative sanctuary poster reflects this in full color graphic art. you'll find coral reef habitat and sea life featured prominently in the foreground, with deep reef features in shadow below them. scuba divers descend from the surface while an rov explores the depths, with its umbilical connected to our fantastic research vessel (r/v) manta at the surface. and, of course, a graceful manta ray, swims through the whole scene. we love it, and we know you will too!
download a poster today or visit us at a community event to pick one up in-person.â 
 






2023 education & research reports
at the end of every fiscal year (october 1-september 30) our education and science teams put together reports to summarize all that was accomplished. the reports for 2023 are now available.
on the education side of things, programs, trainings, and events reached almost 4,000 people,  while our exhibits placed information about the sanctuary in front of another  3.4 million zoo, aquarium, and museum visitors.
on the science side of things, research efforts were primarily focused on coral disease  analysis, climate stressors and vulnerability, reef monitoring, and data  analysis, while resource protection activities focused on improved mooring designs  for increased durability.

divers! please help prevent the spread of coral disease to fgbnms
florida’s coral reefs are currently experiencing a  multi-year  outbreak of a stony coral tissue loss disease (sctld) that has now spread over 200 miles across the florida reef tract, and several caribbean locations.
the disease appears to be caused by bacteria, and may be transmitted to other corals through direct contact and water circulation, meaning that divers and their gear may potentially spread this disease between sites.
as a result, we are asking divers to make sure they properly disinfect their dive gear before visiting flower garden banks national marine sanctuary, in the hopes of preventing this deadly disease from reaching our otherwise healthy reefs.

what is a bank?
when most of us hear the word ‘bank’ we think of financial institutions and money, but banks in the ocean have a different value. â 
 discover what makes a bank so special, and how banks feature  prominently in three different national marine sanctuaries.
uncover the ocean treasures of flower garden banks, cordell bank, and stellwagen bank national marine sanctuaries in our new story map...
fantastic ocean places you can bank on!






virtual dive gallery
can’t get to your national marine sanctuaries? thanks to the wonders of 360-degree photography, videography, and virtual reality, these underwater treasures are now just a few mouse clicks away. 
noaa’s office of national marine sanctuaries (onms) has launched aâ virtual dive gallery, complete with immersive 360-degree images of eight national marine sanctuaries including the flower garden banks.
in celebration of world ocean day 2020, onms has now launched virtual reality voyages usingâ 360-degree videos! whether you live on a coast or in a community far from the shore,â we invite you to experience the power and beauty of america’s underwater treasures. 
along with these videos,â lesson plansâ have been developed for educators to further engage middle school students with the virtual dive experience. these lessons take you deeper into each video and align with leading science standards and ocean literacy principles.â

sanctuary expansion
on january 19, 2021, flower garden banks national marine sanctuary was expanded from 56 square miles to 160 square miles to protect additional critical habitat in the gulf of mexico. this means that the sanctuary is now made up of 17 different banks within 19 separate boundaries. you can explore the entire sanctuary and it's surroundings within the story map below.
