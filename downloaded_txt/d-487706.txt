"i praise you
because i am 
fearfully and wonderfully
made."




our mission
breath of life maternity ministries is called to care for expectant mothers needing shelter, encouragement, and hope. often, they have no one else to turn to.
each day, we remind them that they and their babies are fearfully and wonderfully made. their choice to carry to full term honors their creator, as well as his creation. you can honor them in return. your gifts reassure them they are not alone.

testimonials
 



“your love has changed our lives, our hope for the future and the lives of our children.”“after that first phone call, and the counseling and hugs and prayers that came later, we were able to get past the fear and uncertainty simply because god sent these people to love our family when we needed it the most.”“...through all of it – they were there. whether it was to give me a scripture to lift my heart, or offer me a box of kleenex when i was down, or tell me some silly joke or even hand me a teddy bear to hold – especially to hold – they were always there.  and they still are.”
