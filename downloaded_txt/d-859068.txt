all one story 











all our homes are single story and intentionally built with features to maximize your independence and longevity in your home.  















designed for active adults 











our amenities focus on a lifestyle of low maintenance, passive amenities, community gathering places, and downsizing home design practices. 















minimal upkeep 











our design concept consists of low-maintenance lots with plenty of room for outdoor spaces, brick privacy fences and included front lawn maintenance.
