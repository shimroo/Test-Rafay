what is garden with insight?

  the garden with insight garden simulator
  is an 
educational simulation that uses weather, 
soil, and plant growth 
models to simulate a simple garden in an open-ended 
microworld setting. 
you can plant vegetables and grow them 
to learn more about plants, the soil, the weather, gardening, and science.
  







how can i find out more?

check out garden with insight's features
and requirements;
look over some screen shots;
look through the on-line tutorial
to see what using the software is like;
read our introduction into the simulation's 
models for a look under the hood; and
read our notes to teachers and 
parents.

we've also placed the entire 600+ page help system
on-line; you can use it as a resource to learn about things like

nutrient cycling,
ph,
soil porosity,
movement of water through the soil,
photosynthesis,
leaf area index,
heat unit index,
plant competition for water and
nutrients, and 
about simulations in general.









great! how do i get it?

you can download garden with insight right now!

what does it run on?

garden with insight requires windows 95/98/nt. 

  








how much does it cost?

it's free! garden with insight is released under the 
general public license (gpl), which means that
anyone can use the program and source code. 
if you're a programmer
(or you're learning to program), check out our 
guide to the 
downloadable gwi source code.

  







 
this looks like you must have put a lot of work into it! why is it free?

we sure did put a lot of work into it -- six person-years of work. 
thanks for noticing. why is it free?
it's a long story. something like this:

the project was much more difficult than we had originally expected
(here's a little history);
it was a labor of love (i.e., we didn't have any funding);
we're not as good at marketing as we thought we would be; and
in the end, we didn't have enough money left to market it.

besides, making money was never as important to us as making a great product that
helps people to learn about sustainable gardening.
here's a longer answer.

  








can i pay you something anyway?

sure! if you like garden with insight and you want to help support our work,
we invite you to register one of our other 
fine products.

  







what's in the future for garden with insight?

well, at the moment we're spending 
most of our time consulting for fortune 500 companies
to pay off the cost of developing gwi and our other products.
we're awaiting further funding to improve gwi. 

if you know anyone on a foundation board who might be interested in helping
us continue to support environmental education, put in a good word for us.
(seriously.)
or if you have resources and are interested in collaboration, we'd love
to hear from you.

there's some discussion of the future
of gwi on our why it's free page; and we've posted a 
grant proposal and book proposal
that give you an idea of what we're hoping to do in the future. 

we'd also love
to hear your opinions of where you'd like to see garden with insight go from here;
send your wish list of gwi 2.0 features to 
gwi@kurtz-fernhout.com.
