the bbc's open hostility to the incoming trump administration






i am disturbed by the bbc's open hostility to the incoming trump administration.

the behaviour of the national broadcaster may be doing serious damage to the interests of the united kingdom.

i am not willing for my taxes to used by individuals in the bbc to propagate their extreme "liberal" (sic) views.

angus robertson asked a clever-clever question about the expected demise of the northern ireland assembly






at prime minister's questions the snp's leader angus robertson asked a clever-clever question about the expected demise of the northern ireland assembly requiring the postponement of article 50:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38586483

far from holding us up, it is encouraging to think that the entire brexit process could be carried out during a period of direct rule of northern ireland - far from getting a veto, or even having their views consulted, sinn fein have ensured they will have no voice in the brexit process because they will have no official status in a devolved administration.

looking at the irish situation from a wider perspective, brexit means effectively the ending of any logic to the power-sharing process.

the good friday agreement was based on the assumption that the border between the irish republic and the united kingdom would fade in importance as each country became provinces of the eu.

this is not now going to happen.

personally i think it would be good to have a hard border with the irish republic and certainly i want to see the ending of the automatic right for southern irish people to enter the united kingdom and vote in our elections.

since brexit the world has changed






when even the party of open door immigration is wheeling out their most left-wing leader ever to announce (in a half-hearted way so that you suspect he had his fingers crossed) that free movement might possible need to end you know that things are changing:  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-brexit-eu-immigration-high-pay-latest-chaos-single-market-a7520366.html

forget the qualifications and the weasel words.

focus on the fact that he had to address the subject in the first place.

since brexit the world has changed.

a nation state requires political parties that are nationalist.

as we have seen today, the labour leadership is not capable of expressing nationalism.

therefore they will have nothing relevant to say to the british people.

how many of the current house of commons will be able to turn themselves into nationalist poiticians?  less than a third one suspects.  we are in a pre-1973 world (even perhaps a pre-1968 world) when it comes to the new language politicians will need to learn.

moral leadership
























have just finished reading the czar's madman by jaan kross.  it is a wonderful book about the stand of one principled individual against a monolithic state that will tolerate no dissension.  obviously my reading of the book was coloured by the brexit struggle.

point one of timo von bock's draft constitution:  the christian faith must be the foundation of our social order.

it is a point we need to take notice of as we plan the post-brexit nation state.

and yet the church of england is in no condition to give moral leadership. 

since john major, bishops have not been appointed on the advice of the prime minister.  bishops have appointed themselves.  and like all self-perpetuating elites they have become corrupt.

i would like to see theresa may reasserting control over the appointment of bishops so that the connection between the church and the people is restored.

how diminished she looked






















snp leader nicola sturgeon interviewed on the andrew marr show this morning:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04nrnpx

and i thought how diminished she looked.

not for the first time she mentioned that a million people in scotland voted leave.  it was almost as if she wanted to use this fact as a reason why she is not able to press on with a second independence referendum.  as most commentators agree, if she called a second referendum she would lose.

the leave vote has profound long-term implications for the snp.

the revival of a british nation state offers a rival nationalism to the snp's variety of scottish nationalism.

if handled well, british nationalism could prove to be more appealing than the lightweight scottish variety with its ersatz narratives.

perhaps ms sturgeon already feels support ebbing away.

i thought we were going to see an end to political campaigning by charities






what are we to make of the claim by the red cross that the united kingdom is facing an humanitarian crisis?  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38538637

is the united kingdom really on a par with syria, somalia and eritrea?

or is this political grandstand by a supposed "charity" that is stuffed full of blairite placemen and cronies and is playing domestic politics with the money that the public has donated thinking it is going to a good cause?

i thought we were going to see an end to political campaigning by charities?

time to take the red cross charitable status away.

the game is up for the pro-immigration ideologues





















the appearance of michael gove on dateline london earlier today immediately promoted that programme to the first rank of news and current affairs analysis.

mr gove advised us that sir vince cable (former libdem mp and minister) had written an article critical of free movement.

you can read the article on the new statesman website:  http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/01/why-its-time-end-eu-free-movement

when even fanatics such as vince cable (and he is a fanatic, for all his measured delivery) abandon their commitment to free movement you know the game is up for the pro-immigration ideologues.

since the 1960s the left has used immigration as a way of diluting the british nation state, with the aim of destroying that nation state.  but the british nation state has proved to be too resilient.  as a powellite conservative it is a sweet moment when even fanatics such as vince cable are indulging in self-criticism.

the siren voices softly insisting we stay part of the single market






weasel words from snp leader nicola sturgeon, offering to "co-operate" with brexit so long as the united kingdom stays part of the single market:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38528058

no-one should be fooled by the siren voices softly insisting we stay part of the single market.

the intention of these people is to keep the united kingdom so close to the eu that a future pro-eu government (perhaps a lab-lib-snp coalition) can take us quickly back into the european union with the minimum of fuss.

that is why we need to leave the single market, whatever the economic circumstances.

brexit must be permanent.

brexit must mean brexit.

an attack on british democracy






channel 4 news this evening led with the alleged russian hacking that is supposed to have influenced the american elections:  https://www.channel4.com/news/russian-hacking-controversy-in-us-elections

senator john mccain has called russian interference “an unprecedented attack on our democracy”.

when president barack obama interfered in the british referendum on eu membership was that an attack on british democracy?

back of the queue indeed!

i hope theresa may makes it clear to the obama family that they are not welcome in the united kingdom after 20th january.

and if by any chance mr obama does turn up in future years at heathrow, can we make sure he is at the back of the queue for the passport checks.
