testimonialanother great time at the empress, had a minor hick up at check in as my credit card needed to be called to okay the charge. the staff was more than happy to let us check in and come back down to sort out the issue. we had a good time in the club and breakfast was waiting for us in the am. 
michael b, gueststayed one night and it was a wonderful experence. came to the area to hear a band play at the saint and really had no idea to get around the area. the gentleman at the desk helped me with the taxis and was just so helpful! the room was very nice and comfy also. i will definitely stay here again when coming to the area.
janetdobbs, guesti love staying here and when i stay in ocean grove, i go to their pool daily! the pool is kept very clean by mario (thank you, mario). also the staff are very friendly and accommodating! as a matter of fact i’m booked to stay there in 2017 for an expanded memorial weekend. i’m going to buy the vip summer membership to go to the pool when i make daily trips there! i love, love, love that pool! perfect place to read and relax!
