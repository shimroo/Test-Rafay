  arizona & pacific railroad 






 
          

the arizona and pacific railroad is a project of john sayre (with help from my brother david) located in peoria, 
arizona a rapidly growing suburb northwest of phoenix. the current line consists of approximately 700 feet of 
mainline and over 1000 feet of sidetracks that travel among fruit trees and gardens and past our brick observation 
patios. we have ten switches, one crossing signal, five trestles, water tank, gallows style turntable, transfer table, 
one-stall engine house and a three-stall engine house currently in place.

we are 16 inch gauge and utilize 12 pound rail throughout our railroad. some of our structures like the engine houses, 
steps and platforms are built to human scale; the water tank, turntable, lamp posts and others are built to 5/12ths narrow 
gauge scale. custom lamp posts are spaced throughout the property and provide a âperiod lookâ for night time operation.

the roster of motive power includes miniature train company g-16 no.582 and five allan herschell s-16s. 
the s-16s are builder numbers 59-1866, 59-1873, 59-1875, 60-1880 and 62-1898. a âbâ unit and three coaches 
complete the g-16 equipment. a track inspection car, two speeders, a handcar, two mow trailers, a tool car, 
ballast car and a jordan spreader fill out the mow roster. four of our five gondolas are equipped with 
seats to carry passengers on the a & p. for more details on our equipment, please see our equipment roster

the a & p rr can trace its origins to a fall day in 1994 when the sayre bros. attended a rare open house at the 
flagstaff and middle verde railroad of malcolm and martha mackey in camp verde, arizona and "got hooked" on allan herschell 
and miniature train company equipment and its operation. we purchased our first significant piece of equipment in may of the 
following year.

the three stall engine house was recently completed and is covered with stone native to northern arizona. the structure is 
designed to have the look and feel of a turn of the century narrow gauge railroad structure that might have stood along the rail 
in turn-of-the-century colorado.  in addition to the three engines, the structure houses several displays of allan herschell and 
miniature train company collectibles. among the many displays are vintage catalogs and photographs, restored mtc crossing signals, 
block signals, cross bucks, right and  left hand switch stands, a mtc track gauge and too many more items to mention. mtc g-12 no. 377 
will eventually be displayed in the main engine house as well.

we currently have six engines at arizona and pacific railroad.
 

         

engine no. 1 of the a & p rr, the "phoenix",was our first engine and remains the workhorse of the railroad. it was 
originally purchased by del webb (1959) and operated at his hiway house hotel and convention center in phoenix. the 
history of the engine can be found  here.

the âsanduskyâ engine (no. 2) was one of two s-16s that originally operated at cedar point amusement park in 
sandusky, ohio.  we acquired that engine in 1996.  the history of the engine can be found  here.

the âbumble beeâ engine (no. 37) originally operated at the base of a ski resort in red river, new mexico (near taos).  
the engine and tender sheet metal have been modified to have the feel of the denver and rio grande âbumble beeâ engines 
popular in the 1950s.  the history of the engine can be found  here.

the tucson was installed at the del webb hiway house hotel and convention center in tucson, arizona in january of 1960.
it later became the first engine at the flagstaff and middle verde railroad. 
the history of the tucson engine can be found  here.

the coconino originally operated at playland amusement park in rye, ny and underwent major restoration at the flagstaff and middle
verde railroad. the history of the coconino can be found  here.

our g-16, no. 582, first operated in indianapolis at the short-lived little america amusement park. it was originally shipped on 
october 29, 1951. the history of the engine can be found  here.

we pay tremendous attention to detail in the contruction or restoration of each one of our projects and as 
a result our projects don't get completed as quickly as those of some other enthusiasts.  
we are, however, very pleased as are others with the finished projects. we hope you enjoy 
some of our before and after photos as well as our construction photographs.  
 

















         

we are a private railroad and not open to the public or drop-in guests. working a 50+ 
hour a week job necessitates that policy. requests in advance to visit by other park 
train enthusiasts are welcome when schedules permit.
