inova t3r

inova's most exciting new product is the remarkable t3r flashlight system. although
it delivers a blinding 234 lumens, it is both smaller and lighter than its big brother t4r
rechargeable flashlight.  and the t3r is inova's first flashlight that can be recharged
from a standard usb port (not to worry, it also includes ac and dc charger modules).

source.  but now we have an exciting new alternative: glo-toob electronic lightsticks.
available in original on/off or new special-effects models.  three leds in your choice

inova 24/7       
              

inova microlight

do you need a powerful but portable ultraviolet lamp?  the majority of stationary and
portable ultraviolet lamps are both expensive and bulky, and utilize costly fluorescent
tubes that generate excess heat, can be broken easily, and require periodic replace-
ment. but the inova x5 ultraviolet is both small and durable, the perfect uv solution
for everything from laboratory and workshop applications to currency strip verification.
this superb new instrument is now available from stock, ready for immediate delivery.

do you have a favorite old coleman fluorescent lantern that needs new tubes or other
spare parts?  click
here  to see our easy-to-use listings of popular models.  for many
of these, we offer low-cost cool white and warm white color tubes (that offer improved
appearance for food and flesh tones), in addition to factory brand daylight color tubes.
and we have hard-to-find batteries for the twin-tube and retro rechargeable lanterns
