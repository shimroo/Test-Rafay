new study using ai-powered analysis identifies combinations of social barriers impacting health outcomes.
most doctors’ visits focus on reviewing medical information such as cholesterol levels and symptoms like a persistent cough to diagnose and treat health conditions. however, discussions rarely touch on nonmedical factors, such as whether a patient has reliable transportation to attend follow-up appointments. missing critical appointments like radiation therapy to treat a lung tumor due to lack of transport could worsen health outcomes and complicate recovery.
