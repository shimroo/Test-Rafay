“if i could give a bajillion stars for this catering company i would. ...their performance stations menu was extensive...they executed my vision without a hitch.  everyone in my family kept raving about how amazing the food and service was.  from our seafood station to our steak carving station to our pasta station.  jordan and benji were so amazing with helping us set up and the entire set up was just amazing.  thank you wild thyme, you are officially my go-to caterer for any party i throw now and i look forward to booking you for all of our future events!”

— stephanie m.




“...fell in love with what they had to offer. they cater businesses, small and large events, with food, some drinks, and accessories. their menu choices are huge! we stuck with their appetizer trays during cocktail hour, and cheese and fruit station, and a 2 course meal.the tasting setting was so cute and very intimate. matthew made sure everyone was comfortable and listened to what we wanted for our event, and even gave suggestions. he also brought some other seasonal menu options for us to taste in case. the chef of the tasting was also spectacular. she had an eye for plating and pairing flavors together even for the 5 of us....the wild thyme company is awesome. you should use them for your next event. din din yummy. *2 thumbs up*”

— darline g.
