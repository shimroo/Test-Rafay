lekkages en andere ongemakken zijn binnenkort verleden tijd voor volkskeuken de sering in amsterdam-sloterdijk, nadat afgelopen weekend werd gestart met de sloop van de keuken. en die verbouwing gaat veel sneller dan gedacht, dankzij de hulp van een onverwacht grote groep vrijwilligers. “als alles zo doorgaat, hebben we in 4,5 dag alles eruit getrokken én staat er een nieuwe keuken,” zegt medeoprichter daan dorr. met een beetje geluk kan de keuken hierdoor vrijdag alweer open.

mediamatic has its own urban agriculture system in the form of a now anthroponics greenhouse at the biotoop dijkspark, near amsterdam central station.
we first started with an aquaponics system, which is a way to grow plants and fish together in a closed system. the fish excrete ammonia, which gets transformed by bacteria into nitrate, the latter being used from the plants.
now, after some ethical considerations and practical hindrance, we're solely relying on human excrement and canal water. by: eszter jámbor

in this workshop you will be introduced to scent extraction and the distillation process. distillation is the process of extracting essential oils from plant based materials. we'll explore the process of transforming everyday citrus peels (orange, mandarin, lemon, lime)into fragrant essential oils.

what you will do
during this workshop, you will be introduced to the process of distillation. together we'll transform a product that is normally thrown away, citrus peels, into precious essential oil. after learning about different distilling techniques, you'll get hands-on experience combining raw materials and eventually extracting their essence. by the end we will transform the distilled oil into a bath or shower product and you go home with a little bottle of it.
