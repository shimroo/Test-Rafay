about the author




i’ve been writing my entire life and currently have two books out. the first book: a void droid, is a story about how a renegade ai being struggles to fit into a society that has earmarked him for destruction. my second book: alicia, is about a person who is faced with a life-changing proposition to explore the universe.
raised on a small farm in northeastern wisconsin, my young life was an idyllic tom sawyer existence. my brothers and i would be gone all day exploring the sandy shores of lake michigan. this all changed when the farm burned to the ground, and we were forced to move. the event left my parents in a financial crisis and my teen years were spent in abject poverty. the school became a hostile unwelcoming place and at 16 i forged my birth certificate to get into the army. children and family life brought responsibility. i got hired to work in a library in a mental health facility where i conducted literature searches for the resident doctors. i moved on from the library to work the units and stayed in the mental health field in a career that spanned 30 years. i’m now retired.

a void droid a philosophical look into how an ai-based being might learn to assimilate into a human society. outlawed and a fugitive, this being must learn to adapt and survive. an encrypted code gives him a head start but is very basic, and he must learn what is right and wrong, moral, and ethical, and create his standards to live by.
