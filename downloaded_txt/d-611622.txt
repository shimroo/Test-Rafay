"there's a way of gentle caring"
by gary ritner

there's a way of gentle caring
and of giving thanks to god
for all god has done we can love and live as one,
all sisters and brothers are we.

with these loving words do we
become what god made us, 
beautiful child of the son.

  we can have a heart that's loving
not rejecting any neighbor;
seeing good in everyone;
building up not tearing down
giving life so all may live.

 


with too much critique we whither,
but loving light makes us,
ripened fruit of the vine.

morning worship, and three other arrangements and lyrics for worship 1993.

traveling

growing up in provincial west virginia, i longed to travel until satisfied - which came eventually. ten years in new york city helped to satisfy my thirst for seeing the rest of the world. during those years i also spent many summer days in maine, paris and other parts of france. for four months, i crisscrossed europe and the british isles. warm days in the florida and arizona sunshine were a welcome escape from long northern winters. pilgrimages to play the old course at st. andrews and pebble beach (2 of 3 courses in the annual at&t tournament) enabled me to experience the majesty of these holy places of golf. miracles of nature touched me deeply on trips to the coast of oregon, virginia and north carolina as well as new orleans, san diego and phoenix. driving around the country from east to west and north to south provided opportunities to marvel at the expanse of the us and the diversity of cultures. lately i am content to stay nearer home and cherish the memories of travel without the inconveniences.
