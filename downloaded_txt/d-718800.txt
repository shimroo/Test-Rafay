you can make a difference as a mentor












"my little sister, rae, has been talkative, but i think she's been able to become more comfortable and open to who she is. i'm normally an introvert, and rae brings out a chatty side of me! we're always talking,  joking, and being lighthearted."

big sister morgan








"i was matched before i had kids of my own, so [being a big] allowed me to develop patience, empathy, and the ability to lead by example. all things that have proved so valuable as a parent. "

big brother steve








"being a big isn't a one-way connection where i'm the one providing support for him, or giving him the ability to grow. it's something where i've also changed throughout. this is an opportunity for both the big and little to grow into being better people."

big brother miles








"we met when he was 8 years old and not very tall, and now he's 6'4 or 6'5 calling me a shrimp! from the time that he was young and looking at who he is now, he's just much more confident,  and he's got a little 'swag' to him."

big brother tory








"as a psychologist, i know the short and long term impact a positive, meaningful relationship between a big and little can have on the child. having been a big for 5 littles over 30 years, i’ve been fortunate to see each one grow and thrive."

big brother joe








"just take the leap! the big brothers big sisters program matches you so well that after an hour, i feel like we'd known each other forever."

big sister kat








"i’m a big fan of giving back to the community, and mentoring is one mechanism of doing so. for me, it's about the personal satisfaction and fulfillment in helping others succeed, grow, and achieve their goals. there's no better feeling than that!"

big brother elias








"my big sister has helped me set achievable goals, excel academically, and get ready to attend college. i'm excited to have her  as a friend for life!"
