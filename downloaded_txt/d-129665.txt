named for revolutionary war hero francis marion (the ‚Äúswamp fox‚Äù), the francis marion hotel became an instant charleston landmark when it opened in 1924. rising 12 stories above the historic district, the hotel offers spectacular views of charleston‚Äôs church steeples, historic mansions, and famous harbor, providing easy access to the wealth of charleston‚Äôs attractions.
with continuous restorations throughout the years, the francis marion features 234 modern and comfortable guestrooms and suites while preserving our historical architecture. located downtown on marion square, the hotel is within walking distance of the magnificent gardens, house museums, antique shops, local boutiques, restaurants, and nightlife that has made charleston one of the south‚Äôs premier cities.
