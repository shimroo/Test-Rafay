  |  moving to south beach






south beach features a picture-perfect combination of blue skies, turquoise ocean waters, and lush palm trees. it’s a lively, charming neighborhood that is full of wonderful opposites. its character positively exceeds its stereotypical miami reputation. this region is historical and contemporary, diverse and tiny. south beach is a community where celebrities rub shoulders with hipsters, artists, locals and tourists among the laid-back lounge bars, eclectic sidewalk cafes, energetic clubs and hip designer boutiques. for the most action within south beach, head to the areas near collins avenue and ocean drive between 5th street. or, spend a day on lincoln road and its miles-long outdoor mall.
if you’re about to relocate to this lovely neighborhood, use this helpful guide from cheap movers miami (site here). this local mover offers moving services from fort lauderdale all the way to the keys, ensuring all miami residents have access to licensed, affordable moves.
south of fifth street
south of 5th street, you’ll find a trendy area that’s known as sofi. it is home to numerous big-name celebrities as well as some of miami’s best restaurants. this includes joe’s stone crab where you can get some of the world’s most succulent crab claws and the creamiest key lime pie anywhere.
while vibrant in its right, this prime location has less of a hectic vibe. however, it’s one of the top-rated global destinations and the most sought-after in miami beach. high-rise condos along the atlantic provide some of the best ocean views while art deco buildings add character and culture to the landscape. living here means enjoying the uppermost level of luxury.
south pointe park
if you want to get away from the urban hustle and bustle, head to south pointe park. since this meticulously maintained beach and park area is located near the government cut channel and bordered by the atlantic, you’ll get spectacular 360-degree water views. plus, you can watch cruise ships sailing by.
the 18-acre park features various walking paths, a nice grassy area, and a food stand. it is home to a variety of contemporary art sculptures, so you can enjoy a dose of culture too while you’re here. this family-friendly area also has a miniature water park, a tot lot, and a dog park.
frolic around miami’s famous south beach
miami beach marina
the marina of miami beach accommodates water vessels up to 250 feet in size. all 400 slips offer immediate deep-water entry to the ocean without having to worry about bridges. the venue is ideal for any water sports, including cruising, powerboat racing, jet skiing and sailing. it’s also a great spot for fishing.
art and culture
south beach is full of museums, theaters, galleries, performance halls and many other cultural establishments. you’ll also find many festivals, events, and exhibits that display the world’s most talented artists and performers. the whole community has a diverse and exciting culture that’s on display everywhere. cultural highlights include the jewish museum of florida, the brass museum of art and the wolfsonian.

you may have heard the rumblings this week about the upcoming blue apron ipo. this meal delivery service got its start just five years ago but has already morphed into a $2 billion company. with $800 million in sales in 2016, the company shipped over 4 million orders in the 1st quarter of 2017. this company might be dominating the multi-billion-dollar food delivery industry, but there are dozens of other players trying to gain market share.
if you’re interested in trying blue apron or one of its competitors for yourself, we’ve gathered data on the latest coupons and discounts on first-time orders. most of the major delivery services offer steeply discounted rates to entice new customers. here are some that deliver in miami, fl:
blue apron
the king of the meal delivery kits, blue apron is also one of the most affordable options on the market. while blue apron lacks dietary choices (i.e. no paleo or gluten-free options), all plans are priced at under $10/serving. for most people, this is more affordable than grabbing take out on the way home from work or dining out. though no longer offering a free trial, right now blue apron is offering $20 off your first order, which means you can snag a 2-person box with 3 meals for just under $40.
marley spoon
marley spoon got its start in europe, but when it hopped across the pond, it picked up famed home chef martha stewart to be its u.s. brand ambassador. the service offers meal kits designed for two or four people, with 2-4 meals per person. prices range from $48 a box to $139.20 a box ($12 to $8.70 a serving), but right now you can score $30 off your first deliver.
freshly
if the idea of still having to spend time in front of the stove top doesn’t appeal, but you’re sick of the drive thru, then you may want to consider ordering freshly. this tasty delivery service ships chef-prepared meals that are delivered to your home refrigerated. choose from meal plans that include 4, 6, 9, or 12 meals per week, with breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. try the current coupon for 30% off your first order.
sun basket
for those whose regular grocery routine sticks to the organic, hmo-free aisles of whole foods, sun basket is the meal delivery service for you. this pricier service exclusively uses organic, seasonal ingredients in each of its carefully crafted recipes. it also caters to special dietary restrictions with gluten-free, paleo, and vegan options. right now, you can get three free meals (or 50% off) your first sun basket order.
terra’s kitchen
terra’s kitchen is a meal service out of the northeast that differentiates itself by offering meals a la carte rather than locking users into a pre-defined meal plan. ingredients are not only fresh, but most are already washed, sliced, and diced to reduce the time you spend in the kitchen. the coolest feature is the reusable vessel tk’s uses to ship all its ingredients. each of its space-age shipping containers can be recycled and reused up to 100 times! try terra’s kitchen today and get $35 off your first order.
