we are happy to finally allow you to see the new home for the evangelical theological society. 
the evangelical theological society is a professional academic society of biblical and theological scholars, pastors, and students. we serve jesus christ and his church by fostering conservative, biblical scholarship. we seek to accomplish this goal through our annual meeting, regional meetings, and publications such as our journal. our meetings are open to the public and our publications are available for purchase. older volumes of the journal are made available freely through our online archive.
