tonight, the retail, wholesale and department store union (rwdsu) announced that workers at the rei co-op in greensboro, north carolina voted to join the rwdsu, making rei greensboro the eleventh unionized rei store in the country. rei greensboro workers first began organizing in the wake of rei’s october 2023 round of layoffs, which cut the jobs of 275 of the most experienced workers, known as “leads,” from stores across the co-op. in greensboro, two of the most tenured lead retail sales specialists were laid off, beloved coworkers who were known to embody rei’s signature “co-op way.” greensboro workers proudly unite with green vests organizing under the banner of the rei union from coast to coast, fighting for fair pay, guaranteed hours, a clear path to full-time status, and transfer opportunities within the company.

the occupational safety and health administration (osha) has issued a decision in osha complaint no. 2240262, made by technicians in the rei soho bike and ski shop on december 5, 2024. all eight workers employed in the rei soho bike and ski shop have been out on a health and safety strike since december 4, 2024, after rei removed personal protective equipment previously supplied by the company from the bike and ski shop without providing any evidence to support their assertion that the work environment is safe to perform ski work in without respirators. osha has shockingly determined that the evidence provided by rei is sufficient and does not warrant further investigation by the agency. the rwdsu will be contesting this decision and joins with the new york committee for occupational safety & health (nycosh) in calling for a new air quality test to be performed by a qualified industrial hygienist testing for the three chemicals used during ski tune work – metal grip, emulsion, and low density polyethylene.

the need for a union at work has never been more critical!






















workers today are fighting for and winning a union voice with rwdsu in record numbers. with corporations giving workers less and expecting more, workers across every sector are saying enough is enough and securing their seat at the table with strong union contracts. interested in forming a union at your workplace?

already an rwdsu member?






















rwdsu members built and joined their local unions to protect their rights, improve their working conditions, pay and benefits, and to secure security on the job. with a union, workers have the right to collectively bargain over working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that make workplaces better. union representation means having someone who will stand up for your interests at work. it means having a voice, a way to say to your boss that the concerns of workers are every bit as important as the company's bottom line. if you’re already an rwdsu member looking for your union benefits, tools and resources, information on immigration and more, visit our rwdsu member portal.
