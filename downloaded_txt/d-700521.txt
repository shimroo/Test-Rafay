						thanks so much heather – travel leaders is the best!

						jody, i know when we first looked into it we were searching the internet for hotels and air and cars and when we came to see you everything that we were looking for and could not find you did find and made it all happen.  anyone who tries to book on their own is underestimating the service and experience that you provide!					


bob & lisarochester, mn 






						it’s hard for me to tell you how great this trip was, but i want you to know, we appreciate you and your talented, knowledgeable staff. i will be calling again for my next adventure, and telling my friends!					


julieplymouth, mn 






						amber, thank you so much for your help, we couldn’t have done any of it without your vast knowledge of the resorts in the area. with your help, we were able to select a resort that fit our family style and our budget and it was great!!!!					


todd & jill e. 






						hi nora, we really do feel lucky because you never steer us wrong! the gran porto real was exactly what we were looking for this trip. the hotel was very nice, and the staff was always accommodating and friendly. we especially liked the location – it was perfect – so close to 5th avenue that we went out every day and walked for a while, enjoying the culture. already decided that next feb will be in cozumel – so we will plan to check in with you in november. thanks again!					


bruce and terri d.maple grove, mn 






						rachel, our baltic trip was nothing short of magnificent. everything was even better than we imagined. love, love, loved it! it was indeed a trip of a lifetime. thank you for all of your knowledge and expert guidance. everything went like clockwork from being met at the airport, to luggage transfers and coaches to and fro. it was simply great and effortless.
