using next generation science to meet societal, organizational, and global challenges

   

the world is transforming. why has the unexpected become commonplace? because of complexity. even with mountains of data available, neither decision makers nor traditional science is equipped to unravel collective behaviors with far-reaching consequences.



science is advancing. using the next generation of mathematics, complex systems science helps us understand the dynamics of society and civilization by making more accurate predictions than either statistics or calculus.
