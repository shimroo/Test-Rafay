jared hankins (b. 1975)
jared hankins is a self-taught artist who has worked exclusively with oils for over 25 years. hankins uses early black and white imaging of the american west as inspiration for capturing the gritty, timeless quality of these peaks. by adding subtle tones and more contemporary compositions, hankins hopes to pay homage to all the explorers from pioneers to ski industry innovators that have made these mountains accessible.

edward s. curtis (1868-1952)
no photographer has rivaled the breadth and depth of curtis’ exploration of native american life, culture, and portraiture. the quality of curtis’ imagery also remains unrivaled among any other photo ethnographic undertaking.

nicholas coleman (b. 1978)
nicholas coleman’s work emphasizes the key elements of a good story: scene, structure, event, and plot. every intentional brush stroke builds a story that evokes the common narrative of struggle, fortitude, and resiliency through both characters and characterization. his romantic paintings inspire his audience to join his mission to preserve the fading heritage of the american west.
