                            the afrian queen 


 
on 4k uhd for the first time!


 
directed by john huston
starring humphrey bogart, katherine hepburn and robert morley

on 4k uhd october 21 

studiocanal is thrilled to announce that john hustonâs classic, the african queen (1951), will be available to own on 4k uhd for the very first time when it is released on october 21 in a special edition release that will include a booklet with an exclusive essay from helen oâhara. 

adapted from the novel by c.s. forester, this much-loved wartime romantic adventure combines the masterful direction of john huston (the maltese falcon, the treasure of the sierra madre) with the indisputable chemistry of humphrey bogart (casablanca, to have and have not), who won a best actor academy awardâ® for his performance, and katharine hepburn (the lion in winter, the philadelphia story) in their only on screen pairing.

with a supporting cast including robert morley (too many chefs, marie antoinette), a screenplay penned by james agee (all the way home, the night of the hunter) and direction from john huston, the african queen is one of the most treasured films in the history of cinema.

this new uhd version comes looking better than ever and complete with brand-new extras. a welcome addition to the ever-expanding vintage classics collection.

âthe greatest adventure a man ever lived...with a woman!â
german east africa, 1914. humphrey bogart is the slovenly gin-swilling charlie allnut, while katharine hepburn portrays rose sayer, the maiden-lady sister of a prim british missionary (robert morley). when invading germans kill the missionary and level the village, allnut offers to take rose back to civilization. she canât tolerate his drinking or bad manners; he isnât crazy about her imperious, judgmental attitude. however, it does not take long before their passionate dislike turns to love. together the disparate duo work to ensure their survival on the treacherous waters and devise an ingenious way to way to destroy a german gunboat.

extras material
-        new audio commentary with script supervisor angela allen and ian christie
-        new sir john woolf on the making of the african queen

cert: pg / runtime:  105 mins approx.

restoration information
for the 2010 4k restoration of the african queen, romulus films âone of the film's original production companiesâ provided access to the original three-strip negative at a london facility where the film was carefully scanned and digitized. the separate elements were then transferred to los angeles and painstakingly recombined and inspected frame by frame to ensure that every detail aligned and that any dirt and scratches were removed. 

to ensure that the restored picture matched the filmmakers' original vision, paramount arranged a screening of an mpaa archive print for the film's original cinematographer, academy award winner jack cardiff, whose comments were recorded live during the screening. that same archival print was later screened alongside the newly restored version so that the restoration team could ensure that all of cardiff's notes had been addressed. the result is a vibrant, warm picture that reverentially recreates the film as it was originally meant to be seen.

                            graeme clark rip [read more] 


 
another good one checks out too early 


 
itâs with extreme sadness i have to report that graeme clark passed away on sunday the 19th of june.

i apologise itâs taken me so long to report this, iâve still not really accepted heâs gone, itâs still unbelievable, itâs still almost impossible to put this into words, however iâll do my best.

regular visitors of this site will know graeme as our reviewer or co-editor, or sub-editor, but thatâs not the truth. the spinning image was graemeâs website. sure, graeme wrote reviewsâ¦ over 10,000 in fact, but he did a lot more. he was the life, soul and beating heart of the spinning image. he updated all the news, he ran the press office, he reviewed just about everything that passed under his nose (as his good friend jim said, he watched on the buses 2, so you didnât have to!), yes he wrote reviews too and in between heâd write articles and perform general maintenance on the site whilst answering all incoming email and just keeping all those plates spinning (everything that made the spinning image what it is), he did it all and he never once dropped a single plate.

iâve known graeme for what must be 35 years or so. myself and my cousin john, both keen horror film fans, decided to start a film fanzine. we put an add in the darkside magazine hoping to get some writers, reviewers or just about anyone willing to help out. graeme was first through the door, offering to write an article on giant monster moviesâ¦ little did we realise that graemeâs article would turn out to be a monster itself, a definitive list of every single monster movie ever made, it was so big we had to run it across many pages across many issues! that should have been a big clueâ¦ what this man didnât know about movies, wellâ¦ it just wasnât worth knowing.

as well as his monster movie article, iâm pretty sure, if memory serves, graeme also came up with the title of the fanzine, in his own inimitable style, âinvasion of the sad man-eating mushroomsâ. we loved it and he then named the letters page âa bucket of soapy fishââ¦ we stopped asking him for titles after that!

as well as writing, graeme was also a fantastic artist, his work scattered through the fanzine, brought the pages to life in his monotone, cartoon style (see self-portrait to right). those who followed the fanzine can never forget his comic strip âbigger than hitlerâ, featuring an inflatable george formby, and the many other decidedly odd tangents graemeâs mind went off on! genius.

when invasion finished (bagging magazines of the moviesâ âfanzine of the yearâ twice running, along the way) and the internet was born, we stayed in touch, emails passing frequently; graeme saw me married, have two kids (the eldest now 24!), divorced and remarriedâ¦ in fact iâve known graeme for longer than my marriages combined! he became a great friend, always fun, witty beyond belief and always willing to help out with new ideas and offering to do anything he could to get that idea in motion (more recently that has been kicking me up the arse, but in his own caring way)â¦ and from these ideas the spinning image was born.

fast forward, i dunno, 22 years maybeâ¦ and 10,000 reviews later and here we are. please take a moment to let that sink in, ten thousand reviews. graeme watched and reviewed ten thousand films. where do you even find 10,000 films?! i think thatâs truly incredible. he let that number just slip past me, never after kudos or praise, just quiet and humble. whenever someone loads a review on this site i increment a count of the views. graemeâs reviews have been read approximately 36 million times! he was undoubtedly a very popular guy! i did some quick maths, maybe wrong so iâll expect to be corrected, but if graeme watched 10,000 films averaging 2 hours a piece, that comes in at 2.3 years of continuous film watching, without the time spent reviewing it afterwards! itâs incredible, but then graeme always said, films are my life!

so alas graemeâs story comes to an early end (he was only barely 50), and maybe so too does the spinning image. whilst i let this all soak in, iâm truly devastated by his passing, although iâll leave the site running forever in his memory (along with wayne southworth, another taken too soon) but i wonât be updating it until i know itâs future.

graeme you were a true friend, and i could have never asked for more, because you always gave more. you were the spinning image, and just never realised it.

â rest in peace my friend x

appropriate platform


 
shudder, amc network's premium streaming service for horror, thriller, and the supernatural, has acquired rights to the documentary. this is gwar, which gives rare insight into the 30-plus year career of one of the world's most outrageous heavy metal bands, gwar, known for their grotesque costumed characters and notoriously wild, fluid-soaked stage shows. the film, which world premiered at fantastic fest in austin, tx, and won the 2021 audience award at nightstream, will be available exclusively on shudder in the u.s., canada, and the united kingdom, ireland, australia, and new zealand on thursday, july 21.

"for more than three decades, gwar has set the standard for heavy metal horror with larger-than-life personas and gore-filled stage shows that were unlike anything anyone had ever seen," said shudder general manager craig engler.  "but even their most ardent fans have never seen them like this, as the band and director scott barber reveal in moving detail the literal blood, sweat and tears that have made gwar the true legends they are today."

added gwar, "gwar is founded on horror, humor, and heavy metal. of course, we love shudder! it's our favorite. every movie is like a home movie for us. are you kidding me?? monsters, demons, the undead, dinosaurs? those are our people! gwar and shudder. two terrifying tastes that taste terrifying together."

this is gwar is the powerful story of the iconic heavy metal art collective, as told by the humans who have fought to keep it alive for over thirty years. the feature documentary includes interviews with the band members, both past and present, and other artists, including weird al yankovic, thomas lennon, alex winter, bam margera, and ethan embry, including never seen footage of legendary gwar frontman dave brockie (oderus urungus).  check out the trailer at the link above.
