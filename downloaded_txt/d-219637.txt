na pali experience
kauai's pristine na pali coast stands out among hawaii's many beautiful coastlines for its rugged and striking beauty. lush, verdant cliffs rise dramatically out of the ocean to heights of over 4,000 feet (1,200 meters).
much of this 17-mile stretch of coastline is unreachable by land because of its remote location and sheer cliffs. hikers can view approximately one-third of the coastline by walking the strenuous 11.2-mile kalalau trail. you can only see the rest of na pali by air or boat.
native hawaiians used outrigger canoes to reach the beautiful beaches and valleys of na pali. today, only ambitious kayakers attempt this challenging paddle during the nicest summer weather.

boat tours are truly the best, easiest, and most rewarding way to experience the full scope and scale of the na pali coast. year-round boat tours are available on our sailing catamarans and rigid-hull rafts.
we promise that the sheer beauty of the na pali will take your breath away.
we also provide tours to kauai's sunny south shore when the winter weather makes conditions rough, unpleasant, or unsafe on the na pali coast.
