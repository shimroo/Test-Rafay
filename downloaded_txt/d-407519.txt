 “my child is enrolled at aim high because they put god first, cater to my child’s needs and abilities, and it is affordable!”— kelly, aim high mom




not all children have equal access to activities such as gymnastics and ninja classes. traditionally, these activities have only been available to some.barriers such as cost of programs and location of facilities prevent children from receiving the incredible benefits of gymnastics and ninja activities.aim high academy seeks to “level the playing field” for children by providing scholarship assistance for low-income families.we serve hundreds of children from all backgrounds of life, from north tulsa and south tulsa and everywhere in between. the diversity of our students is a picture of heaven. they all work side by side — black, white, asian, hispanic, scholarship, and non-scholarship... all for the glory of god!





























“aim high made it possible for us to afford to put our daughter in gymnastics. i love that any child can try this sport. i also love that they put christ at the center of everything they do. it warms my heart to see the team pray together after every practice.”— heather, aim high mom
