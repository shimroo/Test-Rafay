bill branley's blog about the pacific northwest, a very cool place indeed!  i only post occasionally, but there are a few gems here. 

this blog was the home of peggy finds a friend, which became the novel sea changes, which you can buy in paperback and on kindle

	 can't seem to stop
    


i think i love creating stuff.  in 2017 i decided to retire and take it easy but within a year i was back at work.  i took a lot of pictures and composed some music and made some videos and before i knew it i had a lot of content!  so i started building some new websites to hold all my new content, not to mention my old content.  then i discovered how cool wordpress can be when you really get under the hood and start playing with it.  it's awesome!!  you can build anything in wordpress.  all these years i just thought it was a little blogging tool but you can customize the heck out of it and build your amazing fantasy dream site!

so here are some new sites i've built in wordpress.  one of them has free stuff that you can download, including some of my posters and music tracks...

what is a cup - this is my "free" store, which means it's a store that only gives stuff away.  the title is a bit abstract, but go to the about page and see what you think.

one sock media - this is my new business venture for doing wordpress websites for other people.  you can send me a note if you want to talk about a wordpress project.

by bill branley - this is my portfolio site.  it's got photo galleries from my recent travels, videos that i made, stories, streaming music tracks that i composed, and soon other stuff.  i'm still putting content on that site.

cedar salon and spa - this is a fun salon site that i did.  if you happen to be in the seattle area you could even book an appointment.  you will look and feel great!

so that's my update.  look for more postings here as i talk about my adventures in keto dieting, meditation, yoga, and how to shop for the right hot tub.  see you soon!

- bill

here's a cool picture i made from 144 pictures that i had in my various lightroom folders...
