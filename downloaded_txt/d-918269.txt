placer county probation department recognized as the 2023 madd outstanding probation agency of the year
8/1/23
auburn, calif. -- placer county probation department has received an award from mothers against drunk driving, recognized as the 2023 madd california outstanding probation agency of the year. at an awards ceremony this month, the probation department received the award from madd california, the california office of traffic safety and the national highway transportation safety administration. the award recognizes the departmentâs contribution to ending drunk driving, helping fight drugged driving, supporting victims of these violent crimes and preventing underage drinking. âwe are proud of our probation dui team and grateful for our continued partnership with the office of traffic safety and mothers against drunk driving,â said placer county probation chief probation officer marshall hopper. âtogether, we strive to reduce duis in our community, keeping our roadways safe and holding dui offenders accountable to the terms and conditions of their supervision.â over the past year, the department conducted 53 after-hours operations, 809 preliminary alcohol screening tests, over 2,000 unannounced field contacts and searches, approximately 2,000 office contacts and collected nearly 1,200 drug tests. âthis recognition is a testament to the dedication of our team and the collaborative efforts of our partners in safeguarding our community from the tragic consequences of impaired driving,â said hopper.




board approves additional funding for lease to locals housing initiative in north tahoe
8/1/23
tahoe city, calif. -- continuing efforts to maximize rental options for north tahoe residents and local workers, the placer county board of supervisors today approved additional funding for the countyâs lease to locals program. the board unanimously approved the allocation of $500,000 in transient occupancy tax reserve funds to continue the program for a second year and provide additional grants to more homeowners with underused properties in north lake tahoe who agree to rent only to locals. âthis is a great program and itâs been hugely successful,â said district 5 supervisor cindy gustafson. âgoing forward, i think itâs important we continue to find partners to help fund the program, such as those non-tourism businesses and agencies that could join us to ensure we get the most from our tot contributions.â the new funding includes $95,000 for placemate to continue implementing and marketing the lease to locals program over the next year.
the lease to locals program incentives property owners to offer their property for seasonal leases of between five and 12 months or long-term for 12 months or more, with incentivized amounts varying by the length of lease and number of tenants. since the programâs implementation in august 2022, 86 local workers have found short-term rental housing through the program. to qualify, a property must be located in unincorporated placer county within the boundaries of its east placer transient occupancy tax district. to be eligible, units cannot have been rented long-term within the past 12 months. property owners also must submit an application, sign a lease with qualifying tenants and undergo lease checks to ensure they are in compliance. a prospective tenant must be an adult employed at least 20 hours per week at an employment site within the tahoe-truckee unified school district geographical boundary and not a blood relation to the property owner.
placemate, previously known as landing locals, handles all qualifying tenants and landlords currently utilizing the program and advertises the availability of rentals throughout the region on its website. placemate has similar agreements in place with the town of truckee, south lake tahoe and other mountain resort communities in colorado and idaho.

north tahoe community alliance to convene and oversee the capital projects advisory committee
8/1/23
tahoe city, calif. -- the placer county board of supervisors on tuesday unanimously approved an amendment to a five-year agreement with the north tahoe community alliance that gives the organization oversight and administrative support over the capital projects advisory committee. the cap committee was created by the board of supervisors in 2018 to recommend projects for funding raised through an extra 2% transient occupancy tax paid by overnight visitors who stay in hotel or short-term rental properties as approved by voters in eastern placer county. the additional 2% tot (above the countywide 8% rate) generates approximately $5.4 million annually.
projects that have received funding through this program have included paved trails like the martis valley trail and dollar creek trail, community signage, the fanny bridge project and many other infrastructure improvements that benefit community members and visitors alike. the ntca will now oversee both the cap committee and the tot committee, created in 2021 with the formation of the north lake tahoe tourism improvement district. the restructuring will allow the ncta to hold joint meetings of the two committees as they make tot funding recommendations to the ntca board. the ntca board recommendations will then move to the placer county board of supervisors who will continue to have final approval authority over the use of tot funds. âseeing as the ntca used to oversee this committee, weâve really come full circle and itâs great to have this partnership reestablished,â said district 5 supervisor cindy gustafson. âthese committees do great work to recommend projects that mitigate the impacts of tourism and peak visitation in our region and i believe we need more community awareness on the benefits of these projects.â the agreement requires that the ncta keep the cap committeeâs current membership and seat designation the same through the 2023 annual grant cycle to maintain consistency however, they have the flexibility to make modifications to maximize efficiencies thereafter.
the boardâs vote authorizes the county executive office to execute an agreement with the ntca for additional funding for the remaining three years of the five-year contract. this includes up to $150,000 for the current fiscal year and an additional 3% cost-of-living increase in each of the subsequent years of the contract. âthe board of supervisorsâ decision to move the cap committee under the purview of the ntca signals their trust in the leadership of our staff and board, their belief in the vision and direction of our organization, and their confidence in our ability to engage the north lake tahoe community,â said tony karwowski, ntca president and ceo. âwe are committed to ensuring that tot dollars generated in our region are applied toward initiatives that will have an impact and help continue to build a successful, sustainable future for north lake tahoe that emphasizes economic health, community vitality and environmental stewardship.â

about placer county tot
placer countyâs 8% transient occupancy tax is collected through overnight lodging from visitors to the area. in eastern placer county, an additional 2% is charged, which helps fund important cap committee-recommended programs and services in north lake tahoe. since voters approved the addition of the 2%, more than $50 million has funded local infrastructure projects, transportation services and other projects for the benefit of the north lake tahoe community and its visitors.

about the north tahoe community alliance
the north tahoe community alliance collaborates with regional stakeholders to make the tot-tbid dollars at work program support a vibrant, year-round economy that benefits residents, businesses, and visitors of north lake tahoe. the organization also advocates for and funds local transportation and workforce housing solutions, visitor services, and promotes responsible and off-peak season travel with a focus on stewardship education. governed by a volunteer board of directors and committees composed of local business owners and their representatives, the ntca is funded by a tourism business improvement district in contract with placer county. formerly known as the north lake tahoe resort association, the organization was renamed the ntca in 2023 to align with its new mission. learn more at www.northtahoecommunityalliance.com.
