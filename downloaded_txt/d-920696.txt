you are my chosen child, carefully selected and adopted with care. i choose you; i want you. allow the flowing of my spirit through your life. let me touch through you, love through you, bless through you. yield to me, lean in and feel the "rivers of living water" flow from within you to a hurting world. rest in me and i will work for you and through you with my infinite love. breathe the spirit in and breathe the spirit out, for in me you live and move and have your being.

you work far too hard for your own good. i will work when you rest in me and will accomplish my "good, pleasing and perfect" purposes. your rest activates my divine love. i will do it. put your faith in me.

there is a rhythm to my spirit and all creation moves along in time with me. if you will slow down and listen to the birds and the wind in the trees, it will be easier to walk in step with me. take a mini vacation and breathe in the beauty around you. feel my rhythm and "live and move and have your being" in me. as adam walked unhurriedly in step with me in the cool of the day, so will you, now that you are redeemed.

the night may close around you like a storm; yet i am the light of the world. the skies may pour down torrents, yet my tears wash you clean; the cold wind may cut you to the marrow; yet my word (living and active) will divide bone from marrow and penetrate your fearful heart. i will save you, keep you warm; i will dry your tears and turn your darkness into light.

though you see me not, i will direct your paths and comfort you with all comfort so that you may uplift the spirits of those who suffer in like manner. child, child if you would but stop. and breathe. and just be -- be afraid, be desolate, be hopeless, without judgment, you would know that i am here, calming your fears and giving sureness and solid, tangible hope. please stop working so hard and, allow me to change your heart from the inside out. "god works for those who wait for him."

i am in the torrents; i am in the darkness, for there is no where in time and space, or even in eternity, that i am not. you may run from the darkness but you cannot escape my mercy and love poured out unto you in the deepest parts of your soul.

"for by grace you have been saved through faith;

and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of god"

  (ephesians 2:8 - emphasis mine)



i have always thought this verse was talking about the faith that god gives me to believe in him. 

my faith. 

but what if paul is talking about god's faith? 

god's faith in me?



i believe, whether we find it here in ephesians or not, that



faith is not so much that 

i believe in god,

but that god believes in me.
