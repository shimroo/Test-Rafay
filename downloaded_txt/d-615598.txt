thoughts from our members



“i like wuu because it is a place that welcomes a free and responsible search for truth. i love being in a religious community with people willing to accept uncertainty, embrace change and take action.”- henry



“over 25 years ago, i was looking for a spiritual home for my young family -- a place that supports kids' questioning and adults' search for meaning alike, unconstrained by a particular doctrine or creed. i found it at wuu. my kids are now grown and flown ("roots, hold me close; wings, set me free") and i am still here because i appreciate this supportive community, where we hold each other up, embracing radical inclusion, where we cherish our relationship to the earth, where we speak out and take action on social justice issues, where heart is at the center. i am giving back even as i am still expanding."- liz



“wuu has meant a lot to me since we moved to williamsburg. so much music, so many stories, watching my son grow up in a supportive, open community, going through the pandemic together, so much inspiration and laughter. i never had a community like this before.”- sue














wuu serves our congregation, the greater williamsburg area and the world by providing a welcoming, inclusive community to explore personal spiritual growth and encourage transformative action to achieve a humane, sustainable and harmonious world.







































“wuu has been my spiritual home for almost 20 years.  i have been supported and challenged to grow in ways i had never imagined for myself.  learning to live in community at wuu is one of the greatest gifts of my life.”   - rachel
