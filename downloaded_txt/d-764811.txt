theâ guru's lairâ is your online tech support service for readers of microcomputer pioneer, researcher, and prolific authorâ don lancaster's ezine columns.
these now include his blatant opportunist, tech musings, resource bin, gurugrams, postscript secrets, hardware hacker, and similar tutorials.
don is now the author of 44 books that include the classic cmos cookbook, the million+ seller ttl cookbook, tvt cookbook, active filter cookbook, and his unique self-help incredible secret money machine. along with 2200 plus technical papers, a patent, a postscript video and a hanging canal video. 

a definitive web resource for the spectacularly engineered and woefully underappreciated hundreds of miles (!) of prehistoricâ bajada "hanging" canals, for our exclusiveâ gila valley dayhikesâ guide, and our new lancaster classics usb library. plus hisâ series of blogsâ and â free ebooks.
along with don's eclectic coverage for postscript, his incredible secret money machine, guidelines to avoid patent ripoffs, or getting surplus ebay bargains, or discrediting the absurd hydrogen energy ludicrosity
or mastering the secrets ofâ bezier cubic splines, trashingâ pseudoscience, going on aâ tinaja quest, or exploringâ magic sinewaves.â plus "pure art" stuff such as ourâ marbelous pancakes,â fractal ferns, orâ avuncular sleezoids.
all based on the premise that ifâ don personally uses them and is interested in them, others are also likely to.
included are many hundreds of don's uniqueâ .psl sourcecode files.â these are ordinary textfiles written in theâ postscriptâ language and are usually executed inâ acrobat distillerâ from the windows command line with a secret magic incantation ofâ "//acrodist /f".
don lancaster runsâ synergetics, 3860 west first street, box 640, thatcher az, 85552. a free technical helpline is often available at emailâ don@tinaja.comâ most content is freely available underâ creative commonsâ terms.

archival web pages
deeplinkâ â â¢â â topâ â â¢â â botâ â â¢â â respond
these are older "blue button era" web pages that are primarily intended as historic archives. some of the information may no longer be active or even appropriate.â viewing is best done in larger display formats.
in particular, postscript these days is ridiculously simpler and easier to use, besides now having ghostscript and google drive alternatives. just use your command line to send your .psl files to acrobat distiller via the top secret "//acrodist /f"â incantation.
