new and improved!





click here to listena new show with an all new format and a new co-host! inspired by many of the podcasting "duo's" such as lime & violet and stash and burn, i've asked my friend, neighbor, and fellow fiber-enthusiast (cheryl) to co-host the show with me. i still do most of the talking in this episode (cheryl's dealing with a little mic-fright) but the next show will be much more cheryl and much less me (i promise)!in this show, we introduce you to my new co-host cheryl (and all her "critters"), talk about the new upcoming format of the show, and talk about what's on our "hooks" and "needles".  edited to add: seeing as it appears to have done more harm than good amongst the fiber community, the editorial portion of this episode has been removed. show notes:cheryl's lion head bunny (mushie)  graciecheryl's tea leaf lustersheen shrug (leaflet #3922)  brooks farm duet hat and scarf new crochet book, crochet on the edge (on sale at amazon)grumperina's post about addi turbo's needlesbelow is a copy of the email i sent to the owners of knitpicks (roughly adapted from grumperina's letter to skacel). feel free to copy and paste (modifying as necessary) this text into your own email to the knitpicks folks!dear mr. and mrs. petkun -- my name is xxxxx xxxxxxx and i'm writing to let you know that i adore your knitpicks options needles. in fact, i adore them so much that i'd like to formally beseech you and your research crew to design a crochet hook set that is as impressive as your options knitting needles.as i'm sure you know, crochet is extremely popular and there is a niche in the market for a high quality, smooth, and fast crochet hook set (such as your options needles). i understand that the focus of your company is on knitting, (the name "knitpicks" somewhat gives it away), however many crocheters patronize your site as well and crochet with many of your fabulous yarns, and would be eternally grateful if you could design and produce crochet hooks as nice as your options knitting needles. specifically, a crochet hook set (sizes b - l or there-abouts) that is as smooth and slick as your knitting needles would make crocheting much faster and enjoyable, and you would have many delighted customers.i know that you and your staff need to have a sense of the market before launching a whole new crochet hook line. not to worry - i will urge all my crocheting friends who've dreamed of crochet hooks as smooth as your options needles to write to you. i hope you will see that the demand is high, and invest time into researching this option further.thank you again for manufacturing superior products, for listening to the needs and desires of knitters and crocheters, and for your willingness to evolve as the fiber-arts change. i appreciate your consideration. please feel free to contact me with any further questions, or to request any additional information. sincerely,xxxxxx xxxxxx999-999-9999email@email.comp.s. being able to purchase additional hooks individually would be an awesome feature as well!want us to review a particular yarn? just have the manufacturer contact us and we'll take care of the rest.

still alive!





hey everybody!!!  yes, the show and i are still alive, although we have been somewhat illusive lately.  i'd like to thank everybody who has left comments and sent me emails asking about the show and want to let you all know that i hope to have a new episode recorded soon.  believe it or not, i'd recorded an episode just before the holidays but somehow (during editing) deleted a large portion of the middle of the show.  don't ask.  needless to say, with all the hustle and bustle of the holidays, i never had a chance to re-record the show but hope to record an entirely new episode very soon. in the meantime, i thought i'd link to a couple of entries from my personal blog since they're crochet-related, so that you can see what i've been up to.  enjoy!no time to writepractically speaking

just a note to let y'all know that the episode that was supposed to be recorded this weekend is going to be postponed somewhat. two of my three kids decided to stay with mom on their dad's weekend, and one seems to be coming down with strep.... soooooo..... not exactly an "alone weekend" as i was expecting to be able to record a podcast.in lieu of this episode of crochetcast however, you can check out the progress on my interweave crochet lace dress and a sweet pea shawl i crocheted for my mom on my blog!see you in a week or two!
