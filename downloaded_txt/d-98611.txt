op-ed: why donors like chabad





by dovid efune · november 10, 2010dovid efunenew york (jta) -- two mammoth jewish gatherings were held recently: the general assembly of the jewish federations of north america and the international convention of chabad emissaries. while both are awe inspiring in their grandeur and focused on jewish continuity, the chabad movement continues to grow rapidly and the federations appear to be largely stagnant.the jfna is a well-oiled machine with an established infrastructure, smooth mechanisms and operational hierarchy. by contrast, although there are a number of supporting bodies, chabad from an organizational perspective appears in some ways to be a band of ragtag rabbis independently operating without an authoritative organizational body, central ceo or board of directors, and endowment, trust fund or investment portfolio.as opposed to the federations, few if any studies, polls or annual reports are conducted or written within the chabad movement, and no center can quantify the precise number of its members. one would be hard pressed to find a flow chart or academic assessment of chabad’s growth, but agreement essentially is unanimous on its rapid rise.chabad institutions have attracted some of the most sophisticated and advanced business and industry leaders as donors. at sunday's concluding banquet of the conference, the guests included the likes of michael steinhardt, guma aguiar, lev leviev, eduardo elsztain and ronald lauder. gennady bogolubov delivered the keynote speech.one may wonder why the informality doesn’t drive away savvy investors that are used to detailed reports, due diligence and rigorous accountability. the answer is simple: those who give money to chabad know they will see the fruits of their contribution. donating to chabad embodies what has become known as true venture philanthropy or entrepreneurial idealism.chabad delivers instant tangible results, which is what any shrewd investor appreciates or giant of industry demands in today’s fast-paced world. donations are not swallowed up by antiquated mechanical financial infrastructures; there is no red tape, application processes, panels or mazes of bureaucracy. the chabad institutions are focused on the immediacy of the task at hand and are adverse to anything that will slow them down.additionally, donors can be sure that a donation to a chabad establishment will support a jewish cause. the federations, by contrast, earmark large contributions for general humanitarian causes in the spirit of "tikkun olam," or repair of the world, but with so many modern-day jewish challenges with which to contend, many donors are saying that our own should come first.much of the donor interest in chabad can be crystallized further by making a comparison to the tea party movement. the movement’s primary concerns include, but are not limited to, cutting back the size of government, reducing wasteful spending, reducing the national debt and adherence to an original interpretation of the u.s. constitution.chabad’s primary concerns include cutting back the top-down, parochial mode of jewish practice, maximizing the use of every philanthropic dollar (there are no earmarks or pork barrel spending), lifting the pride and confidence of the jewish people, and adherence to an original interpretation of jewish law.chabad is a purist, entrepreneurial, visionary and versatile, action-oriented and results-driven organization. for venture philanthropists seeking immediate high returns, there is no better investment.(dovid efune is the director of the algemeiner journal and the gjcf-the gershon jacobson jewish continuity foundation.)

beyond the end of one's nose





there is no doubt that chabad takes whatever it does to extremes.  there is no jewish group more active in more far-flung places of the world than them.  despite a lack of local resources that would drive out less-committed yidden, chabad emissaries live full jewish lives in scattered places around the globe, providing a taste of yiddishkeitto any of our brethren who happen to wander by.  their dedication to kiruv is also unmatched and they work with great fervour to bring back lost jews to torah.
unfortunately it is human nature to let extremism cut both ways.  while a moderate often refuses to take a defined stand on anything, an extremist will have a firm opinion about everything and a refusal to budge from it.  the problem with chabad's extremism is that its desire to bring jews back to judaism is matched by a belief that their judaism is the only real kind. 
as rav shmuely boteach, former black sheep of the movement, notes in a recent piece in the jerusalem post:
i knew then in theory what i just witnessed in practice: chabad emissaries would one day take over the jewish world. why? because of the grandness of their vision and the passion with which they pursued their mission. other jewish organizations sought to educate people about their tradition, but chabad sought to raise all earth’s inhabitants to a higher god-consciousness, and to make judaism the driving force in every decision of daily life.
the passionate dedication of the chabad emissaries was infectious. they did not preach the torah. rather, it coursed through their veins, seeping out of every pore. hassidic teachings about the approachability of god and the accessibility of a higher spiritual reality were grafted onto the average chabad activist’s very dna, becoming an inseparable part of his or her character and personality.
witnessing the fulfillment of that promise at the conference was an awakening. chabad is no longer merely a jewish movement. it is judaism. i find it astonishing that prime minister binyamin netanyahu flew in to attend the jewish federations’ annual general assembly but bypassed the chabad conference. if an israeli prime minister wants to be part of the unfolding of modern jewish history, he has to address chabad. no other organization even comes close to its global reach or grassroots impact. and it is growing exponentially.
they don't read newspapers and are unlikely to care about what rav boteach says but one can imagine going to the rebbes of ger, belz and satmar (both of them), all of them significantly larger in size than lubavitch despite a total lack of outreach, and telling them: "did you know that chabad is judaism?"
indeed, rav boteach should know this.  all the shluchim should know that theirs is not the largest sect within orthodox judaism and that within the chareidi community they are relegated to the fringe with the bratzlovers, a kooky sect that might be scrupulous in the performance of some mitzvos but which endorse beliefs and worldviews unacceptable to the main group.
then there's the modern orthodox and dati leumi who would also be shocked to know that they are not judaism.  never mind the pantheon of thinkers and towering figures they lay claim to.  never mind all the learning and practice.  they aren't judaism because they're not chabad?
yet there is the other side that rav boteach mentions and must be emphasized. as rav david berger notes in his book on the subject, chabad is expanding within significant parts of the jewish community through a clever strategy.  just as leftists realized long ago that if one infiltrates the school system to ensure that children are raised with a socialist/politically correct philosophy so as to create a large group of support later on, chabad realized long ago that going where no frum jews could be found was like mining for gold.  there is a reason chabad is found in isolated small jewish communities that no one else pays attention to, why they show up on campuses even in cities with a large torah-observant population and why they pay so much attention to jewish communities and travellers in such places as russia and india. 
generally one does not find chareidim in these places since they prefer large centres where they have resources, yeshivos and other such supports.  one doese not find dati leumi there either since the movement's focus is on eretz yisrael, not golus.  asd a result, if you're a non-religious jew living in a small town in the american mid-west, or a student venturing onto a university campus, or a villager someone in siberia, chances are the only frum jew you'll ever meet is a chabad shaliach. 
the consequence of this is obvious - if all you ever want from the chabadnik is chicken soup on friday night and the occasional raucous purim party, that's fine but if you want to learn more about judaism you will be introduced to torah observance but through the chabad lens which is, in many ways exhaustively documented elsewhere, different from conventional torah observance.  what's more, you will be taught that theirs is, like rav boteach say, the judaism of our ancestors, the only real type, the kind that moshe rabeinu, a"h, brought down from har sinai.
one might raise an objection by pointing out that aish hatorah and ohr sameach are hardly different in that approach to kiruv.  this is definitely true.  ask an aish or ohr rav about the age of the earth and you will be told the only legitimate answer is 5771 years.  they won't teach you about the rav or rav kook either in those places. 
but the significant difference is that aish and ohr generally restrict themselves to large communties, as i noted above regarding chareidim in general.  you won't find aish in woebegone, minnesota.  you just might find chabad.
through their kiruv, chabad is indeed working very hard to present a specific type of torah judaism to the non-religious masses who don't know about the depth and variety of torah observance.  they are working hard to convince the multitudes that nusach ari is the only siddur god hears you pray and that a certain deceased rabbinical figure really is the moshiach, that it is a fundamental principle of judaism and an actualhalacha to believe this, and that he is just waiting for the opportunity to reveal himself and bring the final salvation.
that chabadniks don't realize that judaism is far bigger than them and that their beliefs are not standard in the rest of the torah community is regrettable.  that the rest of the torah jewish community is sitting back while they divert our non-religious brethren into their narrow camp isn't.posted by mighty garnel ironheart at 8:55 am labels: lubavitch2 comments:

well, okay. but are you suggesting we all move to woebegone?
i lived in a small jewish town; it was challenging - and tiring. while i was there, i was chabad, organizing public menorah lightings, trucking in kosher meat, sending letters to politicians, rounding up the city's straggling few jewish kids for a month of super-fun camp (run by flown-in bochrim).
i don't quite understand - if lubavitch's unique brand of mishegas compels them to live in nowheresville, gei gezundheit. and more importantly, what would you offer the jews of nowheresville in return for giving up their chabad connections??? or are you simply demanding that every chabadnik give equal time to the teachings of the rav along with the frierdiker rebbe?
answers - we want answers, not just more questions!!! :-)10 november, 2010 9:50 am

if one has no problem with a jewish group going around and telling people about a dead messiah who will be resurrected to bring the kingdon of god to earth, only his name is menachem mendel, not yoshke, then there's no problem.
the difficulty is that the jews in yenemsville are going to be taught this belief which is heresy to the rest of us.
should more of us be moving to those small towns? as someone who currently lives in one, i say yes. there is benefit to groups from yu and similar places going on and competing for jews with chabad.10 november, 2010 10:39 am

probing the roots of neglect















dental hygiene among the ultra-orthodox is often disastrous, a consequence of lack of both money and awareness. the new reform in dental care may help the situation, but some are dubious
by tamar rotem

considering the high cost of the as the 12-year-old girl steps out of the treatment room at the chabad dental clinic in jerusalem's mea she'arim neighborhood, she asks: "how long will it take?" the answer she receives from the female dentist, concerning how long the thin metal wires encircling her teeth will have to stay on is apparently satisfactory; the girl gives a little smile.

tuesdays is orthodontics day, for girls only, at this clinic for disadvantaged residents, in the heart of the ultra-orthodox neighborhood. girls aged 10 or 11 flock there: how their teeth look is a very important aesthetic issue for them. indeed, within just a few years they will begin getting offers for potential husbands.treatment and the large number of children in these religious families, orthodontics cannot be taken for granted. today - as chabad dental clinic director rachel donat relates, and as emerges from conversations with mothers - the accepted practice for ultra-orthodox preteens who want to have their teeth straightened is to save up money from babysitting jobs.

at the clinic, where dental care is subsidized, they charge about nis 6,000 for the whole process, which may sound astronomical to a girl who slowly accumulates her shekels, but is lower by several thousand shekels than orthodontic care offered by health maintenance organizations and certainly by private clinics.

in some cases, says donat, there is a medical justification for orthodontic treatment as a result of teeth being neglected from an early age. thus, for example, the extraction of baby teeth because of decay is very common at the subsidized clinics run by nonprofit organizations, of which there are a number in jerusalem. instead of preserving teeth, parents - to the child's detriment - often prefer to extract and save money.

the chabad clinic serves "families that barely make it to the end of the month, in which the fathers study at a kollel" (a yeshiva for married men ), according to donat, a resident of the betar ilit community outside jerusalem.

"this is a population that opts for minimal dental care. whatever hurts is taken care of; they come to the clinic only when a child isn't sleeping at night and there is an emergency. it's shocking to see a 5-year-old child with only one whole tooth in his mouth. it isn't that they don't care, but parents say to me: 'i'd like to [give my child dental treatment], but don't have the money.'"

donat adds that many families cannot afford even the lower prices at the clinic, which charges about nis 100 for a child's filling. "the cheapest is to extract baby teeth. to rehabilitate a tooth, or put a crown on it - that's hundreds of shekels. in very many cases we extract, because there is no alternative."

supposedly, all this will change in the wake of the reform spearheaded by deputy health minister yaakov litzman, involving free dental care for children under the age of 8. while the reform, which went into effect earlier this month, does not include orthodontics, it does include such services as tooth reconstruction, fillings, extractions, root-canal work, temporary crowns, anesthesia with nitrous oxide, and x-rays, with a deductible of up to nis 40 per visit.

although litzman's scheme is intended for the entire public, members of the ultra-orthodox sector are among those that need it most. donat believes the reform "will solve a great deal of problems," but adds that it is inadequate, as "there are children up to the age of 12 or 13 who also need treatment."

a dentist who works at a meuhedet hmo clinic in an ultra-orthodox neighborhood doubts the reform as planned will help much. according to him, his clinic's management recently instructed dentists to limit the number of procedures per visit and thereby save on certain treatments: "a child comes in and might need three fillings on each side. but according to the instructions, and because up to nis 40 is charged per visit, i can do only two."

asked about the policy, a spokesperson for meuhedet says these instructions come from the health ministry, not the hmo itself.

another dentist who works at meuhedet and at a subsidized clinic says the hmo is worried about being inundated with patients, with the advent of the reform scheme. according to her, ever since the hmos started offering free dental treatment as part of their complementary insurance plans (maccabi up to the age of 6; clalit until the age of 18, or 6 under a cheaper plan; and meuhedet until the age of 12 ) about a year and a half ago, there has been an influx of ultra-orthodox seeking treatment for their children. she says the hmos have not prepared themselves for the reform yet, but in any event nowadays, "by law, you have to treat everyone. if you're treating one child for an hour, though, how are you going to take care of the others?" she fears the hmos will not be able to keep up and people will have to wait a very long time for appointments, which will consequently affect the level of treatment. she also fears dentists' salaries will decrease, good dentists will leave hmos and the quality of service will decline even more.

from conversations with ultra-orthodox parents it emerges that most are not yet aware that they are entitled to free treatment. in general, they are skeptical. nor has litzman become the "hero du jour" in the haredi press, though the reform has been depicted as positive there.

"it's a pity the reform has come along only now, when i have only one child under the age of 8," says rivka, a mother of nine in jerusalem (who preferred, like others, that her real name not be published ). "today i am paying thousands of shekels for my son because i didn't give him dental care when he was little. i have taken out a loan. the dentist told me this was the result of neglect. i once thought i didn't need to worry, that it was only baby teeth and why invest? when you have nine or 10 children, you say: 'never mind.' do you know how much laughing gas costs? or a filling? where can i find the money to pay for this?"

a matter of poverty

various perceptions have taken root among the poorer ultra-orthodox populations: for example, that small cavities and baby teeth need not be treated. plus - as a woman from the toldot aharon hasidic sect related - among women there is usually great attention to oral hygiene, but among men brushing their teeth is not considered essential. some parents interviewed noted that at the heders and talmud torah schools, sweets are handed out as rewards and there is no awareness of the damage they cause.

according to dr. yaron avda, who in the past worked at the chabad clinic and is currently employed at another clinic in jerusalem, people belonging to the religious community will only pay for dental treatment if they are in pain. "when i see other teeth that are neglected while i work," he says, "they usually insist that i not deal with them. i try to persuade them they should get treatment but it doesn't always work."

another issue involves dealing with many children, notes avda: "our view is that until the age of 8, children can't brush their teeth alone. the model we aspire to is for the big ones to help the little ones. in this [ultra-orthodox] population, it is common for an older child to accompany a small child to the appointment; therefore, we are trying, for instance, to make the big sister responsible since the mother cannot see to all of them ... extraction is often a lot less painful for children, but cases come in with teeth entirely destroyed and only the roots left in the gums."

today, avda says, he is seeing a change. "a child comes in with his mouth completely destroyed, we perform very complex treatment and six months later fewer procedures are necessary - in families that care, we really see an improvement. this is a population that wasn't exposed to a dentist before the supplementary insurance plans, and today parents are coming in for preventive treatments as well."

according to prof. harold sgan-cohen, head of the community dentistry department of the dental school at hadassah university hospital, ein karem, the upsetting situation in the ultra-orthodox sector has nothing to do with religion, but rather with poverty.

"research has shown," says sgan-cohen, "that poor people tend to be sicker and there is a lot of illness that isn't treated because people have no money, and this is the case with dentistry." he notes that poor families are also usually less strict about brushing teeth and often consume a lot of sweet foods. "the cheapest way to quiet a child," he says, "is with chocolate spread or raspberry juice made from syrup."

noahides establish website for interested followers





by toby tabachnickstaff writer07.22.10 - 11:06 amamy boiles lives in denver city, texas, a town of some 4,000 residents, situated near the new mexico state line. boiles, like the others in denver city, was a practicing christian — until about a year ago, when, as she puts it, she could no longer “pretend that the new testament is true.”through a high school friend, boiles began learning about an alternate way for gentiles to serve g-d. and with the help of michael schulman, a lubavitch physicist in pittsburgh, she found spiritual guidance, as well as a community.boiles is a noahide, a gentile who follows the seven commandments that g-d gave to noah and his children after the flood to ensure order in the world. the laws prohibit (1) idolatry, (2) blasphemy, (3) homicide, (4) forbidden sexual relations, (5) robbery, and (6) eating meat taken from a live animal (cruelty to animals) and require (7) establishment of courts of justice.“there are two paths to serve g-d and to have a reward in the world to come,” schulman said, “that of the jew, and that of the non-jew. the noahide has seven commandments given as part of the torah. if a gentile accepts these seven commandments, the person recognizes that these are coming from g-d, so that’s his path.”schulman has been running a noahide outreach organization, ask noah international (ani), since 1999. although he was employed as a senior research engineer from 1988 through 2006, he no longer works as a physicist, and is devoted full time to ask noah.the organization, founded by chaim reisner, also of pittsburgh, boasts an extensive website (asknoah.org), with educational and outreach materials and essays, and fields the questions of those interested in the noahide laws. schulman and reisner also work to connect noahides with each other, helping them find community.boiles was attracted to the noahide commandments after being inspired from a verse in genesis where g-d tells cain he will be forgiven if he improves himself.“this was contrary to christianity,” boiles said, “in christianity, you can only be forgiven through a blood sacrifice — through jesus christ. i didn’t know there was another option. i didn’t know that under the umbrella of judaism there is a place for non-jews.”“g-d doesn’t require man to go through jesus. you can go straight to g-d. that’s liberating for me,” she said.at age 61, larry telencio, of naples, fla., having rejected his christian background, was searching for meaning. he found ani on the internet and now studies the universal laws, as well as torah, although “not too deeply. deep delving into the torah is forbidden to a gentile,” he said.“the noahide path was basically all the things i believed in,” telencio said. “i believe in one g-d, and hashem is the only g-d.”while the lubavitch are known for their efforts of outreach to other jews, the lubavitcher rebbe, rabbi menachem m. schneerson, saw a mandate to reach out to gentiles as well, schulman said.although the sages of the talmud understood the importance of spreading the word of g-d to gentiles, that duty was suppressed for centuries in favor of “self-preservation,” schulman said, after the jews’ exile following the destruction of the temples. about 30 years ago, jews began to resume the mission of educating non-jews.“in the 1980s, the rebbe said the time has come, and societies are open enough. jewish people have success in the world. there is a new obligation to pick it up again,” schulman said.the lubavitch decided to take up the cause to ensure the noahide laws were conveyed to non-jews in accordance with the torah.“there were others outside lubavitch that took this up more quickly than lubavitch groups,” schulman said. “they were spreading the seven commandments, but in some cases, they were not properly educated. in some other cases, they had their own agendas. there needed to be a dedicated torah-based organization that has oversight to take up this message.”schulman became involved with spreading the word of the noahide laws when reisner sought some help with his fledgling website.“i became the webmaster,” schulman said, “and from there, i started seeing how much this was needed. i saw the [noahide] movement was going offtrack, and saw that it needed to go on the path of a torah teacher.”the movement is growing, according to schulman, and is becoming more widely accepted, although there is a notable lack of noahide communities in the united states, and noahides here must go to the internet to find other noahides with whom to connect.noahides in other countries, such as the philippines, the united kingdom and kenya, have had more success in building noahide communities, schulman said. while these communities do not have rabbis, they have community leaders who aid with learning chumash and tanach.schulman has developed a set of courses on noahide principles of the commandments and faith, and, more recently, has been putting together appropriate prayer services to help these communities.he is also helping to edit a comprehensive codification of the commandments.“the rebbe wanted a codification of the noahide commandments, like the code of jewish law,” schulman said. “the rebbe said there should be one for the noahide communities.”codification of the noahide laws has become one of schulman and reisner’s “major goals,” schulman said, and they recruited torah scholar rabbi moshe weiner to take on the project. while weiner thought he would be able to complete the project in a year, it has taken four years to cover just the first six of the seven commandments. in 2007, ani published volume one, covering the first three commandments, and the principles of faith, and in 2008, the second volume, covering the second three commandments, was published.while some noahides do aspire to convert, most are content living as non-jews, following the noahide laws.“it is not a goal at all to encourage conversion,” schulman said, “although some do decide to go down that road. most people just want to connect with the truth.”both telencio and boiles appreciate schulman’s help in connecting them with a virtual noahide community.“there are no other noahides in naples,” telencio said. “most of my contacts are through the internet.”and community, wherever one finds it, is important, especially after leaving behind the religion in which one is raised.“when you leave christianity and the church, you lose community,” boiles said. “and my family has been a problem. but i had to do it. now i see that my job is to align myself with jews, and that we have a collective mission.“i’m very magnetically drawn to judaism. part of me yearns for conversion, but i take this very seriously. right now my path is as a righteous gentile, and to serve hashem.”(toby tabachnick can be reached at tobyt@thejewishchronicle.net.)

the 50 most influential rabbis in america





two rabbi watchers release their 2010 list.by michael lynton and gary ginsbergjune 28, 2010this year’s top rebbe is yehuda krinsky (center), the head of the chabad-lubavitch movement.in the fall of 2006, sony pictures chairman and ceo michael lynton and his pal gary ginsberg, now an executive vice president of time warner inc., began working on a list of the 50 most influential rabbis in the u.s. the friends devised the following unscientific criteria to rank the leaders, whose specialties range from kashrut to kabbalah: are they known nationally/internationally?

rabbi’s biography disturbs followers





by patricia cohendressed in a white straw hat, tan chinos and a blue shirt, samuel heilman, the co-author of a new book about rabbi menachem mendel schneerson, stood at the rebbe’s grave site among scores of pilgrims — a vanguard of the thousands expected to visit on tuesday, in the jewish calendar the 16th anniversary of his death — who arrived at a queens cemetery a few days early to commune with their beloved leader.“it is very holy,” mr. heilman said outside the open-air mausoleum, or ohel, that contains the graves of the rebbe and his father-in-law and predecessor, rabbi yosef yitzchak schneersohn. hasidim believe that the spirit of a great sage remains after death, and many lubavitchers think the rebbe is not only a sage, but also the messiah.the biography’s look at schneerson’s personal life is already causing a stir in the continuing discussion about his legacy.mr. heilman pointed to a headstone facing the ohel that refers in hebrew to the rebbe as “the messiah of god.”“it’s etched in stone,” he said. rabbi schneerson, the seventh and at this point the last leader of the chabad lubavitchers, remains as powerful a presence in death as in life.over the course of his more than 40 years as grand rebbe, he transformed this tiny hasidic sect, with its headquarters in brooklyn, into an influential global network of jewish followers and emissaries and turned it into one of the most important religious movements within american jewry. his life and philosophy are essential to understanding contemporary jewish life.mr. heilman, a sociologist at queens college, and menachem friedman, a professor emeritus at bar-ilan university in israel, offer a view into his world in their new biography, “the rebbe: the life and afterlife of menachem mendel schneerson” (princeton university press). but they have provoked a growing chorus of complaints from people inside and outside chabad with their characterization of the rebbe.controversy is perhaps inevitable. “any attempt to humanize the rebbe is going to provoke this reaction.” said elliot r. wolfson, a professor of hebrew and judaic studies at new york university and the author of “open secret: postmessianic messianism and the mystical revision.”what some early readers have found most disturbing is the authors’ description of the rebbe as a not especially pious young hasid. they argue that rabbi schneerson’s initial dream was to be an engineer and that he mostly absented himself from lubavitcher affairs before world war ii, living in berlin and paris outside of a religious hasidic community.only after he escaped from europe and arrived in the united states in 1941, when he was a childless refugee with little english and few job prospects, and millions of his people had been massacred did he see he himself as having a different mission, the book contends.rabbi schneerson was a man who “must be feeling desperate in his anxiety, loneliness, confusion and survivor guilt, whose prospects are unclear, looking for a way out, an answer from god,” the authors write.sitting outside the ohel visitor center as a large brown tour bus pulled up, mr. heilman, a modern orthodox jew, spoke of his “profound respect” for the lubavitchers but noted that his responsibility as a scholar was not simply to celebrate the rebbe’s accomplishments. “they just can’t accept that he transformed himself, that he was not always going to be the rebbe,” he said.mr. heilman and mr. friedman did not have access to chabad’s private archives, though there is already a monumental amount of published material from and about the rebbe, with a new collection of 1,200 documents soon to be released. the scholars did speak with many movement members, some of whom are now critical of the biography.rabbi zalman shmotkin, a lubavitch spokesman who is thanked in the book, labeled their speculations “psychobabble” and disdained their attempt to put “themselves in the rebbe’s head while ignoring his deeply expressive correspondence and his scholarly approach.”other critics take the authors to task for not relying more on published material. steven i. weiss, the head of news at the jewish channel, a cable television network, criticized the book for presenting what he called lurid details and ignoring a vast amount of “primary material which would frequently contradict its assertions.” he also chastised the authors for not noting outright that mr. friedman served as an expert witness against the rebbe during a lawsuit in the 1980s over ownership of the chabad library. mr. heilman said, “we have no ax to grind.”and mr. wolfson of n.y.u. argued that bypassing the rebbe’s religious writings was a mistake. “there is no question that menachem mendel and his wife were spreading their wings” during their sojourn in paris and berlin, he said. but the diaries from those years show that he was also completely absorbed in hasidic thought and jewish learning. “the world he lived in was completely structured around his ideas,” he said.mr. heilman maintained that lubavitcher accounts can’t be trusted because they are hagiographies and said that he and mr. friedman did not examine the rebbe’s extensive writings on scripture because they were interested in his personal history, not his scholarship.the american and israeli professors are colleagues and friends who have independently studied the lubavitchers for nearly 20 years. it was their wives, though, who suggested in 2007 that the two collaborate on a book while they were all vacationing together in croatia.in mr. heilman’s eyes, the key to the movement’s success was rabbi schneerson’s global vision. he figured out how to permit younger followers to engage with the modern world while remaining true to their hasidic beliefs. by becoming shluchim, or missionaries, they could spread lubavitch practices, thereby hastening the arrival of the messiah and redemption.rabbi schneerson told his shluchim not to limit their efforts to the most religious but to every jew. “they take everyone,” mr. heilman said.more books and biographies are on the way, insuring that the talmudic-like debate about rabbi schneerson’s life will continue.

chabad lubavitch celebrates moving into new home





christiana lillyjune 11, 2010when the congregants walk into the temple, they gaze at the chandeliers hanging from the elevated ceilings, the new marble flooring and the fresh blue paint on the walls. with music playing in the background, they talk and enjoy appetizers and a drink in front of a portrait paying homage to the lubavitcher rebbe. within minutes, the foyer is filled with people standing shoulder to shoulder.when rabbi mendy posner and his wife, chanie, walk into the temple, they are greeted by congregants with hugs, handshakes and proclamations of "mazel tov!" it has been a long time coming, but the family of chabad lubavitch of plantation finally has its own, freestanding temple to call home."in this economy, people think it's a nice dream, but no one believed we could pull it off," the rabbi said.to celebrate the grand opening of the temple, located at 10165 cleary blvd., a gala was thrown with about 500 people in attendance, posner estimated. the social hall was opened up to accommodate the guests in a reception with food, music and memories. a slideshow presentation of past holidays and events was projected onto the wall.hugo and hilda bamberger, who have been coming to the temple since it opened, attended the gala and said they were blown away by the new building."when you pass the outside, you want to go inside. that's what sums it up," hugo bamberger said. "it's a wonderful building and we needed it; we were always squeezing."his wife described her reaction to seeing it for the first time as being "dumbstruck."shelley drujak has been coming to the temple for six years, ever since she was looking to make a change in her religious life. she originally attended a conservative church, and after attending a service at the chabad, she never left. drujak said it was the warmth, spirituality and acceptance of the people that drew her to stay. with the new building, she said it was a gift to the community."every nail that went in was because of the rabbi's dream," she said. "he dreamed of it and he made it happen."the temple is 12,000 square feet, larger than the 800 square feet of the original one that posner founded in 1993. the groundbreaking was in august 2008, and the rabbi worked closely with an architect to design the building. the new synagogue has children's classrooms, a men's mikvah pool, library, offices for the rabbis, a kitchen and a social hall."we feel that we'll be able to offer so much more to the community," posner said.at the front of the temple sanctuary stands the torah ark, which the rabbi hopes to grow in size as well. he wants it to be 36 by 16 feet with the 12 tribes of israel. but for now, he is worrying about putting the finishing touches on the temple.ivor bamberger, the master of ceremonies for the gala, said the temple is a place for growth in one's judaism, and the size of the temple shows a need from the growing orthodox community."if you build it, people will come," bamberger told the congregants.copyright © 2010, south florida sun-sentinel

the shekel drops / missionaries in ramat aviv





the battle raging ramat aviv isn't just about the neighborhood's character. it's a battle over israel's image.by nehemia shtraslerthe sight was elevating: 800 neighborhood residents took a break from what they were doing and went out to demonstrate. their goal: to protect their homes. they weren't asking for much: just to maintain their way of life, the character of their neighborhood, their values, dignity and right to educate their children as they see fit.nobody was paying them. they had no political party or foreign sponsors. they collected the money to fund their demonstration themselves because they knew that if they didn't, the missionary group chabad could continue to slowly take the neighborhood over, just as is happening in migdal ha'emek, beit shemesh and jerusalem.a few people set up a counter-demonstration against the 800. they believe that the people in question are merely "good jews" who just rented a few apartments to preach torah there. all they want is for us to put on tefillin a little, to light candles on friday night. what charming simplicity.they don't realize that it's a well-organized plan to take control of the neighborhood. they aren't even aware that a yeshiva opened in the neighborhood staffed by "messengers" who are prepared to sacrifice their souls for their rebbe.these "messengers" have one explicit goal: to return the people of the neighborhood to judaism. the more jews keep the sabbath and follow the mitzvoth, the faster the messiah will come. though actually he already did come, in the form of the lubavitcher rebbe, according to chabad. the rebbe has died in the meantime, but he lives on - their belief system is a mystical, un-jewish thing, about which the rabbi shach commented: "chabad is the cult closest to judaism."as in every neighborhood, here too they identified the most vulnerable point: the young. that's why every friday they ply the grove by the alliance school, trying to persuade the children to put on tefillin and drop by the chabad house for a "conversation." at night they lurk among the trees and on benches for the teens, offering refreshments and sweet talk. they cunningly tell these kids, "you have the soul of a righteous person," and don't cavil at saying that their mothers and fathers are sinners. they even whisper that people who don't honor shabbat are doomed to hell.puberty is a vulnerable stage and some of these kids, who want to rebel against their parents anyway, listen. the nice people of chabad have no problem taking in a youngster and destroying a family in israel.where are the police and the municipality as strangers badger children among the trees at night?the chabadniks understand that the middle class is groaning under its burdens. so they opened a few kindergartens in the neighborhood that charge little and give much, including a hot meal. some parents succumbed to the temptation - and lost their children. this neighborhood sorely lacks kindergartens without religious affiliation. but the city allows chabad to open one kindergarten after another, even at the expense of a building that had been a cultural center until two years ago.these chabadniks with their butter-wouldn't-melt smiles have no problem flouting the law. they rent apartments and turn them into studios. they build without permits, establish hostels and mikvas in violation of municipal ordinances, but the city doesn't block them. mayor ron huldai did denounce chabad in ramat aviv, saying they were harassing the residents. but his job is to stop the harassment, not just talk about it.imagine what would happen to me if i went to kfar chabad, rented an apartment and dared to open a class to teach a modern interpretation of the bible, or women's rights or darwinism. in the evening i'd go out and roam the neighborhood, trying to persuade their children to visit my home on shabbat to see what a nonobservant jew does on the day of rest.soon enough you'd have to visit me at the burn ward at ichilov hospital, if not worse.and if all that happened, the good souls among us would say: why did he have to interfere in their way of life? why provoke them?but when they come from kfar chabad to ramat aviv, these same good souls say, in the name of an artificial, suicidal liberalism, "we should understand them," and, "we mustn't oppose others because that is unenlightened racism."only they are allowed to sell their rotten goods, rife with ignorance, superstition, terrible discrimination against women, bottomless hatred of arabs and gentiles, and nonsense about the messiah. we may not even protect our values of humanism, education, rationalism, equality, literature and the great inventions of science that changed the face of mankind.the battle in ramat aviv isn't just about the neighborhood's character. it's a battle over israel's image, and the 800 residents who got up and left their homes and went out to demonstrate last monday are just the harbingers.

loss becomes gain





what happens when a religious leader's spiritual guru is no longer available?that can be a difficult road, said rabbi yeruchem eilfort, director of chabad at la costa, who was crushed when his mentor, rabbi menachem mendel schneerson, died.schneerson, often referred to as "the rebbe" (a highly venerated leader in the hasidic community), is largely heralded as leading the modern chabad-lubavitch movement of hasidic judiasm to found chabad centers and unite orthodox jews nationwide.eilfort, 43, knew him personally: it was the rebbe who sent eilfort to the west coast to open a chabad center."when the rebbe passed away, that was a very difficult day, a challenging day for all of us in the chabad movement," eilfort said of the religious leader's death in june 1994. "the rebbe and his wife did not have any biological children, but when they passed away they left so many orphans."eilfort said it was hard to fathom a world without the rebbe."i was saddened that i would not be able to, in a physical sense, go to him when i had a question," he said. "i wouldn't be able to go and sit at one of his hasidic gatherings and feel the inspiration when i went, and the way he would be able to take a torah passage and make it vibrantly relevant in today's age. a little of the shine came off the world for me."and a burden arose."i would have to be the rebbe for my children," eilfort said.yet since schneerson's passing, there has been amazing growth in the chabad movement, eilfort said."when the rebbe passed away, maybe there were 1,500 chabad centers," he said. "everyone was saying 'chabad was not going to grow because the rebbe's not there.'"what his followers learned was that the rebbe's directive and approach were very much alive, he said."today there are 3,500 chabad centers around the world," he said, adding that faith in god has underscored that expansion."when things happen that i don't understand, it doesn't challenge my faith: it challenges my way of thinking," eilfort said."i feel my relationship with god is beyond a faith relationship. it's a relationship of knowledge. just like you know the sun is going to rise tomorrow, i feel ---- i know ---- god in my life."

new bios of lubavitcher rebbe dig for the man behind the myth





by sue fishkoff · may 17, 2010san francisco (jta) -- sixteen years after the death of rabbi menachem mendel schneerson, a flurry of new publications indicates not only how enduring the interest is in his life and legacy, but how potent the minefield is surrounding his mythology.writing a biography of a larger-than-life figure is never easy. and when that figure is the seventh lubavitcher rebbe, the charismatic leader of the worldwide chabad-lubavitch movement, the usual challenges of sifting through sources and evaluating mountains of research material are complicated by internal politics, religious sensibilities, personal loyalties and a lack of reliable first-person information.then there’s the messiah business.until now, the only recountings of schneerson's life have been hagiographies written by chabad followers. now there are two new biographies by academics outside chabad circles, with a third in the works.new york university professor elliot wolfson came out last fall with “open secret: postmessianic messianism and the mystical revision of menahem mendel schneerson,” an examination of schneerson’s leadership within the context of jewish esoteric tradition.next month will see the publication of “the rebbe: the life and afterlife of menachem mendel schneerson,” by samuel heilman of city university of new york and menachem friedman of bar-ilan university, an examination of schneerson’s early life and what the authors describe as his growing messianic pretensions.and rabbi joseph telushkin, author of several best-selling books on jewish life and thought, is in the early stages of a book focusing on the source of schneerson’s charisma and the influence he continues to exert on people’s lives.the heilman-friedman book is generating the most controversy. written for a lay audience, it frames schneerson’s mission, and that of the chabad movement he led, as motivated by messianism, here defined as the attempt to hasten the messianic era through human actions. the messianic mission was so much at the heart of the late rebbe’s leadership, the authors argue, that one cannot be a follower of the rebbe without full commitment to that goal.the authors take a psycho-bio approach to schneerson’s life, trying to get inside the man’s head to uncover his motivation -- always a tricky business.they focus on schneerson’s 14 years in berlin and paris -- the so-called “lost years” between his 1927 marriage to chaya mushka, the daughter of the sixth lubavitcher rebbe, and 1941, when the couple escaped nazi europe and arrived in new york to rejoin the lubavitch court.left to his own devices, they write, schneerson would have preferred to “settle in paris, become a french citizen, and live as a jew of hasidic background pursuing a career in engineering.”while not explicitly claiming that schneerson and his young wife fell away from their chasidic roots, the authors return again and again to the short beard and secular dress schneerson favored until his arrival in new york, along with other similar details, as evidence of an orthodox but not haredi lifestyle.“there is no question he was an observant jew, but he lived in places where chasidim didn’t live, and he did things they wouldn’t do,” heilman told jta.it was, the authors write, a combination of survivor’s guilt -- schneerson was the only member of his close family to escape the holocaust -- and the improbability of his becoming an engineer in america that led him by the late 1940s to set his sights on a new career goal: succeeding his father-in-law to become the seventh lubavitcher rebbe.“mendel’s whole world had collapsed,” they write. “now he was a childless refugee in america nearly forty years old with little or no english facility, with no job prospects in what had been his chosen field … a man who must be feeling desperate in his anxiety, loneliness, confusion, and survivor guilt, whose prospects are unclear, looking for a way out, an answer from god.”when schneerson assumed leadership of chabad, the authors continue, he was able to use this worldly experience to push a hitherto small chasidic movement onto the world stage, launching the global outreach campaign that was to become its hallmark.eventually, they assert, schneerson believed he was “the prophet of his generation,” the man destined to bring on the messianic era. and because the rebbe was so alone, with no peers to contradict him, they ask rhetorically: was he “getting lost in a culture of messianic delusion”?this version of schneerson’s life contradicts the official lubavitch version of an unbroken journey toward the mantle of movement leadership and suggests a more nuanced life whose twists and turns might easily have led to a different outcome.even before its publication, the book has engendered considerable objections in chabad circles. one female emissary said some of her colleagues "have been briefed by headquarters" to steer their people away from it.lubavitchers are ripping into it, disputing its details as well as its overall thesis, claiming it shows a lack of familiarity with readily available primary sources. according to these critics, the rebbe never trimmed his beard in europe, he rolled it, and the rebbe attended synagogue regularly in berlin -- videotaped interviews with jews who saw him in shul prove it.and the suggestion that schneerson spent his european years divorced from chabad activities?rubbish, they charge.rabbi chaim rapoport, a lubavitch scholar and dean of britain’s machon mayim chayin, points to a wealth of correspondence that exists between schneerson and his father showing the two engaging in deep talmudic and kabbalistic discourse.“all this is a far cry from" the claim by heilman and friedman "that the father was guiding a son who had but an elementary or, worse still, a cursory interest in a chasidic lifestyle,” he says.in response, heilman said in an e-mail to jta, "we do not deny and indeed suggest that rabbi levi yitzchak schneerson was a primary religious and chasidic guide for his son. indeed, we quote from the letters they exchanged. we particularly note the exchanges around the time of the wedding of the son to the daughter of the sixth rebbe."on the question of the rebbe's beard, heilman said readers will be able to judge for themselves by looking at photographs of schneerson, reading comments from his father-in-law and thinking about when those comments were made.in general, heilman says, it should come as no surprise that some chasidim "see things differently from the way we do. but we have presented our viewpoint based on the facts we have gathered.""our book documents what we have learned about the years in europe," heilman said. "we explain that most of the activities of those years were focused around the primary activity that brought the young schneersons to berlin and paris. that activity was pursuit of education, career, and a life distant from lubavitcher areas of settlement. when they wanted more of the lubavitcher life, they either returned to the sixth rebbe's court or visited with him when he came to where they were."we never question the future rebbe's knowledge of chabad or even his interest in it. but as we document, that interest was not always the center of his concerns while he pursued his engineering studies."chabad itself, through jewish educational media, is about to release more than 1,200 documents related to schneerson’s life and work, in english and hebrew, including his own diaries and important correspondence between him, his father and his father-in-law, the sixth lubavitcher rebbe.one volume will come out in late june, followed later by others, both in print at online at chabad.org. chabad sources say this information will “clear up many misunderstandings.”wolfson, a philosopher, presents a much different take on schneerson’s messianism than sociologists heilman and friedman.the nyu professor portrays schneerson as having a very deep and radical understanding of jewish esoterica.“in his prime, his teaching was very dense, very laden with kabbalistic terminology," wolfson said. "i don’t know how many really understood him; most were simply mesmerized by his style of presentation.”schneerson’s teachings are rife with internal contradictions, wolfson says, including the subverting of judaism’s gender hierarchy and the boundaries between the permissible and the non-permissible. but most of this was destined for the realm of theory. schneerson never intended for them to be actualized -- not in this world.“what the implications would be sociologically, what a jewish community would look like if the torah were superseded by the ‘new torah’ he spoke about, a kind of law beyond the law, i don’t think he thought that through,” wolfson said.wolfson agrees with heilman and friedman that schneerson’s messianic vision “was there from the beginning.”“i feel he is using the rhetoric of a personal messiah to mark not so much a political change but a change in consciousness that … involves reaching a state of personal perfection that exceeds the need for the torah as we have it,” he said. “i don’t think he understood the impossibility of his own vision. and he took no steps to remedy that. he took no steps to name a successor. the whole history of chabad from the alter rebbe [18th-century founder of chabad-lubavitch] to [schneerson] is a messianic line that comes to a close with him.”neither book will satisfy chabad’s strongest critics, nor its closest friends. it remains to be seen whether the deluge of new material about to be published by jem will cast further light on the most elusive aspects of schneerson’s life and leadership.“like many mythic figures, he was a combination of opposites,” heilman muses. “but you can’t really be sure what was inside his head. who was he really?”this article was made possible by the support of readers like you. donate to jta now.
