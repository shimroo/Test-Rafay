the jcc remains vigilant about safety. we are taking proactive steps that are both visible and not visible to community members out of an abundance of caution. this includes increasing the number of security guards (all of whom are former law enforcement officers) and liaising closely with our partners at nypd. in addition, our senior director of security, sean o'connor, is in close touch with federal, state, and local law enforcement at all levels. we are thankful to our community members for complying with our safety procedures.

creative arts programming at the jcc is a critical means by which our community understands and appreciates itself more deeply and truly. we use the unique voices and media of visual art, film, dance, theater, musical performance, and intellectual conversation to amplify and give new perspective to the most important questions we face as a community.

children thrive, parents connect, and families grow together through experiences cultivated at the jcc. when a family joins us for prenatal programs, a baby swim class, a toddler music or tumbling class, tae kwon do or steam classes for a school-age child, or community service with a tween or teen, they become part of the fabric of the jcc. at every stage and age of your family’s growth, the center for family life is there.
