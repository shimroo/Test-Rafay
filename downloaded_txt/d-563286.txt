nun karma repatterning got karma? take the quiz!

aligned for mercury retrograde


mercury goes into retrograde 3 times this year meddling with communications, contracts and new starts.  travel plans are known to go haywire during these astrological periods. when we are aligned with this frequency, we organically clean out closets, put things in order, de-clutter, take the time to read the fine print and double check details. travel plans may be disrupted but when we are aligned we are better equipped to flow around the obstacles and attract positive choices.  read more...
 
nun karma release repatterningss

release lifetimes of limiting solemn vows made as nuns, monks and renunciates, and lead the edge of evolution today.
a spiritual consecration in which one is irrevocably set apart through a state of absolute surrender of self to a higher authority. all right to ownership of goods or property is relinquished. for many people, especially men, this commitment is taken to heart at a deep and irreversible level. until now.
isn’t it time for a change! this nun karma repatterning creates a bridge between releasing unwanted vows (especially the vow of poverty) and creating meaningful lives and professions in the 21st century. anyone can use it and benefit.  take the nun karma quiz to find out if you have this pattern.   read more....

if our thougths create the reality we experience, how do our thoughts affect the energy grid of humanity?...  create a resonance of peace within yourself and simoutaneously create peace in the world.   we can change our world! read more
