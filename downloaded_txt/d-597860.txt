				one of the most 
						esteemed electric guitarists of his generation, mike 
						stern has distinguished himself over a four-decade 
						career that has encompassed musical partnerships with 
						blood, sweat & tears, billy cobham, miles davis, jaco 
						pastorius, the brecker brothers and joe henderson, as 
						well as 16 recordings as a leader (six of which were 
						nominated for grammyâ® awards). an electrifying soloist 
						whose blistering chops combine rock-fusion firepower 
						with sophisticated jazz harmonies and his inherently 
						bluesy string bending prowess, stern has the ability to 
						instantly elevate the proceedings on any gig or session 
						he plays by channeling the spirits of his own personal 
						guitar heroes jimi hendrix, wes montgomery, jim hall and 
						albert king. read
