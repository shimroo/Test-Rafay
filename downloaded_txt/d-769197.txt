it has now been over a year for us, working with rahul ji and karan, and i count them among our trusted partners. rahul ji is always willing to go the extra mile for us, be it specialised product innovation or if there is a sudden spike in demand. the best thing about handi is the reliability of consistency and flavours – each and every time you will get the same tasting product, which is a great achievement for a team that runs such a big commissary setup. the team at handi goes to great efforts to ensure the taste is authentic, and their products will deﬁnitely want your customers coming back for more a big thank you to them for supporting us in our journey.

we have been sourcing handi products since inception of pita pit in india. they have excellent recipes, the quality of ingredients and consistency is top notch. add to that timeliness of delivery and you have a satisﬁed customer. we would highly recommend them to anyone looking for external sources of vegetarian kebabs.
