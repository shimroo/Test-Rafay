we loved the location of sea dawg! right across from the beach and easy to walk/bike into town. the private heated pool was a hit with the kids! the house had plenty of room for our 2 families and lots of living space too. communication with collins was great when we had issues with our internet and oven, very professional and responsive. would definitely rent this property and from collins again.

we had an amazing experience staying at the sandcastle. everything about our trip was a pleasure. the house is beautiful. every room is beautifully decorated and so pleasant to be in. we loved that the kitchen is on the top floor; offering an amazing view for everyone. the way to the beach was just feet from the house; which was perfect with having small children. the kitchen was stocked with almost anything you need. honestly everything about this home helped us have an amazing get away. collins vacation rental helped make everything a very easy check in and check out process, with no contact needed. they also offered lots of information about the area and things to do. we will definitely be returning. :)
