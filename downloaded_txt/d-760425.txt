did you know?
 days have passed since the beginning of world war two!



















welcome to home sweet home front!













a warm welcome to this website...


much has been written about britain's military role in the second world war.  from the outbreak of hostilities in 1939 to peace in 1945, accounts of britain's early struggle through to her eventual victory are well documented.
but what of those left behind?  those civilians of the home front left to face their own hardships and the ever changing times.  how did they cope with the restrictions of rationing?  how did they come to terms with the frightening reality of air raid bombings?  how did british women overcome male disdain and evolve from their recognised role of home makers to that of the working women of the 'women's royal voluntary service (wvs)', munitions factories, the 'women's land army (wla)' and the such like?
the 'home sweet home front' website has been designed to go some way to give insight into what it was really like for those heroes and heroines of the british home front during world war two - click and enjoy!

at home - britain, 15th april 1942
'no frills' for wartime underwear
from the 1st june the board of trade has issued orders that all embroidery, appliqu√© work and lace on women's and girls' underwear is to be stopped.  this is in order to minimise the work and material put into making clothing.  skirts will have no more than 3 buttons, six seams, one pocket and two box pleats or four knife pleats.  men don't get away lightly either.  there will be no more double-breasted suits and no pockets on pyjamas!

roosevelt dies
president franklin delano roosevelt died suddenly today in warm springs, georgia this afternoon while sitting for a portrait.  he was 63.
his widow eleanor said 'i am more sorry for the people of the country and of the world than i am for us.'
roosevelt's ill health had been widely known but it was still a shock to the american sailors and soldiers around the world who initially refused to believe he was dead.
