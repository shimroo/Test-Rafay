yessss!!!! mishka slept in her crate aka condo without whining or crying all throughout the night which means we slept all throughout the night. she loves going in there and just plops herself down when she needs her quiet time. when i go to bed, she gets in there and falls asleep and when patrick comes home, he shuts the door. routine and consistency!! now… to figure out her tiny peeing and pooping! we take her out first thing in the morning and after she eats but even after she’s gone outside she still does it right afterwards inside. also, we all 3 are really only home in the morning or evening. she is with either one of us during the day, sleeping and lots of potty breaks during the day.we’ve got pee pads at home while she’s learning or shall i say we are learning and are figuring out the places that she repeatedly goes to set these pee pads. she has tiny little baby teeth and is biting everything! when she bites or chews on something she shouldn’t we stop her and put a chew toy in front of her. she’ll chew on that and then go right back to chewing my toes or my ear or my hair. this morning i twisted a wet wash cloth and put it in the freezer. this will help her with her teething when she chews on this. last night i puppy proofed as much as i could.. electrical cords hidden and out of the way, shoes up, etc. i know this is a phase and takes lots of patience!! just her sleeping through the night was a huge win!! i hope that happens tonight and tomorrow and on and on… 😆🙏🏽❤️any puppy advice, please share!

yesterday while going through momma’s hope chest, i found a pair of wedding gloves and a little wedding bag, my parent’s napkin set, and a bridesmaid pamphlet! i went up to the attic and low and behold my momma’s wedding dress! 🥰i will definitely be using parts of these beautiful items in my wedding! i was gifted a beautiful 2nd hand wedding dress from a dear friend that is stunning. i’ll be using both of these dresses to create my own dream dress working alongside @mariemargotcouture to design and create my dress! i remember a decade ago when i said, “maggie! one day when i get married, i want you to design my dress!” and that day is here! 😭💕💍oh! i brought my mom’s hope chest to our loft! how beautiful to have her special chest with some of her very special memories and be able to add my memories to it!i love you, momma! #paddymacbshigwedding #goingtothechapel https://www.instagram.com/p/cpbv2sqsji6/?igshid=ngjjmdixmwi=

woke up from a dream where i met up with my momma and she gave me her wedding dress! in my dream it was much different from this dress but there we were in a parking lot and she was giving me her dress! grandma taff was there too! i’m going to my parent’s house in the next few days to see if my mom’s dress is in her hope chest. if i can find any remnants of her wedding day, i definitely want to incorporate into my wedding! 💕💍i can’t believe we are planning our wedding!! https://www.instagram.com/p/cppzghirkdj/?igshid=ngjjmdixmwi=

dear photograph, buddy’s sunbeam still comes by now and then, but he’s not here to greet it. it looks very empty without him dozing peacefully in its warmth. i am empty without him, too. maybe one day there will be another dog to enjoy buddy’s sunbeam, but there will never be another buddy. - jennifer
