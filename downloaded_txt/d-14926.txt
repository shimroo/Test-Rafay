veterans. thank you for your service. your dedication and sacrifice have made a lasting impact, and we believe your example and experience are still invaluable. in short, youre still needed.  the sixth judicial circuit, which serves pinellas and pasco counties, is looking for veterans to serve as mentors in pinellas countys veterans treatment court. veterans treatment court, or vtc, is dedicated to helping troubled veterans address their current criminal charges while, at the same time, tackling the underlying issues that brought them into the criminal justice system in the first place, such as substance abuse or mental health struggles. the ultimate goal is to stop them from getting into any further trouble so they can lead healthy and stable lives. we believe mentors who have served in the armed forces could play a crucial role in this process by providing guidance, encouragement and a sense of camaraderie to veterans in vtc as they navigate their way through the justice system. your responsibilities would include attending your mentees hearings and providing the kind of support you may have extended to junior service members when you were both in uniform. this is an opportunity for you to serve your community, and, once again, your country. if interested, please contact the office of pinellas-pasco circuit judge kimberly todd, who presides over the pinellas county veterans treatment court, at (727) 464-7350.
