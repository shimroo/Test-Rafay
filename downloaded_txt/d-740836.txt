classes

 











boxing
boxing is an excellent martial arts style for competition, self defense, or fitness. our head instructor teaches every boxing class and spends time working with each student to polish their technique. no gear is required to start, though a mouth guard is advised, and there is light sparring on thursdays.















muay thai
muay thai is a striking style made popular more recently by mma, but enjoys a rich history and depth. it’s known for strikes that include not just punches and kicks, but also knees and elbows as well as elements of standing grappling such as clinching and sweeps. no gear is required to start, though a mouth guard, a cup, and shin guards are advised, and there is light sparring on thursdays.















grappling/jiu jitsu
brazilian jiu jitsu has hit the mainstream alongside mma and, as a result, it is a fast developing and living style. in addition to bjj, the imb academy places a high value on both judo and wrestling and we do spend time on both in class. most classes end with rolling, or bjj sparring. no gear is required to start.















kids classes
in our kids classes, students will be exposed to all of the ranges in the imb curriculum (grappling, trapping, boxing, kicking, and weapons) as well as basic self defense. emphasis is placed upon safety, practicality, and skill. when sparring, children are paired based upon skill and control and there are never more pairs than there are supervisors. no gear is required to start.















eskrima
filipino martial arts are many and varied though, when people talk about them, they typically mean the stick and knife styles referred to under the umbrella terms eskrima, kali, or arnis. the styles that we practice are villabrille and cacoy cañete doce pares. these emphasize using the stick as a stick, rather than as a blade, as well as including basic striking and standing grappling concepts. 















imb curriculum/ jeet kune do
in our jkd classes, students will be exposed to all of the ranges in the imb curriculum (grappling, trapping, boxing, kicking, and weapons) as well as basic self defense. emphasis is placed upon safety, practicality, fitness, and fundamentals. this class explores the basics of our curriculum and is a great resource for all skill levels. no gear is required to start.

about the gymabout us: for over 40 years, the international martial arts and boxing academy has served the southern california martial arts community and played an important role in the personal growth and professional development of thousands of students both locally and worldwide.the imb academy offers a non-traditional approach to martial arts with emphasis on application, fitness, and individual adaptation. students vary greatly in physical ability, stature, experience, and goals, and it is our goal to make sure that training is accessible to as many people as possible. we strive to ensure our facility and training is as safe and practical as it can be while still promoting effective techniques. martially, we seek to be as efficient, simple, and direct as possible. students can be exposed to many different styles and ranges, from weapons, to kicking, to punching, to clinch work, to grappling, and we encourage them to seek what is personally functional. the goal is not to perfectly mimic an instructor, fighter, or our founder - the goal is to equip our students with the tools necessary to go home safely, whether their fight was in a ring, a cage, or in self defense. in addition to practicality, we at the imb academy heavily emphasize an ohana spirit and family oriented gym mentality. we are happy to instruct children of any age, with some of our students beginning as young as four or five years old and many of our instructors having trained with us since their teenage or even pre-teen years! parents are very welcome to supervise classes, and students waiting for class are free to use the lounge to study, do homework, or relax. we regularly host picnics, barbecues, parties, and other events to help foster a familial spirit and pride ourselves on our tight knit community.
