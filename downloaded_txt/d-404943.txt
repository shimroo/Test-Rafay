klamath lake blue
        green
        algae

blue green algae from upper klamath
      lake
      is called
      
natures
        perfect superfood.



 it is one of the best foods you can
      include in your daily
      regime.
      klamath lake algae is a whole food that gives a comprehensive
      nutritional
      boost, complete in its array of essential
        amino
        acids, trace minerals and enzymes. it has an alkaline nature
      and
      helps the body balance ph levels. a note on our bulk afa blue green
        algae, as pictured to the left.




we are fortunate to have ongoing
      relationships with harvesters of klamath lake algae, and lucky to
      be
      able to sell this high quality basic food. in the past, we have
      traveled to the
      lake during the harvest, and participated in developing the
      harvesting
      technologies.  once the algae is
      extracted
      from the lake, it is immediately filtered to remove all impurities
      and
      extraneous
      strains of other algae. it is then chilled to preserve freshness.
      we
      keep
      ourselves up to date with the advances in harvesting and drying
      methodologies, so we can keep abreast of the developing industry.
      lately we have sourced several different afa products, including
      low
      temp oxygen free air drying, afa flake belt drying, and hydro mesh
      drying.
      we are grateful to our suppliers and customers to be of service in
      this
      industry.  

a note on the latest harvests: for
      several seasons, the harvest has been bountiful and the
      storehouses are well stocked.
      the lake has not been adversely affected by the hot weather
      because the lake levels have remained constant. 

spirulina
      we carry spirulina. now you can get our top of the
      line
      afa and the best spirulina available from one
      source. special order only.



tri
          verde
      we have created a new formula using one third each klamath lake
      blue
      green algae, spirulina, and chlorella.
      then enhanced it with a sea plant blend to provide co-factors for
      assimilation. 
      it is the best of the green powders all in one. and our price to
      the
      public is comparable to industry wholesale prices.
      



pro biotics and
        enzymes
      we also have top
of
        the line friendly "good" bacteria and powerful
      digestive
      enzymes in our product line. 
      we also carry some healthful snacks - see our pricelist.




healing
          greens

created by a gifted nutritional
      researcher, 
      this food
      formulation
      is at the leading edge of food 
      supplement technology today. many of our
      customers 
      combine the blue green algae with healing greens
      in
      their daily drink.








what is medicine?

"let food be your medicine" is a
      famous
      quote.
      

      to that end we not only include algae in our diet here, but also
      sprouted wheat, sunflower sprouts and fresh bean
        sprouts.


      how many times have we seen, or heard of persons leaving their
      traditional medical therapies and going on to holistic /
      nutritional
      programs?
      we have heard of children who have been diagnosed with tourette
      syndrome,
      add, adhd and learning disabilities gaining benefits from
      alternative
      therapies,
      which sometimes includes taking our blue-green algae. tell me more.



in addition, it is good to have some
      natural remedies on hand.
      i
      often use colloidal silver as a general anti-biotic; our friendly
        colonizer 
      to
      give
      my insides the good bacteria it may be needing for good digestion;
      and
      my
      favorite remedy: dirt (healing clay if you will). 











we at
        conscious
        living wish you and
        family our sincere best wishes!
