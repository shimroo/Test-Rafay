pnac information






people for the new american century
have you heard of pnac, unless you are a news junkie like i am probably not. that's because the corporate cable news networks do not want you to know about pnac. they never mention pnac, or any of their members, or what they do in america. they act like there is no pnac, yet they put their members on the cable news shows all the time without disclosing they are members of pnac. this is a violation of the ethics rules of journalism, they are all partisan conservative neo-cons who are put on the air and passed off as objective foreign and war policy experts. not once have i seen any of them identified as members of pnac on any cable news show. 
you are probaly asking who is in pnac, and why do the cable news networks hide it from the people. here is a partial list of their members, the chairman is william kristol, other members are donald rumsfeld, dick cheney, james woolsey, paul wolfowitz, richard perle, william bennett, jeb bush, lewis (scooter) libby, elliot abrams, john bolton, william schneider, frank gaffney, clifford may, gen. barry mccaffrey, gary bauer, charles krauthammer, steve forbes, and many more. click here to read the web page i set up with all the details about pnac and why they are a danger to america.
