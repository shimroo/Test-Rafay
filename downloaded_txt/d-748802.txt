the buffalo national river
escaping from its originating source in the boston mountains, 15 miles above the national park's boundary, the buffalo national river embraces 135 miles of both rapid flowing and calm segments of the 150 mile long river. popular among both avid and amateur canoeist, a float trip on the middle buffalo river offers both level i and level ii canoeing at its best. cutting a path through what appears to be a primitive watercourse, your canoe adventure will deliver breathtaking, scenic views at most every bend of the river. soaring limestone bluffs, picturesque inlets, indigenous flora and fauna present you with arkansas, "the natural state" at its best along this river's borders.
