									gil is the best! not pushy very knowledgeable takes time to answer all your questions waited 2 years for me to make up my mind highly recommend!

									we worked with jason at a&s in norwalk to buy our first boat and what a pleasure it was. no high pressure sales at all. he was so helpful. guided us through the process. there were some issues but he went above and beyond to make it right. can't say enough good things about him. we would buy another boat from him no questions asked.

notes ultralite  ul290fd pvc on sale for $2,695, only 2 left !! the new ul290fd (full deck) is built to handle up to a 15hp engine, to take you and up to three other passengers a little further and with 17? diameter large tubes to give more stability and buoyancy and with a full flat floor for better footing.  as their name suggests, the ultralites’ low weight make them a real alternative for those who may have chosen a soft bottom tender in the past but would prefer the performance of a hard hull. ultralite tenders are roomy and strong, yet light and easy to transport. these little boats can be launched and recovered by a single person, and are easily transported on a roof rack. the ul hull is built from 2.5mm thick powder coated marine grade aluminum, and the tubes feature1100 decitex valmex® pvc or orca® hypalon material, cut and assembled to exacting standards. the simple layout of the ul, with an uncluttered design and numerous standard accessories, make the ul series one of the best values in inflatable boats.	 	fct console compatible	new and specific to the ulfd version, is the full flat floor with non-skid that also has the option to take the fct console kit.  this creates a small console boat that is not only light, roomy and super durable, but also a very affordable option for those on a budget.
