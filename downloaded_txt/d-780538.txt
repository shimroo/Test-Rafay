we scale your  brand to 7- and 8-figures, without risking your budgets on marketing that doesn’t work. no retainers, no nonsense, you only pay for results!apply now to start 





your personal marketing “seal team” that destroys your competition


let us scale your brand, without the common ads policy “ambushes” - and you only pay for results


dear business owner,
do you want to scale your business to 7-figures, 8-figures and beyond?
imagine what your life would look if your business doubled… without spending an insane amount of time and money on your marketing. or without being hammered time after time by ad account disapprovals because of your product.
more leads flow in, sales would go up and profits would skyrocket… your bank accounts is flooded with cash… you’d feel more secure that your business was on a trajectory to success… you wouldn’t have to spend your nights and weekends away from your friends and family… and you can finally relax and enjoy the results of your hard work.
are you fed up with wasting your hard-earned cash on marketing that yields little to no results, or gets you banned from advertising platforms? are you tired of the “consultants” and “experts” that take your money and don’t produce results?
maybe you don’t understand the online game, because it’s too foreign. you don’t get the jargon and technical stuff.
perhaps you don’t know who to hire to get to the next level. or worse, you’ve been taken for a ride by others.
how do you manage them? do you improvise?
you could learn it but you don’t have the time, because success loves speed and every minute you waste, you bleed cash. and every second you spend learning and testing, your competitors gain more ground.
you need someone to guide your marketing, because you’re in unfamiliar territory.
now imagine if you bite the bullet and do a tactical retreat. no more out-of-date strategy and tactics. it’s time to leapfrog to the next generation of warfare.
you need a different approach.
you need something more… small, efficient, and surgical.
imagine your own small team of highly trained professionals running a guerilla marketing campaign.
kind of like the seals of sales and marketing… sea, air and land. night and day.
that’s h-hour marketing.



h-hour is more strategic


the secret to blowing up your profits that most digital marketers don’t want you to know


big agencies “spray and pray” and “carpet bomb” your website with indiscriminate clicks and traffic. anyone can do that with overwhelming force, numbers and large budgets.you’re bound to get some results, but it’s wasteful. there is collateral damage, and it’s your marketing dollars.you get less per dollar spent.h-hour is more strategic. there is a focus on quality over quantity. your advertising is laser-targeted on your ideal customer, your dream client, and they are sent to highly optimized sales funnels.this way, you get more results for each dollar invested. more bang for your buck.










 

traffic generation

we recon for the best places to market your business.
then we snatch-and-grab your dream customers through surgically-targeted google ads, and then follow up with personalized email marketing campaigns.
these are highly tactical, disciplined and frugal marketing campaigns that don’t carpet bomb everyone with your money.









 

conversion

we lead the qualified prospects to your funnels, that entice your visitors into taking action and become customers – for you. seven days a week, 24 hours a day, without complaining or taking a break! we then continue to increase the number of visitors that turn into buyers by implementing optimization tactics that are proven to produce double and triple digit increases in conversion. there’s no “spray and pray” here.

 









 

re-targeting

not every target converts on the first touch point. the visitors that don’t take action will be retargeted on google and email with “irresistible offers” to bring them back to your funnels and become a customer.









 

nurturing

we will help you set up systems that continue to add value to your customers and keep them spending more money on your products and services, making your business run like a high-performance sales engine.this saves you a fortune on constantly chasing new customers.
