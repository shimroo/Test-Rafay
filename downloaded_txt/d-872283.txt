pennsylvania camping in beautiful berks county

welcome to lazy k campground!
                    now under new management, this family owned and operated recreational facility caters to campers who are drawn to the exceptional beauty of pennsylvania’s berks county. when you come to lazy k, sit back and relax, in a restful escape from the hustle and bustle of the everyday world. cast your line into our catch and release fishing pond, where no license is required and you can catch smallmouth and largemouth bass, carp, catfish, bluegills and sunfish. at lazy k, we offer our campers everything they need to enjoy some time with nature, without the over-the-top distractions that are so common with most other campgrounds. we venture to guess that you will appreciate the difference and enjoy your stay!
