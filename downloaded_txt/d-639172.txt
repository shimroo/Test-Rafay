cook’s is located on bailey island, home of the world’s only cribstone bridge. the bridge, which can be seen from our restaurant, gets its name from the large granite slabs laid in a “crib” fashion. this style of bridge contains no mortar and is engineered to allow the tide to pass through with no damaging effects to the structure. it was entered into the national register of historic places in 1975 and was designated a national historic civil engineering landmark by the american society of civil engineers in 1984. prior to its construction in 1927, a flag was placed on either shore to signal a boatman to row over to pick up travelers
