welcome to lynnhaven. we have been raising 
						purebred nubians since 1989, and in the ensuing years lovely lamancha and a nys licensed 
						farmstead creamery have been added. we currently attend 8 farmer's markets weekly with our products and 
						also attend as many goat shows as we can find time to fit in.  it is truly 
						all about the goats here at lynnhaven!

						located in pine bush, ny, the farm is tucked against the scenic shawangunk ridge 90 miles north of nyc. 
						we milk about 130 award winning 
						nubians and lamanchas with a few lovely recorded grades thrown into the mix for good measure. 
						
						we are excited about our herd and our cheeses and we hope that you will be too!
						please check out the links above for more information.
