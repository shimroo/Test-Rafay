josh simpson has spent half a century inventing new glass formulas and making unique objects that embody his fascination with color, form, light, pattern, complexity, and the working of the universe. simpson’s iconic planets evoke imaginary worlds that might exist in distant undiscovered galaxies. new mexico glass suggests star-filled night skies and swirling blue seas, while corona glass is evocative of deep-space images captured by the hubble telescope. josh simpson’s work has been exhibited in the white house and numerous international museums. select pieces are currently on permanent display at the corning museum of glass, the renwick gallery of the smithsonian museum, yale university art museum, boston museum of fine arts, and many more.note: all simpson glass is conceived and created by josh himself, assisted by his amazing and resourceful crew.
