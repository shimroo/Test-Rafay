testimonies


thanks again for your ministry to all of us guys at the illinois camp, my sons and i were truly blessed by the weekend. i am excited to see god leading your ministry to focus on loving like/with jesus. i believe this message has the potential to impact the church greatly.
father/son camp attendeethree years ago at the teach them diligently conference in omaha, ne my son and i met you. at that time his dad had just left us and was living a very immoral lifestyle. you gave us two resources:Â teenagers 101Â andÂ equipping men. we have just finished those two and have been reaping rewards from the wisdom gleaned! we can not thank you enough!
single momi enjoyed listening to your talks at the chap convention. for me, you were the highlight and blessing of the entire weekend. i intended to get to other speakers but ended up skipping others to catch all of yours.
conference attendeei just would like to say how mr. wakefield has changed my life.Â (we know itâ€™s the lord who does the changing ðŸ™‚Â i thoroughly enjoyed the message that you gave us at the feast conference onÂ how to build a foundation of faith. thanks so much for your ministry.
