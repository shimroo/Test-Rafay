        we are south dakota humanities    
        we celebrate literature – promote civil conversation – and tell the stories that define our state    








the south dakota humanities council acknowledges that it operates on the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary lands of the oceti sakowin – the lakota, dakota, and nakota. we honor and appreciate the indigenous people who have the longest relationship to this place.







 how we serve south dakota
south dakota humanities is about the people of south dakota, and our programs are here to inspire imagination, increase literacy excitement, and promote civil conversation.

 humanities cafe (formerly brainstorming) 

sdhc sponsors a discussion program entitled humanities cafe (formerly known as brainstorming). held biweekly via zoom, this interactive program seeks to discuss topics important to our society that all too often go unaddressed.



 







 young readers one book

since 2014, sdhc selects a book for the young readers one book program to share with children across the state. this program provides over 14,000 books to students across the state and is made possible by generous donors.


 







 one book sd

since 2003, sdhc’s one book south dakota (obsd) program has encouraged people across the state to read and discuss the same book throughout the year. groups receive the current obsd on loan from the sdhc lending library and host a sdhc scholar for their event.


 







 speakers bureau

sdhc’s speakers bureau offers a depth of topics that groups across south dakota can bring to their communities. the council supports nearly 150 speakers bureau events annually, across a range of humanities-related subjects.


 







 book club to-go

the south dakota humanities council offers a packaged reading program for book clubs organized by individuals, libraries, bookstores, museums, and other organizations. any organization is eligible to apply for a book club to-go program.


 







 museum on main street

in cooperation with the smithsonian institution, sdhc is pleased to announce that we are sponsoring the smithsonian institution’s museum on main street traveling exhibition “spark! places of innovation,” on tour now through february 2025.


 







 we the people

the south dakota humanities council provides program funding to make “we the people” available free-of-charge throughout the state via the south dakota newspaper association. the article is published weekly, and discusses many topics in david adler’s deciphering study of the constitution. 



 







 veterans programming

the south dakota humanities council sponsors a series of writing workshops specifically for military veterans and their families, designed to help these heroes share their experiences and honor their stories.


 

  





















founded in 1972 by the hard work of fellow south dakotans, the south dakota humanities council (sdhc), a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is the only cultural organization in the state whose sole mission is to deliver humanities programming to the people of south dakota.

 68% of south dakota’s youthread below a proficient level    since 2014, sdhc has selected a book for the young readers one book program to share with children across the state. through our partnership with south dakota educators, black hills reads, and sfec, we are shaping powerful learning habits to increase our youth’s reading achievement levels when they’re the most impressionable through book ownership, author interactions, and class materials.
our program’s success is only made possible through the generous donations we’ve received over the years. we’re grateful for the many supporters who have joined us on this incredible journey. while we’ve gone from delivering a few thousand books to over 14,000 across the state this year, we acknowledge that our mission goes beyond these contributions. as we work to inspire young minds, we invite others to join us in our efforts to profoundly impact and inspire our youth in 2024 and beyond.


    
        you can impact and inspire
