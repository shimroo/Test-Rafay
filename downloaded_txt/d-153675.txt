come put on the pi phi arrowour founders established pi beta phi with the vision of extending sisterhood and friendship to as many women as possible. today, pi phis continue to be confident, diverse women who desire authentic friendships, seek opportunities to lead and dream of making an impact in the world. our members find that pi phi sisterhood is more than four years — it's for life.















“

going into recruitment, i was committed to keeping an open mind. my sister was a pi phi at mizzou, but i honestly wanted to do my own thing. the process of recruitment was one of a kind. i chose pi phi because i was shown, rather than told, what pi phi truly is. i had assumed because my sister and i were different, i would find a connection somewhere else. instead, pi phi showed me all of the qualities i love about her. i saw how truly genuine the members were through every conversation i had. when i entered pi phi, i felt most myself. i didn’t have to act or give anything extra to feel comfortable.

“

pi phi is my home. there is no other way i can say it. the friendships and bonds i have found with the women in this chapter have become a sisterhood i know i can fall into whenever i need. they are my celebration parade when something amazing happens or my group of arms to run into after a tragedy. the sisters i now have will be in my life forever because they have made me who i am today.

i love pi phi because it is a place where i am loved for exactly who i am while also being encouraged to become even better. the girls have been the most incredible support system on my hardest days and my biggest cheerleaders during seasons of celebration! i have truly found my best friends in pi phi and have been able to grow closer with them in every single area of life. pi phis are my biggest inspirations and most trusted friends.

“

growing up i’d always been curious about greek life but was weary about the stereotypes that surrounded it. once recruitment started, i was worried i wouldn’t be able to be myself or would be met with girls that were superficial and only cared about certain things. as soon as i walked into the pi phi room my fears were eased. i was immediately met with incredibly kind and genuine girls that really wanted to get to know me. they did such a good job of easing my fears and giving me a glimpse into my future home.

“

during the recruitment process, i found myself surrounded by leaders and people dedicated to our philanthropy of literacy and education for all. going into the education field, this passion inspired me and i found myself in a space that encouraged growth and community above all else. pi phi members come from a variety of backgrounds and interests, and you meet people you never would've met elsewhere. as a non-binary member of the chapter, i feel extremely loved and welcomed by my siblings of pi beta phi and the sorority community here at knox.

“

i chose pi phi because going through recruitment was nerve racking for me, but when i walked into pi phi, i felt like i could be my truest self. pi phi is full of women who love and support you, my sisters have shown me what sincere friendship is and have pushed me to become a better version of myself in the most sincere way. they encourage me to get out of my comfort zone and get involved on campus. pi phi has given me an amazing group of women to look up to and lifelong friendships that i am forever thankful for.

“

i decided to go through the cob process because i wanted to meet women in a more genuine way without the stress of formal recruitment. i chose pi phi because each conversation i had made me realize how much these women cared about their chapter and about each other and i knew that was something special. for a while, i was really on the fence about joining a sorority, but after going to a couple of cob events and getting to know women who i now call friends, i knew pi phi was exactly where i wanted to be.

“

i am so thankful for pi phi for bringing me some of my closest friends. it’s rare to find someone you can look up to, talk to when you need comfort, and spend all day with and find different stories to talk about. luckily for me, i’ve found so many hanging friends i can do all these and more with. pi phi is my biggest support system; i’d gladly do it all over again if it meant i would meet these girls again!

giving back to pi phi has been integral to helping our sisterhood strengthen and grow. without the financial support of our fearless leaders, at all levels, our club wouldn’t receive the same level of support and opportunity. by giving back, we’re striving to keep our sisterhood alive for generations past, present and future.

“

i first decided to give to our foundation because of the good work our fraternity was doing through all our programs. and the fact that our sisterhood—and supporting our sisterhood—was so important to me.


susan crane kyle, indiana beta










“

giving to pi beta phi foundation is important to me because the scholarships i received allowed me to pursue an education without the burden of student loan debt. i believe in women supporting women and giving to our foundation has allowed me to do that.
