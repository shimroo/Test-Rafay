when i was an officer, many times i arrested spanish speakers, or spanish speakers who knew a few words or phrases of english.their favorite threat was: " i get my gun --i choot jou"often they added--" i choot jou family" or " i chhot jour wife".violence and use of deadly force is a way of life for them.their police do not protect them-- the policia protect those wealthy enough to pay them off.a phoenix police officer was wounded during a traffic stop in central phoenix satudray night, while the shooter fled, stormed an apartment and held a man hostage, investigators said.the officer, jennifer moore, was a passenger in a patrol car when she and her partner, officer benjamin ippel, made the traffic stop at 2100 e. taylor st., police said.investigators said two people inside the vehicle were asked to get out and that's when the passenger, aaron baca lopez, opened fire.the bullet struck moore in the finger before lodging in her protective chest vest, phoenix police spokesman sgt. andy hill said.ippel returned fire and pursued lopez as he fled on foot, hill said.the driver of the suspect vehicle was taken into custody.moore was taken to the hospital by fellow officers where she was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. police said the vest probably saved her life.around midnight, police said lopez forced his way into an apartment in the 2100 block of e. fillmore and took a man hostage."he just came in knocking at the door," said cesar patricio. "he pushed my dad and put a gun to his head."patricio said the intruder was a complete surprise."the guy just said, 'i just shot a police lady and i just run away from it and i'm just here to hide,'" patricio said.the victim was able to escape and called police."when the guy was finally asleep, my dad just ran out the door," patricio said. "he saw the police on the street and started talking to the police."after hours of negotiations, lopez surrendered without incident about 4:40 a.m., hill said.lopez was booked in the county jail for aggravated assault on a police officer and aggravated assault and kidnapping.moore is a patrol officer from central city precinct. she's been an officer for just under a year.

	 the new jews
    


 the jewish population has been the focal point of a lot of blame for all kinds of maladies, for 20 centuries.a given reason was that they had crucified christ, and this made them a little less than human.in medieval europe, jews were prohibited from owning property or businesses. so, they turned to handling money and making loans.since any venture has to be financed, they soon became suspect as making money at the expense of the country they lived in.adolph hitler touted  himself by telling the german people that the jews had sold germany out during world war i, in which he was an army corporal. he added another ingredient, ethnic cleansing, to further dehumanize them.business in the united states went from craftsmen who made needed goods to mass production.mass production introduced big business [bb]to us.the goal of bb became to show a profit to the stockholders. two factors interfered with this goal: unions and government.to counter these detriments, bb sent factories overseas. another counter is the employing of illegal aliens. since they are illegal, big business can get away with paying them a third of what an american worker must have to subsist .however, in the process, big business is giving all the benefits of our country away. they are giving away our sovereignty, to get a better "bottom line"in the case of the jews, much was simply fantasy, but since jews had been blamed for anything bad for two thousand years--it was easy. i the case of big business, the usual accusers are liberal democrats, accusing them of greed.wit until some other groups who depend on government assistance finds out big business gave theirs to illegal aliens.

http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/97943 cell industry crafts law to override text banhoward fischer, capitol media servicesarizona’s cell phone industry was shaken up by phoenix’s new law banning texting while driving and is crafting its own state law that could override local ordinances. one state legislator called the industry’s proposal “completely disingenuous.” susan bitter smith, lobbyist for the arizona competitive telecommunications association, said the new phoenix law unfairly targets cell phone texting by motorists as a cause of accidents. that ordinance, which took effect this week, provides fines up to $100 for drivers who send or receive text messages on cell phones and other handheld devices while their vehicle is moving.the penalty is $250 if there is an accident.  the move came over the objections of the cellular industry, which earlier this year beat back a similar proposal by rep. steve farley, d-tucson, for a statewide ban on texting while driving. bitter smith said attorneys are researching whether cities have the legal right to impose their own texting laws. but bitter smith said a simpler way to resolve the issue is a statewide law, one that covers all issues of distracted driving. she said that could include not just texting but other activities that can be dangerous, ranging from eating while behind the wheel to turning around to yell at the kids in the back seat. farley said bitter smith’s legislation is a sham.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ a demonstration folks, about how people put themselves first, and the rest of the world be damned. so you see, these selfish a-holes are willing to put everyone around their 3000 pound ride at risk. oh, yes, i bet they march for illegal aliens and those undergoing genoicide in darfur

	 they don't care about you....
    


in the 1950's, if you voted for a politician, you were certain that his intent was to make decisions and cast a vote for what was good for the majority of americans.not so, lately.decisions are made based on how much more money can i make?examples: near the mexico border in san diego, sit outside a school. watch who drops off kids. about 60% are cars with baja calif plates. you would think the school administrators would be outraged. nope--they don't care. why? because every kid in that school gets them more money. they just count the kids. where they come from is "don't ask-don't tell".in california, if you start a business, the dept of insurance watches. you must provide a worker's compensation insurance policy, which is very expensive. worker's comp insurance is like your car insurance--have a crash, and your premium goes up. have a worker get hurt, and your premium goes up. insurers never ask where a claimant is from, unless it looks like a fraud claim. they don't care--as long as the employer pays the premium. one adjuster, speaking of fraud, stated that unless fraud could be proven, payments were made. it was said "if in doubt--pay out".

	 it's a two-way street, dipstick!
    


it was interesting to watch congress persons and senators posture to please code pink, move-on.org, and other assorted "peace advocates".     one of the faustian characters was rep. tom lantos, d-san mateo, ca.    this old fool lambasted into general david howell petraeus like he was some errant private first class who was here to confess to a multitude of sins.  lantos basically accused the general of being a liar--before he started his report.      well, mr lantos--have i got a clue for you. it goes both ways.   you democrats love to spew hate, find fault, and profess to be understanding, accommodating, and compassionate. bullshit. if a person has virtues and values, you don't emulate him/her--you try to tear them down to your sewer-line position. any intelligent person can soon deduce that that is what in progress. that person then has a question: what are you lacking that makes you attack this person?" after you tear into people, you who are supposed to be an ethical, compassionate, and tolerant congrssman...why do you wonder that your approval rate is 14% or below?

	 dining at taco bell
    


after a trip to my wife's doctor, we stopped at a pharmacy, dropped off prescriptions, and since they said it wouldn't be ready for at least thirty minutes and it was now 1730 hours ( 5:30 pm), we decided to look nearby for something to eat. this is in cottonwood, arizona, on highway 89a, the main street of the town. i had almost a distaste for taco bell. this came from going to taco bell franchises in california.the places always had some part that was not clean, the attendants demonstrated that english was their second language, and the food was blah. this taco bell in cottonwood has obviously been there for some time. there are indications of age . but--you get inside, and your whole outlook changes. the bathroom door doesn't have five coats of paint, and there isn't toilet paper and water on the floor in the bathroom. the counter man is jay, a guy about 18. he speaks perfect english, and he was born here. he is very knowledgeable about what his store serves. my wife wants something tasty but not too spicy as she recently had session of chemotherapy. we place our order and sit down. not too long passes and jay calls our number.  the food is hot and is good. no bland here. as i sat there eating, a light came on in my mind:1.  for jay, this was an entry job. i'm sure he will move on to college, and a more prestigious job. for hispanics (read illegal aliens)who come here and want benefits but not to put out an effort, this would be their life's work.2. since the hispanics make this their life's work, they are denying some young citizen an entry level job.

	 a big double standard
    


mesa cop to be disciplined for gestures [illegal aliens show their respect for you]http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/96743a uniformed, on-duty mesa police sergeant was among dozens who hurled insults or obscene gestures at immigrant protesters earlier this week, the mesa police department announced thursday.sgt. mike doherty, a 20-year veteran, will be disciplined for making an insulting gesture twice with his hands at a group of about 30 protesters when he drove past them wednesday at alma school road and main street in his marked police truck, said spokeswoman holly hosac.a few protesters took down doherty’s license plate number and description and reported him to the department, hosac said.neither doherty nor a representative of immigrants without borders, which organized the protest, could be reached for comment late thursday.the mesa protest group was among several throughout the valley who were trying to bring attention to new laws that will punish employers for hiring illegal immigrants.their signs said things such as “i am your cook,” and “sorry your house isn’t clean.”doherty told mesa investigators his gestures were not ethnically motivated, pointing out that his wife is hispanic, hosac said.he told them “he just has a general distaste for protesters,” she said.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++in the early 70's, a fellow officer had to go to court in downtown los angeles. the city attorney subpoenas you to be there at 8:00 am, but you have to sit through the cases in front of you.a man was contesting the search of his car by a los angeles police motorcycle rider. his attorney alleged that the officer had no "probable cause" to stop the man, charged with transporting and possesion for sale of drugs.the officer testified that he was westbound on wilshire bl. when he noticed the man driving eastbound, as the man neared and passed, he raised his middle finger to the officer. the officer executed a u-turn and stopped the man to ascertain what his hostility stemmed from. after stopping the man, an odor was noted of leaf marijuana, and a search turned up some "bricks" in the back seat, convered with a blanket.the judge then declared that this was no reason to stop the man, and elaborated that this was simply a gesture with no special meaning behind it, and dismissed the case. the officer then stood up, raised his mid-finger to the judge and said, " have a nice day, your honor"the judge exploded, and ordered the baliff to take the offcer into custody. at this point, the defendant's attorney rose and said, "your honor, you just got through saying it was a gesture meaning nothing". the officer was released. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++http://home.xnet.com/~lelp/lelr/janfeb01.htm#article7civil liability; personnel lawcivil liability: arrest for giving a police officer the finger; "fighting words"; qualified immunitynichols v. chacon, 110 f.supp.2d 1099 (w.d.ark. 2000). federal. an arrestee's display of his middle finger in an upward gesture, commonly referred to as "flipping someone off," "the bird," or "giving someone the finger," did not constitute "fighting words" and, thus, was protected as free speech under the first amendment in a civil rights action brought under 42 u.s.c. sec. 1983. the court ruled that the arresting police officer was not entitled to qualified immunity in the lawsuit. it said the arrestee-plaintiff's gesture was clearly established as protected free speech at the time when the officer issued a ticket to the arrestee for disorderly conduct. "while we agree the gesture utilized by nichols was crude, insensitive, offensive, and disturbing to chacon's sensibilities, it was not obscene under the relevant supreme court precedent, did not constitute 'fighting words,' and was protected as 'free speech' under the first amendment to the united states constitution. we also believe that this right was clearly established on august 6th of 1998 when chacon arrested nichols. accordingly, we hold as a matter of law that chacon is not entitled to qualified immunity and that his arrest of nichols violated nichols' first and fourth amendment rights."+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++so, here we go again. if it is done by a citizen, it is "protected speech".if it is done by an officer, it is cause for discipline. so, in this case, you have a police sergeant, with 20 years of experience, who is going to be "disciplined" for expressing his opinion of people here illegally, and who are advocating that u s citizen employers be given immunity for illegally employing them.action should be taken on whom?

	 why you do not want hillary#1
    


as the old saying goes:"if she will do it to him--she will do it to you!"billy dale had worked in the white house travel office for three decades. he had served 7 presidents and one horse's *ss (and we are not counting jimmy carter as the horse's *ss). but hillary clinton wanted dale and his associates gone. she wanted him gone very badly. harry thomason was owed a big favor for getting rape victim elizabeth ward gracen out of the country on an acting gig during the 1992 campaign.what had dale done to hillary? the answer is he had done nothing. dale and six others were simply in the way of her plans.most americans do not know that during the 1992 campaign, the clintons used an arkansas travel agency, world wide travel. they worked with a clinton cousin, catherine cornelius. wwt provided a million dollars in deferred travel for the clinton campaign, freeing up much needed cash for campaigning. employees of the firm donated to the clinton campaign.it gets even better. the supposed investigation against travel office "accounting improprieties" was headed by…..are you ready…headed by none other than cornelius herself just as she was planning with world wide travel for a reorganization that would put her in charge of the department. she gets a good job and thomasson gets a hugely profitable business.the clintons had every right to simply dismiss dale and the others and bring in their own people. hillary, the brains behind the operation, not only had dale fired, but also tried to send him to prison. firing was not good enough. in may of 1993 the employees were given one hour's notice to clean out their desks, and they were escorted away in a windowless van. the replacement was made without competitive bid.dale was very popular with the white house press corps. he knew them all and treated them very well. the firing and trumped-up charges against dale became a public relations nightmare, so hillary had to distance herself. keeping in mind that the first instinct of the clintons is always to lie, that is exactly what she did. she claimed that he had nothing to do with the firing.the nightmare grew worse for dale as the fbi was brought in and he was charged with embezzling money from the travel office. at one point, the cost of trial would have been so prohibitively expensive that dale tried to do a plea bargain to just make it go away. fortunately, the government did not accept a plea bargain. when it came to trial, dale was acquitted by the jury in under 2 hours. what they did to him was in incredible injustice. not surprisingly, as has happened to most of the clinton enemies, the irs also came after him.there are, however, more twists and turns to this story that most of america has either forgotten or never knew. in december of 1993, a request was made by the white house for dale's fbi file. the reason for the request was to evaluate dale for "access to the building." what? he had been fired seven months earlier. the clintons, of course, along with the rest of their criminal enterprise, blocked and misled investigators looking into the treatment of dale.while hillary claimed not to be involved in the firing, the following information exists:"periodic reports from vince foster that [the] first lady had inquired about [the] travel office and why wasn't action being taken_report was that they should be fired immediately and out of here by the end of the day."-- subpoenaed notes of david watkins."went to mac . . . hillary wants these people fired . . . mac wouldn't do it ... dw [david watkins] didn't want to do it."-- lorraine voles, deputy press secretary, noted that she had heard susan thomases say."[patsy] thomason comes back in dw's [office]_says he bumped into hillary and she's ready to fire them all that day.''-- mr. watkins' contemporaneous handwritten notes detail a conversation that he had with harry thomason."harry says his people can run things better; save money, etc. and besides we need those people out_we need our people in_we need the slots_ . . . is the real story to be told?''-- david watkins notes of a conversation with the first lady on may 14, 1993.yes, hillary was in this thing up to her eyeballs. it was abuse of power and an attempt to ruin the life of a civil servant. she was behind travelgate just as she has been behind almost every abuse of power we witnessed for eight excruciatingly long years.robert ray, who succeeded ken starr, apparently thought that an indictment of hillary for perjury would not be good on his resume as he planned to seek elective office. one more gutless prosecutor and hillary remains free.origin: doug from upland

arthur garcia and his mother loretta, both of pomona, pray on saturday during the million mothers march in pomona. loretta's son, raymond, was gunned down in maywell, boo-freaking-hoo!you want your "culture"? this is part of it--to see who can be the meanest, baddest guy around. they don't care if they shoot kids--they just want to be the baddest guy in the 'hood.you want to dismiss responsibility for illegal aliens...because they are hispanics? well, here is your result. illegal aliens bring their attitudes and problems here. wealthy u s businessmen ignore the toxic by-products so that they can bring in a big profit, live in a gated community, don't have to have health insurance, and can say their penis is bigger than their competitor because they got a bigger profit this/last year. hispanic communities ignore the nationality of illegal aliens on a reverse-racist basis. if you ask to have the law enforced--you are a racist! ( funny--i was always told " you suspect of others what you know to be true of yourself.")

	 they try to make it sound unique
    


the article below implies the problem of corruption is unique to iraq.if you look, any third world crap-hole has this problem. freedom is based on trust, and you can't trust if you know people are ripping you off. the problem is close to home: mexico. many mexicans come to the u s legally and illegally. information says that one man controls all the communications in mexico. this man's company takes 40% of all money wired to mexico. so, if juan comes here, works his butt off on some farm, and sends a hundred dollars home, his family will get sixty dollars.. http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20078180443.aspcan't run, can't hide, can't make a deal by james dunniganaugust 18, 2007discussion board on this dls topicthere are now 162,000 american troops in iraq, the most ever. the surge tactics, of constantly chasing after terrorist groups, has left more of the terrorist leaders vulnerable. this week, the guy who planned the two bombing attacks on the shia al askaria (golden dome) mosque in samarra was killed up north. in nearby mosul, the local sunni arab community is becoming even more vicious, knowing that their politicians have been unable to obtain amnesty for the terrorist leaders who have been presiding over the bombers and death squads in the northern oil city. the sunni arabs must have mosul, because it's where about a third of iraq's oil is. if iraqi gets split up into a federated union, the sunni arabs need oil. but the kurds want the oil as well, and are ready to ignore u.s. calls for calm, and launch an ethnic cleaning campaign. all the sunni arabs would be driven out of mosul. to do this would risk fighting with american troops, but the kurds, and other minorities in the area, are fed up with sunni arab terrorism, and want either peace, or peace through revenge.the 120,000 troops of the iraqi army are really at war now. there are two divisions around ramadi, two in mosul, two around kirkuk and baquba, one south of baghdad and two in basra. three more divisions are in the process of forming. the quality of these divisions, and even battalions within the divisions, varies with the quality of the officers. too many of the officers are inexperienced, or corrupt. a major function of u.s. advisor teams assigned to divisional, brigade and battalion headquarters, is to provide their american bosses with an accurate assessment of just what the advised iraqi officers are capable of. no point in asking these iraqi army units to do more than they can handle. as a result, the iraqi troops have been racking up a long string of battlefield successes. some iraqi generals protest that more could be done with iraqi troops, but these generals are not paying attention to what the american advisors are seeing.in baghdad and in the south, uncooperative shia militias, especially the mahdi army, are under attack. their leaders are being rounded up, along with raids on militia headquarters and seizure of records showing the support from iran.the 138,000 police are another matter. although they are the "national police," the cops are recruited locally, and generally serve in their own neighborhoods. this makes for a lot of corruption and partisan. warlords and gang bosses consider it mandatory to get control of the local police, through the customary bribes and intimidation. it doesn't always work, but it does often enough to make most iraqi cops unreliable. the ineffective police are a major complaint of the average iraqi. then again, no one can remember a time when iraqi police were anything but ineffective.the corruption remains as bad as ever. the iraqi government is mainly interested in two things; putting as much hurt as possible on the sunni arab community, and stealing as much money as possible. the anti-sunni arab stuff comes from public opinion. politicians stay office, at least in a democracy, by doing what the voters what. a majority of iraqis (the 90 percent who are not sunni arab), want the sunni arabs to suffer for their sins (centuries of domination, saddam, the current terrorism). the u.s. has been trying to get the government to make peace with the sunni arabs. but the americans cannot get enough sunni arabs to admit they have done bad things, and must accept some blame from the majority government. too many sunni arabs believe they are being wronged, and that they will eventually prevail. this deadlock led to most sunni arab ministers quitting the government. the u.s. is caught in the middle. many local sunni arab leaders (tribal and clan chiefs) have turned against the al qaeda and iraqi terrorist groups. they want peace. but the many sunni arab leaders with blood on their hands, won't accept peace that puts them at risk of being tried for war crimes.the stealing, and corruption in general, is seen as a perk of office, whether elected or appointed. officials are expected to grab goodies for their supporters. not much different than the "pork barrel" politics in any democracy (where legislators are expected to get money for local needs), but on a much larger scale. there's something of a competition to see who can steal the most for themselves and their supporters.get too greedy, and you might be one of the few officials who gets prosecuted.the iraqis have figured out that it's a good idea to prosecute a few corrupt officials to keep the americans happy.many iraqis also have a hard time figuring out exactly what the americans mean by "clean government."there is definitely a bad case of cultural confusion here.meanwhile, the government has made peace with turkey, by promising a crackdown on the turkish pkk (kurdish separatist) rebels who have refuges in northern iraq. promising and doing are two different things. the iraqi prime minister making the promise is a shia arab. the people who run northern iraq are kurds. but if this promise is not kept, the turks threaten to invade, and clean out the camps. this time, the turks are demanding performance, or else.
