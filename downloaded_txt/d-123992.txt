	lehigh valley wellness center is a health care practitioner's office who cares about you!! we provide individualized, holistic and 
	cost efficient care. just like the "old fashioned" country doctors did many years ago. we take the time to listen to your needs.
	we do not just take you in the examination room and check you out in a few minutes. we take the time to get to know you and listen to your
	concerns.




	louise is the practice owner. she is a dual board certified nurse practitioner. she offers a blend of traditional allopathic and homeopathic
	medicine. she has completed training in naturopathy and nutrition. she will give recommendations for dietary modifications and herbal treatments
	that may be beneficial to your care in addition to the typical traditional medicines.

	we carry a complete line of skin care products. we also have a complete line of natural herbals to help promote health and wellness naturally.
	we believe in creating an environment where you, the patient/client can feel at ease knowing that you have come to the right place to feel 
	better. we like to incorporate a holistic approach to our treatment for you. we see the body as a “whole” which is how it should
	be treated in order to receive maximum benefit from the recommended therapy.

	we try to incorporate herbals to best treat your symptoms naturally without all of the caustic effects that some prescription medications 
	may cause. but we also incorporate prescription medications into your treatment plan as we see are appropriate. we try to help you decide 
	how you want to approach your health care and guide you in that direction.

	we believe that you are in charge of your body and your health and we provide the education and the assistance in getting you reach maximum
	wellness.




     our website is dedicated to promoting nursing. it was developed by an advanced practice nurse for nurses in any and every specialty or 
	 practice area. whether you are a nurse with many years of experience or a student nurse you will enjoy the website. it is a website that
	 you can read interesting articles published by fellow nurses, publish your own article, check out a helpful link or hint to help you with
	 your nursing practice, or contact the editor with a nursing question. you can also contact the editor with a nursing dilemma, get career 
	 advice or receive encouragement if you have had a very troublesome shift.
nurses need to support each other. this website is designed to support nurses emotionally, psychologically, intellectually, and spiritually.
     many nurses don't know how to support each other, or don't take the time and effort required to support their fellow co-workers. we encourage
	 nurses to read and publish articles relevant to nursing practice. nursesaregreat.com strongly believes that nurses should be avid readers of
	 nursing literature including books, journals, websites, and other related literature. this is how we grow and develop our practice and it is
	 how we will become recognized leaders in our field. just remember you don't have to be a nurse manager to be a recognized leader in nursing
  
all of us nurses have had experiences where we just thought we have had the worst day, the worst shift, the worst experience, and we didn't 
     know if we wanted to continue to be a nurse or if we could ever work another shift. we examine what transpired during the shift over and over
	 in our minds and wonder if we could have done something different or said something different. would the outcome have been any different, if
	 we did something else or said something different? we nurses are many times our own worse enemies and we can often turn a situation into a
	 spiraling cycle of negativity that consumes us and becomes contagious. don't get caught up in this spiral. find a constructive outlet to
	 diffuse your negative feelings and anger.
we must always try to find that positive thread and "hang on to it". keeping a positive outlook will help keep you in the nursing
     profession and make you feel happy that you are a nurse. we must support each other and help each other. if you don't know how to support
     another nurse or co-worker, there are many resources available to guide you through this process. you must also remember to take time in your
     day to pray, this will strengthen you in every way.
we as nurses often forget the good days and forget the shifts where we did a tremendous job, supported another co-worker, encouraged a 
     patient who felt there was no hope, and comforted the significant other of a dying patient. take time to reminisce. look at the good in your
     life, in your career, in your family and friends, and in yourself. you will be a better person. do something for yourself to decrease the 
	 stress and negativity in your life. nurses often neglect their own needs because we care so much for the ones we take care of at home and
	 at work. there are many ways to decrease the stressors in your life.
take some time to search the website, i hope you will find some peace for the moments that you are searching the site.
