video transcript



“six years ago, i switched to pcc, who has, in my opinion, the premier pediatric practice management system. it was the best move i have made in my ten years of private practice.
with only a few clicks, i can review a multitude of meaningful and easy-to-read reports. i can also create my own custom reports for things that are important to my practice.
i know when claims are denied, and why. pcc notices too, and proactively corrects them, resubmits the claims, and sends me an email. since i also do my own payment posting, i can review eras quickly and spot discrepancies.
you really need practice management consultants to navigate the complexities of the world of insurance, and pcc provides this service to clients as part of our monthly fee.
updates are not an option. when they release an update, we get it. there is no ‘opting out’. webinars are given in advance, and instruction is placed on the pcc resource website. this ensures that everyone is on the same version, and has the most up-to-date system.”
dr. robin warner, union pediatrics, union, ky
