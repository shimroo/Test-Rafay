recognition





















kendra of loves me flowers is amazing! my wedding flowers were what everyone asked about. she went above and beyond what i asked for, it was my favorite part of my day! kendra had great ideas for working within our budget. i recommend her to everyone i know.






















initially she gave me a proposal in which i had a big, traditional bouquet and my bridesmaids had smaller ones. i asked her to give me a bridesmaid bouquet and to have the bridesmaids carry just five gerber daisies and she made it happen. basically, whatever i wanted i got and i think we got a good deal. she also got us two bags of pink rose petals at a better price than the ones i had found online (which were a good deal, but charged $35 for shipping!!!).






















i didn't have a lot of contact with this florist as my wedding planner worked with her and just relayed information to me, but i was really happy with the results. we were putting most of our money into our venue, so we wanted to not spend too much on the flowers. this florist was very flexible and the results were perfect.






















kendra is a sweet, graceful, and professional person. she is amazingly talented and everything she provided was so beautiful! you will not regret choosing her as your florist!






















on the wedding day, kendra dropped off our personal flowers at the hotel where we were getting ready and i was in awe of how beautiful my bouquet was...stunning! it was more than i had ever expected —the ribbon was perfect and she added little crystal beads to accent the bouquet handle. we didn't talk about any of this because i had just kind of given up on the details towards the end, but kendra executed everything perfectly and made everything beautiful. the boutonnieres were also amazing — kendra added little accents of something (herbs or pine needles) that made the smell so good! 






















kendra did a great job working within my budget and taking notes on what i envisioned for our flowers. she never made me feel bad about being budget-conscious or expressing doubt about the look of the flowers i had initially selected. she detailed everything i wanted and made helpful suggestions. she reworked my budget, incorporated my last-minute changes, and provided excellent customer service. i think she really understands what a bride wants - she appreciates the significance of the flowers - and handles everything so gracefully. at one of our meetings she said something that made me have full confidence in her...she said something like, "it's important that you look at your bouquet and love it."






















kendra exceeded all of my expectations and did an amazing job. the moment i walked into my venue i was blown away by how great everything looked.






















kendra did a fabulous job with our flowers and decor. i got a ton of compliments on them. i even had a stranger ask for a print of my flowers from my photographer's website since they were so pretty. i trusted kendra with the design and just told her what a did and didn't like. loves me flowers is a great company to trust with your big day.






















kendra was great! she went over and above throughout the planning process just to make sure that we had flowers the exact way we wanted them. she took my small amount of ideas and turned it into a beautiful project! she also handles all of our linens. it was so great to have someone take care of all of that - it looked beautiful!






















i shopped around what seemed like forever for flowers and it was so overwhelming for me and almost the last item on my list. finally, i figured out what my budget was and let kendra know and she was able to put together some beautiful options for me that fit into my budget and everything turned out beautifully. although her shop is located north of seattle she was able to deliver way down south of tacoma, wa, to chambers bay! the pictures turned out terrific! thanks kendra!
