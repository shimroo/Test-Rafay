afda's new app launched


afda is pleased to announcethe migration of its web site to the
                    new afda app, which is available as a free download in both the apple store
                    and google play store. search afdaapp in the store.
while it is a bit sad to be saying goodbye to our web site that first
                    opened in 1995 when the internet was in its relative infancy, changing
                    times allows afda to provide you with resources wherever you go. now afda
                    goes where you go.
the app provides both free and paid resources listed below, which have
                    been created specifically for federal defense attorneys.
