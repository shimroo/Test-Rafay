a new way of thinking
our customers benefit from our years of engineering combined with a fresh approach to problem-solving.




a trusted partner
partnership requires dedication and commitment at every level. on every project. every day.




a different focus on success
it's not just meeting a scope of work. it's determination not only to succeed, but to outperform.













because this was presented as an emergent need, we went with a company we’ve used before and trust. tri tool was able to mobilize a team immediately. it took them six days to execute the entire repair. the professionalism of their project manager, machinists and welders was exemplary and the quality of their work was beyond compare. they took ownership of what we needed them to do without us having to provide direct oversight. i will continue to work with tri tool and highly recommend this company.
