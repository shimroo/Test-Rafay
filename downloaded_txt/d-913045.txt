i don't need a reason baby…c'mon caligulove me.


nov. 30th, 2009 at 2:59 pm



 


bionicblinkholy crap, i feel so fucking happy.  i’m not happy about going back to school.  hell, i’m extremely not happy about some of the assignments i was given, but whatever.  i still feel real fucking good right now.  i’m listening to kick ass music.  i was really happy at the them crooked vultures concert a week ago.  it was glorious.  i was nicely positioned in front.  i could see josh, john, alain, and dave. listening to the album just reminds me how great the concert was.  not to mention the music just makes me so fucking happy to listen too.   some of the songs are just so goddamn sexy.  caligulove, scumbag blues, and the whole fucking album.  seriously, this is the type of music i can be wooed with.  the guitars + drums + bass so freaking awesome.  ok, i’m done gushing and blushing.  laters.

software useful or waste of space?


nov. 18th, 2009 at 5:57 pm



 


bionicblinki’m having trouble grasping my head around google wave and google voice.  i also dislike windows live call.  i just don’t understand the usefulness of these pieces of software.  perhaps its cause i’m not the target audience. alright, so i just don’t like windows live call cause it’s not skype.  that’s really nothing against the software, i just enjoy skype more. but google wave and voice, i just can’t grasp my head around how do i use it without saying to myself; “hey dumbo, why don’t you just use a messenger application and a wiki?”  i know it’s supposed to be in real-time, but when has working in real-time with a group over the internet ever happen?  it’s really fucking rare.  and to work in a big group where this is the most useful, is extremely fucking rare.   google voice is just an oddity because none of the features are that exciting.  call screening. announcement of callers based on their number or by an automated identification request for blocked numbers (all phones have caller id already, why do i need to screen a call?)  listening in on someone's recording of a voice message before taking a call (this person is an asshole, if you don’t want to take the call just step away.  don’t listen first then decide if you want in or not.  either take the call or don’t.)  send, receive, and store sms online (cause those sms are just so valuable)  answering incoming calls on any configured phone (so you can receive calls from mr. telephone!)  voicemail transcripts. reading of voicemail messages online. (if you can’t understand the message the first time, read the incoherent babble for extra facepalm.)  listening to voicemail online or from a phone (don’t listen to that voicemail after you get it.  wait until you get to a computer or another phone, it’s not important.)  notification of voicemail messages via email or sms  (omg, i can imagine how annoying that would be.)   in other words i don’t like technology.

software testing


nov. 18th, 2009 at 5:14 pm



 


bionicblinkalright, so i’m testing out some software mostly the windows ones.  why?  cause it came with the operating system, might as well try it out.  i’m also pretty bored right now too.  a rare event because i’ve been mostly busy with school.      this page was made using windows live writer.     highlights:  adding tables  adds photos  you can upload to multiple blogs  great stalking map feature.  saves your posts to your hdd!  nice preview button.  lowlights:  a little bit of a pain getting the settings right.  the adding a video is a little weird because it politely asks to respect copyrights and includes a link to copyright law.  still trying to understand the viability of this app, considering how cloud computing has become so credibly stable.              i can dig it.  it’s pretty easy to use.   i give this a 8/10.

films i'm looking forward to...


aug. 12th, 2009 at 11:41 pm



 


bionicblinkwhip it - roller derby, sweet.halloween ii - rob zombie is an upstanding individual.fantastic mr. fox - stop motion goodness.i sell the dead - omg, the trailer makes it look so cute.coco before chanel - biopic on coco chanel starring audrey tatou, i'm so there.jennifer's body - megan fox as a demon and the dead girl from veronica mars as her friend, sounds good to me.ponyo - hayao miyazakiinglorious basterds - i support a former narbonne high school student.it's complicated - starring meryl streep, alec baldwin, and steve martin.  although it is a romantic comedy, my arch nemesis. but i'll let it slide cause it's alec baldwin and steve martin together, getting it on with meryl streep.  this can't be bad. the informant - cause it has scott bakula in it.  sherlock holmes - it's iron man in the past.now for the film that i will not watch and will be happy when it fails cause the trailer fails too.couples retreat.  even though you can see pete from shaun of the dead in the trailer, this film is gonna suck.  i'm just really tired of the average-below average looking chubby guy with hot, young, thin wife coupling.  why can't it be in reverse? grr.

back to my dear sweet game consoles


jul. 2nd, 2009 at 12:45 pm



 


bionicblinkwell, that was fun going back to southern california for a little while.  i got to see my family, philip's family, went to disneyland and dca, then i saw the taping of the price is right.  good times.  the price is right with drew carey was pretty fun.  thanks to robert for driving us there and being the ride home.  i'm kinda bummed we didn't get picked, but it's ok maybe next time.  the set was smaller than i thought it would be, but man was it colorful and awesome.  the seats were cushy and nice.  when i was sitting with philip in the audience we kept getting the urge to sing denton, usa.  the downside was that we couldn't keep our cellphones or ipods or cameras.  everyone got their gadgets taken, but we got them back.  so no pictures of the set.    small fact: it takes about 2 hours to film a 1 hour show.  another fact:  there's no retakes for the price is right.after spending the time in so. cal, i was starting to miss sleeping in my bed.  the futon we were staying on was kinda painful for me. the cushion wasn't cushiony enough for me.  but it's awesome to sleep on my bed again.

"hail to the king, baby!" ®???


may. 27th, 2009 at 12:10 pm



 


bionicblinkdid 3realms, makers of duke nukem 3d copyright army of darkness catchphrases?http://www.3drealms.com/games.htmli don't exactly know how this works, but it seems pretty lame to me.  who da fuck copyrights a catchphrase?  well, actually they registered trademark catchphrases taken from a movie.  i know duke nukem 3d paid homage to army of darkness and other awesome action movies.  still is weird that decided to trademark ash's signature catchphrases, it's like trademarking "i'll be back," 3 years after the terminator came out.  just seems a little like they were high and had money laying around so on a bet they trademarked dialogue from a sam raimi movie just for shits and giggles.i'm actually pretty sure they were high for the majority of the late 90s and 00s, cause seriously, 12 years?!  12 years it takes to work on duke nukem forever and it's still not done, and it will never be done either.  you know why 3d realms shut down cause of lack of funding?  it's cause for 12 years they weren't getting things done, and who pays for zero work?
