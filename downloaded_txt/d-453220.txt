future-proof your content
the publishing industry continues to morph as it adapts to new means of producing, distributing, and consuming content. publishers are finding their traditional publishing programs — geared towards yesterday’s long-form reading of books and analog production processes — don’t always translate well to a digital landscape where content flows, interoperates with other content and media, and becomes more responsive to readers. here is where open book systems, inc. (obs) comes in. adapting traditional publishing practices and workflows into the digital realm, we call on our expertise and more than 35-year track record in e-publishing to bring your company and your content up to speed with today’s readers.
