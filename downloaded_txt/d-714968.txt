going
 deeper
...to go
 further


daily bible reading strengthens our relationship with god, nourishes our spirits and equips us to live a fruitful, effective life for him.
this month we're looking at some scriptures about the holy spirit and being fruitful alongside reading a chapter from the gospel or letters of john each day.

jesus mocked and flogged1so pilate had jesus flogged.2-3the soldiers made a crown out of thorn branches and put it on his head. they placed a purple robe on him, the colour of royalty, and bowed before him again and again in a mocking fashion saying: "hail, king of the jews!" and they hit him about the face.pilate's dilemma4pilate went outside to the jewish leaders again and said: "listen, i am bringing this man out to you again because i want to make it clear that i do not find him guilty of any charge brought against him."5then jesus came out still wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. pilate said: "here he is!"6but as soon as the chief priests and their officers saw him, they shouted out, "crucify! crucify him!" pilate responded: "take him yourselves and crucify him. i have made it clear that i have not found him guilty of anything."7but the jewish leaders were insistent: "according to our law he must die because he claimed to be god's son."8-9this made pilate even more fearful and he went back into the palace to question jesus further. "where do you come from?" he asked. jesus stood silent, refusing to answer.10"why do you not speak to me?" pilate asked him. "surely you understand that i have the power to free you or to crucify you!"11then jesus said: "you could have no power over me unless this was given you from heaven. those who have handed me over to you are far more guilty."12that settled it. pilate now wanted to free jesus, but the jews kept up their opposition by shouting: "you are no friend to caesar if you release this man. it is treason against caesar for anyone to claim to be king."13this hypocrisy put pilate in a dilemma. so he sat down on the seat of judgment and had jesus brought before him again at the place known as the stone pavement.14it was now about noon on the day of preparation for the passover. pilate said to the assembled jews: "here is your king."15they shouted back: "take him away. take him away! crucify him!" "you want me to crucify your king?" asked pilate. "we have no king apart from caesar," answered the chief priests.16so pilate finally relented and handed jesus over to them to be crucified!king of the jews crucified17-18then the soldiers took charge of him, leading him to golgotha, the place of the skull, where they were to crucify him. he had to carry his own cross there. they crucified two others at the same time, one on either side of jesus.19pilate had ordered that a sign be nailed to the cross reading: 'jesus of nazareth the king of the jews.'20many people read this sign which was written in aramaic, latin and greek, for the place where jesus was crucified was just outside the city.21the jewish chief priests were incensed by this and protested to pilate: "do not write 'king of the jews', but that this man claimed to be the king of the jews."22pilate answered them: "what i have written, i have written."23the soldiers who crucified jesus divided his clothes among the four of them. but his undergarment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. "we will not tear this," they agreed, "it is too valuable. let's cast lots to decide who shall have it."24this fulfilled the scripture that reads: 'they divided my apparel among them and cast lots for my clothing.' so the soldiers fulfilled what had been predicted.john to care for mary25jesus' mother, her sister, mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene stood near the cross where jesus hung.26-27when he noticed his mother and also john, the disciple he loved deeply, standing there, he said to his mother: "dear woman, here is your son," and then to john, "here is your mother." from that day john took mary into his home.it is finished28jesus now knew that his mission on earth was completed and the scriptures that had prophesied his crucifixion were being fulfilled. so later he said: "i am thirsty."29a jar of wine vinegar, used to dull the pain, was nearby. so a sponge was soaked in it, placed on a hyssop stalk and lifted to jesus' lips.30when he had received the drink, jesus said: "it is finished." now that everything had been accomplished, he bowed his head and died, giving up his spirit.31this was the preparation day before the special sabbath. the jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses on the sabbath. so they came to pilate and asked for the legs to be broken to hasten their deaths, and then their bodies could be taken down.32-33they broke the legs of those crucified alongside jesus, but found that he had already died. so they did not break his legs.34instead one of the soldiers thrust his spear into jesus' side and out flowed both blood and water.35i, john, personally bear witness to the truth of this, for i saw it myself. i know this is the truth and i testify to this to encourage you to believe.36-37and so in this way other scriptures were fulfilled: 'not one of his bones will be broken,' and, 'they will gaze on the one they have pierced.'the burial of jesus38-39joseph of arimathea came to pilate later and asked him to release jesus' body. joseph had become a disciple of jesus, but secretly because he had been fearful of the jewish leaders. pilate gave permission and together with nicodemus, who had earlier visited jesus at night, joseph came and took the body. nicodemus had brought about a hundred pounds of a mixture of myrrh and aloes to prepare the body for burial.40so the two of them wrapped the body in strips of linen together with the spices, according to the jewish burial customs.41near the place where jesus was crucified was a garden in which was a new unused tomb.42as it was the jewish day of preparation and time before the sabbath was short, they laid jesus in that tomb which was conveniently nearby.

s.o.a.p.
in order to go further in the mission god has given us, he said we need to go deeper in our relationship with him. as with any tree or plant, the fruit is determined by the health and depth of the root. one way we have been going deeper is by reading and journaling through the word every day. we’ve called it s.o.a.p.

[s]cripture - read the word
[o]bservation - write down what god is saying/showing you
[a]pplication - how do we apply this in our lives?
[p]rayer - pray through and over your life
                                    
as we read the word (scripture), listen to the holy spirit (observation), discover how to apply that to our lives (application) and pray these things over our lives and those in the church (prayer) we’re going deeper in our relationship with god so that we can go further in the mission he’s given us.
throughout the rest of the year we’ll be continuing our bible reading plan to press deeper into god so that we can go further in his purposes. get yourself a bible, a journal and a pen and soap your way through the scriptures!
you can see which chapters we’re reading today above this section.
