#mdpurposeprevious our #mdpurpose itemwe have people here that are home grown. many of us return to teach in mid-del because we cherish those roots and that foundation we had and want to give it back. i have so much mid-del pride in my heart!- tissa king, schwartz elementaryworking for mid-del schools allows someone to make a difference in people's lives. this includes co-workers, students, adults in the community and local businesses. these people care about others and will do anything they can to help you be successful in your role. - blake mccrabb, mid-del technology center i love being able to serve all grade levels in the elementary level because they bring different interests, perspectives, and skill levels into the library. - rachel long, cleveland bailey elementaryi love helping parents and students who speak a language other than english because it allows me to take them under my wing and provide a positive insight to our district and ensure them that the opportunities available are accessible to all students. - leila velasco, english learners  departmentmid-del is truly a family. it doesn't matter what building you walk in; you are embraced, and everyone has the same goal: loving the children and furthering our educators to be the best for our community. - heather bone, parkview elementarynext our #mdpurpose itembond informationwe are incredibly grateful to the mid-del community and everyone who came out to vote. in a way, this bond election is the culmination of 18 months of work by the leaders in this district and everyone who actively participated in our bond steering committee meetings. in another way, this is just the beginning of a tremendous amount of activity. from this point forward, every project will go from concept, to development, to groundbreaking, to construction, to ribbon cutting. watching the progress we will make as a district is going to be exciting!personally, i want to thank the mid-del board of education for their encouragement and support throughout this process, our district and building leaders for helping to establish safety and security priorities, and to all mid-del employees who provided feedback throughout this process. additionally, we couldn’t have reached this point without the help of so many parents and members of the community who showed up for meetings to help us shape the slate of bond projects. #middelstrongdr. rick cobb, superintendent of mid-del schoolsfor more information about the 2023 bond election, please click here.find usmid-del school district7217 se 15th
