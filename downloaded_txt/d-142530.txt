vaughan - vaughn - vaughen  y-dna testing project


the vaughan - vaughn - vaughen surname y-chromosome, dna project was officially begun on january 12, 2004. having read many success stories in matches with dna for genealogical purposes, we decided that it is time to try to advance our research in the many cases where there are no written documents to help to prove our ancestry.  for more information click here!
