we make it.














for a company to incorporate ‘british’ into its name, it first has to prove that it is pre-eminent in its field. this is something british silverware is well qualified to do. with a history spanning over 200 years, we have developed a truly global reputation for producing the finest quality silverware. we produce some of the world’s most distinguished silverware brands, as well as offering high-end ‘white label’ products for the trade. our discerning, worldwide client base includes major retail brands, blue-chip organisations, sports and event organisers, private individuals and more.


























superior craftsmanship.we have a team of 20 craftspeople in our workshops, who have the skills and expertise required to create high quality cutlery, flatware, hollowware, trophies and bespoke pieces of silverware, to almost any specification.

exemplary production.our products are crafted using traditional techniques, many of which have remained unchanged for centuries. the very antithesis of today’s mass-produced, throwaway culture, each british silverware piece is unique and hand-finished with care to last a lifetime.

outstanding design.we’re proud to continue this manufacturing tradition from our base in the historic city of sheffield. although our methods are rooted in history, we embrace innovation and constantly strive to find smarter ways of working to ensure our customers receive the best possible service.
