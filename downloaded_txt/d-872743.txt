7:59 pm - watterson



some thoughts on the real world by one who glimpsed it and fledi have a recurring dream about kenyon. in it, i'm walking to the post office on the way to my first class at the start of the school year. suddenly it occurs to me that i don't have my schedule memorized, and i'm not sure which classes i'm taking, or where exactly i'm supposed to be going.as i walk up the steps to the postoffice, i realize i don't have my box key, and in fact, i can't remember what my box number is. i'm certain that everyone i know has written me a letter, but i can't get them. i get more flustered and annoyed by the minute. i head back to middle path, racking my brains and asking myself, "how many more years until i graduate? ...wait, didn't i graduate already?? how old am i?" then i wake up.experience is food for the brain. and four years at kenyon is a rich meal. i suppose it should be no surprise that your brains will probably burp up kenyon for a long time. and i think the reason i keep having the dream is because its central image is a metaphor for a good part of life: that is, not knowing where you're going or what you're doing. i graduated exactly ten years ago. that doesn't give me a great deal of experience to speak from, but i'm emboldened by the fact that i can't remember a bit of my commencement, and i trust that in half an hour, you won't remember of yours either. in the middle of my sophomore year at kenyon, i decided to paint a copy of michelangelo's "creation of adam" from the sistine chapel on the ceiling of my dorm room. by standing on a chair, i could reach the ceiling, and i taped off a section, made a grid, and started to copy the picture from my art history book.working with your arm over your head is hard work, so a few of my more ingenious friends rigged up a scaffold for me by stacking two chairs on my bed, and laying the table from the hall lounge across the chairs and over to the top of my closet. by climbing up onto my bed and up the chairs, i could hoist myself onto the table, and lie in relative comfort two feet under my painting. my roommate would then hand up my paints, and i could work for several hours at a stretch.the picture took me months to do, and in fact, i didn't finish the work until very near the end of the school year. i wasn't much of a painter then, but what the work lacked in color sense and technical flourish, it gained in the incongruity of having a high renaissance masterpiece in a college dorm that had the unmistakable odor of old beer cans and older laundry.the painting lent an air of cosmic grandeur to my room, and it seemed to put life into a larger perspective. those boring, flowery english poets didn't seem quite so important, when right above my head god was transmitting the spark of life to man.my friends and i liked the finished painting so much in fact, that we decided i should ask permission to do it. as you might expect, the housing director was curious to know why i wanted to paint this elaborate picture on my ceiling a few weeks before school let out. well, you don't get to be a sophomore at kenyon without learning how to fabricate ideas you never had, but i guess it was obvious that my idea was being proposed retroactively. it ended up that i was allowed to paint the picture, so long as i painted over it and returned the ceiling to normal at the end of the year. and that's what i did.despite the futility of the whole episode, my fondest memories of college are times like these, where things were done out of some inexplicable inner imperative, rather than because the work was demanded. clearly, i never spent as much time or work on any authorized art project, or any poli sci paper, as i spent on this one act of vandalism.it's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves. and with all due respect to john stuart mill, maybe utilitarianism is overrated. if i've learned one thing from being a cartoonist, it's how important playing is to creativity and happiness. my job is essentially to come up with 365 ideas a year.if you ever want to find out just how uninteresting you really are, get a job where the quality and frequency of your thoughts determine your livelihood. i've found that the only way i can keep writing every day, year after year, is to let my mind wander into new territories. to do that, i've had to cultivate a kind of mental playfulness.we're not really taught how to recreate constructively. we need to do more than find diversions; we need to restore and expand ourselves. our idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car battery-it recharges by running.you may be surprised to find how quickly daily routine and the demands of "just getting by: absorb your waking hours. you may be surprised to find how quickly you start to see your politics and religion become matters of habit rather than thought and inquiry. you may be surprised to find how quickly you start to see your life in terms of other people's expectations rather than issues. you may be surprised to find out how quickly reading a good book sounds like a luxury.at school, new ideas are thrust at you every day. out in the world, you'll have to find the inner motivation to search for new ideas on your own. with any luck at all, you'll never need to take an idea and squeeze a punchline out of it, but as bright, creative people, you'll be called upon to generate ideas and solutions all your lives. letting your mind play is the best way to solve problems.for me, it's been liberating to put myself in the mind of a fictitious six year-old each day, and rediscover my own curiosity. i've been amazed at how one ideas leads to others if i allow my mind to play and wander. i know a lot about dinosaurs now, and the information has helped me out of quite a few deadlines.a playful mind is inquisitive, and learning is fun. if you indulge your natural curiosity and retain a sense of fun in new experience, i think you'll find it functions as a sort of shock absorber for the bumpy road ahead.so, what's it like in the real world? well, the food is better, but beyond that, i don't recommend it.i don't look back on my first few years out of school with much affection, and if i could have talked to you six months ago, i'd have encouraged you all to flunk some classes and postpone this moment as long as possible. but now it's too late.unfortunately, that was all the advice i really had. when i was sitting where you are, i was one of the lucky few who had a cushy job waiting for me. i'd drawn political cartoons for the collegian for four years, and the cincinnati post had hired me as an editorial cartoonist. all my friends were either dreading the infamous first year of law school, or despondent about their chances of convincing anyone that a history degree had any real application outside of academia.boy, was i smug.as it turned out, my editor instantly regretted his decision to hire me. by the end of the summer, i'd been given notice; by the beginning of winter, i was in an unemployment line; and by the end of my first year away from kenyon, i was broke and living with my parents again. you can imagine how upset my dad was when he learned that kenyon doesn't give refunds.watching my career explode on the lauchpad caused some soul searching. i eventually admitted that i didn't have what it takes to be a good political cartoonist, that is, an interest in politics, and i returned to my firs love, comic strips.for years i got nothing but rejection letters, and i was forced to accept a real job.a real job is a job you hate. i designed car ads and grocery ads in the windowless basement of a convenience store, and i hated every single minute of the 4-1/2 million minutes i worked there. my fellow prisoners at work were basically concerned about how to punch the time clock at the perfect second where they would earn another 20 cents without doing any work for it.it was incredible: after every break, the entire staff would stand around in the garage where the time clock was, and wait for that last click. and after my used car needed the head gasket replaced twice, i waited in the garage too.it's funny how at kenyon, you take for granted that the people around you think about more than the last episode of dynasty. i guess that's what it means to be in an ivory tower.anyway, after a few months at this job, i was starved for some life of the mind that, during my lunch break, i used to read those poli sci books that i'd somehow never quite finished when i was here. some of those books were actually kind of interesting. it was a rude shock to see just how empty and robotic life can be when you don't care about what you're doing, and the only reason you're there is to pay the bills. thoreau said,"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."that's one of those dumb cocktail quotations that will strike fear in your heart as you get older. actually, i was leading a life of loud desperation.when it seemed i would be writing about "midnite madness sale-abrations" for the rest of my life, a friend used to console me that cream always rises to the top. i used to think, so do people who throw themselves into the sea.i tell you all this because it's worth recognizing that there is no such thing as an overnight success. you will do well to cultivate the resources in yourself that bring you happiness outside of success or failure. the truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive. at that time, we turn around and say, yes, this is obviously where i was going all along. it's a good idea to try to enjoy the scenery on the detours, because you'll probably take a few.i still haven't drawn the strip as long as it took me to get the job. to endure five years of rejection to get a job requires either a faith in oneself that borders on delusion, or a love of the work. i loved the work.drawing comic strips for five years without pay drove home the point that the fun of cartooning wasn't in the money; it was in the work. this turned out to be an important realization when my break finally came.like many people, i found that what i was chasing wasn't what i caught. i've wanted to be a cartoonist since i was old enough to read cartoons, and i never really thought about cartoons as being a business. it never occurred to me that a comic strip i created would be at the mercy of a bloodsucking corporate parasite called a syndicate, and that i'd be faced with countless ethical decisions masquerading as simple business decisions.to make a business decision, you don't need much philosophy; all you need is greed, and maybe a little knowledge of how the game works.as my comic strip became popular, the pressure to capitalize on that popularity increased to the point where i was spending almost as much time screaming at executives as drawing. cartoon merchandising is a $12 billion dollar a year industry and the syndicate understandably wanted a piece of that pie. but the more i though about what they wanted to do with my creation, the more inconsistent it seemed with the reasons i draw cartoons.selling out is usually more a matter of buying in. sell out, and you're really buying into someone else's system of values, rules and rewards.the so-called "opportunity" i faced would have meant giving up my individual voice for that of a money-grubbing corporation. it would have meant my purpose in writing was to sell things, not say things. my pride in craft would be sacrificed to the efficiency of mass production and the work of assistants. authorship would become committee decision. creativity would become work for pay. art would turn into commerce. in short, money was supposed to supply all the meaning i'd need.what the syndicate wanted to do, in other words, was turn my comic strip into everything calculated, empty and robotic that i hated about my old job. they would turn my characters into television hucksters and t-shirt sloganeers and deprive me of characters that actually expressed my own thoughts.on those terms, i found the offer easy to refuse. unfortunately, the syndicate also found my refusal easy to refuse, and we've been fighting for over three years now. such is american business, i guess, where the desire for obscene profit mutes any discussion of conscience.you will find your own ethical dilemmas in all parts of your lives, both personal and professional. we all have different desires and needs, but if we don't discover what we want from ourselves and what we stand for, we will live passively and unfulfilled. sooner or later, we are all asked to compromise ourselves and the things we care about. we define ourselves by our actions. with each decision, we tell ourselves and the world who we are. think about what you want out of this life, and recognize that there are many kinds of success.many of you will be going on to law school, business school, medical school, or other graduate work, and you can expect the kind of starting salary that, with luck, will allow you to pay off your own tuition debts within your own lifetime.but having an enviable career is one thing, and being a happy person is another.creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. in a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. a person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential-as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth.you'll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you're doing. there are a million ways to sell yourself out, and i guarantee you'll hear about them.to invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and i think you'll be happier for the trouble.reading those turgid philosophers here in these remote stone buildings may not get you a job, but if those books have forced you to ask yourself questions about what makes life truthful, purposeful, meaningful, and redeeming, you have the swiss army knife of mental tools, and it's going to come in handy all the time.i think you'll find that kenyon touched a deep part of you. these have been formative years. chances are, at least of your roommates has taught you everything ugly about human nature you ever wanted to know.with luck, you've also had a class that transmitted a spark of insight or interest you'd never had before. cultivate that interest, and you may find a deeper meaning in your life that feeds your soul and spirit. your preparation for the real world is not in the answers you've learned, but in the questions you've learned how to ask yourself.graduating from kenyon, i suspect you'll find yourselves quite well prepared indeed.i wish you all fulfillment and happiness. congratulations on your achievement.bill wattersonkenyon collegegambier, ohmay 20, 1990 ((originally posted online at http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/spe_kc.htm. as of august 2010 the link is no longer available.retrieved from http://www.graduationwisdom.com/speeches/0025-watterson.htm))

7:29 am - advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young



inside every adult lurks a graduation speaker dying to get out, some world-weary pundit eager to pontificate on life to young people who'd rather be rollerblading. most of us, alas, will never be invited to sow our words of wisdom among an audience of caps and gowns, but there's no reason we can't entertain ourselves by composing a guide to life for graduates.i encourage anyone over 26 to try this and thank you for indulging my attempt.ladies and gentlemen of the class of '97:wear sunscreen.if i could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. the long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. i will dispense this advice now.check out our crossword, sudoku and jumble puzzles >>enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. oh, never mind. you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. but trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. you are not as fat as you imagine.don't worry about the future. or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. the real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle tuesday.do one thing every day that scares you.sing.don't be reckless with other people's hearts. don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.floss.don't waste your time on jealousy. sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. the race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.remember compliments you receive. forget the insults. if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.keep your old love letters. throw away your old bank statements.stretch.don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. the most interesting people i know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. some of the most interesting 40-year-olds i know still don't.get plenty of calcium. be kind to your knees. you'll miss them when they're gone.maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. your choices are half chance. so are everybody else's.enjoy your body. use it every way you can. don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.read the directions, even if you don't follow them.do not read beauty magazines. they will only make you feel ugly.get to know your parents. you never know when they'll be gone for good. be nice to your siblings. they're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.live in new york city once, but leave before it makes you hard. live in northern california once, but leave before it makes you soft. travel.accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise. politicians will philander. you, too, will get old. and when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.respect your elders.don't expect anyone else to support you. maybe you have a trust fund. maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. but you never know when either one might run out.don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. advice is a form of nostalgia. dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.but trust me on the sunscreen. (mary schmich, 1997)

tyger, tyger, burning bright	 in the forests of the night,	 what immortal hand or eye	 could frame thy fearful symmetry?	  in what distant deeps or skiesburnt the fire of thine eyes?	 on what wings dare he aspire?	 what the hand dare seize the fire?	  and what shoulder and what art	 could twist the sinews of thy heart?and when thy heart began to beat,	 what dread hand and what dread feet?	  what the hammer? what the chain?	 in what furnace was thy brain?	 what the anvil? what dread graspdare its deadly terrors clasp?	  when the stars threw down their spears,	 and water'd heaven with their tears,	 did he smile his work to see?	 did he who made the lamb make thee? tyger, tyger, burning bright	 in the forests of the night,	 what immortal hand or eye	 dare frame thy fearful symmetry?	   - william blake (1757-1827, tyger)
