trusted - safe - secure - since 2004
about us: greetings and welcome to flyshop new zealand - flyshop is owned and operated by steve gerard - 

"i have long had a passion for our river environments, fishing for me is just an excuse to venture into the back country, where being there is a simple pleasure in itself. in 2012 i established the future rivers trust in an effort to give back and protect those special areas - we need to do so much more!"
we are a family run business, with my wife providing invaluable assistance. we are based in methven, a small rural town in the central south island and have been serving the fly fishing community for almost two decades, sending out orders daily to all corners of the globe. 



"i was lucky enough to be brought up on the banks of the rakaia river so fishing has been in my blood from an early age. i also gained a lot of valuable experience from a 12 year stint as a fishing guide, and now run the shop full time". 
steve gerard
