our vibrant arts and culture scene is evident in a myriad of galleries, installations, murals, festivals, and performance venues. dozens of independently owned and operated restaurants, breweries and distilleries are sure to satisfy any palette. if sports and athletic competition is your thing, enjoy a bit of small-town baseball in one of the most scenic ballparks in the u.s., or watch international athletes compete in a spartan races.
