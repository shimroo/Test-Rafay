clan mcalister of america (cma), the brainchild of the late 
       paul emmitt towry (a05), was founded in 1990 by him and other volunteers with the mission of searching for, preserving, and sharing mcalister (of whatever spelling) genealogy and history.
       
       cma currently has identified 350 separate mcalister family lines containing over 100,000 individuals, and is continuously extending and connecting those lines through identification of common ancestors and descendants.  cma also collaborates in a robust familytreedna âmcalister dna projectâ incorporating genetic genealogy using y-dna, mitochondrial dna, and autosomal dna. if you are a mcalister or related to one, we can help you search for your ancestors. 
       
       the cma wiki repository, accessable for free by all cma members, is a digital data resource of 30 years of cma research and documentation. among other items, it includes sasines, censuses, parochial birth and death records, and other documents, some dating from the 16th century, as well as  cma ancestral family line information.  
       
       our quarterly journal + newsletter features articles on family histories, scottish history and culture, and genealogical matters. cma also hosts a biennial gathering of members and prospective members to discuss genealogy and to socialize among like-minded individuals.  
       
       cma currently has active members around the world. if you are a mcalister (of whatever spelling), related to a mcalister, or just interested in mcalister genealogy, you can join or rejoin cma by clicking on the button above.









    

    cma believes that discrimination and harassment, in any form that is inconsistent with federal laws, undermine the integrity of the association; thus, cma promotes mutual respect and professional conduct at all times.

cma is a 501(c)(7) non-profit organization incorporated in arkansas on 20 march 1995.
