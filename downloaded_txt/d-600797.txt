haloscan





nothing like bringing you out from hibernation when you discover that "haloscan" is no more (well it is but under a different name asking for money). net result = those of us who have used haloscan as a comment platform have now lost all our comments. i'm not bothered about that from an egotistical perspective but rather that comments are an integral part of memories. i will miss the valuable comments of friends and fellow bloggers at times which i have forgotten but whose opinions i respected. it's a sad loss. perhaps time to hibernate again?

michael phelphs and his winky





i'm just about getting sick of hearing about michael phelphs and his brief hit on a bong every time i turn on cnn. personally, i think that his recent display exhibiting more than just his new swimsuit is far more newsworthy!

demons





every now and again, the most unlikely of sources throws up the tastiest bit of 'eye candy'. in this case, the new uk show entitled 'demons'. it seems to be an attempt at a 'blighty' version of 'supernatural' but with more black comedy. what am i talking about in terms of 'eye candy'? here are a few stills of the man himself and a few of the demons. definitely going to be on my 2009 must see list.......
