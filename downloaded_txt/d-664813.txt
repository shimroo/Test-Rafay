update on the icrc cyber-attack 



									the icrc determined on 18 january that servers in geneva hosting the personal information of more than 500,000 people receiving services from the red cross and red crescent movement were compromised in a sophisticated cyber security attack.  we take this cyber-attack extremely seriously and have been working with our humanitarian partners around the world to understand the scope of the attack and take the appropriate measures to safeguard our data. the irish red cross servers have not been affected by this attack.
