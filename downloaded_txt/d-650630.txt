how to find a 
		good and (or) the best bible commentary for your bible study:



1.     
		

		know what your needs are.  
		bible commentaries are written for various levels of study. 
		some offer a general overview of the text. 
		other commentaries offer an exposition of the text that is 
		verse-by-verse.  some will 
		even discuss the words used in the original text (i.e. hebrew and 
		greek).  bible commentaries 
		range from very simplistic to highly technical. 
		one means of determining what type of bible commentary you need 
		is based on how you will use the commentary. 
		is this for your personal use? 
		do you need a commentary to teach a bible class? 
		is the commentary for sermon preparation? 



2.     
		

		if you want your bible study to be enhanced by a commentary, you should 
		know something about the author of the book you are considering buying. 
		does he allow his religious background to influence his comments 
		on the bible?  some 
		demonstrate bias in their work and especially their writings. 
		seek to find bible study material that is free from biasâyou want 
		an author who will offer an unvarnished view of the biblical text. 



3.     
		

		applying the bible to everyday life. 
		a key part of all bible study is applying godâs word to daily 
		life.  preachers need to do 
		this in their sermons, and bible class teachers need to do this for 
		their students.  some bible 
		commentaries offer very little application of the text. 
		other commentaries offer more application than interpretation. 
		know how much âapplicationâ you need, and use this criteria to 
		help you select a good bible commentary. 



4.     
		

		a series of bible commentaries: 
		rather than try to find several individual bible commentaries, 
		some think they can find a single series of commentaries, and this is 
		all they will ever need.  
		while this approach is understandable, it is not always the best choice. 
		if a series of commentaries is done by a single author, the 
		author may have done an especially good job with some bible books but 
		not in others.  if a 
		commentary series is done by multiple authors, some authors may be 
		outstanding, and others may be very poor. 
		there are a few bible commentaries that must be bought as a set, 
		or you may want to purchase an entire set; however, it is better to 
		individually select the best volumes from a set of bible commentaries. 



5.     
		

		bible commentaries can often be purchased as paperback books, hardback 
		books, or in some type of electronic format. 
		many now like bible commentaries on-line and many search for 
		things like âfree bible commentaryâ or âon-line bible commentary.â 
		you need to decide what you like best. 
		many bible students prefer a combination of bible commentaries in 
		the form of actual books and electronic books. 
		some bible programs include bible commentaries that are pretty 
		good.  other bible programs 
		are seemingly filled with very poor commentaries, perhaps in an attempt 
		to make their product more attractive to unsuspecting buyers.

 



6.     
		

		has the bible commentary material actually been taught in a classroom 
		setting?  the best bible 
		commentaries have been taught to students. 
		when authors write material that is not âfield tested,â it may 
		make a lot of sense to them but not to those who eventually read the 
		material.  see if you can 
		find bible study material that has actually been used to instruct 
		others.

 



7.     
		

		what version is the bible commentary based on? 
		many modern bible commentaries are based on the niv (the new 
		international version).  
		while the niv is not a paraphrase, it is by no means one of the more 
		accurate translations.  
		several good bible commentaries have been based on the kjv (king james 
		version), the asv (american standard version) and the nasb (new american 
		standard bible).  you may 
		choose a bible commentary that is based on a translation that is not 
		very accurate, but this should be done very, very cautiously.

 



8.     
		

		remember, bible commentaries are not inspired by god. 
		just because the author says something is true, or just because 
		he has an advanced degree, that does not make the statement true. 
		the bible tells us to check things out for ourselves (acts 
		17:11), so do not let a commentator have the final word on something; 
		especially in matters related to salvation, worship and christian 
		living.

 



9.     
		

		how many bible commentaries should you buy? 
		some preachers have dozens or hundreds of bible commentaries. 
		there are even some preachers who have several thousand bible 
		commentaries.  a person may 
		have a houseful of bible study tools, but if he does not use them or 
		know what is in them, they are of little use to him. 
		only purchase bible study materials that you will realistically 
		use.  bible commentaries are 
		to help people learn more about the scriptures, not impress people.

 



10. 
		

		what about one volume commentaries? 
		some bible commentaries are contained in a single volume. 
		in some cases there is a single volume for the old testament and 
		a single volume for the new testament. 
		single volume commentaries can be useful, but they usually lack 
		the depth you find in a commentary that focuses on a single bible book.

 



11. 
		

		look for a bible commentary that offers cross-references. 
		a good bible commentary will usually offer cross-references at 
		different points to help you further study out various subjects. 
		these cross-references are often neglected by readers, but a lot 
		of good information can be gained by taking the time to read and study 
		them.

 



12. 
		

 do not overlook old commentaries 
		on the bible.  many seem to 
		think the ânewest books are the best,â but such is not always true with 
		bible study tools.   
		people have been writing some very insightful things about the bible for 
		some 2,000 years.  some of 
		the bible commentary information from the 1800âs is especially good. 
		do not discount older bible commentators.

 



13. 
		

		when people think of âbible commentaries,â they often think of books 
		which offer specific comments on the text. 
		while this definition is fairly accurate, there are other books 
		that also fall into the âcommentaryâ category. 
		bible encyclopedias and bible dictionaries are sometimes useful 
		in studying the bible.  
		naveâs topical bible may be considered a âcommentaryâ resource. 
		there are also âtheologyâ books that discuss various topics. 
		many bible students appreciate various âword study resourcesâ 
		such as henry thayerâs greek-english lexicon and the greek english 
		lexicon by bauer.  bible 
		commentary information can also be found using the âsynonyms of the new 
		testamentâ by trench, the theological lexicon of the new testament by 
		spicq, the exegetical dictionary of the new testament by balz and 
		schneider, the dictionary of new testament of theology by colin brown, 
		and kittelâs theological dictionary of the new testament.

 



14. 
		

		bigger is not always better.  
		some seem to have the idea that if a bible commentary is âbigâ (hundreds 
		or thousands of pages), it will be good. 
		some authors say a lot in a few words and others say very little 
		in a lot of words.

 



15. 
		

		the cost (price) of bible commentaries is another important matter. 
		some bible commentaries may cost as little as $5.00 if purchased 
		new.  others may cost close 
		to $100.  while it is true 
		that some excellent commentaries are often $15-$20, it is not true that 
		a high price always guarantees a good or useful bible commentary. 
		some high priced commentaries have very little value to most 
		people and some inexpensive bible commentaries are very, very good.

 



16. 
		

		bible commentaries can sometimes be bought at a discounted rate. 
		when many people think of buying a bible commentary they go to 
		the local religious bookstore in their local mall. 
		many of the big name chain bookstores no longer carry a wide 
		selection of bible commentaries. 
		on-line shopping may be a better way to find bible commentaries. 
		there are also some companies that specialize in discounted 
		religious books, including bible commentaries.

 



17. 
		

		do not let a bible commentary be a substitute for personal bible study. 
		some treat a commentary as if it is on the same level as godâs 
		word or even more important than the scriptures. 
		a bible commentary is just thatâa commentary. 
		it may help you understand some bible passages better, but it is 
		an uninspired work.

 



18. 
		

		a bible commentary may take the form of a âtopical study.â 
		for instance, if you found a good book describing the âfruit of 
		the spiritâ or the âworks of the fleshâ in gal. 5:19, this book would 
		qualify as a âbible commentary.â 
		some great bible commentaries actually take the form of a topical 
		study.

 



19. 
		

		pray if you are searching for a bible commentary on a certain book or 
		perhaps your very first bible commentary. 
		ask god in his providence to help you find the book or books you 
		need to better know him and his word.

 



20. 
		

		try to preview any bible commentary before purchasing it. 
		google books has many books available that can be viewed for 
		free, including my bible commentary on romans and my bible commentary on 
		first corinthians.  you might 
		be able to find an excerpt of the book you are studying on-line, or the 
		bible commentary you are considering may also be available on-line.

 

many have found 
		their bible study to be enhanced by one or more bible commentaries. 
		if you want to further your journey in knowing god more fully, 
		feel free to visit 

		www.abiblecommentary.com 
		and take advantage of all the bible study and bible commentary material 
		available there. 

 

may god richly 
		bless your study of his word.
