lakeview community church
whether you are a visitor or have been attending for years, we pray you feel the love of god here at lakeview. if you do not already have a church family we would like to invite you to become part of ours. you are only a visitor once and after that you are family. we believe every member of the family of god has a place and a ministry. our hope is that we are able to guide you in finding yours. may the blessing of god be upon you as you press forward in your relationship with him.
