 pcnj has provided an excellent space for me to be my truest self surrounded by other queer people who have common interests and experiences. not only are the events fantastic, but i have also bonded with other members and regularly hang out with them outside of the groups. i highly recommend checking out pcnj if you are looking for a good queer space!
