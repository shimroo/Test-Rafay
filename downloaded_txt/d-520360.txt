                  the insurance consumer advocate network (“i-can”)
              was formed in 1994 by a retired adjuster (j.
              d. howard) as a consumer advocacy effort local to arizona.
              in 1996, this web site was developed to empower consumers
              nationwide.

                    forty years of consumer abuse cause some to see things as they are and ask “why”
                    - - - we dream things that never were and ask “why not ?”
