customer reviews
everyone there is really nice and helpful. they all seemed interested and treated me respectfully and were not condescending at all even though i am new to boat ownership. they all exceeded what i expected from a business that i did not have a previous relationship with and even on a busy saturday morning they treated me like i was a long time customer. i would recommend lpm for all boating needs. a special shout out to logan and dylan who really impressed me with their attention to detail and willingness to genuinely be helpful to me. you won me over after my first impression this weekend. thank you.
