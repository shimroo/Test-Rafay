find a workshopwhat do people say about us?‚Äúi have worked for the grantee, grantor, and sub-recipient. i am a grant writer, grants reviewer, and a grant manager. i have spent hours of my life reading, writing and re-writing narratives, summaries, and other components of grants. if only i had met you and attended the class when i began my career ten years ago! the class confirmed that i know a few tricks of the trade, taught me new and easier ways to process, and opened my eyes to many opportunities. thank you ‚Äì it‚Äôs the best bang for the buck my employer could ever get!‚Äùcarolyn l. | grant coordinator"i put off taking grant writing usa's course until it was presented in san diego. having taken several other courses in the interim, my recommendation to budding grant writers is to start out with this one, even if it's out of town. if you feel you need more training, take it again! if you're serious about writing grants, i can't think of a better use of your valuable time and money."jon l. | executive director"this training provides the information necessary for researching, writing, and submitting funding proposals to federal, state, corporate, or private foundation funders.  i recommend this training for the municipal, county, educational and non-profit officials who are considering or seeking grants to supplement their budgets during these times of economic belt tightening."stacey p. | deputy director
