the departmental of physics curriculum combines fundamental physics courses with hands-on laboratory training and research projects.
we have a dedicated faculty and staff that support such student participation with state-of-the-art research laboratories, observatories and other educational programs that will enhance the students' future professional prospects.
the flexibility of the curriculum permits interdisciplinary exploration, not only among the physics and astronomy disciplines, but also the other stem fields such as biology, chemistry, geology, environmental sciences, mathematics and computer science.
we expect our curriculum to result in physics graduates who are capable of applying and adapting their undergraduate education in a variety of scientific, teaching or engineering professions, as well as future educational endeavors.
