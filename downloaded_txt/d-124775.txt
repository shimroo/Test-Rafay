testimonials






 mas table top epoxy
great stuff-- 2022-08-02  this is my 3rd order of the mas table top resin. i've tried the other resins but nothing really is thick like this product. thicker resin, creates better art for me.
thanks, ordering my 4th batch now.-- by kenji


 high torque clock movements (up to 5/8" dial face)
happy customer -- 2017-04-28  i am pleased with price and quality. i have purchased a few of these movements and have been satisfied with them.-- karleen stallard


 modified geometry scroll saw blades #2/0r (.0087" x .0236" x 15.4tpi) (pk/12)
great blades! -- 2017-11-09  the pegas blades are so well made i had originally ordered just a few to try them out. after 2 projects i ordered enough so that i could replace all the olson and flying dutchman blades i have... as i wont be using them any longer. thanks! -- marc phillips
