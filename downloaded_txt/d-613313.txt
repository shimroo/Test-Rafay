a message from debbie
the galice resort is a family owned and operated business. galice has been home to three generations of the thomason family, and now we have a fourth generation ready to ride the waves and walk the banks of the rogue. the rogue river has a way of touching the lives of the people who float through the timeless canyons, drift downstream toward whitewater thrills, or relax and reflect along the bank of the river. you will come to know and love galice just as our family has experienced it for generations.
