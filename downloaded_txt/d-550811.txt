overview
overview of climate and culture
florida is by far the most popular retirement destination for active adults. there are many age-restricted  or age-targeted communities in the eight major regions, the panhandle, northern florida, upper atlantic coast and jacksonville, central florida and orlando, tampa bay, the space coast, lower gulf coast and the lower atlantic coast and miami.
with a tropical/subtropical climate that encourages gardening, sun-worship, and year-round golf,  florida is filled with exciting urban areas such as miami, tampa, and orlando.  the heat is bearable keeping in mind that no part of florida is too far from any coast. standing in central florida you can see the space shuttle flying as it launched with the naked eye. during the summer months the temperature is in the low 90’s while it is a balmy 50 degree average in the winter months.  during the summer there are a lot of quick thunderstorms that come and go quickly. the results of these summer rains means florida has one of the highest averages of precipitation, keeping the state lush and green throughout. the southern region of florida is known as the everglades and made up of swamps and marshes. you’ll find many lakes in the central region of florida. that is one of the reasons walt disney picked orlando to build his theme park, walt disney world.
historical sites like st. augustine and cape canaveral are intriguing aside a surprising amount of quiet, purely rural countryside in the central and northern parts of the state. 

many active adults call florida home and enjoy a myriad opportunities for recreation and entertainment. over 161 state parks in the state offer activities like camping, hiking, bird watching, horseback riding and much more.  many of these parks offer educational services geared towards informing people about this state's wildlife. this state was made for active senior living. the famous everglades in the south, numerous theme parks and sports and extensive parks and preserves featuring boating, fishing, and aquatic activity, have all helped transform florida from a sleepy southern backwater to a booming state in little more than a century.
healthcare 
active adults who need regular medical attention will be glad to know that florida has 252 active physicians per 100,000 people. that is one of the highest physician counts in the entire country. there are 303 hospitals in the state offering state-of-the-art care, treating everything from the common cold to cancer. active adults in this state live well knowing that if they ever need help there are numerous medical options in the area. there is even a mayo clinic in jacksonville.
cost of living
florida is a friendly tax state for active adults and a robust senior living lifestyle. there is no state income tax. a low 6% sales tax on all good sold is a state law. property tax is collected at the local level rather than by the state. active senior adults will find one very interesting exemption, the senior citizen exemption. this exemption is available in certain counties only and is valued up to $50,000 for residents 65 and older with a gross income below $20,000. and no tax on lottery winnings!
