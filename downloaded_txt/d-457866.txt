		10 reasons why pitbulls
		are scary!



it 
      is estimated as many as 250,000,000 companion animals were slaughtered in 
      american 'shelters' during the last decade. that figure is equivalent to 
      the entire us human population in  1991.

this site is dedicated to citizens  
      everywhere who are willing to join together for a common cause: to stop the killing of  dogs and cats  and other companion animals in our municipal shelters.
whether you are a rescuer of many, an 
      animal caregiver of few or  simply a concerned individual, if you believe 
      that a 'shelter' should be a safe haven for animals that leads to their eventual placement into loving, adoptive homes, then you 
      have come to the right place. how do we accomplish our goal? 
we are an 
      advocacy group willing to do what is necessary to save the lives of 
      millions of 
      companion animals incarcerated in our animal control facilities who will never leave alive 
      unless we take action.
we want our public officials to know 
      we have sat on the sidelines long enough for them to make the right 
      choices. their decisions have cost the lives of thousands of our community 
      animals. we now have to take a stand. we demand that our representatives 
      yield to the will of their constituents. they must stop the killing now. our plan covers several fronts...read

nevada county 
collects funds for no-kill goals
 
  


the director of no-kill now!:
    "i hear it over and over again. 'doesn't a no kill shelter have to kill when 
    all the cages are full?' this is the question most often asked. 

    "the 
    objective of no-kill is to prevent filling animal pounds to capacity.  
    how this is accomplished encompasses everything that the no-kill movement is 
    about.
"we can stop looking for that 
easy one-step 
solution to overpopulation. we've already had a quick-fix for the last 150 years. it 
has been 
 
killing.  today our society is ready for a more  sophisticated and 
humane response.

"no-kill requires a 
collaboration between



the public



rescues



pound administrators



veterinarians



charitable foundations



government officials



and the business 
community.



"no-kill is not one solution.  it is many.

for the first no-kill city shelter in the west!
		----------------
 




a "no-kill" fervor is spreading across the united 
states like wildfire.  it is advocated by our neighbors in canada and mexico 
and has found supporters in nearly every continent on the globe. what does it  mean? can shelters 
really save all animals?  is this  the best solution? 

the term raises many questions and an eager 
public, weary of all the killing, wants answers.  

■  the california legislature defines 
no-kill  
the most widely accepted 
definition of "no-kill" in the country has been adopted by the california 
legislature.  read more.





if 
      you can offer a temporary home 
      to one or more dogs or cats currently scheduled to be killed at the 
      rancho cucamonga animal 'shelter', please help! 
what's so great about fostering?

      nothing feels better than 
      saving lives! just think what an influence you can be on your children, family, neighbors and community! if we can get everyone to help, we can turn our 
      animal pound into a place of joy and salvation! 90% of animals in city 
      facilities are healthy, adoptable
      companions 
      that had homes and were a part of families. 
       

 


 




no-kill
      impossible you say?
		no-kill facilities are operating in several cities across the country, 
		including new york,  san francisco and utah.  while some 
		pounds kill as many as 90% of the animals they capture and that owners 
		relinquish, others are reducing their kill rates of adoptable animals to 
		0%! 

"some people still think it will be 
	impossible ever to bring an end to the killing of homeless animals in this 
	country. among them are some of the nations largest, oldest, and most 
	well-known  and well-funded  animal rights organizations and humane 
	societies.

    "they may be right. it may indeed be impossible. then again, lots of 
	perfectly honorable and decent people, 150 years ago, believed it would be 
	impossible ever to bring an end to slavery, however much they disapproved of 
	it. more

please 
		give the animals a voice and sign!
