jewan r.
“thank you aaron for this wonderful community minded store. i really appreciate this store reopening to serve us. i love shopping there, also the quality of the food and the friendly people who work there. it's really a wonderful experience for me and my friends.  not sure how you can complete with big box and online stores with all the sales you hold weekly. you put the customers first and we really appreciate that. i pray that god richly bless you and his blessings overflow abundantly in all areas of your life. may you have abundance beyond your wildest dreams and success beyond belief. thank you, we appreciate you.  god bless. love and light.”

“a hidden gem! such a beautiful store filled with fresh fruits and veggies, great selection of supplements and vitamins and delicious prepared food from the kitchen! the staff is friendly and the store is pristinely clean! small businesses like this are few and far between, bravo to everyone for making it a bright spot at jax beach!”






jay c.
“one of my favorite things about jacksonville beach is this grocery store. i will miss it. whenever i bought something here, i felt confident that it was of quality/good ingredients. they weed out, ‘bad for you’ products.”






susan m.
“native sun at jax beach is our go to for produce, meats and frozen fruits (before, during and after the pandemic). we trust that what we buy is organic and the options are better than any other health food store in jacksonville.”
