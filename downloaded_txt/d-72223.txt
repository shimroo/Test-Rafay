picturehouse film club


 
clapham picturehouse



i’ve been a member of picturehouse cinemas for something approaching twenty years. it costs about £60 a year and for that, you get five free tickets and discounts on your tickets and snacks. i’ve often wondered whether it’s worth paying for, but in the last couple of years, they’ve added an extra feature that makes… continue reading picturehouse film club

the tourist


 
the view of the planet



changing rooms are the same all over the galaxy and this one really played to the stereotype. the lights flickered that little bit more than you’d want them to, a sizeable proportion of the lockers wouldn’t lock and the whole room needed a good clean. it didn’t fit with the eye-watering amount of money we… continue reading the tourist

2023 in gigs


 
the imagined village



i really thought that 2023 would be the year i got back into the swing of seeing gigs. but, somehow i ended up seeing even fewer than i did in 2022 – 12, when i saw 16 the previous year. sometimes, i look at martin’s monthly gig round-ups and wonder what i’m doing with my… continue reading 2023 in gigs

2022 in gigs


 
lcd soundsystem at brixton academy



rather later than usual (again!) here is my review of the best ten gigs i saw in 2022. for the first time since 2019, i did actually see more than ten gigs in 2022 although my total of sixteen falls well short of my pre-pandemic years. here are my ten favourite gigs of the year.… continue reading 2022 in gigs

5 reasons why using ai to generate blog posts can destroy your seo


 



using artificial intelligence (ai) to generate blog posts can be bad for search engine optimization (seo) for several reasons. first and foremost, ai-generated content is often low quality and lacks the depth and substance that search engines look for when ranking content. because ai algorithms are not capable of understanding the nuances and complexities of… continue reading 5 reasons why using ai to generate blog posts can destroy your seo

should children be polite while using smart speakers?


 



‘okay google. where is antarctica?” children can now get answers to all their questions using smart speakers and digital voice assistants. a few years ago, children would run to their parents or grandparents to answer their questions. but with the ascendence of voice assistants to the mainstream in recent years, many children rely more on… continue reading should children be polite while using smart speakers?

2021 in gigs


 
heaven 17



a little later than usual, here’s my review of the gigs i saw last year. in 2020, i saw four gigs. in 2021, i almost doubled that to seven. obviously, we spent a lot of the year with most music venues closed, so those few gigs i saw were all in the second half of… continue reading 2021 in gigs

the return of rtd


 



doctor who has a new showrunner. but he’s actually an old showrunner. is that a good idea? since the news broke yesterday, doctor who fan forums have been discussing nothing but the fact that russell t davies is returning as showrunner after chris chibnall’s regeneration special is broadcast next year. most fans seem to be… continue reading the return of rtd

virgin tv 360 — first impressions


 



i’ve just upgraded my v6 box to virgin tv 360. i’m starting to think that was a mistake. when liberty global took over virgin media in 2013, it seemed likely that at some point in the future vm would stop using tivo software to run its set-up boxes and switch to something based on liberty’s… continue reading virgin tv 360 — first impressions
