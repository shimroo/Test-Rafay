"...the e-mail tips are great they are very helpful, just thought i would 
		let you know what you are providing is a great thing keep up the great 
		work. "            
		best regards, -george carreon

				 

i 
				have previously invested at least $400-$500 in video training 
				alone...you can imagine my surprise when after all of that 
				i realized 
i 
				was learning faster & more efficiently from free emails,
				
i 
				thought maybe i'd pick up one or two things but i've learned 
				alot.  
my 
				dvd training (the 
				mega package 
				incl. tutorial key training) should arrive today & i can't wait.
				

				 


				knowing how much i've learned just from your free stuff i can't 
				even imagine what the video's will be like. thank you for 
				sharing your wealth of knowledge with people like me, it's truly 
				a service to our kind. thank you.

						"the photoshop cs/cs2 tutorialkey training that i 
						recently acquired has taken me to another level 
						in such a short time.  the tutorials are so easy 
						to follow and well explained which really helps the 
						learning curve.  it is almost like setting in a 
						classroom and having your questions answered... well 
						done!!."

"i had 
						gone to basic photoshop school and had not learned how 
						to understand masking.  i took the masking with the 
						gradiant tool and showed it to my school instructor and 
						he learned something new - thank you very much for 
						your training dvds"

7/10/05    i was 
		writing the email asking you what i can do about having previously 
		ordered the madison ave. dvd & before i could even finish, you 
		wrote to me telling me that i have a $113 credit for having already 
		purchased it. now that's service. i have to say i'm amazed.
		that level of service & honesty 
		as (at least i thought) impossible to find on the internet. 
		....thank you very, very much. i have to say that you definitely just 
		got yourself a lifelong, loyal customer.

		sincerely, walter f gremba jr

"...over 
		all your training
		dvds rival the best in the business.
