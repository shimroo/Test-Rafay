history
decordova sculpture park and museum is located on the former estate of julian and elizabeth “lizzie” de cordova (1851-1945). the self-educated son of a jamaican merchant, julian de cordova became a successful tea broker, wholesale merchant, investor, and president of the union glass company in somerville, massachusetts. although he married into the locally prominent dana family of boston, julian achieved prosperity without the advantages of inheritance or social position.
