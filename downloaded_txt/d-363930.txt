watchmen on the wall 

presently there are many 
	ministries which intercede for the united states and for the nations of the 
	world. no serious christian can doubt that evil men have come to power in 
	the world, whose purpose is to overthrow free forms of government and to 
	suppress the gospel of jesus christ. however, few christians seem to be 
	aware that this same anti-christ network has infiltrated the church with a 
	hidden agenda of subverting the true faith and converting believers to their 
	false religious system.   

this quiet intrusion of false brethren 
                                    into the life of the church was foretold in 
                                    the new testament.  paul stated that, 
                                    for three years, he did not cease to warn 
                                    the church day and night with tears: for i 
                                    know this, that after my departing shall 
                                    grievous wolves enter in among you, not 
                                    sparing the flock. also of your own selves 
                                    shall men arise, speaking perverse things, 
                                    to draw away disciples after them. (acts 
                                    20:29-31)

the book of jude confirms paul's 
	prediction: "beloved, when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the 
	common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you 
	that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto 
	the saints. for there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of 
	old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our god 
	into lasciviousness, and deny the only lord god, and our lord jesus christ." 
	(jude 4) 

the lord jesus christ must have 
	foreseen this great danger to his church when he related the following 
	parable: take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 
	for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and 
	gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the 
	porter to watch. (mark 13:34) 

just as some are called to 
positions of authority within the body of christ and others to serve in various 
ministries, there are also those who are called to be watchmen. in israel, the 
watchman stood on the wall and notified the porter or gatekeeper of the identity 
of anyone who was approaching the city. using a similar analogy, jesus says that 
the gatekeeper will only open the door of the sheepfold to the true shepherd of 
the sheep. "verily, verily, i say unto you, he that entereth not by the door 
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a 
robber. but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. to him 
the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep 
by name, and leadeth them out." (john 10:1-3) 


apparently, it was the duty of the 
watchman to warn and of the porter to protect the city from foreign invaders. 
accordingly, there must be a parallel operation within the church to protect it 
from outside enemies. god has called some to be 'watchmen on the wall' to warn 
those who labor inside and 'gatekeepers' to protect the sheep. 


the lord jesus also prophesied that 
									the period just before his return would be a 
									time of unprecedented deception. in matthew 
									24:24, he says that even the very elect 
									would be deceived ~ if possible. ii 
									thessalonians 2:3 reveals that during this 
									period there would be a great 'falling away' 
									from the faith that was once delivered to 
									the saints. it is difficult to comprehend 
									how this could happen, until it is 
									understood that this deception would come 
									from within the 
church ~ just as paul said it would! 


today, a multitude of zionist jews and 
									freemasons have infiltrated the bible-believing 
churches and are posing as christian ministers. according to jewish author, 
									jeremy rifkin, their expressed goal is to 
									use the evangelical church as the primary 
									instrument to bring their zionist new world 
									order with its jewish world religion to 
									birth. theosophist alice bailey 
									disclosed in 1922 that, in preparation for 
									the false christ, master masons would 
									infiltrate the church and rise to the 
									leadership of the various denominations.







										very 
										definitely may the assurance be given 
										here that, prior to the coming of the 
										christ, adjustments will be made so that at 
										the head of all great organizations will 
										be found either a master, or an initiate 
										who has taken the third initiation. at 
										the head of certain of the great occult 
										groups, of the freemasons of the 
										world, and of the various great 
										divisions of the church, and 
										resident in many of the great nations 
										will be found initiates or masters. (initiation: 
										human & solar, pp. 61-62)










as a result of this judeo-masonic 
									conspiracy, many sincere christians are 
									being led into deception by the abundance of 
									false teachers and prophets on the christian 
									scene and organizations that have the 
									appearance of being christian 
but are apostate in their doctrine and practice.  


the reader may naively 
	assume that the majority of professedly christian leaders could not possibly 
	be false teachers and false prophets because they are so widely accepted.  
	for a more scriptural perspective on this matter, we recommend reading the preacher as a false prophet by rev. james stalker who stated concerning 
	israel, our example: 



the false prophets were strong, not only in their own numbers, but in 
		their popularity with the people.  this told heavily against the 
		true prophets; for the people could not believe that the one man, who 
		was standing alone, was right, and that his opponents, who were many, 
		were wrong.  the seats and the trappings of office always affect 
		the multitude, who are slow to come to the conclusion that the teachers 
		under whom they find themselves in providence can be misleading them...  
		if they are going wrong, they will generally get the majority of the 
		people to follow them.  so completely may this be the case, that by 
		degrees the popular taste is vitiated and will not endure any other 
		teaching than that to which it has been accustomed, though it be false.  
		there is no sadder verse in all prophecy than the complaint of jeremiah, 
		the prophets prophesy falsely, and my people love to have it so.  
		like prophet, like people; the public mind may be so habituated to what 
		is false, and satisfied with it, that it has no taste or even tolerance 
		for the true.  jeremiah could not gain a hearing for his stern and 
		weighty message from ears accustomed to the light and frivolous views of 
		the false prophets; and to baruch, his young coadjutor and amanuensis, 
		who was starting on the prophetic career with the high hopes of youth, 
		he had to deliver the chilling message, seekest thou great things for 
		thyself? seek them not.  the path to popularity and eminence was not 
		open to anyone who did not speak according to the prevailing fashion.



foreseeing the great end-time 
apostasy, when the multitudes would not endure sound doctrine, our gracious lord 
advised us how to recognize and avoid the spiritual deception that would engulf 
the church. in many passages, such as luke 21:34-36, he cautions his disciples 
to 'watch and pray' that they may be accounted worthy to escape the time of 
deception that will surely come to pass.  i peter 4:7 warns, but the end 
of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. the 
apostle peter had learned well the antidote to temptation, for these were the 
very words of warning that jesus spoke to him prior to his own falling away and 
denial of his lord. (mark 14:38) because he had learned to heed these words of 
jesus, peter ultimately glorified the lord through his life and death. 




									watch unto prayer is comprised of those who 
									believe that god has called them to watch 
									and pray for the church. over the past 
									several years we have evolved into a 
									loosely-knit group of christian researchers 
									who live in various parts of the united 
									states. our work is not pastoral ministry or 
									teaching, but investigation of the various 
									evangelical trends, movements and 
	change agents which have infiltrated the christian community with a view to 
	subverting the christian faith. our objective is to report our findings to 
	interested christians so they will become informed, pray and inform others.  
	many pastors and others in christian ministry do not have the time for this 
	kind of research and find our material helpful. we are not affiliated with 
	one particular church or denomination, but we do adhere to the following
									
statement of faith. 
									


if you also have a burden for the 
spiritual condition of the church, you are invited to subscribe to the watch 
unto prayer ministry. each watchman will receive notification of new reports via 
e-mail. the reports are a means of sharing information on the serious issues 
that warrant prayer for the body of christ. although such knowledge is 
personally necessary for each believer, it is not an end in itself. ours is not 
a ministry of merely exposing deception in the church, although we are called to 
do so.  rather, the watch unto prayer ministry has the ultimate purpose of 
rescuing gods people from the present apostasy. who among us can say we have 
never been deceived? as we become informed of the deceptions that are presently 
overtaking the church, and perhaps even ourselves, may we look to the word of 
god with the sense of our own dependence upon god's grace for understanding and 
for the proper guidelines for prayer. 























watch & pray


for spiritual discernment 
			within the church and a disposition to try the spirits and to prove 
			all things, whether they are from god. (i john 4:1-3; i thess. 5:21) 
												

that christians will look 
			only to the word of god as the foundation for sound doctrine and 
			prophecy, rather than trusting in men, experiences, or their own 
			understanding. (prov. 3:5-7; ii tim. 3:16,17; jer. 3:15, 23:28; ii 
			pet. 1:20) 

that pastors, teachers and 
			other christian leaders will not be deceived, but will warn and 
			protect the flocks which are entrusted to their care and for which 
			they will give an account. (i pet. 5:2; acts 20:28; heb. 13:17; see 
			also jer. 23 and ezek. 34) 

that those who are false 
			prophets posing as christian leaders will be exposed, reproved, and 
			their teachings rejected by the church. (ii john 10; titus 3:10,11; 
			ii tim. 3:8,9; eph. 5:11) 

that god will raise up men 
			and women of true spiritual stature to contend for the faith that 
			was once delivered to the saints in scripture. (jude 3; eph. 5:11) 
												

that god will enlist men 
			and women of prayer to intercede for the body of christ in these 
			perilous times. (eph. 6:18; i pet. 5:8; i john 5:16)
