<div>power to the newsroom.</div><div>for less.</div></a>














  

when we started newsengin in 1996, we imagined a different model for software for news organizations. newsroom software at the time was too expensive, too rigid and too complicated. news organizations were largely at the mercy of vendors.more than 25 years later, newsengin helps thousands of journalists around the globe every day deliver every manner of digital and print content with no downtime.we've always believed that the market value of honest journalism rises in an information free-for-all. newsengin has the service that best distills information into authoritative and thoughtful news. we serve everyone from a newsroom of seven people to a distributed operation of more than 400 users that feeds dozens of websites and multiple print centers.we reject the pricing model that has plagued our industry. we don't require long-term contracts or heavy maintenance agreements. instead, we provide software as a service that covers all your costs.we are fanatical about supporting our customers, many of whom insist we’re the best company they’ve ever worked with. we’re not making that up.and long before the pandemic disrupted the concept of an office, newsengin enabled the idea of a virtual newsroom. for more than 15 years, our browser-based system has allowed staff members to work anywhere they want.we welcome the chance to talk with you about how newsengin can help your organization.
