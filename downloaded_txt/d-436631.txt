            advertising and pr agencies don't need an excuse to party. though turning 50 is a pretty good one.we’re proud to be a place that so many smart, talented, weird and wonderful people have called home. (and a business that so many businesses have trusted with, you know, their business.)but in the end, maybe the best part of turning fifty is getting the chance to turn fifty-one. to keep having fun together, making amazing things with even more amazing people we can call family. to be here for what’s new, and lead the way toward what’s next. to continue making a difference.and celebrating one thing or another.  show mecategoryindustry

      our work to support the launch of the boston globe rhode island edition
      led to being named the boston globe’s agency of record for the globe
      “proper”. we’re honored to have contributed to the celebration of 150
      years of the boston globe, and we’re so proud of our work that has
      encapsulated a century and a half of journalism and truth-seeking into
      three short videos and a public exhibit that will be traveling
      throughout boston.
