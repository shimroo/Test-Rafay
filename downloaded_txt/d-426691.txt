welcome to pendleton pilatesat pendleton pilates, our work with our clients begins with the fundamental principles of pilates. once these are understood, the work becomes incredibly efficient and profoundly effective.each exercise, whether on the mat or a piece of equipment, is simply a choreographed sequence designed to put the body in motion while maintaining an intense focus on the core. once a client truly grasps the principles of pilates, there is no such thing as a "beginner" workout.
