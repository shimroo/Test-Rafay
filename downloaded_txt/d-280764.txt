human security and ir theory 

 


06:39pm 29/04/2006


 

  
  final exam:  human security and ir theoryhallie jonesmay 2nd, 2005the notion or concept of “human security” is extremely difficult to define.  the term is vague, broad, and often times a serious point of contention amongst its most ardent proponents, according to both paris and mcdonald’s articles.  human security can include elements such as economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security (paris, p. 90).  with such an extensive list of priorities, policymakers and academics must contend with the question of how to address all areas of concern without allowing one area preference over another.  indeed, attempts to narrow the concept have resulted in exclusion of, or hierarchical ordering of, specific normative values over others.   likewise, the notion of human security is so encompassing that it could potentially support all hypothesis and their corresponding null hypothesis.  this perplexes scholars who in turn lack the clear focus and direction necessary to construct well developed theoretical debates from the foundational basis of human security (paris, p. 93).  consequently, developing human security as a theoretical framework for analysis of the international system seems highly improbable.  rather, human security appears to resemble a campaign for normative standards that was constructed to be vague intentionally. when human security is placed in the context of international relations as an organizational apparatus or political tool, it appears to be effective.   the ambiguity of the term provides common ground on which middle-power states (canada, norway, switzerland, chile, etc…) can jointly predicate their foreign policy objectives.  these middle-power states can invoke the human security “campaign” to assemble coalitions thus allowing them to respond to various international actions and political developments with a unified voice.  not only does it initiate strength through numbers and cooperation, but it contributes the additional boost of rallying around a “moral” platform thus providing legitimacy to those specific governments, a global appearance of benevolence, and forces the standards to be raised for opponents by coercion and pressuring through public relations, “soft power”.  a narrowing of the concept would pose additional barriers to this type of coalition building by reducing or shrinking their available area of common ground, and is therefore seen as counterproductive to accomplishing various human security advancements.  liberalism does, can, and should accommodate the notion of human security within its theoretical framework.  according to class discussion, human security falls under the rubric of liberal cosmopolitanism, which is preoccupied with a normative agenda focused on ethics and morality.  according to liberal cosmopolitanism, the western developed countries, or the global north, have an obligation to repay to the south third world for years of exploitation of its natural resources.  this line of reasoning holds the notion of mutual reciprocity as a truism, believing that the north supports its living standards through the oppression of the third world and as such should accept a reduction in its quality or standards of living in order to allow the south to catch up.  the relationship is inversely proportionate; northern standards of living increase as southern standards of living decrease. this specific branch of liberal theory is concerned with the “ought to be” and offers the radical suggestion that the primary unit of analysis or level of inquiry should shift from the state to the individual.  accordingly, this theory posits the notion of individual egalitarianism at its foundation, stating that we all belong to a single species of humanity and are “fragmented” into the state system, which is inconsistent with human nature.  they argue that the state-centric system is oppressive because it authorizes and legitimizes preferential treatment of some over others.  if humans were not fragmented into states, each individual would have the same claim to equal moral worth and status.  evaluating human security in the general context of liberalism, it is apparent that it promotes values, objectives, and a moral agenda that is consistent with the developed north.  human security is predicated on the notion of universalism, the assumption that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.  this generalized conception implies that the values and moral agenda embodied by its proponents are consistent with the rest of the world (translation: liberal democracy).  theoretically, it is flawed because it denies differences and does not allow room for varying positions.  if the unit of analysis is placed upon the individual, how do you find common ground in the current case of iraq?  there are some individuals that want a democratized iraq, and there are others who fervently oppose their country being transformed into a liberalized democracy.  there are two distinct, dichotomous goals at battle.  human security only acknowledges the movement toward establishing a liberalized democracy as the valid or moral side of the coin, they are the “freedom fighters”, while the opposition gets labeled “terrorist” for resisting western values. liberal institutionalism and regime theory argue that a hegemonic power is necessary to enforce the balance of power.  they theorize that actors derive functional satisfaction through an institutional dimension or regimes such as ngo’s.  a hegemon is required to enforce the particular agenda and the anarchical nature of the system is mitigated through cooperation for mutual gain.  additionally, since human security initiatives are created by the un and middle-power states, they are irrelevant if the hegemon choose not to join the ranks of its supporters.  an example would be the kyoto treaty, the us did not sign the treaty because it held competing values as priorities over environmental values, and kyoto is therefore irrelevant because there is no one to police it. structural liberals believe the hegemon is the crucial element.  the hegemon must be liberal and its role is to shape and mold the “separate peace” or democratic zone.  the us is charged with expanding the democratic zone, or spreading democracy, based on the position that liberal democracies don’t fight each other.  this essentially means opening up new markets to foreign investment for members of the controlling liberalized global coalition (further exploitation of the south to maintain the north’s living standards).  when considering human security in that context, the us is violating many facets of the notion, such as using military force, economic sanctions, etc...  however, because the us is liberalized (according to liberal institutionalism), its ability or temptation to become universally dominant is curbed because of the pressure placed on it from other members of the liberal coalition.  therefore, governments advocating for human security concerns are in effect allowing the us to do their bidding.  these countries free-ride, sit back on a soap box and advocate an agenda of morality while the hegemon facilitates the global balance of power which enables them to do so.  these middle-power countries are given a voice through the international organizations which exist in essence because of the primary actions of the hegemon who is responsible for maintaining stability and the global balance of power.  the hegemon can still pick and choose its battles, enjoying a certain degree of freedom.liberalism can and does incorporate the notion of human security.  above, the various perspectives of liberal theory have been explored.  there is disagreement, and the notion of human security is placed in different boxes and afforded different levels of relevance.  liberalism in general would hold that more needs to be done in the way of human security initiatives because it is necessary to maintain the status quo.  the us can not choose to act unilaterally and must at times consider yielding to the initiatives of the un and middle-power states.  after all, the members of the northern liberalized global coalition provide it with its legitimacy.  the us must respond, to some extent, to the majority which authorizes its actions through their inaction.  realists would balk at the notion of human security.  a state-centric theoretical perspective, they would exclude the notion of human security from their consideration because it suggests a radical ontological shift to the individual.  realists would argue that the state is the most rational and logical unit of analysis and would counter by asking how human security theorists expect to resolve problems for individuals.  they would claim that the state is the most obvious structure for managing individual complaints and grievances, because the international system obviously could not effectively govern, facilitate, or administer the day to day realities of individuals.  the international system is too far removed from the individual for this notion to be realistic.realists would debunk the claim that ngo’s and coalitions pushing normative values have a significant amount of relevance.  they would scale the argument back to the basics, that these states are maximum utility organizers seeking to advance their individual positions within the international system.  ngo’s are extensions of the state.  they are rational actors operating within the context of the balance of power which restrains their capabilities.  states use international norms and laws as an avenue to pursue self-interest.  they band together only because they have specific agendas through which they can gain a common mutual benefit.  therefore, while liberalism would recognize cooperation as possible for mutual gain, realism would suggest that the system is still anarchical.  the notion of human security is vague intentionally because these countries in reality are at war with one another.  if there were a more explicit iteration of the concept of human security, these countries would not be able to identify collectively.  they still fear each other, but they fear the hegemonic powers more based on their relative capabilities and that fear drives their behavior within the system.  realism seeks to explain how things are, not how they should be.  there is no room for human security within the theoretical framework of realism.  it is a theory that supports a constant, immutable set of rules or truisms.  realism would treat human security as any other emergent concern or influence within the international system, dealing with it in a manner that is equal to other elements of consideration, such as religion, economics, expansion of territory, and culture.  it is simply another iteration of the struggle for power and balance.  it’s a method for engagement in the international system and an attempt to assert dominance through the use of coercive soft power.  realists believe that the state does not have the capacity to follow moral precepts.  they do not accommodate the notion of dynamism or change in nature.  man, by nature, is evil.  the state is a product of man.  since man exists in a state of war, the state and the international system is therefore a state of war and war does not accommodate human security.   realism can not, does not, and should not incorporate human security into its theoretical body.  realism exists to provide a purely pessimistic critique of the inter-workings of state relations.  it is removed emotionally and is therefore able to provide a more objective impression of the systemic balance of power.  it provides a constant, a point of reference from which arguments can be constructed.  postmodernism, feminism, and green theory all three would fall into the rubric of human security.  postmodernists are credited for being the largest contributors to the area of human security.  they deconstructed and debunked the debates between liberals and realists, questioning and demythologizing the very notion of power and the origin from which it derives its legitimacy.  they uncover the linkage between power and knowledge, calling the discourse between the opposing camps into question for hypocrisy because they package so-called “truisms” into their theories.  postmodernists claim that theory is nothing more than interpretation and the ultimate source of authority is the play of discourse.  as a conceptual notion, human security fits nicely within the context of postmodern thought because it is deconstructed, lacks absolutes, and resists hierarchical or polarized oppositions.  feminism and green theory also fit well within the realm of human security.  each line of argument can be classified as a concern or element that combines to compose the overall concept of human security as a whole.  green theory and environmentalism are interwoven with other elements of human security, such as health security, economic security, and personal security.  likewise, feminism opposes the patriarchal structure and calls each policy area into question from a critical perspective, positing that the global system is created and based around a male dominated agenda.  this is consistent with ngo’s that seek to serve, protect, and represent women.world systems theory would recognize human security as a positive trend serving to effectively dismantle the global economic status quo.  these theorists do not recognize states or individuals.  the unit of analysis is the global capitalist system, which they study objectively from a historical perspective.  they predict that the underlying secular trends, the influence that differentiates capitalism from its respective historical periods, will yield a radically different picture by 2050.  they predict the end result (or natural progression) to be globalized socialism.  the campaign for human security is essentially fighting for position, seeking to serve as the regulatory body that restricts the morally impoverished free-market from operating in a completely unethical, inhumane, and unchecked manner.  socialism is a combination of market economics and democratic controls that facilitate distributive benefits for all based on the notion of individual equality.  world systems theory does accommodate the notion of human security in a way that explains its relevance, permits its validity, and places its importance on an elevated level in the context of analyzing the international system.    social constructivism would also incorporate the concept of human security in its pursuit of playing the role as the great theoretical intermediary or diplomat.  social constructivists would still recognize the state as the primary unit of analysis, however, and would likely use the logic that realism uses to deny the notion of human security.  since human security posits the individual as the primary unit of analysis, and realism points to the state as the logical method to resolve individual grievances, social constructivism would not reject the notion of human security based on this logic.  instead, it would use this as a fertile breeding ground to plant the “great divide-bridging” seeds, arguing that individuals are just as relevant as the state or the global system.   in conclusion, most of the theoretical frameworks we studied accommodate the notion of human security and realism seems to be the single exclusionary realm of discourse.  the fabric for incorporating and treating human security within these various frameworks differs across the board.  world systems theory offers an optimistic outlook for the future by accounting for the equalizing potential that organized resistance and ethical positions can force onto market economic systems, thus restricting and subjecting the behavior of capital to a standard that is consistent with the basic fundamental premises of democracy.  while human security might not prove to be fulfilling as a theoretical framework of ir, it is proving to be effective as a campaign for raising the bar and creating standards to be applied horizontally across humanity.   i’m unsure if you were serious about justifying absences from your class or not.  in case you are serious, here’s my explanation.  i left at the break on one occasion because i was extremely sick, which ended up disabling me for an entire week.  i did consult you to explain the reason for my early departure.  on one other occasion, i did not come to class.  that was the monday directly after spring break.  in the spirit of having moral scruples about myself as an individual, i must admit that i have no good excuse for missing that class.  i had a friend in town from milwaukee and took her on a shopping excursion.  however, we did consume consciously by patronizing the secondary thrift market exclusively, avoiding the direct exploitation of the third world associated with patronizing such retail locations as the mall.   in all, i missed 1.5 classes.

the pledge protection act of 2005 (hr 2389) part 1 

 


06:36pm 29/04/2006


 



mood:  anxious

  policy analysishallie jonesapril 26th 2006political science 629-75 – seminar in american politicspart i: introduction to the issue and its politicson the surface, the pledge protection act of 2005 (hr 2389) is a highly politicized bill that directly confronts mainstream cultural wedge issues pertaining to church-state separation and religious freedoms.  however, when the facade cloaking hr 2389 is chipped away, a complicated and entangled web reveals itself as extending far beyond the constitutional legality of the “under god” phrase.  the pledge protection act is replete with the age-old competing tensions embedded in the united states constitution.  hr 2389 addresses the conflict inherent in reconciling majority and minority rights, provokes the cleavages of federalism, and most immediately challenges the balance of power between the legislative and judicial branches.  the bill is one of several recent attempts by social conservatives in congress to assert its constitutionally defined authority over the federal judiciary (h. rpt. 108-691; cq september 18th 2004; article iii, sections i and ii of the constitution).  the major backers of hr 2389 are republicans, although the pledge protection act and related bills solicit bipartisan support.  the pledge protection act of 2005 has a complex history containing many related bills, resolutions, amendments, and constitutional amendments.  while some have been passed, the activity varies across both chambers.  in order to gain a clear understanding of who supports the legislation, it is necessary to look at the historical impetus and also assess the related congressional actions.  the first amendment to the constitution, which states “congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…”, was ratified on december 15th 1791 (see findlaw.com accessed on 4/6/2006 from http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendments.html).  the phrase “under god” was not added to the pledge of allegiance by congress until june 15th 1954 and was signed into public law by president dwight eisenhower (see americanatheists.org website accessed on 4/23/2006 from http://www.atheists.org/flash.line/pledge8.htm; also see h. rpt. 108-691).  hr 2389 stems back to the 2002 court case, newdow v. u.s. congress (herein referred to as newdow i).  the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals held in newdow i that the phrase “under god” was an endorsement of monotheism in violation of the first amendment establishment clause incorporated to the states via the 14th amendment (newdow v. u.s. congress at findlaw.com accessed 4/6/2006 from http://files.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/wp/docs/conlaw/newdowus62602opn.pdf).  in reaction to the court’s decision siding in favor of an atheist religious minority, the 107th congress introduced and passed resolutions (h res 459 passed 416-3; s res 292 passed 99-0) in both chambers stating the position that the case was erroneously decided and reaffirming the “under god” reference in the pledge of allegiance.  house committee on the judiciary chairman, james sensenbrenner jr. (r – wi), sponsored the resolution in the house.  senate democratic leader tom daschle (d – sd) sponsored the resolution in the senate.  the passing of a congressional resolution technically has no impact on public policy, although it can pave the way for future legislation.  cq weekly notes that passing a resolution is an easy means to inoculating oneself from constituents (cq weekly volume 60 no. 26).  therefore, it is likely that the bipartisan support shown for these resolutions was purely political in nature. subsequently, the pledge protection act (hr 2028) was born in 2003.  it was introduced in the house on may 8th, 2003 and sponsored by todd akin (r-mo).  however, the legislation did not mirror the bi-partisan support that the 2002 resolutions enjoyed.  hr 2028 remained in the house committee on the judiciary for a total of 15 months.  the bill eventually came to a full floor vote in the house on september 23, 2004 and passed by 247-143, of which 34 democrats joined the majority and 6 republicans dissented.  hr 2028 was received in the senate, and no action was taken.  hr 2028 is the most robust piece of legislation in the series of pledge-related bills to date (in terms of actual deliberation).  the house committee on the judiciary produced a report that is over 100 pages long, which will be discussed in part two of this paper when looking at the legal arguments supporting and opposing the legislation.    in the senate, orrin hatch (r-ut) introduced a twin bill (s 1297) on june 19th, 2003 with the same title.  it never left the senate judiciary committee (all bill history, http://thomas.loc.gov).  this led to the creation of the pledge protection act of 2005.  in the house, hr 2389 was introduced by todd akin (r-mo), again.  in the senate, the same bill (s1046) was introduced by jon kyl (r-az).  both pieces of legislation remain in committee to date.  in addition to the pledge protection act, 2005 was a busy year for congressional activity concerning the pledge of allegiance, the national motto, the ten commandments, religious freedom, school prayer, and court jurisdiction over these issues.  constitutional amendments, amendments to the federal judiciary code, general legislation and also resolutions were brought forward in both chambers.  interestingly, these were all republican sponsored, except for a constitutional amendment proposed in the senate by mary landrieu (d-la) (all bill histories, http://thomas.loc.gov).  democratic senator landrieu’s proposed constitutional amendment (s.j. res. 24), “declares that a reference to god in the pledge of allegiance or on u.s. currency shall not be construed as affecting the establishment of religion under the first article of amendment of the constitution.”  senator landrieu first introduced this amendment during the 108th congress (s.j. res. 7) on march 3rd, 2003.  this is an interesting move for a democrat to make in the senate, because she proposed an amendment to the constitution, not just a simple piece of legislation to restrict court jurisdiction, or a resolution to express the sentiment of congressional disapproval.  searches failed to recover any mention of s.j. res. 24 or s.j. res. 7 on ms. landrieu’s official website (http://landrieu.senate.gov/), and she is not up for reelection until 2008.  the constitutional amendment ms. landrieu proposed could potentially be interpreted as a strategic means for maneuvering around the court-stripping legislation that most democrats oppose.  through the constitutional amendment, the majority supported “under god” sentiment can be fully expressed while the court-stripping language contained in the pledge protection act would be avoided.  the outcome would constitutionally deny the courts and religious minorities, such as atheists, the ability to challenge the monotheistic “under god” profession.  it would also serve to prevent the establishment of a legislative precedent that could potentially lead to a series of court-stripping legislation that would likely follow hr 2389.  although, senator landrieu’s testimony before the u.s. senate judiciary subcommittee on the constitution, civil rights and property rights, in which she expresses her position on the issue, makes this assumption unlikely (see the subcommittee website accessed on 4/23/2006 from http://judiciary.senate.gov/member_statement.cfm?id=1218&wit_id=3561).  ms. landrieu also represents louisiana, which is a southern state that has a traditionalistic political culture (see nelson, pgs. 2-6 for discussion on the south).  even though the introduction of the proposed constitutional amendment is a break from the democratic party’s position on the issue, it is likely that she is being consistent with the wishes of her constituency.  other democrats in congress (daschle proposed s. res. 292 and steve israel proposed h. res. 466) proposed resolutions to express support for the pledge and disagreement with the newdow 1 court decision, rather than legislation.     president george w. bush is widely known for proudly endorsing a faith-based platform, so it is logical that his position would be in favor of the pledge protection act.   the gop website features the president’s remarks delivered on the national day of prayer, in which he notes the history of a reliance on god in the united states and that: “…we pray to acknowledge our dependence on the almighty. …and so we pray as americans have always prayed: with confidence in god's purpose, with hope for the future, and with the humility to ask god's help to do what is right.  (accessed 4/21/2006 from http://www.gop.com/news/read.aspx?id=5429).” additionally, the president and the gop have been known to rail against the courts and what they perceive to be judicial activism (nelson, pgs. 13-14).  conservative interest group eagle forum quotes the president on its website:"we will not stand for judges who undermine democracy by legislating from the bench and try to remake america by court order (accessed 4/21/2006 from http://www.eagleforum.org/psr/2004/oct04/psroct04.html).”legal reform is a main platform of the gop, which offers a section on the topic under its “issues” portion of the national website (accessed on 4/21/2006 from http://www.gop.com/issues/legalreform/).the interest groups lining up in support of the legislation are socially conservative and/or members of the religious right.  the campaign for working families refers to the “liberal judicial activists in san francisco” that found the pledge to be unconstitutional.  in their position statement, they claim:“polling indicates that 90% of the american people want the words "under god" to remain the pledge, yet arrogant, unelected federal judges think they know better! (see campaign for working families website accessed on 4/0/2006 from http://capwiz.com/cwf/index_frame.dbq?url=http://capwiz.com/cwf/issues/bills/?bill=8022091).the campaign for working families website also has a list of all the democratic non-cosponsors of the pledge protection act (for all states), and a form letter to “defend the pledge” that constituents can fill out to send to their representative regarding hr2389.   eagle forum is another interest group actively supporting the legislation.  the founder and president of eagle forum is a conservative woman named phyllis schlafly, who is known for her notoriously anti-feminist rhetoric, and her proud efforts that led to the legislative defeat of the “radical feminist” equal rights amendment (ms. schlafly’s bio can be found at eagle forum http://www.eagleforum.org/misc/bio.html accessed on 4/6/2006).  ms. schlafly has also testified before the house subcommittee on the constitution in a hearing on "limiting federal court jurisdiction to protect marriage for the states" on june 24, 2004, which focused on congress's constitutional authority to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts (see h. rpt. 108-691).  the eagle forum website lists position statements for all the legislation they are in support of (including h.r. 997, english language unity act of 2005; s. 8 / h.r. 748, child interstate abortion notification act; h.r. 1357 / s. 658, human cloning prohibition act of 2005; h.r. 1100, marriage protection act of 2005; h.r. 4313 true enforcement and border security act of 2005; s. 2117 engaging the nation to fight for our right to control entry (enforce) act), in addition to hr2389.  eagle forum also “strongly opposes” s. 1197, to reauthorize the violence against women act (vawa).  their advertised position in favor of hr2389 publicly states: “due to the outrageous june 2002 ruling by the ninth circuit court of appeals regarding the reference to god in the pledge of allegiance, congress voted to reaffirm the phrase "one nation, under god." rep. todd akin (r-mo) wants to move a step further by removing the jurisdiction of the federal courts (including the u.s. supreme court) from cases involving the pledge of allegiance. therefore, only state courts whose judges are elected (or retained in office) by the voters would hear pledge cases. this bill is a practical legislative tool to check the power of the courts. the bill awaits action in the house judiciary committee's subcommittee on the constitution (accessed from eagle forum on 4/6/2006 from http://www.eagleforum.org/alert/bills/bills-to-watch.shtml).” when tracking the interest group connection to the legislation in terms of their financial influence on politicians, opensecrets.org reveals a money trail in the expected direction.  eagle forum supports most of the republicans who are pushing for the pledge protection act.  although their contributions are not extremely large, there are many across the board which further demonstrates their commitment to the socially conservative agenda.  the information in the chart below was abstracted from opensecrets.org on 4/6/2006.  the names in bold red text represent the politicians who are co-sponsors of hr2389.  the most notable observation is that eagle forum strictly gives only to members of the republican party.  additionally, orrin hatch is a republican senator who is co-sponsoring the reauthorization of the violence against women act.  the legislation, which eagle forum “strongly opposes,” covers many aspects of violence against women, including authorizing increased appropriations for grants to combat violent crimes against women (stop grants), expansion of the grants to include use for

judiciary report (h. rpt. 108-691) listed the most prominent interest groups in opposition to the legislation.  the list was promulgated as part of the dissenting opinion argument dated 9/15/2004.  again, it is important to note that the report was in regards to hr2028, the precursor to hr2389.  interestingly, some of the groups in opposition to the pledge protection act are religiously oriented organizations.  this observation implies that the republican party might not necessarily have a monopoly in the god-politics arena.   interest groups in opposition to hr2028leadership conference on

leaguebaptist joint committeenational council of jewish womenunion for reform judaismu.s. actionhuman rights watchthe unitarian universalist associationthe anti-defamation leaguethe interfaith alliancethe constitution projectin summary, the movement surrounding the “under god” reference, the pledge, and related religious issues are largely backed by congressional republicans, although there are a number of supporting democrats and a small number of dissenting republicans.  the break in party lines surrounding this issue, such as the provided example of supporting democrat ms. landrieu, helps to illustrate depth and political complexity.  the issues are definitely newsworthy today, as god-politics are emerging to the forefront in america.  common criticisms of the democratic party, generally coming from the religious right, are that they turn their backs on god and religion, and that they have become the “…immoral party in our nation” because they support abortion, gay rights, and separation of church and state (accessed on 4/21/2006 from http://www.republicans.org/; also see the private website http://law.brotherofyeshua.com/democrat.htm for an example of right extremism accessed on 4/21/2006 that states “satan works through the democratic party to turn the children away from god -- and bring them into servitude to the demonic forces of darkness.”).  democrats have been losing traditionally democratic-leaning votes because of the republican’s streamlined faith-based campaign, which is successfully capturing the religious vote across america.  in response, there have been recent calls for democrats to begin reclaiming part of the god-politics and morality debate (beliefnet.com story accessed 4/21/2006 from http://www.beliefnet.com/story/149/story_14990_1.html; common dreams.org story accessed 4/21/2006 from http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1104-01.htm; tikkun.org article accessed on 4/21/2006 from http://www.tikkun.org/magazine/050111a.html; alternet.org article accessed on 4/21/2006 from http://www.alternet.org/story/32037).  it is likely that the discussion of religion will shape the next decade of american politics.  power struggles between the court and the legislature do not appear to be waning and have no promising resolution on the horizon.  as long as the republicans remain in the majority, it is not probable that they will relent in their crusade to strip the courts of their ability to make decisions that they perceive as being inconsistent with the majority (i.e. republican) mainstream opinion in america.

the pledge protection act of 2005 (hr 2389) part 2 

 


06:35pm 29/04/2006


 



mood:  anxious

  part ii: the story of the billshr 2389 (the pledge protection act of 2005) is extremely complex and there are numerous related bills, resolutions, and amendments that have been introduced in both chambers over time.  section two of this paper attempts to present the history of these issues in chronological order across both chambers of congress.  as noted in the preceding section, hr 2389 can be directly linked to the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals decision in newdow i.  newdow, an atheist father who’s daughter attended a public elementary school in the elk grove unified school district in california claimed that his daughter was injured when she was compelled to "watch and listen as her state-employed teacher in her state-run school leads her classmates in a ritual proclaiming that there is a god, and that our's [sic] is 'one nation under god” (accessed 4/21/06 from www.lexnotes.com/legalnews/pledge_newdow_9thcir.shtml).” newdow i was later overturned on procedural grounds, in which the supreme court ruled that newdow lacked “prudential standing to bring this suit in federal court (accessed 4/21/06 from www.lexnotes.com/legalnews/pledge_newdow_9thcir.shtml).”  in essence, the child’s mother filed a motion to intervene because even though the two parents shared “physical custody” of the child, she had been granted “exclusive legal custody” by the state “including the sole right to represent [the daughter’s] legal interests and make all decision[s] about her education” and welfare.”  the mother further claimed that her daughter was christian and believed in god and that she had no objection to reciting or hearing the pledge (accessed 4/21/06 from www.lexnotes.com/legalnews/pledge_newdow_9thcir.shtml).  the reversal of newdow i on procedural grounds, rather than on the constitutionality of the “under god” phrase, ignited a series of protective measures in congress designed to restrict the court’s ability to hear cases related to the pledge and to insulate various references to “god” from future legal challenges.  the 107th congresschamber	number	title	sponsor	introducedhouse	hrs 459	expressing the sense of the house of representatives that newdow v. u.s. congress was erroneously decided, and for other purposes.	james f. sensenbrenner, jr.

(text of measure as introduced: cr s10047)**all bill history accessed from thomas on 4/21/2006 - http://thomas.loc.govas previously noted, hr2028 is the most robust of all pledge-related activity in congress.  the house report from the judiciary committee (h. rpt. 108-691), in which the bill was held up for a total of 15 months, provides a detailed history of the deliberation process on both sides of the issue.  the remaining portion of part two of this paper consists of a summary of the arguments made, both for and against, the legislation as described in h. rpt. 108-691.   the proponents of hr2028 note that there is an impending danger of a future challenge to the pledge because newdow i was overturned on procedural grounds.  they claimed that this allowed the supreme court to avoid having to address the question of the “under god” phrase’s constitutionality.  hr2028 was motivated by the end desire to insulate the pledge from future legal challenges.  restricting the court’s jurisdiction and denying the court the ability to hear a class of cases related to pledge challenges was the means by which proponents believed they could achieve the end goal.  the legal basis of the proponents’ argument is that the lower federal courts are entirely creatures of congress, because congress was vested with the constitutional power to establish them as deemed necessary.  they cite article iii, sections i, clause i of the constitution, which provides that "the judicial power of the united states, shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish."  in terms of the supreme court, they point to the original jurisdiction ascribed by the constitution to the supreme court in article iii, section ii, clause ii that the supreme court has “…in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction. in all the other cases . . . the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the congress shall make."  in other words, the original jurisdiction ascribed to the supreme court is not within the authority of congress to regulate.  however, its appellate jurisdiction does fall under congressional authority.  the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals acts out of appellate jurisdiction, which therefore constitutionally places the newdow i case under the ultimate authority of congress.   the argument in favor of the pledge protection act further states legal precedent (as they interpret it) that establishes that the supreme court does not have a constitutional endowment of exclusive legal jurisdiction (meaning that they are not the supreme legal authority of the land on every aspect of the law).  the cases cited are:•	california v. arizona (1979)•	illinois v. city of milwaukee (1972)•	ohio ex rel popovici v. agler (1930) they continue by citing hamilton’s commentary in federalist papers numbers 80 and 81.  they point to the judiciary act of 1789, which was legislation in which congress established some lower courts and hence, it also asserted the subordinated position of those courts relative to congress as the body who granted their authority.   the argument continues with the citation of similar court-stripping legislative acts.  the advocates, in an attempt to demonstrate bi-partisan support for court-stripping legislation (and also, to likely point out what they view as being hypocrisy amongst the democratic party), call public law number 107-206 into the debate.  public law 107-206 was sponsored by senate minority leader tom daschle.  the law denies the federal courts jurisdiction over the procedures governing timber projects “…in order to expedite forest clearing and save forests from destruction.”  the proponents scathingly argue: “if congress can deny all federal courts the authority to hear a class of cases to protect trees, certainly it should do so to protect a state's policy regarding the pledge of allegiance.”they point to additional court-stripping legislation to underscore the proliferation of such acts by congress: •	terrorism rick insurance act (p.l. no. 107-297) – precludes judicial review of certifications by the secretary of the treasury that terrorist events have occurred•	small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act (p.l. no. 107-118) – precludes judicial review of hazardous waste cleanup programs•	amendment s.u. 70 to s. 450 during the 96th congress - denies lower courts and the supreme court jurisdiction to hear cases regarding state laws relating to voluntary prayers in public schools and public buildings)•	the marriage protection act (hr 3313) – prevents courts from striking down the provision of the defense of marriage act (doma) that provides that no state shall be required to accept same-sex marriage licenses granted in other statesthe champions of the pledge protection act also outline a slew of case law precedents, which they interpret as being court decisions that are consistent with their agenda to restrict jurisdiction:•	wiscart v. d’auchy•	turner  v. bank of north america•	cary v. curtis•	barry v. mercein•	sheldon v. sill•	major v. cooper•	united states v. klein•	stevenson v. fain•	kline v. burke construction co.•	lauf v. e.g. shinner and company•	lockerty v. phillipsthe proponents of hr2028 also provide historical and contemporary arguments for their legislative push.  the historical argument consists of a sweeping account of the acknowledgement of god and religion in america since christopher columbus set sail across the atlantic ocean:•	christopher columbus set sail “…by the grace of god” with the “hope that by god’s assistance…”•	virginia’s first charter granted by king james i states “…by the providence of almighty god…”•	the mayflower compact said “having undertaken, for the glory of god, and advancement of the christian faith…”•	the massachusetts 1629 charter read “…true god and savior of mankind, and the christian faith…”•	the charter of privileges granted by william penn to pennsylvania in 1701 claimed “…and almighty god being the only lord of conscience…”    •	the fundamental orders of connecticut called for “…decent government established according to god.”•	alexander hamilton wrote about “…the law dictated by god himself.”•	the declaration of independence has numerous god references:o	“nature’s god”o	“endowed by their creator”o	 “appealing to the supreme judge of the world”o	“a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence”the contemporary portion of their argument is structured on the current inclusions of god references in federal offices and national monuments:•	national motto “in god we trust”•	“so help me god” when people are swearing in (under oath)•	arlington national cemetery is federal property with thousands of god references on the headstones•	the national holidays (“holy days”) are religiouso	christmaso	thanksgivingo	st. valentine’s dayo	st. patrick’s day•	city names are religiouso	st. petersburgo	los angeleso	san franciscoo	st. paulo	santa fe•	art galleries and museums receive government subsidies and their collections contain religious works  •	churches and clergy receive a tax-exempt status•	many state constitutions recognize god•	many examples of presidents, justices, and leaders referencing godthe dissenting opinion is substantially shorter.  however, it presents a series of like arguments (their interpretation of previous legislation, case law, and their reasons for opposing the bill) and “findings” to counter the supporters of hr2028.  the main theme of their argument is that hr2028 has no legal precedent, and they assert:“the majority attempts in vain to find precedent for court-stripping bills, but none has ever been enacted into law.  they point to several laws they’re touting as precedent and misstate them, they constitute only partial restrictions on federal judicial review, or do not even involve issues of constitutional review.”  they also go on the record arguing the following major points:•	eliminating the possibility of operating under a uniform federal code divides the nation into 50 different legal regimes and is the anti-thesis of the pledge’s principles of unity•	the pledge protection act and the marriage protection act are efforts by the majority to use social wedge issues to divide the nation for political gain, which is why they are bringing the issue up at election time when they know it has no chance of passing in the senate•	the legislation precludes people in d.c. and the territories from bringing suit regarding the pledge because they are not states and have no state courts•	it is unconstitutional•	it is unnecessary because the case has been overturned•	it intrudes on the separation of powers and provokes inter-branch confrontation thus places undue tensions on the separation of powers and the framework of government•	it is contradictory legislation because the majority seeks to undermine federal judicial power with respect to constitutional law, but in other contexts (such as state class action claims, state drug laws, and state abortion rights) the majority seeks to expand federal judicial power at the expense of state court authority.they also discuss marbury v. madison as a precedent for the separation of powers, noting that justice marshall declared unconstitutional the provision of the judiciary act of 1789 that the proponents of the pledge protection act are citing as precedent for their legislation (also see aberback and peterson, p. 455).  the dissenting opinion notes that in marbury, the court enunciated the principal of federal judicial review of all federal laws.  they refer to this decision, which led to 200+ years of judicial review, serving as the touchstone of our constitutional system and democracy.  they also marshal additional legal precedents that prevented congressional interference in judicial review:•	united states v. klein – the only case in which the supreme court directly addressed the question of whether congress can impose a legislative restriction on court power if framed in jurisdictional terms, and the court made it clear that the language of the challenged law plainly showed that it did not intend to withhold appellate jurisdiction except as a means to an end.o	therefore, the dissenting voices state this case as proof that the majority is passing the limit that separates the legislative from the judicial power.•	city of boerne v. flores – ruled it unconstitutional for congress to legislate its view of the free exercise clause of the first amendment.•	dickerson v. united states – struck down an executive branch attempt to withdraw certain habeas corpus cases from federal court jurisdiction.the pledge protection act of 2005 has a hidden history of partisan struggles that surfaced in the house judiciary committee report (h. rpt. 108-691).  both sides of the debate were clearly outlined and detailed in the report, some of which was summarized and presented in the above section.  additionally, the record of actual verbal debate between committee members contains heated criticisms in which members bluntly confront one another while declaring their positions on the issue.  the report provides insight into the process of deliberation and reveals the complex history behind the pledge protection act that would other wise go unnoticed when looking only at the surface.  by drilling down into the depths of the report, a true impression of the legislative process is uncovered.  the legislation no longer seems lifeless, but rather becomes animated and full of energy, telling a story that is unique to the legislation and is representative of the politics and individuals of its time.  part iii: analyzing assigned course readingsthe first portion of the course defined the underlying values encapsulated in american politics by the constitution.  part three of this paper discusses hr2389 in the context of the structure of american government and how it facilitates peaceful conflict resolution through process.  the pledge protection act manifests examples of conflict in terms of competing majority and minority rights, the divisions of federalism, and also inter-branch competition for authority.  democracy is a two-fold theme running through hr2389, as the republican majority attempts to assert the will of the people over the judiciary’s defense of a minority group, and politically appointed federal justices are deciding the pledge’s constitutionality as opposed to elected state court judges.  the members of congress supporting hr2389 are attempting to play with the divisions in the federalist system by placing the authority of deciding in state courts, which could lead to the proliferation of state power and an ambiguous future for america.  additionally, the balance of power is being tested, as congress employs legislative tools to check the judiciary by restricting its jurisdiction and asserting congressional authority. the house report on hr2028 (h. rpt. 108-691) provided a clear example of how the committee system serves congressional function by gathering information and shaping legislation (quirk and binder, p. 207).  h. rpt. 108-691 illustrated the intense partisan conflict over hr2028 (a political wedge issue), and members of congress were taking their opportunity to publicly state their positions on the record (quirk and binder, p. 207-211).  the sheer amount of pledge-related legislative activity provided an example consistent with sinclair’s description of majority party agenda setting and p.r. politics for the purpose of promoting the party’s image with the public (quirk and binder, p. 236).  in the same thread, sinclair’s p.r. politics were at play, as the social conservatives framed the debate in their favor by associating themselves with popular opinion and depicting the dissenting voices in a negative and absurd manner (quirk and binder, p. 248).  in terms of democracy, the minority party has essentially been stampeded in the house as the legislation has passed in each congress, but in the senate the legislation consistently dies because its stark partisan lines fosters stalemate in the higher chamber where a majority is not a mandate for passing (quirk and binder, pgs. 246-276).   unity between the executive branch and congress has enabled the majority party to develop a strong hold on their power because they dominate public discourse across the board.  the message coming out of the white house is streamlined with the actions of republicans in congress, in terms of the socially conservative legislation this paper is concerned with.  as the nelson book points out, bush has been a builder, leader, and unifier of his party (nelson, p. 2).  he engaged in the 2002 mid-term election on behalf of his party, and in return the republican members of congress are in support of his socially conservative policy initiatives (nelson, p. 12; aberbach and peterson, p. 194-205).  bush campaigned on the themes of tort reform, stamping out judicial activism, and appealed to a religious partisan base (nelson, p. 14; aberbach and peterson, p. 194, 205-207).  hr2389 represents a culmination of the strength and unity of the republican party, its domination of both the executive and legislative branches, and the adoption of a highly politicized social wedge issue to construct the public appearance of delivering on the party’s promises of checking the judiciary and preserving conservative values.  if hr2389 were to pass the senate, bush would certainly sign the bill into law, which would give the appearance of true democracy in action as the majority rules.  however, democracy is not necessarily determined by which party has a majority in the two political branches of government.  nor is democracy necessarily undermined by the minority party in the senate when a piece of legislation fails to pass.  the two-party and federalist systems combine to obscure the “majority” in american politics (hall and mcguire, p. 121-124; fiorina, 99-104).  since the republicans currently hold the majority position in government, they claim to represent the majority interests.  although, nelson notes that bush was elected by a narrow victory to his second term (only beating kerry within 5% of a tie in 20 states), and his election in 2000 is still a point of contention (nelson, p. 45).  the federal hierarchy of constitutional interpretation reinforces the superior position of the national majority in american politics (hall and mcguire, p. 121-124), but the socially conservative federal legislation coming out of congress is not necessarily consistent with the majority at the state-level of government (especially in the northeast and on the west coast) which is closer to the people.  democracy on a national scale, in terms of a majority, could be construed as being undermined when legislation dies in the senate.  however, in terms of state-based representation and also representation of the minority party (which is not as small as the term “minority” implies), democracy is in action when a bill dies in the senate.  the senate provides a safety net by filtering out highly controversial legislative acts that undermine minority interests.  in the newdow 1 decision, the court decided in favor of protecting an unpopular minority’s (atheists) rights over the majority (religious) sentiment.  conceptually, the struggle wrapped up in hr2389 is exactly what the founders feared would play out; national majority tyranny over a very narrow minority.  even though their fears were economically-driven and dealt with completely different issues, they constructed a system that includes provisions for the facilitation of conflict resolution between groups, large and small, and the protection of narrow minority interests.  though the process of judicial review, the court held that the majority (u.s. congress by via the congressional act of adding the words “under god” to the pledge) was unconstitutionally violating minority rights.  judicial review in the newdow 1 case is anti-democratic because it produced a highly politicized counter-majoritarian decision upholding an atheist’s minority rights (hall and mcguire, p. 120-121).  even though the case was later overturned, the struggle between democracy and individual liberties continues to play out because hr2389 is a product of the national majority’s attempt to further assert its authority and dominance.  the various congressional tools for checking the courts are contained in the mass of pledge-related legislative activity.  hr2389 is a congressional attempt to check the judiciary’s power by restricting its jurisdiction and denying the court the authority to interpret the constitutional legality of the profession “under god” (hall and mcguire, p. 110; 132-136).  there were also attempts by the legislature to override the court decision.  the court realized the political timing of the decision was incorrect and therefore defaulted to using judicial restraint to avoid the controversy by overturning the case on procedural grounds.  the court’s power to overturn a decision based on its rules of access is a tool for avoiding inter-branch conflict over a highly partisan wedge issue against an unsympathetic majority controlling party.  it is also an example of the court using deference as a means to tabling the issue of the pledge’s constitutionality until a later date when the political climate in the country is more feasible for looking at the question (hall and mcguire, p. 94-95).  the supreme court overturned the appellate court decision.  if the legislation to strip the appellate court’s jurisdiction over pledge issues were to pass, the court would likely defer to congressional authority because it allows the high court to avoid touching having to touch the issue.  hr2389 would place the question of the pledge’s constitutionality in the jurisdiction of state courts.  state court judges are elected in most states, and unlike the federally appointed court justices, they do not enjoy the amenity of life tenure.  when considering the issue of democracy, it seems much more democratic for the state courts to have this power.  the judges are democratically elected by the people and can therefore be held accountable.  they are not an unelected group of elite justices who are legislating public policy from the bench (hall and mcguire, p. 120-121).  at one level, this is a more democratic means for handing social wedge issues.  the states are closer to the citizens, are more reflective of their values, and the judges are elected.  california can have a secular version of the pledge and kentucky can have a version that recognizes the christian deity.  however, individual liberties are in danger of being denied if minority groups are deprived of representation by politically responsive state court judges deciding cases in ways that are conducive to their reelection.  the insular nature of the federal court system allows judges to make counter-majoritarian decisions.  additionally, state court judicial review of federal law is always subordinated to federal judicial review (hall and mcguire, p. 121-124).  so, while placing the issue in the state court system might be a temporary fix for dealing with a highly political issue, it is only a nominal solution because the pledge challenge deals with a national law that is subject to federal review. the judiciary committee report on hr2028 chronicles the process of deliberation between members.  the dialogue exhibits their underlying concerns regarding the substantive social issues and political consequences of the legislation (quirk and binder, p. 316-317).  for example, the republican advocates of the legislation make a case for the legislation in terms of upholding the “under god” phrase as a permanent addition to the pledge.  they frame the argument in a purely religious and political manner.  they point to the historical uses of the word god, or references to god.  the cite examples of the current nationally accepted uses of the references.  they shore up examples that would be absurd to challenge, such as national holidays, the national monuments, arlington national cemetery, and even city names that have religious affiliations.  to drive their point home, they even point to art galleries that receive public subsidies which have religious works of art in their collections.  the social conservatives are identifying art galleries as having direct association with, or being threatened by, the repercussions of a constitutional challenge to the pledge.  this strategy is a direct appeal for democratic support, and is also a threat that it could be used as grounds to challenge or revoke funding for culturally liberal arts-supporting initiatives later down the road.  democrats must heed those warnings, as it is a part of estimating the consequences of policy and comparing the options (quirk and binder, p. 316-317).  as well, the republicans assert the ethical and emotional consequences of removing “under god” from the pledge.  they highlight the need for recognizing the importance religion has played in the establishment of america.  they spend little time addressing the issue of restraining the courts and preventing judges from setting social policy, even though that is the main underlying theme of their legislative agenda.  they focus on building the argument from the religious perspective to appeal to the majority public sentiment in support of the pledge, and to please their partisan base.the discourse related to the pledge protection act shows members of congress who support the legislation advocating their cause.  the dissenting voices have the ability to criticize the bill (quirk and binder, p. 317-320).  the interest groups who are affected are defending their interests.  siding with the advocates of the pledge protection act, interest group support was traced to socially conservative organizations such as eagle forum and the campaign for working families.  those groups siding with the dissenting members of congress (such as the aclu, people for the american way, and national council of jewish women) are defending their interests.  however, the dissenting voices frame the debate in a different way.  they do not point to the suppression of religious sentiment.  rather, they frame the debate in terms of the devastating impact that court-stripping legislation could have on america, and how the rights of minority groups could be trampled if the legislation shuts the courthouse doors on certain groups.  the house report shows a deliberation failure, because the partisans debating the issue are not recognizing the other side’s concerns.  the outcome is a socially conservative push for a piece of legislation that will die in the senate, but will appease house member constituents (quirk and binder, p. 317-320).  the members and the interest groups paint their conflict as an irreconcilable disagreement, and focus their attention on the negative outcomes (quirk and binder, p. 317-320).  the interest group involvement is a constant reminder of the political consequences of the members’ decisions and positions, as they contribute to the campaigns of members, but more importantly, they launch massive campaigns to compel the constituency to place pressure on their representatives (quirk and binder, p. 322-330).the pledge protection act serves as a great example in which to observe and analyze the structure and process of american politics.  the bill stimulates a great degree of conflict because it is a heated social wedge issue.  it also illustrates how the system is used to exploit issues that the public likely has a strong feeling about, in order to generate political support for the party.  hr2389 and most of the bills in this class will never pass the senate because of the potential substantive impact the court-stripping legislation could lead to.  however, republicans in both chambers and also in the executive branch can use the issue to draw public attention to their positions, while at the same time using the opportunity to deflect public attention away from other issues that could potentially undermine their power.  the bill also highlights the balance of power between the court and the legislature.  the court manages to check itself through deference to congress and by using restraint to avoid political controversy.  congress can mobilize to assert to the judiciary that they are elected representatives who determine social policy, and if the court is challenging their position, they can use a variety of tools and techniques to put them in their proper place.  hr2389 touches on issues of democracy at many levels. in addition, the conflict surrounding religious social issues is thick.  the pledge protection act provides a complex picture of how the system and its processes facilitate solutions, or at the very least, discussion of the issues driving american politics.     additional resources gop backs bill to protect pledge from judges.

  policy analysishallie jonesapril 26th 2006political science 629-75 – seminar in american politicspart i: introduction to the issue and its politicssummarize the importance of the topic.	on the surface, the pledge protection act of 2005 (hr 2389) is a highly politicized bill that directly confronts mainstream cultural wedge issues pertaining to church-state separation and religious freedoms.  however, when the facade cloaking hr 2389 is chipped away, a complicated and entangled web reveals itself as extending far beyond the constitutional legality of the “under god” phrase.  the pledge protection act is replete with the age-old competing tensions of democracy in the united states.  hr 2389 addresses the conflict inherent in reconciling majority and minority rights, provokes the cleavages of federalism, and most immediately challenges the balance of power between the legislative and judicial branches.  the bill is one of several recent attempts by social conservatives in congress to assert its constitutionally defined authority over the federal judiciary (h. rpt. 108-691; cq).  members of congress who proposed /support hr 2389, and why.  the major backers of hr 2389 are republicans, although previous versions did solicit overwhelming bipartisan support in the house.  the pledge protection act of 2005 historically stems back to the 2002 court case, newdow v. u.s. congress (herein referred to as newdow i).  the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals held that the phrase “under god” was an endorsement of monotheism in violation of the first amendment establishment clause incorporated to the states via the 14th amendment.  in response to the court’s decision siding in favor of an atheist religious minority, the 107th congress introduced and passed resolutions (h res 459; s res 292) in both chambers stating the position that the case was erroneously decided and reaffirming the “under god” reference in the pledge of allegiance.  house committee on the judiciary chairman, james sensenbrenner jr. (r – wi), sponsored the resolution in the house.  senate democratic leader tom daschle (d – sd) sponsored the resolution in the senate.   	the passing of a congressional resolution technically has no impact on public policy, although it can pave the way for future legislation.  it is likely that the bipartisan support shown for these resolutions was purely political in nature.  cq weekly noted that passing a resolution is an easy means to inoculating oneself from constituents (cq weekly volume 60 no. 26).  subsequently, the pledge protection act (hr 2028) was born in 2003 and sponsored by todd akin (r-mo).  hr 2028 was passed in the house in both 2003 and 2004, only to die in the senate each time.  this led to the creation of the pledge protection act of 2005.  in the senate, look up twin bills for these years and sponsors.	the pledge protection act likely received bipartisan support in the house because the legislation was expected to die in the closely divided senate.  this gave house democrats an opportunity to gain political points with their constituents.  democracy – majority opinion trampling the rights of minorities. also, democracy in terms of federally appointed and insulated court justices deciding cases as opposed to state courts whose judges are elected and accountable to the people.  balance of power – the congress is using a variety of legislative tools to control the judicial branch, including restricting jurisdiction over certain classes of cases. as well, they are using appropriations bills to restrict enforcement of unfavorable court decisions, monitoring sentencing, and calling justices in to testify and explain the reasons for their decisions.  judicial is pushing back, finding their legislation unconstitutional, refusing to provide information to congress, overturning cases on procedural grounds and not in terms of constitutionality.federalism – put the decisions to the state courts, and take it out of the federal courts’ jurisdictions. yet, has more impact because this could sway several issues in the unintended direction the social conservatives had in mind.

mood:  disappointed

  i just found out that my own mother called us (aron and me) "terroristic" because of our political views and the art we produce.  utter betrayal.  what can one possibly say about something like that? if the nazi's come knocking on the door to round me up, i guess she'd sell me up the creek so as not to "bash our president".  weak, narrow, shallow.-------------------american politics. 21 page paper on the framers, the constitution, and seperation of powers. whooooo hoooo. i got a 98%.i look at this and ask, "did i actually write this shit?" i don't believe a word of it!!!! the framers were some elitest bastards.american politicsspring, 2006midterm exam february 15th, 2006 part 1:  what were the goals of the constitution’s framers and how did the proposed structures and processes fit them?the clearest articulation of the framer’s goals is found in the preamble of the constitution; formation of a more perfect union, the establishment of justice, insurance of domestic tranquility, provision of common defense, promotion of general welfare, and securement of liberty for themselves and future generations.  the federalist papers are a seminal volume of political philosophy and provide an in-depth theoretical explanation of the principles upon which the constitution is predicated.  additionally, the rhetoric presented by the federalists (hamilton, madison, and jay) enables contemporary readers to depict the intricacies of the conflicting values and political tensions surrounding the time, of which the federalists were obligated to mediate if the agenda for a new constitution was to transpire into a new set of governing rules for the union.  focusing on the “defects” of the confederation, the federalists presented a scathing critique of the insufficiency, inherent of the articles, to insuring preservation of the union.  hamilton’s statement in paper no. 15, essentially stating that the union had reached “the last stage of national humiliation”, is the embodiment of their contemptuous sentiment toward the confederation.  with elegant political precision, the federalist papers confront the “defects” of the articles as a point of departure from which the central commensurate argument is developed, necessitating the urgent formation of “a more perfect union”.  in other words, the federalists’ brilliantly cloak their self-interests by framing the confederation’s deficiencies as opportunities for progress, and they offer the new constitution as the ultimate solution.   the framers’ goals, or solutions, are directly linked to the “defects” of the confederation.  for example, they sought the establishment of justice in response to what they viewed as a disparate system of locally-based, democratic, popular lawmaking by communities.  this system of law was vague and inconsistent, and posed numerous problems.  the citizenry had no central reference documenting legal codes, and the framers’ feared that popular whims would encroach on individual liberties at the expense of minority groups (i.e. property owners, such as debtors) (hall, mcguire, nelson, pgs. 5-8).  in the pursuit of establishing justice, and, as outlined in no. 22, the “want of judiciary power” was a “defect” of the confederation.  they created a supreme court to serve as the ultimate legal authority of the land, the “last resort a uniform role of civil justice” (federalist paper no. 22).  the framers sought to insure “domestic tranquility”, provide for the “general welfare”, and secure “liberty” for themselves and future generations.  they held these goals contingent upon the creation of an enduring system that could effectively mediate competing interests by breaking and controlling the violence of faction, which they posited as adverse to liberty (federalist paper no. 10).  the federalists vehemently proselytized against popular democracies, pointing to the “men who have overturned the liberties of republics” as demagogues appealing to the masses and evolving into “tyrants” (federalist paper no. 1).   they believed majoritarian politics consistently spiraled into the eventual demise of democratic societies.  in no. 10, madison defines the concept of faction and then theorizes two methods for its cure; abolishing its roots or controlling its effects.  poetically detailing the absurdness of abolishing the causes, madison identifies “mutual animosities” as the nature of man, which therefore necessitates a system that anticipates faction and controls its effects. he illustrates that the “most common” source of faction is “the unequal distribution of property” that divides society into different classes with competing interests.  madison held that “justice ought to hold the balance” between creditors and debtors (federalist paper no. 10). the federalists’ are consistent in their embrace of an anti-democratic philosophy, even though they conceded that the new government would find its fundamental legitimacy in the people’s popular acceptance.  responding to the question of legitimacy, they built concessions into the system to acknowledge the delicate balance.  an example is the protocol for constitutional conventions, as discussed in paper no. 49 that were reserved for “extraordinary occasions”.  this appears to be an apparatus for majority input on major questions.  however, their proclamation of recognizing the people as the “legitimate fountain of power” is questionable.  the federalists seemed to be placating the opposition’s fears and paying lip service to respecting the body politic, simply to realize their own elite agenda.  madison was clearly appealing to a like-minded audience in no. 54, when he glorified the ability of “an opulent citizen” (even though he would have only a single vote) to use his affluence as a vehicle for the promotion of special interests by guiding the vote choices of others.  additionally, anti-democratic principles guided the framers, and the new government was engineered as a republic in order to obstruct and prevent the domination of majoritarian passions. the federalists advocated for centralized, federal governmental authority.  in no. 15, hamilton calls for a means of enforcing the powers allotted to the national government, something of which the articles denies.  he outlines that under the articles, the federal government can request men and money but that there is no follow up means of enforcement, and that the states were poor at providing for the collective defense and also at regulating commerce.  another point he makes is that there is still foreign occupation of land in the us, specifically, spain was blocking the union’s access to the mississippi river.     in no. 21, hamilton speaks of the confederation’s “total want of sanction to its laws”.  he also criticizes the oppressive nature of applying a blanket tax quota to all member states because their productive capacities differ and all states are not created equally.  hamilton concludes that a common measure for taxation can not be uniformly applied.  in no. 22, hamilton continues with the topic of “defects”, leading into the “want of power to regulate commerce”, which “no object…more strongly demands a federal superintendent”.  the dual responsibility of states to contribute money and men to the union dangerously teeters on eminent state faction and competitive races.  if the national government is dealing with competition between states in relation to commerce, there could be a threat of faction leading to civil war under the pretenses of taxation, debt collection, and/or the unequal distribution of wealth.  if the government is dealing with state competition in relation to supplying men for the common defense, there is the serious threat of unchecked foreign aggression, due to the lack of soldiers and the inability of the union to legally enforce the extraction of men from the states.  no. 42 outlines what the new federal government will be able to do under it’s second-class powers; regulate commerce between the us and foreign nations, define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the laws of nations, and regulate foreign commerce (including the power to prohibit slave importation after 1808 and to tax at $10 per head to discourage the practice).  in relation to the power of punishment for offenses against nations, madison asserts that states under the confederation were essentially left to their own unilateral discretion and could instigate conflict with foreign nations that might entangle the entire union.  madison details underlying needs in relation to the regulation of commerce (federalist paper no. 42):•	between states and with indian tribes•	the value of currency (foreign and domestic)•	punishment for counterfeiting currency and securities•	establishing a standard for weights and measures•	establish the uniform rule of naturalization and laws of bankruptcy•	prescribe the manner for which public acts, records, and judicial proceedings were to be proved•	establish post offices and roadsthe federalists made clear their distaste for the institution and practice of slavery.  in no. 54, madison refers to slaves as being “debased by servitude”, which regarded slaves not as men, but as 2/5 of man.  recognizing slavery as one of the main cleavages between the north and the south, the federalists realized the immediate need for compromise on the issue.  article 1, section 2 of the constitution, the 3/5 clause, represents the middle ground, or compromise, reached between the north and the south.  paper no. 54 provides the accompanying commentary for the 3/5 clause, providing important insights into the rationale behind it.  since the slaves were conveniently viewed as property by the south, they were therefore allowed to treat them as slaves under that law.  however, when the dichotomous questions of ‘taxation based on property’ and ‘apportionment of representation based on population’ surfaced, the debate was that slaves deserved representation because they were allotted protections of their lives under the law.  the dual nature of this issue induced the creation of the 3/5 clause.  article 1, section 9 of the constitution also deals with slavery.  the wording in the constitution does not prohibit slavery.  rather, it prohibits the federal government from banning slave importation until 1808.  yet, federalist no. 42 rephrases this statement, not as prohibiting the federal government from banning the practice, but rather giving the federal government the power to prohibit and discourage slave importation after 1808.  this overt discrepancy in the framing of the issue highlights the political language used in each document.  the wording used in the constitution was less offensive to the south, which was conducive to the north gaining their essential buy-in on the new constitution.  however, the federalists made it clear that their intention was to ban the practice, and in no. 42, madison ironically challenges the south to follow a popular example of the states not engaging in the practice.  the proposed structures and processes of the constitution were designed with the end (goals) in mind; the protection of liberty was the main emphasis in the the papers.  the separation of powers (executive, legislative, and judicial), as outlined in no. 47, were intended to distribute and blend, to destroy symmetry and expose the parts to danger of encroachment by the others.  the framers knew there was the danger of tyranny and dictatorship if all power accumulated in one branch.  a helpful analogy to understanding the separation of powers is found in the phrase “two’s company, three’s a crowd”.  the system is designed to provoke conflict.  while the branches are separated by function, they are integrated via “constitutional means” or powers to check, control, and defend themselves against each other.  each branch depends on the others for various types of backup and support.  for example, the executive branch enforces legislative decisions and judicial findings; the legislative branch controls the purse for the executive and judiciary branches; the judiciary decides legislative and executive acts are constitutional, etc... no. 48 discusses the concept of parchment barriers as being ineffective protection against the encroaching nature of power, and this paper clearly spells out the fear of the legislative branch (absence of deliberation, fueled by faction and passions).  therefore, in no. 51, the solution presented is to embrace the desire for institutional power seeking.  each branch is empowered to pursue power, which comes at the expense of some other branch’s power.  this inter-governmental rivalry is what initiates a check and balance, and also results in the government governing itself.  their “mutual relations” keep them in their proper places.  the legislative branch was designed to intentionally faction the majority.  there are two separate chambers, the lower being the house of representatives directly elected by popular election, and the higher being the senate indirectly elected by state legislative bodies.  the equal representation of states in the senate was engineered to provide a check on state-to-state encroachment, or as explained in no. 62, to preserve state sovereignty, which would be in danger of usurpation if representational apportionment of the senate relied on a purely proportional scheme.  in no. 63, madison discusses the senate construction in relation to the house, and upholds the “temperate and respectable” senate “as a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions”.  yet, he concedes that if the senate were to gradually accumulate enough power to transform itself into an aristocratic body, then “…the house of representatives, with the people on their sides” would snap the senate back into its proper constitutional position.in a balancing response to the fractured, pluralistic structure of the legislative branch, the executive was designed to hold unified, centralized power in order to execute the task of effectively administering the public’s business.  in paper no. 70, hamilton praises the aspect of “energy” in the executive, to protect the country against foreign invasion, administer laws, protect property, and secure liberty from assaults of ambition, faction, and anarchy.  he rules out the possibility of a plural division of executive power (that would link it closer to the people), pointing to the legislative branch as the proper body for facilitating the deliberation of majoritarian politics, and the hierarchical executive as the body for execution.  however, even though the federalists succeeded in this area, the tensions between them and their opponents who feared a remote national government and preferred a locally oriented, supervised government, still linger today (aberbach and peterson, pgs. xxi-xxiii). the federalists viewed the judiciary as the least dangerous branch (hamilton in paper no. 78), specifically because the court retains no enforcement powers.  the judiciary is said to have “neither force nor will, but merely judgment”.  it depends on the legislature for its fiscal capacity, and on the executive for enforcement, and on both the executive and legislative for appointments.  the judges are appointed by the executive to insulate them from “the ill humors in society” and prevent unjust and impartial law making that could occur due to popular whims.  hamilton speaks of the judiciary as the mediator between the people and the legislature, and that it will prevent legislative tyranny by holding unconstitutional legislation that essentially violates individual liberties (even though there is no mention of this specific power in article 3 of the constitution). however, today this provision is used to afford rights to ethnic minority groups and other marginalized members of society, such as homosexuals.     part 2:  since the founding, how/where has american political and institutional development both conformed to, and deviated from, their vision?	there are many examples of american political and institutional development both conforming to and deviating from the framers’ visions, as explored in the first part of this paper.   the second part of this paper will explore substantial cases of change relating to each of the three branches of the federal government; brown v. the board of education (judiciary), jacksonian presidential authority (executive), and the rise of national political parties (legislative).  additionally, the issue of representation and how it fits into american political and institutional life is explored.  	brown v. the board of education marks “the turning point” in the court’s activist pursuit of personal rights, as it overturned the precedent of plessy, and ignited “a large-scale process of social reform” (hall, mcguire, sunstein, pgs. 48-50).  the era of the 20th century, as noted in class discussion, was marked by a federal assault on state sovereignty.  the 14th amendment incorporates states under federal jurisdiction concerning the civil rights of citizens of the united states, which was used in the case of brown.  as we saw in “eyes on the prize”, the battle became a contest for states rights versus federal authority.  in the end, we see the executive branch, under kennedy, stepping in to enforce and uphold the supreme court’s ruling by using military power (eyes on the prize, episode 2, “fighting back”).  protection of personal liberty, federal power over state authority, and the enforcement mechanism of the divided powers (the executive backing the judiciary) are examples of how political and institutional development has been consistent with the framer’s intentions.  on the other side of the equation, however, they intended for the executive, and especially the judiciary, to be insulated from the passions of the popular opinion.  the brown decision was pro-majoritarian in the sense that the majority of the country, except for the south, wanted integration.  however, it was counter-majoritarian (as the framers intended) in that it upheld personal liberties over majority (i.e. southern or white) popular passion and prohibited states from violating civil liberties (hall, mcguire, sunstein, pgs. 48-50).   additionally, brown deviated from the view the federalists held regarding the judiciary as incapable of legislation.  activist supreme court decisions are in fact legislation.  they are the final legal authority of the land.  extensive change and evolution can be seen in the executive branch when exploring the impact of jackson’s presidency.  tensions surrounding congress’s re-chartering of the bank of the united states lead jackson to use the veto power in 1832, marking the first occasion in history that a president had used his veto power based on personal discretion (aberbach, peterson, james, pgs. 10-11).  this power move asserted the president as the chief legislative authority, and meant that congress must consider presidential prerogatives.  jackson set a standard for the chief executive to no longer be constitutionally bound in a subordinate position to the legislative process (aberbach, peterson, james, pgs. 11-12).  jackson’s transformative veto was a deviation from the framer’s intentions regarding the separation of power, as the legislative function was not intended to be intermingled with the executive functions.  in paper no. 47, madison explains that the executive “can not of himself make a law”. the executive was vested the authority of the veto as an apparatus to check the feared legislative power.  jackson however, used it as a loophole to transform the president into america’s chief legislative officer.    next, jackson appealed directly to the electorate for support, in an attempt to legitimize his policy involvement (aberbach, peterson, james, p. 12).  direct appeal to popular public opinion was also a new precedent (aberbach, peterson, james, p. 12).  going one step further again setting executive precedent in yet another realm, jackson subordinated all cabinet officers directly under his authority (aberbach, peterson, james, p. 13).  this move found its constitutional basis under jackson’s obligation to faithfully execute the laws.  this allowed for unity and “universal compliance” in the executive branch, giving the president authority to remove cabinet officers not conforming to presidential administrative directives (aberbach, peterson, james, pgs. 13-14).   jackson’s presidency no doubt shaped the course for the development of presidential power.  consistent with the federalists blessings, the presidency carved out an enormous degree of executive authority, as the constitutional basis of this power (article ii) was left intentionally vague so as not to limit the executive’s pursuit (aberbach, peterson, james, p. 5).  the unity the federalists intended for this branch, as outlined by hamilton in no. 70, is indeed consistent with his expectations.  the bush presidency is replete of hamilton’s desires even today, in terms of the overall unity, presidential loyalty, and overwhelming reticence that characterizes the administration.  hamilton’s hostility toward “dissention in the executive department” which “…serve[s] to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which they relate” is dually shared by those at the top under the leadership of george w. (federalist paper, no. 70).  the executive has control over his cabinet and the administration acts in unison, even though congress attempts to inject some authority via budgetary provisions, hearings, etc….  hamilton did, however, warn against the danger of collusion between the branches (federalist paper, no. 70).  we have witnessed, especially in the case of fema and hurricane katrina, the “scandalous appointments to important offices” that have been made by the executive, with the approval of congress.  hamilton, in speaking against the plural executive, points to the importance of the body politic being able to clearly judge misbehaviors of the elected in order to remove them from office, and also points to the personal responsibility and accountability bestowed under the single executive structure (federalist paper, no. 70).  hamilton goes further to state that “multiplication of the executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty” (federalist paper, no. 70).  the current state of the presidency is a massive deviation from these principles. as the executive branch (bureaucracy) has expanded and multiplied since the founding, accountability has been obscured and blame has been shifted from person to person until it seems as if no one is really in charge (especially evident in the torture scandals).    the rise of national political parties was a substantial deviation from the framers’ intentions.  they engineered the legislative branch in a way that dispersed its powers and was intended to faction factions, as described by madison in paper no. 10.  the rise of parties, especially the democratic party in pursuit of jackson’s election, politically maneuvered around those obstacles set up by the constitution by suppressing local and regional issues and coordinating electoral efforts (quirk, binder, stewart, pgs. 3-13).  states were deprived of the constitutional mechanism to strip senators from power.  realizing their insubordinate positions, senators began directly appealing to their own political base.  parties coordinated slates of state legislative representatives that promised to follow through in the election of the preferred senatorial candidate, which resulted in the eventual transition from indirect elections to direct popular election of the senate (quirk, binder, stewart, pgs. 14-15).   jackson’s bold move of placing himself in the position as chief legislator paved the way for the partisan process of legislative jockeying, forcing congressional members to forge partisan alignments with the executive in order to make policy advancements, and resulting in a diminution of the legislative branch’s overall power (quirk, binder, stewart, pgs. 3-7).  on the surface, it appears that the senate (engineered by equal representation in order to preserve state sovereignty) failed to fulfill its original intention (federalist no. 63; quirk, binder, stewart, pgs. 15-16).  however, as demonstrated in the articles assigned for class reading regarding local pork for louisville, uofl, and alaska, etc…, the senate does still hold a balance allowing smaller, disadvantaged states to achieve a higher degree of participation.   madison’s notion of a republic form of government was based on a scheme of representation that would enable the facilitation of governance over a larger population and make feasible the management of a greater breadth of spatial territory (madison, federalist paper no. 10; quirk, binder, schickler p. 50).  considering the federalists fear of popular majorities, and the discussions regarding the legislative branch, it is consistently implied that the house of representatives was the national institution with the closest link to the people.  it follows that it was assumed by the framers that the house would be representative of the population which elected it directly by popular vote.  this assumption led to the creation of the senate, which was based on an equal number of representatives indirectly elected by state legislative bodies.  in essence, the senate was a protective measure to guard against the impending popular passions of the house.  since, at that time, participation in the electoral process was the sole privilege of men from european decent, it is doubtful that the framers considered “representation” in the context in which it is discussed today.  there is no evidence in the constitution or the federalist papers that the framers aspired for diversity (ethnic, gender, or other characteristics commonly associated as qualifiers when referring to descriptive representation) in america’s political institutions.  they engineered a system based on representation that was specifically set up to prevent minority groups (i.e. property owners) from being excluded or overrun by the majority.  however, today those mechanisms for minority inclusion have been used to protect and include society’s marginalized groups.  representation as a concept is extremely complex and intricate.  the assigned article by mansbridge explores descriptive representation, referring to how closely the elected reflects the various aspects of the electorate (ethnicity, gender, profession, economic class, etc…).  she states that normative theorists traditionally reject the concept predicated on the basis that simply because the legislators have shared characteristics with particular groups does not guarantee or obligate their performance to be reflective of the group’s interests (mansbridge, pgs. 629 – 630).  however, mansbridge goes on to point out that descriptive representation is important in deliberation because groups can achieve synergy and critical mass.  as well, the dispersion of influence and the range of views presented are good for the whole of society (mansbridge, pgs. 633 – 635).  similarly, canon adds that the central cleavage is the opposing perception of the politics of difference versus politics of commonality, and he advocates for a balancing perspective (quirk, binder, canon, pgs. 173 – 174).  under the balancing perspective, descriptive representation is not necessarily a requirement for substantive representation, but it raises the empirical question of how a candidate’s race or gender effects how they represent their constituents (quirk, binder, canon, p. 174).  canon marshals a following presentation of empirical evidence that blacks are indeed found to better represent blacks (quirk, binder, canon, pgs. 174 – 179).  the legislative branch has been transformed into a body that primarily provides descriptive representation for the two competing national political ideologies in the u.s. (conservatives or republicans, and liberals or democrats).  as well, the collective body of legislators serves as descriptive representatives to their locality (city, state, district, etc…) (quirk, binder, jacobson, pgs. 113 – 114; pgs. 129 – 156).  national political parties use the mechanism of gerrymandering as a means of partisan manipulation of the electoral system to achieve descriptive representation, which has been deemed legal by the supreme court if used for partisan purposes (quirk, binder, jacobson, pgs. 111-112).  in the past, candidate-centered elections drew public attention toward candidate pork projects and constituent work to increase the odds of reelection, meaning the candidates had a substantial incentive to represent the local interests of their electoral base (quirk, binder, jacobson, pgs. 111-114).  however, locality-based descriptive representation is being challenged and even weakened by the heavy-handed approach of national parties that are moving toward centralized control of campaigning.  the story of republican candidate bob beauprez’s 2002 race for the 7th district house seat in the state of colorado provides a clear picture of how the national parties are using pecuniary measures to gain centralized control over elections, thus reducing state party control and candidate autonomy.  this, in turn, is leading to a decrease in responsiveness to constituents (quirk, binder, jacobson, p. 129).  additionally, the trend is polarizing the legislative branch across both chambers, an effect which decreases the number of centrists that make bi-partisan cooperation possible.  the polarized government of today, as empirically demonstrated in the jacobson chapter, is an extremely divided government in which more stalemates are occurring (quirk, binder, jacobson, pgs. 129, 153-154, 155-156, 161-164).  due to the remote nature of national party politics in the two-party system of polar opposites, intuition says this form of descriptive representation is far removed from the actual interests of the individuals that comprise the electorate.  it will be interesting to see how this scenario unfolds in the next few years, and to see if parties end up fracturing into effective, yet smaller, more representative subgroups such as the “democratic socialists” or the “republican libertarians”.  another tool at the disposal of marginalized groups in pursuit of increased access to participation in the american political system is that of litigation in the court systems.  the 20th century saw major movements on rights issues that sprang up through the courts, specifically the civil rights movement followed by the women’s rights movement (hall, mcguire, epp, pgs. 349 – 366).  the courts prefer to stall on making major rights decisions until after a sufficient amount of legal mobilization (broad litigation) has been mounted in the lower courts, a process referred to as “percolation” (hall, mcguire, epp, p. 349).  after the civil rights movement (naacp) won in the case of brown, other movements began to develop similar legal approaches to achieving representation and rights through the judicial process (hall, mcguire, epp, pgs. 350 – 366).  infrastructures were developed to fight rights issues through the court systems, which is a process that requires substantial financial resources and legal experts (hall, mcguire, epp, p. 350).  in addition to the gains made by african americans during this period, women also saw sweeping successes in the areas of discrimination and birth control rights (merritor savings bank v. vinson; roe v. wade; griswold v. connecticut) (hall, mcguire, epp, pgs. 350 – 366).  representation in its contemporary conception is likely something the framers would have found to be quite fascinating.  the entirety of the american political experiment in self-government has grown in such massive and multidimensional ways since its inception, that the framers could never have possibly predicted its current state.  the framers were, indeed, endowed with a special vision and political philosophy that lead to the creation of an enduring governmental system.  they had the foresight to create a representational scheme that anticipated and could effectively govern the substantial increase in population and territory that lie in the future. while there are many aspects of the current system that deviate from the framers’ initial intentions, there is no doubt that if they were to visit us now, they’d clearly recognize the underpinning skeleton as their own creation, the u.s. constitution of 1787 which is still mitigating the conflicting tensions and holding the balance for american society today.

mood:  aggravated

  neighborhood planning studiohallie jonesquestion 1:	what factors are driving the housing development described in the new york times article?the housing developments described in the new york times article are being driven primarily by the prevailing western mode of corporatist capitalist production.  the toll brothers and other publicly traded housing developers are entering into the vicious cycle of aggressive, corporate, capitalist behavior, of which society can draw parallels of the replication of this phenomenon across all industries from retail to technology, to the control of global water sources and food supplies.  these companies consume, accumulate, and grow thus aggrandizing their capital holdings at an exorbitant rate; their expansion is supported by the destruction of the natural environment, social structures, small economic rivals, and basic community sustainability.  the sheer existence of these large-scale, monolithic yet vague and confusing corporate structures depends upon the deterioration of local economies, person-to-person interactions, and relationships that exist on a more human scale.  these housing developers treat the environment, “ground”, as a mere hot commodity that must be snapped up at once, hoarded, and protected from encroachment by the competition.  the nature of capitalism is competitive, thus ensuring one’s own survival (the survival of the corporation) translates into the destruction of the competition, achieved through complete annihilation (bankruptcy) or acquisition (annexation/absorption).  so is the case with these housing developers.  they are operating on a scale in which humanity, harmony, and true wealth are sacrificed in the face of immediate profits.  by this i am referring to harmonizing with the environment and ecological systems in which the housing constructions share physical “place”.  true wealth might be conceived of, or conceptualized as, living in a manner that is on a human scale, in which water sources are not polluted by chemical particulates and traffic run off imposed as a byproduct of sprawl and consumption of “ground”.   additionally, the housing market is likely inflated by the purchase, rapid appreciation, and resale of these homes.  the huge profits made by the sellers are then re-invested into more expensive housing, and the cycle is repeated again.  this is a false economy.  nothing is being produced or sold, it’s just americans surfing on credit, buying, buying, buying, and increasing their debt.     question 2:	how can development be controlled in order to accomplish coherent metropolitan development?upon completing the kevin lynch article, i must respond to this question by asking if there is such a thing as coherent metropolitan development.  the lynch article, while describing, analyzing, and identifying the various elements that compose an image of the city, left much to be unresolved.  ultimately, the impression i drew from his presentation was that individual experience and subjectivity were key factors at play.  he did identify several critical themes, such as paths and nodes, districts, edges, and landmarks.  however, for each example lynch presented, he seemed to present a counter example that was equally as sound, even though opposite.  i’m not sure if coherent metropolitan development has ever been achieved, even though it is indisputable that some areas obviously function better than other areas for numerous reasons.  in the context of controlling development to achieve coherent metropolitan development, zoning and regulatory controls that were imposed in the past are now the formula for creating sprawl.  the policies, principles, and regulations that seem appropriate today might indeed be the downfall of tomorrow.  transportation seems to be a key in the equation, considering lynch’s analysis of paths, nodes, boundaries, etc…  it is no secret that development follows transportation routes.  new urbanist principles of higher density and mixed use development in traditional street grids with nodes of activity and commercial use seem to be a starting point toward controlling development.  however, when considering new urbanism, it is important to note that these developments are driven by a commonly accepted shared set of principles, which can be altered and allow room for flexibility.  zoning, policy, and regulation might prevent the necessary adjustment of practice through lessons learned.  however, the lack of top down control and unchecked growth can also be detrimental.  ultimately, i am lead to the conclusion that it is through education, intentionality, and constant analysis of developments and change that we can progress.  even so, who is to say that 100 years from now, no matter how much effort we go to, that the future generations will not look back at our decisions and balk at our inability to anticipate and accommodate the realities of their daily existences?

mood:  discontent

  sometimes, it feels like everyone fears being even the slightest bit controversial.  no one wants to take a challons of water rushing overtop in the opposite direction. today we went to uofl tonge and upset the natural order of things.  no one wants to stand out in the crowd of monotony.  no one wants to reach down inside of themselves to breathe life into their true spirit of leadership.  where is the consciousness of my  people.... even more, who exactly are my people?  in this time of radical political, social, cultural, and economic polarization, i feel isolated.  i feel like i'm floating in a weak under-current, with millions of ga the board of trustees meeting to protest the tuition increase.  of course, they waited until summer break to put it on the agenda.  campus police tried to run us off.  we showed up with a shopping cart full of clothes, water buckets and squeegies to clean trustees windows, we were "soliciting" our tuition dollars, therefore, we had to stop.  no soliciting on campus.  they made us pull up our signs and move them across the street because we did not have a "permit" to "protesp" and "carry signage".  however, because we were disrupting the flow of traffic, they allowed us back onto the school grounds.  a student prepared a speech and was alotted three minutes to plead our case to the board. she did a really good job.  the trustees acted like they appreciated out input and were glad to see us mobilized and attempting to communicate with them.  however, it also felt a bit patronizing, as if they were patting us on our heads like we were their little grandchildren and they were there to school us. that's okay though. they'll remember the younger generation of leaders that was before them today.  now give me a job so i can drive a lexus too and pay off my fucking debt!the local urban growth machine and the governor and i guess the republicans want to put a stadium in downtown. it's a failed economic development strategy.  there is plenty of quantitative data out there that shows how its a huge leach on the public sector.  they predicate their arguement on the line that it was be a "revenue generator" and it will "create jobs" and "increase tourism".  not the case when compared to the actual costs placed on the public sector for maintainence.  but, cest la vie. i guess every city that's worth a damn (except louisville) has a generic stadium.  now.... we too shall have our own, big, hideous, generic-ass stadium.  how cutting edge.  how unique.  then, we can also have a gang of pre-madonna pseudo-star rich ass basketball players running around the city acting like gangsters and fucking 15 year old girls in their hummers. i love that culture, its so rich and leaves us all with deeply meaningful and enriching experiences to remember forever.we need a new sport.  i'm tired of all the current ones.  someone - invent a new sport. please!!!!so, they want to move the speed museum downtown with their new stadium.  we went to a meeting last night about the issue. they called it "museum expansion".  i was the only one who said "yes. move the museum." everyone else wanted to keep it on campus and redesign it to be more post-modern, transparent, and inviting.  i suggested that they just start a new museum for contemporary art downtown.  i don't see why it has the be the speed museum's pet project.  this city needs a contemporary center and a damn god contemporary curator that's going to work with the local artists.  we need an advocate, someone to help the artists grow and develop their careers, not a solid brick wall to barrel thru that is the establishment.... the speed.  the speed is not that engaged with the community from my perspective. i don't really feel like i belong in that space.  its too quiet, uninviting, cold, and for the most part, disengaged from the younger adults and emerging artists.  we go to things there but its always the same old people all the time. i'm sick of that pretentious bull shit.  i need new dogs with fresh asses to sniff.  louisville artists are alienated from the collectors too.  i don't know a single person that would collect my work.  i have met a few people who like to think of themselves as collectors.  they socially pride themselves on that facade.  in reality, they are either buying art on e-bay, buying art by dead people, or buying shitty east-end house-wife-ey crafts from st. james art fair.  its about social climbing.  they like to hang out with the local artists and let the local artists entertain them but wouldn't dare shell out a dime for it.  ggggoooodddddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it pissed me off that i feel like i have to move to new york city or chicago to plug into my market.  but, thats the only option for me. louisville, you loose people to your brain drain because you don't support shit that's real!  you put in your wal-marts and your office depot bix boxes.  you let the developers rape and pillage and sprawl all out to the east, south, west, north of downtown.  you operate at cross purposes.i went to one ypal meeting ever.  there was a lady there that worked at yum who was the biggest snobby-est cunt bitch i had ever met.  she turned me off in 2.5 seconds. she was acting like a little princess and looking down her nose at everything.  complaining and speaking like a valley girl.  she had to have been 34 years old, which is the sad part.  so superficial and shallow.  i never went back to one of those ypal meetings.  i just don't have the stamina for people like that.  i just feel ready to make some shit happen.  when you have visions and energy to put to work, there are all these obstacles in the way.  hell, thats enough ranting for one night.  but, to anyone who ever hapens to read this, which no one probably will, just remember, don't be scared to take a chance.  don't be scared or ashamed to stand up for things that you believe in or things that are going to directly impact your life.  and don't only think about woriking to help yourself out.  sometimes you gotta get in there and fight for other prople.  sometimes you gotta help one another out, even if the issue or cause is not near to your immediate proximity.  i do love this city but it has a long way to go.  i'd like to know who is advocating for the museum move or new contemporary art museum.  they should check out the things that progressive contemporary centers are doing. check out ps1's partnership with moma. check out chicago's mca working with the underground.  check out the contemporary in cincinnati, they always have political art shows with controversial work that is over the line. i think every time i go in there i see at least one video with gay butt sex.  louisville would die if they saw that i bet. louisville, you need to see some gay butt sex.i rest my case. excuse the type-o's because this was written in a manic state.

creeping scary men 

 


02:39pm 10/05/2005


 



mood:  busy

  oh my god, you poor girl. thank you for sharing this. i am copying other women on this email.i thought i would share two similar experiences.  the first one involves a man that i started out being friends with.  he had a major crush on me and convinced me to give him a chance, so we started sort-of dating.  it only lasted about two months.  when i called it off, he flipped out.  he kept trying to get my attention and doing things that he thought would cause me to respond to him, which continually failed.  one night my roommate and her friends left at about 1:00 a.m. to go to a bar. when they left, they locked the doors to the house.  i happened to wake up at about 4 a.m. and felt very strange.  when i went to sleep, my bedroom door had been closed.  when i woke up, it was standing wide open.  i walked out of my room, only to find the side door open and the back door open as well.  i walked thru the house into my roommate's room to see if anyone was there, and there was no one.  the front door to the house was in her bedroom, so i unlocked the deadbolt from the inside to look out.  i found a key broken off in the dead bolt lock on the front door.  this guy apparently took my house key at some point and made himself a duplicate copy. i guess he broke in and was watching me sleep.  i ended up having several additional threatening encounters with him and finally had to get a restraining order, which was not an easy process.  the courts fought like hell in an attempt to resist granting it.  after that, i had to have him put in jail 3 times for violating the epo. here’s the second experience.  i lived in an apartment on east broadway on the first floor.  there was a young married couple that lived on the first floor next to me.  we used to cook out together; they had a dog so we would go to the park together… i felt safer because they were there next to me who was 21 and living alone.  one day, i got out of the shower and was standing in my bedroom getting dressed in front of my dresser. i saw thru the blinds that someone was walking around the side of the building past my window, which was unusual.  i kept watching in the corner of my eyes to make sure that the motion continued on past my window, and that the person was heading toward the parking area in the back.  however, my fear came true…. the motion did not continue.  i saw out of the corner of my eye someone trying to peep thru my blinds.  suddenly and abruptly, i punched the window to startle them and grabbed the blinds to look out and see who it was. it was the married mad who lived next to me.  he took off running.  when left my apartment that morning i saw his wife.  she said he ran in and woke her up to tell her that a squirrel jumped out of the bushes on the side of the house at him.  he was covering his tracks.  she said she asked him why he had even walked around that particular side of the house (the side my bedroom was on was not the usual pathway to the back parking area) and i guess he did not respond.  i didn’t tell her what had happened.  he was passive aggressive after that, giving me threatening looks and body language.  i broke my lease and moved.this is not nearly as scary as what happened to you sarah…. but it does go to show you that even those men you think you can trust might turn out to be threatening. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's been awhile since i have spoken to many of you, but due to a recent  event in my life, i feel the need to make contact with the ladies.  a few weeks ago, i awoke to a man trying to climb into my bedroom window.  thankfully i woke up before he entered.  this startled him and he disappeared.  the cops were quick to respond, however they did not find the man.  i am fortunate that i woke up and that he was not more aggressive.  long story short, that same night he actually  returned.  i was definately awake this time.  i found him laying outside my bedroom window, pants-less, masterbating.  again cops were called, but he took off before they arrived.  he was never found.  i moved the following day.   i know this was not the first time he had "visited" me.  i regularly heard noises on my deck, but often wrote them off as various animals.  i have never been more creeped out in my life.  i am still not sure how involved with me he was/is.   i haven't had any problems where i currently live (with a roommate and big dog) which makes me think he a was a peeping tom more than a stalker. i don't know.girls. girls.  moral of the story?  sick fucks do exsist.  we must be careful.  you are all beautiful women and you draw attention whether you are aware or not.  you never know who is watching.   don' t live in fear, just be aware.  take care of your selves and each other.enjoy the sunshine.   sara

corporate fraud report 

 


03:10am 04/05/2005


 



mood:  accomplished

  feeling like an activist today.  went for a visit at the community development bank.  we're opening a community cd (savings account) and opting for a 0% return on interest to help support the community development bank's mission.  i also sent an email reporting corporate fraud to the state auditor's office.here's the email.  maybe it will actually spark some discussion..... if they aren't too politically bound.-------------------hello.  i’m a graduate student at uofl in political science.  i recently uncovered a very telling piece of quantitative research published in feb. 2005 by the state of massachusetts concerning companies who have 50+ employees using state funded public health assistance.    the report is available on the mass.gov website.here is the direct link:  http://www.mass.gov/portal/index.jsp?pageid=eohhs2terminal&l=3&l0=home&l1=researcher&l2=masshealth+and+insurance&sid=eeohhs2&b=terminalcontent&f=dhcfp_researcher_hpt_health_insurance&csid=eeohhs2if this is happening in massachusetts, it is likely happening here in kentucky.  many of the companies on the list are major corporations with a strong presence in our state, which should set off warning bells in your office.  the private sector is reaping astronomical profits because they find clever ways (case in point) to siphon off taxpayer dollars.  this is outright waste, and it’s enraging.  this report provides clear empirical evidence illustrating that the private sector is extorting public sector funds.  they refuse to pay for employee health insurance, shift financial burdens onto taxpayers, and in turn, increase their profit margins and ceo quarterly bonuses. please….. we cannot afford to wait 50 years and then look back on the issue realizing how foolish we were for tolerating such injustice and inequality.  the private sector looks down it’s nose at government as being completely incompetent.  that’s because government’s inaction authorizes the private sector to abuse it, allowing it to get away with whatever they want, no matter what the cost. i firmly believe this practice is fraudulent.  i challenge you to place this issue on your radar screen.  the taxpayers and families of kentucky deserve better than this.  thanks for your time.------------------------------i feel better at least.shewwwww, that prisoner abusing chick is really busted!!!! nasty! i'd hate to be locked up with her and have to see that busted face every day.  it's late.michael jackson is fucked.

final exam:  human security and ir theory 

 


08:02pm 02/05/2005


 



mood:  happy

  final exam:  human security and ir theoryhallie jonesmay 2nd, 2005the notion or concept of “human security” is extremely difficult to define.  the term is vague, broad, and often times a serious point of contention amongst its most ardent proponents, according to both paris and mcdonald’s articles.  human security can include elements such as economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security (paris, p. 90).  with such an extensive list of priorities, policymakers and academics must contend with the question of how to address all areas of concern without allowing one area preference over another.  indeed, attempts to narrow the concept have resulted in exclusion of, or hierarchical ordering of, specific normative values over others.   likewise, the notion of human security is so encompassing that it could potentially support all hypothesis and their corresponding null hypothesis.  this perplexes scholars who in turn lack the clear focus and direction necessary to construct well developed theoretical debates from the foundational basis of human security (paris, p. 93).  consequently, developing human security as a theoretical framework for analysis of the international system seems highly improbable.  rather, human security appears to resemble a campaign for normative standards that was constructed to be vague intentionally. when human security is placed in the context of international relations as an organizational apparatus or political tool, it appears to be effective.   the ambiguity of the term provides common ground on which middle-power states (canada, norway, switzerland, chile, etc…) can jointly predicate their foreign policy objectives.  these middle-power states can invoke the human security “campaign” to assemble coalitions thus allowing them to respond to various international actions and political developments with a unified voice.  not only does it initiate strength through numbers and cooperation, but it contributes the additional boost of rallying around a “moral” platform thus providing legitimacy to those specific governments, a global appearance of benevolence, and forces the standards to be raised for opponents by coercion and pressuring through public relations, “soft power”.  a narrowing of the concept would pose additional barriers to this type of coalition building by reducing or shrinking their available area of common ground, and is therefore seen as counterproductive to accomplishing various human security advancements.  liberalism does, can, and should accommodate the notion of human security within its theoretical framework.  according to class discussion, human security falls under the rubric of liberal cosmopolitanism, which is preoccupied with a normative agenda focused on ethics and morality.  according to liberal cosmopolitanism, the western developed countries, or the global north, have an obligation to repay to the south third world for years of exploitation of its natural resources.  this line of reasoning holds the notion of mutual reciprocity as a truism, believing that the north supports its living standards through the oppression of the third world and as such should accept a reduction in its quality or standards of living in order to allow the south to catch up.  the relationship is inversely proportionate; northern standards of living increase as southern standards of living decrease. this specific branch of liberal theory is concerned with the “ought to be” and offers the radical suggestion that the primary unit of analysis or level of inquiry should shift from the state to the individual.  accordingly, this theory posits the notion of individual egalitarianism at its foundation, stating that we all belong to a single species of humanity and are “fragmented” into the state system, which is inconsistent with human nature.  they argue that the state-centric system is oppressive because it authorizes and legitimizes preferential treatment of some over others.  if humans were not fragmented into states, each individual would have the same claim to equal moral worth and status.  evaluating human security in the general context of liberalism, it is apparent that it promotes values, objectives, and a moral agenda that is consistent with the developed north.  human security is predicated on the notion of universalism, the assumption that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.  this generalized conception implies that the values and moral agenda embodied by its proponents are consistent with the rest of the world (translation: liberal democracy).  theoretically, it is flawed because it denies differences and does not allow room for varying positions.  if the unit of analysis is placed upon the individual, how do you find common ground in the current case of iraq?  there are some individuals that want a democratized iraq, and there are others who fervently oppose their country being transformed into a liberalized democracy.  there are two distinct, dichotomous goals at battle.  human security only acknowledges the movement toward establishing a liberalized democracy as the valid or moral side of the coin, they are the “freedom fighters”, while the opposition gets labeled “terrorist” for resisting western values. liberal institutionalism and regime theory argue that a hegemonic power is necessary to enforce the balance of power.  they theorize that actors derive functional satisfaction through an institutional dimension or regimes such as ngo’s.  a hegemon is required to enforce the particular agenda and the anarchical nature of the system is mitigated through cooperation for mutual gain.  additionally, since human security initiatives are created by the un and middle-power states, they are irrelevant if the hegemon choose not to join the ranks of its supporters.  an example would be the kyoto treaty, the us did not sign the treaty because it held competing values as priorities over environmental values, and kyoto is therefore irrelevant because there is no one to police it.   structural liberals believe the hegemon is the crucial element.  the hegemon must be liberal and its role is to shape and mold the “separate peace” or democratic zone.  the us is charged with expanding the democratic zone, or spreading democracy, based on the position that liberal democracies don’t fight each other.  this essentially means opening up new markets to foreign investment for members of the controlling liberalized global coalition (further exploitation of the south to maintain the north’s living standards).  when considering human security in that context, the us is violating many facets of the notion, such as using military force, economic sanctions, etc...  however, because the us is liberalized (according to liberal institutionalism), its ability or temptation to become universally dominant is curbed because of the pressure placed on it from other members of the liberal coalition.  therefore, governments advocating for human security concerns are in effect allowing the us to do their bidding.  these countries free-ride, sit back on a soap box and advocate an agenda of morality while the hegemon facilitates the global balance of power which enables them to do so.  these middle-power countries are given a voice through the international organizations which exist in essence because of the primary actions of the hegemon who is responsible for maintaining stability and the global balance of power.  the hegemon can still pick and choose its battles, enjoying a certain degree of freedom.liberalism can and does incorporate the notion of human security.  above, the various perspectives of liberal theory have been explored.  there is disagreement, and the notion of human security is placed in different boxes and afforded different levels of relevance.  liberalism in general would hold that more needs to be done in the way of human security initiatives because it is necessary to maintain the status quo.  the us can not choose to act unilaterally and must at times consider yielding to the initiatives of the un and middle-power states.  after all, the members of the northern liberalized global coalition provide it with its legitimacy.  the us must respond, to some extent, to the majority which authorizes its actions through their inaction.  realists would balk at the notion of human security.  a state-centric theoretical perspective, they would exclude the notion of human security from their consideration because it suggests a radical ontological shift to the individual.  realists would argue that the state is the most rational and logical unit of analysis and would counter by asking how human security theorists expect to resolve problems for individuals.  they would claim that the state is the most obvious structure for managing individual complaints and grievances, because the international system obviously could not effectively govern, facilitate, or administer the day to day realities of individuals.  the international system is too far removed from the individual for this notion to be realistic.realists would debunk the claim that ngo’s and coalitions pushing normative values have a significant amount of relevance.  they would scale the argument back to the basics, that these states are maximum utility organizers seeking to advance their individual positions within the international system.  ngo’s are extensions of the state.  they are rational actors operating within the context of the balance of power which restrains their capabilities.  states use international norms and laws as an avenue to pursue self-interest.  they band together only because they have specific agendas through which they can gain a common mutual benefit.  therefore, while liberalism would recognize cooperation as possible for mutual gain, realism would suggest that the system is still anarchical.  the notion of human security is vague intentionally because these countries in reality are at war with one another.  if there were a more explicit iteration of the concept of human security, these countries would not be able to identify collectively.  they still fear each other, but they fear the hegemonic powers more based on their relative capabilities and that fear drives their behavior within the system.  realism seeks to explain how things are, not how they should be.  there is no room for human security within the theoretical framework of realism.  it is a theory that supports a constant, immutable set of rules or truisms.  realism would treat human security as any other emergent concern or influence within the international system, dealing with it in a manner that is equal to other elements of consideration, such as religion, economics, expansion of territory, and culture.  it is simply another iteration of the struggle for power and balance.  it’s a method for engagement in the international system and an attempt to assert dominance through the use of coercive soft power.  realists believe that the state does not have the capacity to follow moral precepts.  they do not accommodate the notion of dynamism or change in nature.  man, by nature, is evil.  the state is a product of man.  since man exists in a state of war, the state and the international system is therefore a state of war and war does not accommodate human security.     realism can not, does not, and should not incorporate human security into its theoretical body.  realism exists to provide a purely pessimistic critique of the inter-workings of state relations.  it is removed emotionally and is therefore able to provide a more objective impression of the systemic balance of power.  it provides a constant, a point of reference from which arguments can be constructed.  postmodernism, feminism, and green theory all three would fall into the rubric of human security.  postmodernists are credited for being the largest contributors to the area of human security.  they deconstructed and debunked the debates between liberals and realists, questioning and demythologizing the very notion of power and the origin from which it derives its legitimacy.  they uncover the linkage between power and knowledge, calling the discourse between the opposing camps into question for hypocrisy because they package so-called “truisms” into their theories.  postmodernists claim that theory is nothing more than interpretation and the ultimate source of authority is the play of discourse.  as a conceptual notion, human security fits nicely within the context of postmodern thought because it is deconstructed, lacks absolutes, and resists hierarchical or polarized oppositions.  feminism and green theory also fit well within the realm of human security.  each line of argument can be classified as a concern or element that combines to compose the overall concept of human security as a whole.  green theory and environmentalism are interwoven with other elements of human security, such as health security, economic security, and personal security.  likewise, feminism opposes the patriarchal structure and calls each policy area into question from a critical perspective, positing that the global system is created and based around a male dominated agenda.  this is consistent with ngo’s that seek to serve, protect, and represent women.world systems theory would recognize human security as a positive trend serving to effectively dismantle the global economic status quo.  these theorists do not recognize states or individuals.  the unit of analysis is the global capitalist system, which they study objectively from a historical perspective.  they predict that the underlying secular trends, the influence that differentiates capitalism from its respective historical periods, will yield a radically different picture by 2050.  they predict the end result (or natural progression) to be globalized socialism.  the campaign for human security is essentially fighting for position, seeking to serve as the regulatory body that restricts the morally impoverished free-market from operating in a completely unethical, inhumane, and unchecked manner.  socialism is a combination of market economics and democratic controls that facilitate distributive benefits for all based on the notion of individual equality.  world systems theory does accommodate the notion of human security in a way that explains its relevance, permits its validity, and places its importance on an elevated level in the context of analyzing the international system.     social constructivism would also incorporate the concept of human security in its pursuit of playing the role as the great theoretical intermediary or diplomat.  social constructivists would still recognize the state as the primary unit of analysis, however, and would likely use the logic that realism uses to deny the notion of human security.  since human security posits the individual as the primary unit of analysis, and realism points to the state as the logical method to resolve individual grievances, social constructivism would not reject the notion of human security based on this logic.  instead, it would use this as a fertile breeding ground to plant the “great divide-bridging” seeds, arguing that individuals are just as relevant as the state or the global system.   in conclusion, most of the theoretical frameworks we studied accommodate the notion of human security and realism seems to be the single exclusionary realm of discourse.  the fabric for incorporating and treating human security within these various frameworks differs across the board.  world systems theory offers an optimistic outlook for the future by accounting for the equalizing potential that organized resistance and ethical positions can force onto market economic systems, thus restricting and subjecting the behavior of capital to a standard that is consistent with the basic fundamental premises of democracy.  while human security might not prove to be fulfilling as a theoretical framework of ir, it is proving to be effective as a campaign for raising the bar and creating standards to be applied horizontally across humanity.   i’m unsure if you were serious about justifying absences from your class or not.  in case you are serious, here’s my explanation.  i left at the break on one occasion because i was extremely sick, which ended up disabling me for an entire week.  i did consult you to explain the reason for my early departure.  on one other occasion, i did not come to class.  that was the monday directly after spring break.  in the spirit of having moral scruples about myself as an individual, i must admit that i have no good excuse for missing that class.  i had a friend in town from milwaukee and took her on a shopping excursion.  however, we did consume consciously by patronizing the secondary thrift market exclusively, avoiding the direct exploitation of the third world associated with patronizing such retail locations as the mall.   in all, i missed 1.5 classes.

highly organized moral hypocrisy 

 


12:24am 27/04/2005


 



mood:  apathetic

i’m sure anyone can guess, on the basis of the subject or “title”
of this entry, whom i might be referring to, knowing my inclination to lean
toward the left.  
 
i must ask a serious, puzzling question:  how do we attempt to reframe the issues, empower
the left to fight back, and remain within a moral and ethical framework?  
 
simply put, how the fuck do we fight back against such an insanely
evil yet brilliantly smart demon-satan-fire-brimstone-raging-hate-monger (translation:
the right) while remaining true to upholding our pluralist values of respect
and tolerance?  
 
the right and their highly organized moral hypocrisy are all
the more blatant each day.  from the
shift of the social welfare sector into the hands of “faith-based” institutions
which can discriminate and deny services to individuals based of personal
religious or lifestyle choices, to the recent freak show being broadcast via closed-circuit
television to churches across the country from the louisville-based highview
baptist church…. scarrrrrrrryyyyyyyy.  
 
mom!!!!! it’s raining outside, i’m wet, cold, and frightened.  
 
i mention the f-word to people and they look at me like i’m
crazy.
 

fascism.
fascism.
fascism.
fascism.

 
how can they right point their filthy hooves at an entire
party (which represents over half of the country and would be in office right
now if there were not a fraudulent history of the two past presidential
elections)?
 
it’s inane.  i mean,
the extreme, radical right is truly small in terms of sheer numbers.   
 
why does the media give their rhetoric top priority?
 
is it because they have such audacity, because they stop at
nothing?
 
is it because their charades are so far fetched that it’s
legitimately deserving of public scrutiny?
 
is it that the majority, main-stream of this country is so immeasurably
appalled that the media has to report it?
 
i can’t help but to believe that their coverage just fuels
the fire of hell which is raging up to the surface, creeping across the
backwoods like a plague, “wrapped in the american flag and carrying the bible”
in its hoofed feet.   
 
honestly, the moral hypocrisy is outrageous.
 
pro-life but pro-death penalty.
pro-life but pro-war.
pro-religious freedom but they want to stack the supreme
court with right wing, constitution disrespecting, neo-fascists (note: it’s
just the christians they are fighting for).
pro-life but cutting medicade and medicare reimbursements by
5% each year.
christians claiming to life in the likeness of jesus yet casting
narrow judgments onto individuals whose personal choices they don’t agree with or
feel threatened by.
 
it’s so funny how it’s okay to exploit the third world to
sustain the american life when slavery was supposed to be abolished.  well, abolished as far as we can see it here
in our own reality.  
 
suv driving is a tax deduction, which means the us
government rewards you for raping the world’s oil supply, exploiting nature and
the third world for their natural resources, and polluting the earth at the
same time!  you go us government, with
your upstanding cultural superiority and high moral standards.  it’s like shitting in your own food.  hell, dogs won’t even piss in their own
kennels.  let me know if i’m off target
here, but if dogs can figure out that they shouldn’t urinate and defecate in
their kennels, they are either more intellectually advanced than humans or it’s
ingrained in them biologically that filth is just plain nasty.
 
apparently, we humans just don’t get that fact.  however, i’d prefer to believe the opposite.  we get it, we just don’t give a shit, at
least those of us who are making a dime don’t give a shit.  
 
i could transition into a rant about capitalism, but i’m
kind of confused.  i just don’t think its
capitalism that is creating the rise of fascism in this country. capitalists
are way too smart to compromise the stability of the global economic balance
with something as nasty as a little infection of fascism sparking across the us.  no, the capitalists understand that there
needs to be more tolerance.  the
capitalists, evil as some of them are, just want to make their money.  the rise of a fascist party in the us could be
really bad for business….. well, unless your business was to sell bibles, guns,
bombs, prisons, and meat!
 
just joking about the meat.
 
this whole post is lame. why do i even care?  let’s just all go to tgi friday’s, bud light,
and watch the final episode of american idol.

arghhhhhhhhhhh.... drunken used-to-be-frat boys!!!! 

 


01:31am 26/04/2005


 



mood:  annoyed

  god!!!!! i went to a show tonight at uncle pleasant's to see buffalo
bill, arch and some other seriously hardcore band (who was really good
btw).  i decided to be friendly and invite a couple of guys from
my program at school. big mistake.  

one of them decided that it was okay to be a complete ass hole. 
he threw his flip flops at my friend's girlfriend who was doing nothing
more than standing there and watching her man play drums.  how
embarassing to be associated with that type of behavior.  god! i
had to apologize to her immediately.  

he kept invading my personal space, made numerous snyde remarks that
were completely rude and inappropriate, and kept making insulting
comments about the bands.  the whole time, i'm just totally
uncomfortable.  he's talking shit and i'm thinking....  these
are not some random people but friends of mine, and some of them even
close enough friends to aron that they are in our wedding!!!!!!
and this ass hole is talking shit, while surrounded by an entire group
of people who are friends with these people. he apparently had no
conception of the fact that we were not at some random bar, seeing some
random bands, for some random purpose. it made me so uncomfortable and
i felt so embarassed for bringing this guy up into my area.  

never again will i extend the invitation to some person like that just
to be nice.  it was the last day of our class and he gave me some
beers. we had been cool all semester long, so i figured that it would
be cool to invite him along.  i figured wrong. if i did not have
to see him tomorrow because we have a statistics test, then i would
have left him there at the bar.  thank god for keenan who offered
to take him home.  he saved me from having to deal with it. 
thank you keenan!!!!!  

i was so happy kristin was there, the only person who was seemingly
remotely sane.  aron had to leave early to go to work.  his
friends were having some drama. i think matt was pissed off abotu
something and stormed out. he left brendan at the bar, who swatted at
me with a little ruffled brow all pissed off. he took off walking and
pat said to just let him go. i tried to call him like 4 times and he
kept hanging up on me. i think he was trying to fight with kristin and
she would not buy what he was selling. compounded by the fact that matt
left him, so he took a hike.  i tried to pick him up. i hope
someone did.

the worst thing of all is that this ass hole's book bag was left in my
car with all his homework in it.  there's even an i-pod in the
bag. if i were a shady bitch, i'd gank that thing so fast.....
especially because of his behavior and the way he acted tonight. 
he embarassed the fuck out of me and i felt ashamed to even know him.
but, i'm not like that.... and i'll be returning the bag tomorrow....
i-pod included. damn, thats bitter sweet.  sometimes, being a
person of conscience is painful, especially when some jack ass pissed
you off, embarassed you, and left a sweet ass i-pod in your car that
you could annex. 

well, school is almost out. i'm creeping along with finals.  i
have to write 1 more paper and have a statistics test tomorrow.  i
never finished my independent study. i feel aweful about that.  i
saw my professor tonight and apologized again. he was cool and acted
like its no big deal, but still, i'm have higher standards for myself
than that and i really failed miserably this time around. i have to
spend the summer working on it now. i'm not too excited abot that, but
the bright side is that i'll do a much better job on it and probably
learn a whole lot more than i would have while trying to juggle ten
thousand other things.  

lynn is going to try her best to recruit me into her sales team this
summer. i don't wanna do it!!!!!!!!!!! she's going to have to make me a
very very attractive financial offer,. or else, i'll have to say no.
the idea of working full time all summer like that kills me. i just
want to stay up late in my studio, making art, being dirty, and making
more smart ass art.  if she would make an agreement to let me work
only 4 days a week, pay me about $30 an hour, and let me come in from
11:00 - 7:00, that might work. she could give me a sales territory on
the west coast and the time difference would be no issue. i just hate
getting up early. it really fucks up my world.  it goes against my
natural grain.

speaking of getting up, i need to go to bed so i can get up and study
for my statistics final. i'm nervous about it, even though i'm sure
i'll do just fine.

mood:  moody

  i just called my mom. my grandmother is apparently doing better than last week. she said that she and my little brother were at the hospital with her tonight and they were going to help her to bed.  my grandmother got up, walked around the bed, and got in by herself, without help or a walker.  my brother commented... "well, why didn't you just run?" so apparently she is feeling a lot better.  mom said that she might get to come home from the hospital on thursday if she keeps doing better.mom said my father confronted her about her aproach to handling my grandmother's health situation. he asked her, "what are you planning to do? just let her die?"  first of all, it's none of his damn business. they are divorced. when you divorce someone, you divorce their parents along with them.  you don't get to hold a share of the family stock. you don't retain your voting rights.  you get divorced, you sell your stock, you officially disinvest.  he apparently thinks he still have the right to give input into the situation.  my father is the last person on the face of the earth who's opinion counts as far as my mother is concerned.  besides, he had the audacity to email me and tell me he wanted to discuss my grandmother's health with me, without my mother knowing.  i've been emailing him for 3 weeks asking if he wants to be a part of my wedding or not and he never responded to my emails. what gives him the notion that its okay to carry on about his business as if i did not attempt to contact him, but when the communication is initiated from his end, then it's time for a conversation.  well, fuck that. i'm tired of the one way relationship and being used to hear his sob stories.  i hurt his feelings. he's depressed.  well, welcome to the real world.  you know, everyone has hurt feelings. everyone feels depressed. but most everyone will get off their lazy asses and take charge of the situation. call a fucking therapist. they get paid to listen to your self denial. they get paid to hear your dellusions of grandure and deal with your over inflated sense of self importance. i'm soooo sick of the self denial and attitude of perfection. god, admit your wrongs and maybe you can find a way to sleep at night. urgh! i've got a final to write, and statistics test tomorrow night, a house to close on this week, going to chicago on friday.... lots going on. i'm just glad my grandmother's pain has lessened and that she is feeling better.now i'm going to pick up some of my comrades from the political science department and we're going to see buffalo bill at uncle pleasants.
