"mentorship in the legal academy, as well as the greater legal profession, plays a crucial role in the professional development, success, and well-being of aspiring lawyers," says professor brenda gibson. "effective mentorship has been transformative, particularly for members of underrepresented groups who face unique challenges and barriers in the profession. as an african american woman in the legal academy, i have found this to be so, and for that reason, i have been and currently am a mentor to many. my presence in the academy directly demonstrates to my students and colleagues the value added by diverse voices."learn more about how mentorship helps create a stronger, more diverse legal community, and how professor gibson is leading the way, beginning on page 10 of the jurist. link in bio.

when professor shannon gilreath (@shannon_djm_rector_gilreath) and professor emerita suzanne reynolds were approached by the @americanbarassociation to work on an anthology book about former supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg, they had no way of knowing what the political and social landscape of the united states would look like when the book was finally published. how could they know that some of the fundamental rights of the american people would be under attack?on being american: the jurisprudence of ruth bader ginsburg, written and edited by professor gilreath and former dean of wake forest law, suzanne reynolds, was never intended to be a survey of ginsburg‚Äôs jurisprudence, but rather an attempt to answer a key question: what did justice ginsburg do as a lawyer, an advocate, and a judge to change and broaden what it means to be an american citizen? a question that is more relevant today than perhaps ever before.read more about their book at the link in our bio.

participating in mock trials is a cornerstone of the law school experience, offering students a dynamic and practical way to bridge classroom theory and real-world legal practice. through simulated courtroom scenarios, aspiring attorneys develop critical skills to prepare them for the challenges of trial practice.wake forest law‚Äôs trial team takes this approach, offering students invaluable opportunities to build their confidence inside and outside of the courtroom.the weekend of november 2-3, 2024, students from wake forest law‚Äôs trial team competed in the premiere trial competition at broward county clerk of courts in fort lauderdale, florida. this annual competition provides first-time trial competitors the chance to argue in a mock trial setting, representing both plaintiffs and defense. participants showcase their advocacy skills, test their courtroom abilities, and gain important legal experience. the competition offers a supportive environment where students receive constructive feedback from coaches and judges.the event consists of four rounds of competitions, judged by coaches dedicated to encouraging growth and confidence among the participants. sixteen schools made up of eighteen teams participated. wake forest law placed in the top ten.representing wake forest law were 2ls madison doser, mary mccullough, jay ramesh, and nik rappaport. competition alternates included 2ls carson sanford, virginia brown, and caleb osborne. the students were coached by ashley dimuzio (jd ‚Äô19), mark parent, and judge whit davis of the forsyth district court bench, who also took home the award for best judge. read more about their experience at the link in our bio.pictured from left to right: jay ramesh, mary mccullough, madison doser, and nik rapparport
