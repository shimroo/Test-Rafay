welcome to my fan site! i will be updating soon.
please excuse me for not updating this site as often as i should have. i would like to apologize to ryan cooley and his fans for not having this site as up to date as it should be. ryan is a talented actor who deserves a better fan site than what i am able to make. expect a totally new updated look to this place in the next week!
