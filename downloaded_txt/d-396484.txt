2nd edition of the routledge handbook of sustainable design the routledge handbook of sustainable design considers the design, not only of artifacts, but of structures, systems, and interactions in the context of sustaining our shared planet. this revised edition introduces new and updated chapters, as well as a new section on pedagogy for sustainable design. with authors from around the world, design is positioned in context with recent crises such as global pandemics, racial reckoning, political unrest, and natural disasters. just as design is an interdisciplinary field, the climate crisis is deeply tangled in racial justice, gender justice, global health, economics, trade, and more. arguing that design needs to restore, regenerate, and rejuvenate our planet and people, this handbook will be invaluable to researchers, students, and practitioners across all subdisciplines of design, architecture, business, energy management, visual arts, and environmental studies, among others.
