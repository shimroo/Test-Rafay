  psychotherapy for couples, individuals and groups  
my intention for my clients is to achieve healing on the deepest level.  as an adlerian trained therapist, i utilize psychodynamic as well as alternative modalities to explore, shift and heal those perceptions and beliefs that may be negatively impacting their lives.  whether it’s one on one, couples, or group therapy, i am actively participating, encouraging, and guiding my clients so they feel safe  and supported to examine and process their deepest emotional wounds.
utilizing psychodynamic therapy, emdr,  hypnotherapy, breathwork, rohun, or healing touch, i offer many approaches based on the individual needs of my clients. i have created a warm and collaborative environment, ultimately achieving balance, harmony, and a sense of well-being. i also offer transpersonal life coaching awakening your greatest resources, talents and gifts. 
 if you are looking to enrich and find greater meaning in your life, spiritual work offers the opportunity to connect with our authentic self; allowing us to embrace ourselves and live to our fullest potential.
