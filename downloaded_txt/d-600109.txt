time flies
by admin on june 17, 2016


ages since i took pictures of insects. all the gear been sinking under an accumulation of dust for the last five or more years. still not photographing bugs but when i go out with the dogs these days, some creatures insist on sitting in front of my phone camera when i’m just trying to take another selfie. this month there has been an explosion of insects in the area i take the dogs, especially mosquitoes and ticks. here are some shots from the last few days, nothing in particular, just a random selection of what has been around.

an unusually wet month and not very good for insects. avisit to punjen is always worthwhile, though and here are some of the finds. pride of place goes to the lamiinae olenecamptus fouqueti (thanks to michel chantraine for finding the id)- as far as i know it’s the only picture of one on the internet.

you don’t expect to get vast numbers of insects during the winter months but wang chin (the punjen hideaway) was always good. everest, however, was not- three moths all night and three thousand hornets. only got stung once, though. i will add these and others to the galleries. eventually.

death and life: december 2010
december 19, 2010

fewer insects around now winter has set in but still plenty of moths and butterflies, including my first sighting of papilio demolion, a beautiful and uncommon species. the most striking thing i came across, however, was a tragic sight: the body of a fishing cat (prionailurus viverrinus) presumably shot by a farmer. larger than the […]

bugs defy the winter
november 15, 2010

trips to pamiang, everest and wang chin. now the rains have stopped there are not supposed to be so many insects around but this year the bugs have defied the predictions by turning out en masse (see the picture of the sheet at punjen, wang chin, at around midnight. i counted 82 hawk moths on […]

the most frustrating thing about finding moths is not knowing what they are. all these came to the lights in the last few days and i’ve no idea what they are. any suggestions welcome.

the rainy season prepares to go out with a bang
october 12, 2010

thaibugs is slowly struggling back to normal after the site was hacked. apologies for the disruption. meanwhile, i took advantage of the last moonless nights of the rainy season to continue my exploration of resorts around chiang mai and incidentally to photograph a few moths. here is a small selection plus a few other creatures.

bugs in the rain
september 23, 2010

good trips this month to chiang dao, wang chin and chae sorn. huge storms with nightly downpours, landslides and mud everywhere. moths plentiful, the highlight being an actias maenas hanging from the branch of a tree which i spotted while driving along the winding wooded road to chae sorn one morning. lots of cicadellidae came […]

butterflies
september 10, 2010

this is the best place i know of around here to see lots of butterflies. just outside chiang dao, at the bottom of the road leading to meuang khong. in the sandy area around the checkpoint i have regularly found 60 species or more in a morning- and i’ve missed loads. these are some pictures […]
