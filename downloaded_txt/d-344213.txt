2024 in retrospect & happy new year 2025! (jan 5, 2025)



happy new year 2025! once again, a lot has happened over the past months, in gentoo and otherwise.
our fireworks were a bit early this year with the stabilization of gcc 14 in november, after a huge 
amount of preparations and bug fixing via the modern c initiative. a lot of other programming language 
ecosystems also saw significant improvements. as always  here 
weâre going to revisit all the exciting news from our favourite linux distribution.




 


fosdem 2025 (dec 29, 2024)





itâs fosdem time again! join us at universitã© libre de bruxelles,
campus du solbosch, in brussels, belgium. the upcoming fosdem 2025 will 
be held on february 1st and 2nd 2025. our developers will be happy to greet all open source enthusiasts at 
our gentoo stand (exact location still to be announced), which
we will share this year with then gentoo-based flatcar container linux.
of course thereâs also the chance to celebrate 25 years of compiling!
visit this yearâs wiki page to see whoâs coming and for
more practical information.
