research & insights

the future of corporate social responsibility: a purpose-driven approach to sustainable growthcalling wonder woman for science: how female experts engender likability and trustpublic trust in science has been declining for decades, a challenge that may be exacerbated by pop culture and media portrayals of scientists as cold and disconnected. could a female face give science communication the warmth it needs to succeed?beyond consent: rethinking privacy in the digital agein an age where data drives much of our digital interactions, questions about privacy and consent are more pressing than ever. as tech evolves, so do the complexities of navigating the digital landscape — particularly when it comes to the collection and use of our personal data. this book chapter argues that the traditional understanding of consent — where individuals simply opt into terms and conditions — fails to protect users in the current data ecosystem.can ai speak our language: exploring human-machine communicationas ai continues to play an increasing role in both personal and professional spheres, the need to understand not just the outputs of these technologies, but also the processes behind them, becomes ever more critical. new research merges two growing fields — explainable ai (xai) and human-machine communication (hmc) — to address how we can begin to bridge the divide between ai’s decision-making processes and human comprehension.
