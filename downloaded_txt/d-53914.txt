notice to my visitors
this website is under extensive renovation.  i will be taking the next year to add recipe photos,  refurbish recipe formats and recipe content.  this should not make surfing the site too difficult,  but there might be a glitch or two now and again.  thanks for your patience and enjoy the "gutsy gourmet".














about this websitetop ⬆



it is my sole purpose to introduce you to some of the best recipes on the internet,
and to share with you some of my own personally developed recipes and those
of my mother, gladys,  who taught me how to cook.

the recipes you find here are not normally found in your basic cookbooks,  but are a
collection of recipes from around the world that i love to prepare and that my friends 
have raved about.  they may seem difficult at first sight,  but they are really quite simple.  
they do,   for a large part,   take a little time to prepare.  they are not, what in today's 
"faddish" society you would call "lo-fat",  but are nutritious.  these recipes are not intended 
for daily faire,  but are for those special occasions when you want to look  and feel like the 
best damn cook that ever was.  they are for impressing your friends and family with your 
culinary mastery.  the recipes are free for your use and the gutsy gourmet does not receive 
any monies for their use.  many of these recipes have been sent to me from around the world.  
i have tried to give credit for those recipes of others that may be listed here.  if i have included
your recipe without acknowledgement,  please contact me and i will either delete it or give you 
credit for it's source.

i also want you to know that recipes are made to be altered.  use your imagination when you
cook.  if one fruit or vegetable is not in season,  use something that is.  keep things as fresh as you 
can buy at the time.  experiment with recipes.  change a spice or two.  use different meats,  like
substituting pork for chicken.  fry some sweet potatoes instead of white ones.  throw a handful of 
raisins into your gravy.  pick some nasturtiums out of your garden and toss them in your salad.  put
some cranberry juice in your salad dressing. use lots of olive oil!  raise a little hell in your kitchen!
everyone will think you know what you are doing and will go home and try it themselves.

season your food while you are cooking. season before, and during cooking. if you add a new ingredient that needs seasoning, season again.  food seasoned after it is cooked does not taste as
good as when seasoned before and during the cooking process.  experiment with different seasonings.
sure,  you are going to mess up now and then,  but go lightly at first and you will find that your 
experimentation with seasonings will give your recipes a signature that no one else has.

last but not least,  i hope that you and your family make an effort to have meals together at home...and 
often. not having time to cook for your family is like not having time to love them.  take the time to do it.  families are made at the dinner table.  make a time for your family to spend quality time together,  to converse,  to laugh and to build a foundation on which to grow and love one another.  do it when your children are at an early age,  and those will be the moments they will  remember all of their lives.  make the time! make mealtime..happy time!

i hope i have encouraged just one more person to cook in the "gutsy" style.  go get yourself a cup of 
tea or coffee,  relax and just have fun surfin' this site!  hey! it's free,  only food related advertisements,
and no pop-ups!"if you can't break bread with a friend,  the least you can do is share a recipe!"
cooking has been a passion of mine for over 65 years.  i have traveled extensively throughout the mediterranean and the middle east and i enjoy preparing the recipes from all ethnic cuisines and cultures.  i love to combine them to come up with new and more exciting results.  most of the recipes you will find here have been tried by me and suit my tastes.  some have been developed by me personally and i hope you will enjoy preparing them as much as i have.  most important of all,  enjoy yourself, come back often and above all...... "raise a little hell in your kitchen!""may your seas be always calm and your meals always memorable".

turn it up if necessary.  the different selections of quality ethnic music has been included to mentally whisk you to the country of
origin of the recipes.  there is also a console on the page where you can adjust the volume or opt out from listening to the music at all if you so desire.
