“our facilities have specified cis paint curing oven systems for over 20 years worldwide. they are smaller in size, reliable and energy efficient. gas infrared has helped improve production because the accelerated ramp-up technology rapidly brings the temperature of the part to optimum."
 — paint manager- world's leading manufacturer of construction,  mining equipment and engines 
















applicationsindustrial manufacturers with liquid or powder coating processes utilize cis gas catalytic infrared heating system for the substantial savings in process time, reduced energy costs and increased production capacity. from wind turbine blades to consumer razors, infrared gas catalytic heaters are utilized worldwide by manufacturers with paint curing needs. cis gas catalytic ir ovens consistently outperform convection oven systems by as much as 80%.























liquid coating














powder  coating 


























gas catalytic infrared cis catalytic heaters emit heat in the form of far infrared energy. far is a long wavelength infrared energy, more readily absorbed by most materials than the shorter wave infrared energy others use. heat goes right to the coating or paint, for faster curing, reduced process times by up to 80%, and lower operating costs.
