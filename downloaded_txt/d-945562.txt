	 new world wide ill wiki
	 
    


this was posted today on the ill-l listserv:     we are pleased to introduce shareill (pronounced like  the woman's name "cheryl"), a new wiki devoted to all aspects of ill and resource sharing,  http://www.shareill.org. you might notice that the content  looks more like a tarted up web site than wikipedia, but that's because we just  wanted to get the basic infrastructure in place so that you (yes, we mean you)  can contribute the sort of content that will be helpful to you and your ill  colleagues around the world. just go to www.shareill.org, create an  account, and start writing your wiki entry.   maybe you want to write about ill copyright tracking, or  performance standards, or how ill works in your  country/state/province/region. maybe you're the resident expert on german  copyright law and ill, or you've been involved  in some innovative ill project, or you want to write about the convergence  between ill,  acquisitions, and collection development. create your shareill account, and  start writing! we want this to be a truly grass roots effort for the entire  global resource sharing community, sort of "wikipedia meets ill", so that means  anyone can create and/or edit any of the shareill pages.      linda and i want to thank nada vaughn for coming up with  the name shareill, and our gracious host, blake carver of lishost (  www.lishost.com), for his expertise, kindness, and patience with our endless  list of questions and last-minute changes.remember: like ill itself, shareill can  only be successful if we all pitch in and share our expertise, so start writing! see you on the wiki,linda frederiksenfrederik@vancouver.wsu.edumary hollerichmary.hollerich@gmail.com

	 c-car reminders  (****yet again****)
	 
    


from sharon brettschneider:good afternoon,i thought it was time to send out a couple of reminders based on some feedback that i've been getting from libraries.first, please remember that we love it when you use those clear plastic bags to send multiple items to one library.  saves you time labeling and saves us time sorting.second, please remember to wrap all dvds and cds in protective padded envelopes or boxes.  they are fragile and can get damaged in transit.  some libraries are doing the right thing but get their stuff returned with just an elastic.third, be careful with your route numbers.  unfortunately libraries in the same town usually have consecutive numbers and are easily mis-labeled and therefor mis-delivered.  (i'll ask the sorters to be careful on the same issue.)  there's fairfield public and fairfield u, hartford public and u of hartford . . .thanks for your help.  and remember to let me know if you are having trouble with your delivery.sharon

	 patron email notification in request ill
	 
    


have you tried using the patron email notification in request?  steve reminded us about it at the combined ill roundtable a few weeks ago.  ccsu does not use request ill for many of our borrowing, but when the patrons find it and choose to use it, we will usually put the request through there.   as i gave it more thought, it occurred to me that we do have occasions when we could make use of it.  so, i set it up for unfilled and cancelled requests.  i really think it will good compliment to our other systems.instructions on how to set it up are as follows:included in a recent upgrade to request is ill e-mail notification. you can set this function in your ill participant record. it is turned off until you activate it by completing at least one of the messages on your participant record. patron e-mail notification is located just below the "exceptions to library hours open" section on your participant record.the following instructions (through 3) are from auto-graphics:the patron notification set-up field on the maintain participant record screen lets you create up to five messages intended to notify library patrons of the current status of their ill requests. each notice is associated with a selected ill status. when a patron-generated ill request enters a status category for which a patron notification message exists, the system automatically sends the associated message to the email address specified when the ill request was generated.to set up patron notification messages:1. select the ill status for which you wish a message to be sent from the first ill status menu. patron notification messages can be created for the pending, received, recalled, overdue, unfilled, cancelled, accepted renewal, rejected renewal, conditional and need-by date expired status categories only.2. enter the text for the patron notification message in the first e-mail text field. the e-mail text can be a maximum of 300 characters, including spaces.3. repeat steps 1 and 2 using the remaining ill status menus and associated e-mail text fields to create additional patron notification messages, as desired.4. enter an email notice subject. this will be the subject line of all of your e-mail notices.5. enter an e-mail notice from name. this name will appear in the "from" field on the e-mail header of all your e-mail notices. i suggest that you put your personal name or your library name in this field.6.  enter and e-mail notice from address. this e-mail address will appear in the "from" field on all of your e-mail notices, thereby allowing the patron to use the "reply" command to communicate with you. you can put your work e-mail address or your ill department's e-mail address.7. enter an "cc e-mail address". this *optional* field allows you to enter a second e-mail address. this e-mail address will get carbon copies of all of your e-mail notifications. 8. click the "update" button when you are satisfied with all of the changes.the feature will be active once you have taken the steps above. when a request goes into a status for which you have specified a notification, the patron will receive an e-mail. this feature will only work if the patron initiated the request and if they input an e-mail address on the "request this item" form.questions? contact us at 860-704-2223 or scauffman@cslib.org.
