closing our doors

          on behalf of christian, pamela, noma, and all the staff at sel et poivre restaurant, unfortunately after 35 years we had to make the heartfelt decision to close our doors. the last few years have been very challenging for us. the overhead cost to operate the business in nyc has taken a toll on us. we would like to thank all our loyal customers for their support throughout the years. we will miss the sel et poivre charm, good food, and especially the staff. we are proud of what we have accomplished and thank each and every one of them and you for the devotion to sel et poivre.
        

          thank you; christian and pamela

                  "this is one of the best restaurants i've been to in nyc. the food was amazing; some of the best i've had. the atmosphere is not only warm and inviting and intimate, but it resembled that of an actual parisian restaurant, and the prices were very fair. and the servers and the bar tender were the absolute best; our waiter, alberto, was one of the kindest and purest person i have ever met. definitely one of the main highlights of the trip to nyc!"
