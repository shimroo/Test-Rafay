 temporary price increase notice on eggs effective january 30th  2025  we thank you for being such loyal and consistent customers to famous anthony’s.  your satisfaction is very important to us, we strive to provide you with excellent food, service and pricing.due to the avian influenza, egg supplies continue to weaken. the threat of avian influenza continues to bring eggs to exceptionally high prices.increasing prices is something that we at famous anthony’s take very seriously.  we have spent a lot of time trying to determine the best way to offset this price increase that we are paying from our distributors.  we came to the conclusion that rather than go up on every menu item that serves eggs, is to implement a temporary increase of .39 per egg.once the egg market stabilizes, we will cease this temporary increase.  we feel doing this temporary increase is better for our loyal customers, opposed to doing an across the menu increase.we will continue to provide you with the quality products, service and competitive pricing that you are accustomed to.  we appreciate your continued loyalty and support. sincerely, famous anthony’s management team
