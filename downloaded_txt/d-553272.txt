memphis listening lab
memphis listening lab is an upcoming public space that will tap into memphis’ rich musical history to offer a massive collection of physical media and historical ephemera for listening, sampling, and research… gratis.










































huling station bourbon whiskey
developed for old dominick distillery, this private label whiskey required not only a premium bottle design, but an accompanying marketing campaign to launch it. the end result has been a success for old dominick, becoming their best-selling product mere months after arriving in stores.photography, video editing, design, copywriting, creative direction





















 































graceland tourism campaign
graceland needed to get the word out about their brand new entertainment complex, as well as a whole new set of museum exhibits. public perception tends to focus on graceland the mansion, so we hyped specific attractions with larger-than-life headlines and a targeted “2019 comeback special” marketing campaign, meant to entice new elvis fans and previous visitors alike.the sizzle reel at the top was put together to sell the tagline, but will be repurposed for tv and social media.design, copywriting, creative direction



 




























 





































old dominick distillery
possibly the largest end-to-end branding job i’ve ever done, old dominick distillery came to us for logo design, web design, product design, tour experience, and environmental design.the end result is a lineup of amazing spirits, from whiskey to vodka, as well as a 6 foot tall oil painting of their founder, and a 13 foot tall neon rooster that stands proudly over downtown memphis.design, copywriting, co-creative directionengravings by roger xavieroil painting by david riley










































baptist blue healers branding
baptist college of health sciences, founded in 1912, has one of the longest health care legacies in the mid-south. realizing they needed to craft a more approachable brand for recruitment, we were approached to create a recognizably “collegiate” mascot. the result is hartley the blue healer, a symbol of compassion and service, and also just a dadgum good boy.illustration, design, copywriting, creative direction






















































live at the garden 2019
each year, a set of posters are commissioned for the live at the garden concert series at memphis botanic garden. 2019 poster duties fell to me, and i had a blast doing them. a little matisse, a little saul bass, and a whole lot of fun.illustration, design, creative direction






























baptist healers – answer the call
to boost recruitment, baptist college of health sciences requested we produce a video targeting 14-22 year olds to be aired locally via movie theater pre-show advertising. we went a step further by also producing a geo-targeted digital campaign that leveraged the full-length spot for social media, and created a unique url and microsite to get more detailed tracking and metrics.creative direction, copywriting, video production, video editing, social media strategydirector of photography, stewart holmes

national civil rights museum
commemorating the 50th anniversary of mlk’s tragic death was a solemn task, and drawing awareness for the national civil rights museum was an honor. through a series of print ads, we encouraged tourists to meet the prominent figures of the civil rights movement, people whose message rings out to this day.photography, design, copywriting






























unquote podcast
this is an ongoing effort in collaboration with unquote to provide both branding and social media. the podcast discusses, often humorously, the american film institutes top 100 movie quotes of all time. each new episode gets an accompanying social media blast with the featured quote and a still from the film.design, copywriting, creative direction




































grizzlies winter slams
the grizzlies needed a holiday card set for a game-time giveaway. we did them one better with a set of traditional holiday postcard spoofs featuring chilly messages that could be sent to rival players from particularly snarky grizz fans.design, copywriting, creative direction










































elvis presley anniversaries branding
over the years, i’ve had the privilege of doing several logos and themes for various elvis anniversaries. in each case, the look is handed off to an internal marketing team who then applies it across media and merchandise.illustration, design, creative direction






















































kalamazoo institute of arts proposed rebrand
working with a longtime friend, creative collaborator, and native of kalamazoo, a complete brand refresh for the kalamazoo institute of arts was proposed. key to our vision was a focus on the highly recognizable facade of the building, as well as keeping classic elements of the old, like using gill sans as the brand typeface.design, co-creative direction
















































pure memphis music series
old dominick came to us to develop a look, feel, and name for a concert series to be held on premise at the distillery. in addition to a templated poster and social posts, we also produced a :60 and :15 promo video to be shared on facebook and instagram.video editing, design, copywriting, creative directionfootage by robert rowan



 






















 







grizzlies 8-bit power packs
each season, in addition to a core campaign, the grizzlies have specialized promotions to encourage ticket sales and keep their media feed fresh. using an old-school videogame aesthetic, we encouraged grizz fans to purchase ticket packages by way of an 8-bit grizz who leveled up with “power packs”. giveaways for the games during this promotion included a set of t-shirts featuring 8-bit versions of mike conley and marc gasol, and an 8-bit grizz decal that is found on rear windshields city-wide.illustration, animation, design, copywriting, creative direction



 





































youth villages holiday ecards
the annual youth villages holiday ecard is always an opportunity to do some a little out of the box, the most outrageous of which was filming a custom gingerbread house (and gingerbread family) to deliver an on brand message as well as thank yv donors.photography, video editing, animation, design, copywriting, creative directiongingerbread house frost



 




 







various logos
just what the title says: various logos. most of these were one-offs with no additional branding requested, but show various approaches from illustration to custom typography.design, illustration, copywriting, creative direction
