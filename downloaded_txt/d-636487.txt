twenty years ago, we researched cutting-edge schools across the country to find the perfect mix of best practices with one goal: to graduate students ready for life.
our curriculum for grades 9-12 is rigorous and relevant to the modern world. furthermore, career-mapping, workforce skills literacy and mentored internships ensure our students graduate tech-savvy, college and career ready.
today, this unique educational model continues to prove itself.  with free* laptops, year-round classes, a low student/teacher ratio, and focus on college and career readiness, city high averages a 94% graduation rate – across all demographic groups. 

apply now!
find out how you can become tech-savvy and well prepared for the challenges of college, career… and life.  








a unique place... by design





technology was a founding principle at city high. we recognized early on, the importance of emerging technology as a learning tool as well as a vital skill for the modern workplace. so we make sure that in addition to free* laptops, our students also get the software skills training and certifications to prepare them for their future.



technology infused education







a career-focused experience convinces students that what they do at city high impacts their future. so, all graduates complete a 13-week mentored internship to explore a potential career and get a taste of the real work environment. but before they go out into the business world, we arm them with business orientation skills, like time-management, collaboration and an overall professional work ethic. 



mentored internship






city high teachers “loop” with the same students over all 4 years, so our students really get to know their teachers... and vice versa. this results in a more personalized teaching approach. more importantly, it gives us better insight into each child’s individual learning style and pitfalls, so we can adapt to make sure every child stays engaged and learns to the best of their ability.


teacher looping






interdisciplinary, project-based learning sets city high apart. our students are not just taught facts and information, but how to teach themselves and collaborate with others to learn. their studies focus on cultural literacy, information literacy, scientific literacy and workskills & financial literacy, which collectively prepare them with the skills needed to become 21st century learners. 



curriculum







city high uses a unique trimester school year: three 62-class day sessions with month-long winter, spring and summer breaks. our students grow to love these well-placed breaks from class. and since the material from the previous session is still fresh, they don’t need to start over in a particular study area when the break is over. 



year-round learning






from its inception, city high has offered free* laptops, software training and certification, and tech support to keep students connected. they check and submit assignments online – often communicate with teachers and each other through email, google meet, text and phone. our students regularly use google classroom – creating a “virtual classroom” so they can learn wherever they are. 



distance learning preparedness






using innovations like career mapping, goal setting, peer sharing, mentored internships, and resumé & mock job interview classes, city high students are well prepared for the their place in the world after high school. to facilitate success, they are supported by a dedicated post-high school planning team.



college & career planning






in addition to traditional areas of learning (like steam – science, technology, engineering, arts and math), students are exposed to life-skills, including financial literacy, independent study and teamwork and learn soft skills like discipline, patience, concentration, and listening to take with them, no matter what they do in life.
