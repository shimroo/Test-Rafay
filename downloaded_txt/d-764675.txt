retiree pay dates

benefits are paid on the last business day of each month. learn more about the current schedule of payment dates here.




  benefits are paid at the end of the month (last business day) for
  the current month’s benefits.


  first benefit payment


  if you have recently retired, you will usually receive your
  first allowance payment by direct deposit at the end of
  the month following the month you retire (for example, if you
  retire any time in march, you will receive your first payment on
  the last business day in april). also, due to processing time
  with your employer, it may be approximately 6-8 weeks before you
  receive your first retirement payment.
