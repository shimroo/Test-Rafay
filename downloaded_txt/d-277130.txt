my class web sites are no longer being 
            maintained.  they will remain online for students to visit 
            their digital webfolios.  it brings back nice memories of 
            second grade. many of these projects were originally hosted on the 
            comsewogue school district server.  when the school district 
            adopted a new web site all my files were moved and as a result none 
            of the links in my projects worked. the only way to salvage them was 
            to put them on my own server. since many of these collaborative 
            projects were on different servers it was very difficult to 
            recreate.  please accept my apologies.








you are my    
visitor.
