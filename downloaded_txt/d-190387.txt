20 years of falls parkdo you remember greenville, sc before falls park? did you know the waterfall used to be covered by a four-lane highway? our natives do, and those who transplanted before 2004, but for our newer residents and younger generation, it's always been here. as we celebrate 20 years of falls park on the reedy, we took a walk down memory lane, and across the liberty bridge, with mayor knox white.take a few minutes to enjoy the history, see a few before and after photos, and learn about the subsequent projects that may never have happened if falls park didn't exist.
