dr. rick 
                                        swartzburg, d.c.
										dr. swartzburg has spent the last 12 
                                        years trying to help his patients 
                                        overcome problems associated with the 
                                        back, neck, shoulders, and hips.  


in his research, he learned 
                                      that the root of many problems is very 
                                      simple. most of his patients were simply 
                                      not getting a good, restful night's sleep. 
                                      his years of research have led him to 
                                      consult for a company which creates memory 
                                      foam mattresses. the fruits of his labor 
                                      can be combined with the most used and 
										most reliable adjustable bed bases for a truly 
                                      unbeatable night's rest. we are proud to 
                                      offer adjustable beds and sets featuring
