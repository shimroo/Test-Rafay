 my transmission went out on me in louisville, found these guys on google and i was grateful i did. they beat all the competitor pricing and even we're willing to ship it to the shop for me. great place and a huge selection. it's pretty awe-inspiring just how big the place is. friendly people as well. it was all in a great help.

 great place to go for your engine parts, they have nearly everything and if they don't that can send you to who does.  we have done a ton of business and i would not hesitate one moment to send a customer of mine their way.﻿  midamerica truck parts & salvage
