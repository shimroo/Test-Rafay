      jonco's
    creations was created as a means to an end. i enjoy making graphics and came up with the
    idea of internet sign language flash cards as a means to help my son communicate
    easier.joshua has a tracheostomy and a speech disorder.then came along unique
    snowglobes,personalized keepsakes,water scenes and other varies graphics. i have built web pages    and
    am now taking a graphics course for that degree that says,"you are officially able to
    get paid for all you endeavors."also flyers,business cards,calendars and have been discussed. if
    there's anything that i have not stated here that you would like to be made, please don't
    hesitate to e-mail me with your suggestion. please look around our site and take joshua's
    logo to yours. hope you find something you like.
