welcome to the a2 collaboration 
 

 
 
the a2 collaboration @ mami is performing photo-nuclear reactions to investigate fundamental physics at the scale of nuclear and sub-nuclear dimensions. we plan, realize, run and analyze high precision experiments with high energetic real photons at mami in the photon-energy range between 40 mev and 1603 mev. a2 is organized as an international collaboration. working groups from several universities worldwide contribute to our challenge to produce new scientific results.
