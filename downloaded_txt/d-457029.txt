		the jordan family		
south african roots. world-wide acclaim.
gary and kathy jordan have been making world-class wines since 1993 on a farm with a history going back over 300 years. he’s a geologist, she’s an economist. gary’s parents, ted and sheelagh, bought the now 164-hectare stellenbosch property in 1982, and embarked on an extensive replanting programme, specializing in classic varieties suited to the different soils and slopes. unique by nature's design.
