christmas woes





well another christmas day has come and gone. i spent mine alone for the most part as hubby had to work his normal 12 hour shift and the only son left at home worked 12 hours last night and spent his holiday sleeping. i am sick - whether flu or a severe sinus infection i don’t know yet. i already have an appointment for wednesday so i will wait till then to find out. my nose is draining down my throat making me cough, my ears are hurting and ringing and my balance is iffy at best. i feel like crap. spent most of the day on the couch wrapped in a blanket and shivering. all in all, not a very good holiday to be sure.
lana is better i think. yesterday i made stew from the turkey remains and took her a pint. she called and told me she ate it all. today she called and asked if i had any more. my reply was yes, but i wasn’t bringing it - if she wanted it, she’d have to come get it - which she did. she has apologized profusely about being the cause of us missing our christmas eve ritual. i keep telling her it’s not about the day of the month we meet, it’s about the love and caring when we finally get together that matters. folks can’t help getting sick after all.
i was reading tina’s blog about her christmas morning aftermath and have to say that i have noticed that since my children are grown, i miss the hustle and bustle of preparing for big morning when the kids find what santa left under the tree. i miss the chaos, the laughter and excited squeals as they locate gift after gift they had asked for. it isn’t the same when the kids are grown. the excitement level is less, the anticipation is gone. grandkids help some, but it is definitely different than your own children.
merry christmas and happy 52 anniversary mom and dad, where ever you are. we love you and miss you today and every day.
