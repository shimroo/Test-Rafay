the pitt rivers museum wants to become a welcoming space to all where stories are shared by many voices. 
working collaboratively and creatively with staff, volunteers, and communities we will transform how our iconic collections are engaged with, both online and in the museum. in an increasingly disconnected world, we want to inspire empathy and deepen cross-cultural understanding.
