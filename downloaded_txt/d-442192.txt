welcome to

the romney marsh countryside partnership








the romney marsh countryside partnership (rmcp) was set up in june 1996, a sister project to the white cliffs countryside partnership.

the project aims to care for the special landscape and wildlife of the romney marsh and dungeness, and by the same token encourages people to enjoy and understand the countryside through guided walks, countryside events and childrenâ€™s activities.



we are a non-profit making organisation, managing various sites across the romney marsh with the help of our conservation volunteers and visiting corporate volunteer groups.Â  we always welcome new volunteers, so do get in touch if you would like to volunteer by emailing: rmcp@dover.gov.uk.

Â conserving wildlife across the romney marsh
the romney marsh countryside partnership is involved in managing various nature reserves across the romney marsh, from dungeness nnr to greatstone dunes and romney warren. we also get involved where we can in other projects across the marsh that help improve areas for wildlife.
we are currently creating ponds for wildlife across the romney marsh, and further afield into folkestone and dover, as a delivering body for natural englandâ€™s district level licensing scheme. if you are interested in creating or restoring a pond (minimum size 10m x 15m) on the marsh, or further afield, do get in touch with us at: rmcp@dover.gov.uk. or call steff on: 07864 608825 for more information.



the now isolated church of st thomas Ã  becket (fairfield) is typical of the many unusual sights to be seen on the romney marsh.



the old lighthouse at dungeness (which is open to the public).



we did our annual count of this gorgeous and scarce flower at romney warren. we counted 24! itâ€™s called deptford pink. this is one of only a few places in kent where you can see it.

lympne castle and the ruins of the roman portus lemanis (port lympne) sit on the escarpment overlooking the edge of the romney marsh. the royal military canal runs along the length of the marshâ€™s northern boundary.

the romney marsh
romney marsh is a sparsely populated wetland and shingle headland bounding the counties of kent and east sussex. it covers about 100 square miles and is so unique it has subsequently been referred to as the â€˜fifth continentâ€™.
