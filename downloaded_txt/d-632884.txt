ilala lodge hotel, victoria falls

the perfect location from which to explore africa’s adventure capital ilala lodge hotel is a family-run hotel that offers luxury and comfort in the heart of victoria falls, zimbabwe. nestled in attractive gardens, the well-appointed hotel is a mere eight-minute walk from victoria falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world.
the hotel is ideally located in the hustle and bustle of town, within walking distance of all historical sites, restaurants and activities in victoria falls. offering warm and welcoming true african hospitality, our friendly and attentive staff will ensure that your visit is perfect in every way.
the award-winning cassia restaurant at ilala lodge hotel is famous for its delicious gourmet cuisine and attracts guests worldwide. diners can see the spray and hear the sounds of victoria falls, locally known as the ‘smoke that thunders’, while they enjoy the al-fresco dining under the starry african skies that the cassia restaurant offers. wild animals, such as warthog and impala, often graze on the hotel lawns and entertain guests during mealtime.











located on the zimbabwean side of the mighty zambezi river, ilala lodge hotel is geographically the closest hotel to the magnificent victoria falls and is easily accessible to the town centre. explore the lush wilderness surrounding the town on a game drive, surf the rapids on a zambezi river white-water rafting expedition, get your heart racing as you bungee jump off the victoria falls bridge, or view the falls from the exhilarating angle of devil’s pools on the edge of the plunging water. you can also enjoy a legendary zimbabwean sunset from the comfort of the elegant ra-ikane river cruisers, part of the ilala lodge hotel group.
