welcome to stanford vascular & endovascular surgery
	    
    
























"welcome to stanford vascular and endovascular surgery. we are dedicated to the highest levels of patient care, professional education, and clinical and translational research."
jason t. lee, md
division chief of vascular surgery










the division works continually to improve quality of life for patients with vascular diseases. we are privileged to work with an outstanding team of faculty and community vascular specialists, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, radiologists, podiatrists, rehabilitation specialists, basic scientists, engineers and computer scientists. our ongoing collaborations have promoted remarkable academic and clinical productivity involving new and dramatically improved techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease, gaining the division international recognition as a vascular center of excellence.
the faculty is distinguished by expertise in many aspects of vascular disease management, but perhaps none more so than aortic aneurysm disease. stanford vascular surgeons are recognized around the world as leaders in aortic aneurysm treatment and research.
