looking for something?


even though the site has changed, we’ve kept most of our old material. champions and gurps gaming resources are still here. i know there are some broken image links (and links, period) and i’m working to restore them. please be patient, but if you think i’ve missed something, drop me a line at smactyre at gmail dot com. thanks!
don’t forget the totally massive list of superhero and supervillian names!
my law school outlines have also migrated over, too.
