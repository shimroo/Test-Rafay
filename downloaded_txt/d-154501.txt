serving our students and campus community
it is our privilege to serve and support you. 





























course schedule
the course schedule is published before advising and registration begin for each semester and summer session. it lists each class being offered, its time, location, instructor (if available), and its unique number—which students must know in order to register. the course schedule also lets you know when to register and pay tuition. it is updated with the latest changes, and shows if seats are available in each class.
current course schedule












academic calendar
the academic calendar is the main resource for important dates and deadlines for course registration, add/drop, financial aid, withdrawing, tuition due dates, and more.

university catalogs

additional university catalogs include undergraduate, graduate, law, and medical school.
