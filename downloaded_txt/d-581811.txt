welcome to the birchtree center for healthcare transformation
the birchtree center was founded in 2000 by two nurses with the idea of transforming the culture of healthcare using the principles of holistic health, therapeutic presence and person centered care.
central to our vision is compassionate and competent care for patients and authentic and respectful collaboration among healthcare providers.
these ideas have blossomed into a simple mantra: transforming healthcare with heart ! 
today the birchtree center is a team of talented and dedicated thought leaders, educators and practitioners from nursing, medicine and integrative healthcare. we use our decades of expertise and skills to envision and co-create with others a compassionate healthcare system that achieves its highest potential and vision for all people and our planet.
we invite you to explore our website and contact us to start the conversation.

"the profession needs direction, hope, and help in sustaining and rekindling its healing arts within the context of caring relationships. the birchtree center and its excellent work can make the difference for individual and system healing, facilitating transformation of health care and institutions."
jean watson, phd, rn, ahn-bc, faan
author and theorist: human caring science


“i heartily recommend the retreats and programs offered by the birchtree center. healthcare professionals have needs too, and their programs address these needs and raise the level of the practice for the nurse and the patient so both may experience healing.”
