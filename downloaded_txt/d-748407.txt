 innovation is in our dna


copan (collection and preservation for analysis) has been transforming pre-analytics since its founding in 1979—bringing a unique, collaborative approach to product development. copan invented flocked swabs in 2004, which opened the door for a new age of sample collection & transport and technology that serves the laboratory and medical community.
