want to see what the weather business was like in 
			the early 1940's? 
			many interesting images were found in the library of congress 
			archives and have been put together here.  
			the vast majority are of the weather bureau offices that were and to 
			a certain extent still are at reagan national airport in washington 
			d.c.  you can take a trip 
			back in time here.




			over
			120 photographs from ww 
			ii and before...many illustrate pieces of weather equipment. 

			the 
			afwa history office has sent us numerous cd's with lots of 
			historical information and images that are being cataloged here.  
			the first set to be stored is a 
			1st weather wing history from 1954 to 
			1968.  we also have, so far, a set of images that all have 
			aircraft in them.  many are from the
			55th, 56th and 58th weather 
			recon squadrons.  no info is available other than the image 
			so if you can provide some details, we will add that to the image.  the images have been shrunk down for the web but we have 
			the high quality images available.  if you would like any of 
			the images sent to you, please contact the
			webmaster. 


			thanks to the afwa history folks for giving us 
			a great deal of information during the reunion.  a partial listing has 
			been added with more to come soon.  they put together an "air 
			force weather professional reading list" on cd-rom that is now 
			available here for the first time.  these files are quite large 
			and will take some time to download.  all are in adobe pdf 
			format. click here for the latest.
			afwa complied a "heritage celebration" video that was previewed at 
			the omaha reunion banquet.  the video is available as a windows 
			media download 
			and as a real player download video.  
			also available as a streaming video.  
			you will need macromedia flash to view the streaming video.

afwa history office put together 
			picture postcards for table decorations at the banquet.  here 
			are the complete series of photos throughout the years. 
			see them here!
