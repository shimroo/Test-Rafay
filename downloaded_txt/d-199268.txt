foster miso

february 16, 2025 jah leave a comment



for those who are keeping track, calvin & hobbes are hopefully soon to be permanently homed together. bug(sy) is going to muttville on tuesday, where i know he’ll get the medical attention he needs in a few areas to make the rest of his hopefully long life wonderful for a new home where i know he’ll be so loved. all three of these dogs are extremely loveable and i feel very honored that shea and i could give them a good home for a spell. hoping these three are soon to be placed, we also recently took in a special needs dog that wasn’t thriving that well in a crate in the shelter. 
miso took a few days to warm up to us, but he’s going to be an amazing pet to someone after being abandoned like all these other dogs were. it’s very inspiring to have these dogs come from an environment that scares them and just a few days in a real home shows how they can thrive. there are so many dogs at hsnb and other shelters that could really use our attention. miso looks like a miniature german shepherd with the pointed ears.   i don’t mind being a rehab for dogs that fit into the pack we have at home.

it was nice to be back in the water after the boats were cleaned, as it had been a few weeks for me. besides the pictures above, i got some with jim looking like an angel in front of the sun’s corona also after coxswain tori pointed it out.

cuddle club with calvin and hobbes

february 15, 2025 jah leave a comment





yesterday calvin and hobbes were a hit at the benicia library.  there was a regularly-scheduled cuddle club event, which is a pet therapy program of hsnb that my friend carlene coury founded.  however this time the press was there!  
the news story mentions them in the first words of the main article on the front page of today’s vallejo times herald! despite “holding court” there, they were not photographed, so i’m including a picture of them, together with the article and the two pictures of some of the other dogs that were there. several people were interested in adopting calvin and hobbes together, so we’ll see. they were incredibly well-behaved with lots of people and children. everyone was surprised that they had never done anything like this before.
i was so busy answering questions that i didn’t even pull out my own camera.  in hindsight, i should have deputized shea to be the cameraman.  i so appreciate that he was gracious enough to join me.

foster miso’s first day

february 12, 2025 jah leave a comment






six dogs including the four fosters in the rental backyard are enjoying each other’s company and getting lots of exercise.  
with senior foster bugsy (who did so well adapting to our household) leaving on tuesday, we agreed to foster miso. miso looks like a miniature german shepherd, pointed ears and all.  he’s a young chihuahua mix, like calvin and hobbes, who needed some tlc.  he wasn’t doing too well in the shelter environment. of course the goal is to get every cat and dog at the shelter into permanent homes.  i’m glad while waiting for my house to be renovated shea and i can provide some sanctuary to a few dogs. miso had a heck of a fun time meeting and playing with the pack. i’m glad he and bugsy got to meet for a few days overlap.  they will all sleep well tonight.
hopefully the three remaining younger chihuahua mixes will be adopted out soon.  five of these six dogs are rescues from hsnb, including bonnie, who i adopted last year.  snoopy was also a stray, but he’s my special survivor from the fire 13 months ago.
