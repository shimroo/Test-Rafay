as the weather warms up all our thoughts turn to the 2018 racing season.  itâs time to get the boat put back together and get those ratings certificates revalidated.  irc, orci and orr have all undergone refinements that can have a significant impact on your handicap.  our team of designers follows the rule changes in detail and can quickly advise how these changes may impact you and what modifications may be worth considering for this season.
 
we offer a range of services to suit any budget. from a simple certificate review to identify potential sources of measurement error, to a complete performance versus handicap optimization program targeted to your specific race program and budget we are here to help.
 
contact us at info@farrdesign.com or +1 410 267 0780 to find out how we can help make 2018 your best season yet.
