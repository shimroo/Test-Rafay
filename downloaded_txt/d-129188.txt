basic steps in the research process






                    this list of steps is a guideline for you to use. not everyone will do these steps
                    in the same order and you may go back and forth between them.

                    click on the colored words to learn how to do that step.




                1. select
                    a general topic that interests you in some way.

                2. list key words
                to help you look up information about the topic.

                3. go to an encyclopedia, or other reference source, to 
get an overview of the topic.

                4. make source
                    cards for whatever sources you will use for information.

                5. using the general overview, begin to 
focus the topic into something you can cover well.

                6. write
                    a statement of purpose about the focused topic.

                7. brainstorm
                    questions about the focused topic.

                8. group questions
                under similar headings.

                9. add any new questions you can think of under those headings.

                10. repeat step 2, listing more key words from your newly focused topic and questions.

                11. make a 
                    list of possible sources that can answer your questions. identify the
                best sources to use.

                12. find the sources in
                the library, on the computer, etc. 
make a source card for each one you use.

                13. begin making
                    notecards. use your brain stormed questions to guide your note taking.

                14. change your statement of purpose into a draft
thesis statement.

                15. make an outline
                of your headings. if you are ready to print your outline, click

                16. refocus your 
thesis statement if necessary.

                17. write the body
                    of your paper from your notes.

                18. cite any necessary information with 
parenthetical citations.

introduction and 
conclusion.

                20. write your 
works cited (it is similar to a bibliography).

                21. create a 
                    title page.

                22. evaluate
