actuaries believe more transparency in the u.s. healthcare system would help bend the cost curve downward
society of actuaries' survey identifies effective ways to reduce cost trends and create a sustainable healthcare system
schaumburg, ill., june 29 -- with national healthcare spending expected to rise by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years, there needs to be a greater emphasis on finding ways to reduce healthcare cost trends. according to the findings from two recent surveys by the society of actuaries (soa), actuaries and consumers both believe that more transparency within the u.s. healthcare system is the key to bending the cost curve downward: actuaries believe there needs to be more transparency between doctors and patients, while consumers feel they could make more informed decisions if they had more information on medical procedures and options for care.

wellmark premium increase delayed by governor chet culver
governor chet culver is injecting himself in the middle of a dispute about wellmarkâs plan to raise the price of health insurance premiums by 18 percent, on average, for about 80,000 iowans.
culver has directed the state insurance commissioner to âstayâ the premium increase.  heâs calling for âa third party, independent actuaryâ to review the matter and determine whether the rate increases are justified.  rob schweers, a spokesman for wellmark, says his company doesnât object.
âwe intend to cooperate fully with the insurance commissioner in an independent, actuarial review of the data that supports our recent, individual rate increases in the individual, under 65 market,â schweers says. âand by individual, weâre talking about people who buy their own policy as opposed to people who have a group policy through their employer.â

new york times releases article on bruce schobel & aaa
the american academy of actuaries, the public face of a behind-the-scenes profession, is in disarray after quietly sacking its incoming president, then trying to conceal both his ouster and an unpleasant secret from his past.
the president-elect, bruce schobel, is one of americaâs foremost authorities on the social security system. he is also a onetime convicted felon who, according to court records, served time three decades ago for âassault with a dangerous weapon while demanding propertyâ in new jersey. few know this, though, because his record has been expunged.
mr. schobel has put many productive years between himself and his conviction. the matter would probably be entirely unknown if it had not surfaced in the professionâs long-running debate about actuarial accountability, and the way numbers bearing little resemblance to reality keep turning up at the scene of failed insurance companies, collapsed pension funds and states that cannot balance their budgets.

statement made by bruce schobel regarding aaa
statement by bruce schobel on the actuarial outpost
during the past month, the board of the american academy of actuaries has engaged in egregious and unprecedented behavior that has interfered with and prevented me from continuing my good work as a leader of the actuarial profession and has harmed me personally. because negotiations have proven to be fruitless, i have found it necessary to file suit against the academy in the united states district court in washington, dc. i am confident that the court will remedy this bad situation and provide justice. i am eager to continue performing my duties as president-elect and a director of the academy and look forward to becoming president on october 26.

american academy of actuaries discuss health care reform
the american academy of actuaries is calling on all health care reform stakeholders to revisit cost issues considering recent reports that have questioned the sustainability of new legislation.
"especially given the congressional budget office's (cbo) most recent estimates, all stakeholders must engage in a new dialogue to establish mutual understanding as to what will lead to real and quantifiable health cost savings," said al bingham, jr., the american academy of actuaries vice president for health issues.
bingham said the actuaries believe that a new dialogue, and subsequent legislation, must strive for a cost-savings program that is achievable, credible and "score-able."
"unless health care spending is controlled, health reforms to reduce the number of uninsured will not achieve their goals," bingham said. "if health spending continues to grow at the projected pace, health insurance premiums will continue to increase as well. thus efforts to rein in health insurance premiums will be negated if rising health spending drives premiums to their original levels within a few years and even higher thereafter."

study supports health benefits of smoking ban
hospital admissions fall 17% after scottish law enacted; businesses balk at restrictions

by jeremy singer-vine
when scotland prohibited smoking in enclosed public areas and workplaces after march 2006, researchers found:

a 14% reduction in admissions for acute coronary syndrome among smokers.
a 19% reduction among former smokers.
a 21% reduction among people who had never smoked.
source: new england journal of medicine
a new study from scotland provides what public-health experts in the u.s. say is the strongest evidence yet that public bans on smoking -- being debated in several locales -- improve health by reducing exposure to secondhand smoke.
according to the study, which appears in thursday's edition of the new england journal of medicine, hospital admissions for heart attacks and acute coronary problems fell 17% overall, and even more for nonsmokers, in the year after scotland banned smoking in public places.
"there has long been a claim from smokers that they are affecting their own bodies, and why should the public care?" said david cohen, director of cardiovascular research at saint luke's mid america heart institute in kansas city, mo., who wasn't involved in the study. "this shows that the public should absolutely care ... that is an incredibly powerful finding."

longevity insurance pays people for living a long life
bellevue-based symetra life insurance company recently announced the launch of a new product to help protect retirees from outliving their savings. the symetra freedom income annuity1 functions as âlongevity insurance.â  it enables clients to use a small portion of current savings to buy guaranteed income for their later years of retirement, providing financial security for when they need it most. 
âit now only costs you $10,000 to purchase a stream of income you cannot outlive,â says rich lindsay, senior vice president of symetraâs life and annuities division. âthatâs how cost-effective longevity insurance can be. with symetra freedom income you get more guaranteed income down the road for less money up front.â
for example, if a client wants $2,500 a month for life and purchases a symetra immediate single premium income annuity at age 85, the premium would cost about $185,000 at todayâs rates.3 however, if a 65 year old client purchased the same monthly income to begin at age 85 through symetra freedom income, the premium would cost around $31,000.

northern illinois university (niu) adds actuarial science degree
students with math aptitude who'd like to start their careers at $55,000 should explore niu's new bachelor's degree program in actuarial science.
professor rama lingham, director of the math department's statistics division, says job prospects are excellent, especially in this area.
