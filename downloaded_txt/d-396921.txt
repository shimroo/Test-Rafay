no riot

not the ones that did not happen in regina or saskatoon, but rather the reunion that will not take place now.kevin dubrow, lead singer for the 1980s heavy metal band quiet riot was found dead in a las vegas home. he was 52.

outsourcing at its finest

students deliver election message door-to-door.... for the ndp.cfs is so clever they forgot to mention that they are doing work on the missing person in the ontario election - howard hampton.college and university students delivered the federation’s report card on the main political parties’ platforms and information about the students for electoral reform campaign door-to-door in the toronto centre, trinity-spadina, and york west ridings. the ontario election 2007 political party report card gives each major party a letter grade on six different categories: tuition fees, ancillary fees, student debt, post-secondary education funding, quality of education, and system design.it is interesting when a group writes a portion of a party platform and then provides a grade for said writing. not sure that passes the fall down laughing test in most circles. however, in the world of the cfs where everything is a "left-off" and you are either with us or against us, they believe so.funny they actually have no opinion on the electoral system. they must have spent all their collective energy thinking of the roll-back fees to pre-mcguinty levels. take a bow sam walton, you have inspired the cfs.

spare a sandwich?

 wow. i am not sure what is more amazing.the fact that the woman - isabelle caro - in this picture is only 27! or, the fashion industry actually cares about the underweight models they force into insane roaster dresses.the model - of course - is an anorexic who weighs just 31 kilos (4 stone, 12lb - love the british!), has been displayed on milan billboards as the city celebrates its fashion week.caro indicates that her illness is a result of a rough childhood and she goes on to say that she has hidden herself - not hard to do - and covered myself - with floss - for too long. now she wants to show herself freakishly - i mean fearlessly - even though she knows that her body arouses repugnance.

dirty degrees done dirt cheap

 i really need to go back to school.robert j. oxoby, an associate professor at the university of calgary in the economics department, has written the dream flobee paper.a preview:among musicologists, researchers of popular culture, and rock and roll lovers of all ages there exists a common debate. that is, with respect to the rock band ac/dc, who is the better vocalist: bon scott or brian johnson? the band’s original vocalist, scott, performed on seven of the band’s albums (excluding live albums and compilations), passing away in 1980. brian johnson joined the band in 1980, serving as vocalist on nine albums (excluding live albums and compilations). since 1980, there has been near constant contention regarding who was the better singer.

space constraint

this ad in manhattan is causing a stir with some - read the catholic group. this group forgets about the constitution.clearly, manhattan storage is a liberal group and doesn't hide their politics.

basebrawl

the final score - 9 to 2 for yankees - was irrelevant. josh towers adhered to the code. he plunked alex rodriguez early in the game to pay the loser back for his classless actions in toronto earlier this summer. towers did what any self-respecting ball player would do and hit a-rod.towers is a horrible pitcher, however, he has earned new respect because he stood up for the code in baseball. rodriguez will likely chase down barry bonds homerun record and then baseball will have two zeros at the ultimate record. anyone who yells at other players on routine fly balls is a dud.500 homers, hundreds of millions of dollars and no friends. such is the life of alex rodriguez.
