about us â¦



















in a word, barrett enclosures is all about innovation. with five patents in our portfolio we continue to lead the industry with innovative structures, materials, and manufacturing processes to produce the best of the best. we understand that marine applications face extreme conditions rarely seen land-side.â â so, when industry standard parts prove unsuitable, we pioneer our own. where structures call for extra support we engineer it from the beginning.â â boats are full of compromises - we say âbs to compromisesâ - our motto is (eso) elegance, suitability & operability.


 elegance â blend with the design of the boat to ensure that our work appears as integrated (âinvisibleâ) as possible.
 suitability â engineer with safeguards to ensure structural integrity and adequacy in all elements of performance.
 operability â take the mindset of an owner to ensure that our product is a pleasure to operate and accessible to maintain.


the result is design, operation, and materials that impress. we are not bashful - ask our customers how much they appreciate and enjoy our products. we will handle your project from start to finish to ensure the highest level of quality.

sincerely,
john barrett â â  &â â â â shane leazer

from the early age of 5 john recalls having a great interest in lines, angles and shapes. his favorite hobbies included spiro-graphs, string art, model airplanes and brain teasing puzzles. at the age of 18, john joined the marine canvas world and spent his first 6 years as an apprentice at two seattle area canvas shops learning basic canvas skills. during that time john soon discovered this was a field that had not advanced in fifty years and needed change. the techniques of yesteryear would soon prove to be insufficient as the motor yacht industry continued to grow. being a part of the next generation of canvas men to come, john prepared himself for the challenge.

johnâs first endeavor started âbarrett boating canvasâ in 1989.â â this entrepreneurialâ â outlet enabled johnâs creative side to expand as he continued to perfect his fit and finishing techniques. john created a division within his company known as "bimini world" where he introduced the truss bow frame to the region along with a line of heavy duty fittings for larger tops.â â he demanded his entire crew school in computer aided drafting (cad) so they would have the ability to engineer fine and very complex bimini tops for shops all across north america, including some of his largest local competitors. he had become a problem solver for many shops across the country and became recognized as a valuable leader in the industry.â 

on several occasions john has won outstanding achievement awards, the highest honor in our field. on more than one occasion, the annual international marine fabricators convention has invited him to speak and provide demonstrations on design concerns, fabrication techniques and new products he pioneered.â â his proudest achievement to date would be the barrett bonded window system, the finest marine enclosure window available, often used by naval architects in their plans.â â john racked up the airline miles as demand for his window product came from all parts of the world. he has built enclosures in singapore for the asian boat show and for private yacht owners in osaka, japan as well as partnering with new dealers on the east coast.

john is currently the holder of 5 u.s. patents and has many more ideas in the works.â â allow john to exceed your expectations while he offers up innovative ideas and finishes with a product that is unparalleled.


about johnâ¦













you could say that shane has been in the canvas business his whole life. as a second generation canvasman he started at a very early age. his father owned and operated a canvas shop in montana, where shane developed a solid background of working with fabrics over a wide range of applications.â 

shane moved to seattle in 1993 to follow his sweetheart who was attending college at seattle pacific university. that's when he formed a relationship with barrett enclosures and worked side by side in the field with john each day.â â this is where he perfected the art of marine canvas and chose to make a career out of it.

after 16 years shane as the lead man, john made him an equal partner. his honesty, integrity, and dedication along with his christian background are such valuable assets to the company. shane is truly a perfectionist and loves to create products that not only look great but function the way they should. he truly loves the challenges each day presents and looks forward to the many years to come.
