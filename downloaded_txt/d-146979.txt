we regret...

that we were unsuccessful at finding the time to maintain this website
  and, later, attempt to bring it up-to-date. we continue to leave it online
  and dormant because it may still offer a useful collection of historical
  and other reference  information about orange county, california
  (such as the historical timeline and orange county map).
