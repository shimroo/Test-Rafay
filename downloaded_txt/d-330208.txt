buying a home
now is a great time to buy a home in the metro atlanta area! the first step would be to speak with a loan officer to determine how much you can afford to spend. there are many reputable lenders in the area, and an experienced realtor can put you in touch with a loan officer, if you havenât already found someone to assist with your loan. after getting prequalified, you should select an experienced realtor that can help you find the right home, in the right area, negotiate the best price and accomplish that within the parameters of your time frame.  after placing the home under contract, itâs important that you have the home inspected while still within your due diligence period. using an ashi certified(american society of home inspectors) home inspector is recommended, as they have constant training to stay up to date on industry trends and changes to local building codes.  again, your realtor should be able to assist you in finding a highly reputable ashi certified inspector with years of experience.  once the inspection is complete, your realtor will assist you in negotiating needed repairs to the home youâre purchasing.  after the inspection process is completed, and your loan is approved, you close on your scheduled date.  and thatâs all there is to it!
                
selling a home
selling a home without the assistance of a realtors can potentially save thousands of dollars in real estate commissions. there is, however, a reason that most home sellers use a realtor to assist them with their transaction. it is extremely important that you find an agent with years of experience in the industry, as well as one thatâs familiar with your market area.  an effective listing agent will aggressively market your home to ensure that your receive good foot traffic through your home. they will contact you regularly with updates on the market.  they will ensure that potential purchasers are prequalified, prior to allowing them to set up an appointment to see your home.  most importantly, they will get your home under contract in the shortest time possible, at the best price possible, with the least inconvenience to you.  make sure you interview at least 3 agents before you list your home, and select the agent youâre most compatible with.  give them 6 months to sell your home, and if it hasnât happened in that timeframe, you can make the decision to continue to work with them or change to someone you feel will do a better job for you.
