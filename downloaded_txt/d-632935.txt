windows alive

sometimes potemkin had the right idea... we have a thing called windows alive. art from local artists is placed in the store front windows of the old yakima mall. it makes things look nicer and gives the artists some exposure. i got pictures of one artist and her stunning fabric art. now i need to figure out how to make those pictures appear.

endorsement:

the yakima gulag has been feeling the bern. 
yes, we endorse senator bernie sanders for president of the united states of america.
single payer health care, free college, no more stupid wars, and the jewish guy is far less of a zionist than anyone else running.
we personally attended two of his rallies. key arena in seattle, and his historic visit to the yakima gulag.
only 3 presidential candidates ever have visited the yakima gulag.
teddy roosevelt
george w. bush
and senator bernie sanders.
if i were a clinton supporter (..and i really am not...)
this really would have turned me. he is a good speaker. he is right on damn near all my issues. with sanders i don't feel the need to hold my nose as i mark my ballot. i feel good wearing his button.
i've donated to his campaign and i am an actual delegate.
it's also likelier he'd beat trump. he'd even beat kasich.
bernie just has to be the democratic party's nominee!

karadzic gets 40 years:

karadzic got a guilty verdict and a sentance of 40 years. after all this time it seems so anti-climatic. 
i've been busy on local matters of importance. i haven't had time to fully process all this.

another mass grave revealed:



ms. subasic often rode the same bus as i did. she's a nice lady.
i am glad someone had the decency and conscience to reveal where this grave was.
repentance does mean something.

a mass grave is revealed:




blogger is not easy to use on my device. this is part of why i spend so much less time here. i had the page go totally black. 
anyway, munira subasic was practically a neighbor. we often rode the same bus. i'm glad the man revealed the grave to her.
repentance is a good thing. i'd rather see it than revenge.

serbia also has done a lot to help the refugees from syria. it's commendable because serbia is not a wealthy country.
