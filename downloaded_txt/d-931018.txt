5 cell phone safety tips worth following in your life

 january 22, 2023march 2, 2023  lori



cell phones have become an integral part of our lives. they are no longer just a communication tool but an essential device for our daily routine as well. from making calls to browsing the internet, from sending texts to checking emails, we rely on our cell phones for various purposes. however, it is crucial to use our cell phones safely to avoid any negative consequences. highlighted below are five cell phone safety tips that are worth following in your life.
1. protect your personal information
your cell phone contains a lot of personal information, including your photos, contacts and messages. it is essential to protect this information from unauthorized access. to make sure your data is kept secure, you should set up a strong password or pin code. avoid using simple passwords, such as “1234” or your birth date, as they are easy to guess. instead, use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to create a strong password. you can also use biometric authentication, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scan, to unlock your phone.
another way to protect your personal information is to be cautious about the apps you download. only download apps from trusted sources like the apple app store or the google play store. carefully read the reviews and ratings of the apps prior to downloading anyone of them. avoid downloading apps that ask for unnecessary permissions, such as access to your photos or contacts.
2. do not use your phone while you are driving
distracted driving is a leading cause of accidents on the road, and texting while driving is one of the most dangerous forms of distraction. when you are driving, put your phone away and focus on the road. if you must use your phone, pull over to a safe location first. many jurisdictions have laws prohibiting texting or talking on the phone while driving, and violators can face hefty fines and even jail time. as such, using your phone while driving is not only dangerous but also illegal in many countries.
according to a recent study by the national safety council, using your phone while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. to avoid any accidents, it is crucial to avoid using your phone while driving. if you need to use your phone, pull over to a safe location first.
there are also many apps available that can help you to avoid using your phone while driving. these apps can automatically silence notifications, send automated replies to text messages, and even block incoming calls. included among some of the most popular apps are safedrive, lifesaver and drivesafe mode.
3. move with caution and avoid phishing scams
phishing scams are a common way for cybercriminals to steal your personal information. they usually come in the form of an email or text message that appears to be from a trusted source, such as your bank or a popular retailer. the message may ask you to click on a link or provide your personal information, such as your login credentials or credit card number.
to avoid falling for phishing scams, be cautious of any unsolicited messages that ask for your personal information. never click on links from unknown sources or provide your personal information unless you are sure that the request is legitimate. you can also use anti-phishing software to protect yourself from phishing attacks.
4. safeguard your eyes against blue light
blue light emitted from cell phones can cause eye strain, headaches, and disrupt your sleep cycle. to protect your eyes from blue light, you can use the “night shift” feature on your phone. this feature reduces the blue light emitted from your phone and makes the screen warmer, which is easier on your eyes.
another way to protect your eyes is to reduce the amount of time you spend on your phone. take frequent breaks and look away from your phone every 20 minutes to avoid eye strain. you can also use blue light filtering glasses, which block blue light from reaching your eyes.
5. practice digital hygiene
digital hygiene refers to the habits and practices that we follow to keep our digital devices secure. to practice digital hygiene, you should keep your phone’s software up to date. updates often contain security patches that protect your phone from vulnerabilities and malware.
you should also avoid connecting to unsecured wi-fi networks. public wi-fi networks are often unsecured, which means that hackers can intercept your internet traffic and steal your personal information.
in conclusion, cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is essential to use them safely. from communicating with friends and family to browsing the internet, listening to music, and watching movies, cell phones offer convenience and endless possibilities. however, with all these advantages comes the need for caution and safety measures.
