				through your “power of the pride” you managed to connect, and unite, every single person in our audience of 450.  one of the most difficult things to achieve is a common platform in a very diverse audience:  you held them in the palm of your hand –  executives, middle managers, call centre staff  – every single one of them hanging of every word! it was incredible!  the message of team work and collaboration hit home – and i can’t describe the change in energy and in attitude after the session.
