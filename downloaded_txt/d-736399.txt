(pa came in second.) the shop grew, family grew, slowed down my rifle building and competition shooting. now after all these years, i have no time to build & very little time to shoot. did join a living history group called the patuxents and for 9 years, we organized and put on the fort frederick market fair in maryland. to date, am still doing gunsmithing in the same store, same place, and found out that our store qualified for the 3rd largest black powder shop in pa. i really enjoy instructing customers on how to build them and shoot them, for hunting or competition.
