				the chilled seafood sampler was amazing and the atmosphere was equally as good. best part about it was the service we received from katelyn.  so helpful and friendly she really made our dinner.read moreread less

				so glad we chose this place! sat outside w/ a nice water view & had top notch service from hunter.  the complimentary sourdough bread was warm & delicious & served with a freshly prepared herbed olive oil. our favorite was the chilled seafood sampler!  all 5 items were amazing & we would definitely order it again.  highly recommend this place & ask for hunter if you have high standards of service!read moreread less

				started and ended with the freshly shucked virginia sourced oysters and were they good!! had 2 1/2 dozen in total which more than paid for the buffet priced at $39. also had the flavorful peel your own shrimp which were large and nicely seasoned. deviled eggs were ok but had a weird taste to them, while the smoked salmon was rather bland! fruit was fresh and sweet but the sushi was depleted and awaiting replenishing. bottom line--good brunch experience but a long drive (45 minutes) might discourage us from returning!read moreread less

				wow! this place was amazing! went for happy hour and ordered off supper club menu. had a filet wrapped in bacon with salad, mashed potatoes and dessert. bread was delicious as well. can’t beat the price and the service was fantastic!!read moreread less

				food and service was really good, along with a beautiful outdoor table view! we had the firecracker tuna roll to start, and that was extremely good, highly recommend. then had the red snapper piccata (5 stars, really good) and the honey siracha mahi mahi, it was good but not as great as the snapper!read moreread less
