                  more info 









         winter riding on fat bikes! a fat bike is ideal for winter riding because its wide tires provide significantly more traction on snow and ice compared to regular bike tires,  allowing for better stability and control on slippery surfaces, making it possible to ride through deep snow and challenging terrain where  other bikes would struggle to maintain grip.see our fat bikes here
