why choose trinity?



as i started making plans for college, i thought i had everything figured out. slowly but surely, god began showing me my plan was not his plan. a friend suggested that i apply to trinity, and that is when everything started to fall into place. i am grateful that my plans fell apart so that god's plans could fall into place. there is no other college i would rather be at. i love the family atmosphere and the life-long friendships that i have made.

madison may




god used key people at trinity to inspire me to grow into all he was calling me to.  i was surrounded by professors and leaders who modeled humility and wisdom and who wanted to lead me into these same qualities. these relationships played an irreplaceable role in developing me into the person i am today.

non profit management degree, class of 2015




tbc has great leaders with great values! they give their best to their students who will change the world!

ernie cabrera




as an older student, it was quite a decision to go back to college at the age of 65. everyone from the staff to the students were willing to help me get back in the groove of being a student(including using a computer lol). this is a caring and loving place to get your degree! you won’t regret it!

ann heavener
class of 2017




my favorite thing about coming to trinity is how encouraging everyone is; the staff and even the students have helped me find new motivation

morgan moore
youth ministry major




i love tbc because it's where god chose to place me to increase my knowledge of him and to become better equipped to teach the gospel.

joseph carnley
pastoral theology major




tbc has prepared me for my future in education by giving me experienced professors and numerous opportunities to do hands-on learning.

angela dennard
elementary education




coming here has expanded my horizons and i have come to a better understanding of the gospel and what it means for the world.

kaitlyn petteway
interdisciplinary studies




one thing i have learned at tbc is the value of relationships. how to build them, how to pour into them, and allow them to pour into me. i never expected the faculty and staff at my college to become my friends!

rachel uithoven
missions




i learned how to be who i am but put some polish on it; how to be cross-cultural and be to all men what they need.  the first class that totally blew my mind was hermeneutics. tbc has given me confidence in the word of god! i look at the text so differently now! it has blessed my ministry.

ardel jones
pastoral theology




trinity helped me get out of my comfort zone.  i met a lot of people and i made a lot of close friends.  i learned that it is important to enjoy college even though there is a lot that needs to get done.  it goes by so fast!

anna wilkerson
elementary education




a lot of athletes can be nervous about being outspoken about their faith.  but i wasn’t and coach jones saw that in me so i was able to get really involved in leading the team in prayer and in chapels before games.  it was crazy to me that i could prep for a game and prep for a sermon at the same time!

marquel perry
christian counseling




i really liked my education at tbc because we were in a classroom for several months, slowly taking on more subjects until i had the whole class on my own.

alejandra baromeo
elementary education




of course, grades are important!  but you need to make sure you get involved!  get to know people, and be sure you spend time with god. you want to surround yourself with friends who have the same values as you, that are going to push you to succeed and not slack off!

mara lynn johnson




when moving to a new place where you aren’t around your family who check in and make sure you’re doing the right things, you have to make your faith your own.   my personal walk was strengthened when i moved.  i had the choice about going to church on sunday or choosing to serve, to get out of my comfort zone like that.  i knew i wanted good friends and influences.  i think god allowed those friends to come around me and hopefully i’ve been that friend to other people.

morgan houghton
interdisciplinary studies




i was looking at a couple of big colleges but a friend encouraged me to visit tbc.  once i actually got here and looked around i realized that it would be a lot more beneficial to me to have a smaller pond – somewhere where i could get involved and have more opportunities.  i felt like there was a lot more opportunity at trinity to actually meet people.  i fell in love with it when i got here.
