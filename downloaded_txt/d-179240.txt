note that while i keep an ongoing log of things here, my main table tennis
website is now www.tabletenniscoaching.com,
where i have a weekly blog
that goes up on mondays. 
in 2018 i was awarded the lifetime achievement award by usa table
tennis. i had already been inducted into the usatt hall of fame in
2003. 
in 2014 i was elected (for the second time) to the usatt board of directors. i was also chair of the usatt coaching
committee from march, 2017 to march, 2019, as well as a four-year term in the
1990s. however, i chose not to run for re-election, so my term ended in
march, 2019. i also decided to step down as chair of the coaching committee -
it's someone else's turn! - though i agreed to stay on as a member. 

 check out my weekly table
tennis blog, which goes up every monday by 1pm. (from 2011-mid-2018 it
 was a daily, mon-fri.) tabletenniscoaching.com
 is now my main table tennis website - come visit. often. 
the
daily quarterly, a satirical website (similar to the onion) did a hilarious
"news story" on oct. 16, 2011, about brad pitt starring as me in a
film adaptation of my book, "table tennis tales & techniques." i
blogged about this on oct.
17 and oct. 18.
many people believed it to be true, including the part where i was paid $3.5
million for the film rights. here's part
1, and here's part
2. 

see the ittf
news item on the ittf coaching seminar i ran at the maryland table tennis
center in april, 2011. they even ran my picture! it's also featured
in the  may/june usatt magazine, along with my article "changing bad
technique." (the cary cup open coverage has an extensive passage about my
winning the hardbat event, though i was mostly there to coach. there's also an
ad for mdttc training camps, so i'm all over this issue.) i expect to run
another circa april, 2011. if interested, email
me. 

i'm a table tennis player/coach/writer/organizer, but i'm also a science fiction & fantasy 
writer. my science fiction & fantasy page can be found
here.
the international table tennis federation recently named the first two ittf
certified coaches in the u.s. - and i'm one of them! (the other is donn olsen.)
see the article
on their home page. i was also named one of the initial 11 ittf course
conductors - see article
- which qualified me to teach and certify ittf coaches in the u.s.  i'll probably run a coaching seminar for
other usa coaches in spring, 2011.  
from sept. 4-12, 2010, i was at the international table tennis association
coaching seminar in colorado springs along with many of the top usa coaches.
it's the first time the ittf has run such a seminar in the u.s. i'm now
certified as an ittf course conductor. see article.  
i was featured on tabletennis.com.  
the washington post  did a
feature 
article and
video on the elite junior training at club joola 
when i was coaching there. i'm interviewed several 
times. the video is about 2 min 30 sec. also featured on the video are marcus 
jackson, amaresh sahu, peter li, and tong tong gong, all ranked at or near the 
top of their age group in the u.s. 
in 2009, my third table tennis book came out, "table 
tennis tales & techniques." it's a compilation of my best work over the past 
30 years, including lots of interesting (and humorous) stories and many coaching 
articles. it's packed with photos. 
read the 
review by tim boggan!
i recently finalized my science fiction novel, "campaign 2100: game of
scorpions." (it covers the election for president of earth in the year 
2100, and features a third-party moderate challenge. one of the four main 
characters is a table tennis player, and there are three table tennis scenes.) it's
117,000 words, or 596 pages double spaced. i also write 
science fiction and fantasy short stories - i've sold 196, including 43 resales, and
15 "twitter" stories (140 characters or less, about 25 
words). see my
            fantasy & science 
			fiction page.

my article "the table 
tennis fantasy tour" is up at fantasy magazine! feel free to comment. 


i was interviewed online by community fridays. the 
interviewer, emma larkins, asked for the interview after one of the panels i was 
on at the capclave sf convention. 














at 
the usa nationals in las vegas, in december, 2007, i was caught off guard at the 
hall of fame banquet when they announced i had won the president's award for 
service to the sport of table tennis. (see below for some other plaques in my 
"growing" collection!) 
as the editor of usa table tennis magazine, i did 71 issues, through the march/april 2007 issue. (usa table tennis has gone through a lot of
editors 
over the years.) here's the
usatt news 
item on my resigning as editor for twelve years of usa table tennis magazine 
after the march/april 2007 issue. i'm also the founder  of the usa 
table tennis  league. 
i now have 2326 published articles in
203 different publications, including 2016 on 
table tennis. many of these articles are linked online. 
you might have read my book, table
tennis: steps to success. over 30,000 copies were sold. it has been translated into chinese, korean, indonesian, 
 
malaysian and hebrew, 
and there are more translations planned. i  did an update in 2007 for a reprint.  see
info page for ordering 
english version.
my first book was instructor's guide to table tennis, the official 
coaching manual for usa table tennis. 
i have a master's degree in journalism, and a bachelor's degree in math, 
with concentrations in computer science and chemistry (all from university of 
maryland).  i'm a member of the following organizations: usa 
table tennis,
usa table 
tennis hall of fame, maryland table tennis 
center, classic table tennis association,
science fiction writers of america,
the writers center,
critters, u.s. tennis association,
quince orchard tennis club, and
american mensa. 
in the july/august, 2005 usa table tennis magazine, i 
had a feature article i co-wrote with cheng yinghua, "the 
secrets of chinese table tennis ... and what the rest of the world needs to do 
to catch up." (this was also

translated and published in slovenian!) 
in october of 2004 i  created a celebrities playing table tennis page - just what this world needs! 
hundreds of photos of celebrities playing our favorite sport! it's been 
averaging 15,000 (that's not a misprint!) downloads per day! many 
"celebrity" web 
pages and blogs discovered it and linked to it. 



(click
on plaque for larger version.)






in december, 2003, i was inducted into the usatt
hall of fame.  (i'd missed it by one vote
the previous two years.) here's the notice
of my induction,  the profile
of me by tim boggan, and the

online video of my induction - go to minute 9, then 13:50). i was inducted as a "contributor." (i'm the
youngest person every inducted as a contributor.) two
players were also inducted - eric boggan and david zhuang, and marty
reisman received the lifetime achievement award. usatt has been around since
1933, and there are currently 109 members of the hall of fame. here's a picture of me
with my parents at the induction ceremonies, and one of my parents
talking with usatt president sheri pittman. 

i was the 2007
usa
table tennis developmental coach of the year. after being nominated three
times in past years but never winning, it was a pleasant surprise. i'm a usatt 
certified national coach, the highest level of certification. 
 i was an editor for a magazine that covered quality
in industry ("the quality observer," 8 issues, a color glossy), and a computer programmer for one year before
coming back to table tennis. 

from 1991 until 1998, i was the director and a  regular (sometimes 
full-time) coach at the maryland table tennis center in
gaithersburg, maryland, usa. (i only coach there part-time now, plus some
organizational work.) go there to find info on training camps and
tournaments, most of which i help out on.  mdttc players dominated the 
junior olympics and junior nationals from 1991 to 2003, winning over half the 
gold medals and the most total medals for 13 straight years, but the last two 
years many of our players have spent the summer training in china or other 
places, so few have gone. we expect to be back at full force at the 2006 junior 
olympics/junior nationals, when they are held in norfolk, va, which is driving 
distance for a change. 
i 
was the director of the usatt league 
which i founded in september, 2003. as of sept. 1, 2009, over 9281 players had 
played  160,011 league matches in 268 leagues in 47 states and dc. 
here's
a listing of u.s.
hardbat champions - i've won 18 u.s. national titles at the u.s. open and nationals
(15 in hardbat, but i normally use sponge).
check out the u.s. open and nationals doubles listings! however, my main task at
the open and nationals is online and magazine coverage.  i'm 
semi-retired from tournaments now. 
some web pages i maintain: 

my complete published works 
  - 22 books and 2326 published articles in 203 different publications, many of them linked online.
tabletenniscoaching.com,
      your worldwide center for (duh) table tennis coaching!
usatt
      leaders - all usatt ceos, executive directors, presidents, board
      chairs, and editors since usatt began in 1933.
my 
    celebrities playing table tennis page - 1407 photos of 819 celebrities. 
    this page used to get about 15,000 downloads per day for a few years! i generally update it around
      the first of each month. 
timboggantabletennis.com,
      where you can find tim's history of usa table tennis books.
my political cartoons page 
    - i created all of these. can you tell what i think of the bush 
    administration?
my table tennis book collection 
  - over 330 books! i only actively collect books in english. 
my table tennis clip
    art collection  - you may use any of these. 
my favorite quotes page
my science
    fiction/fantasy page - i've sold 117 sf&f stories; some of the best 
	are online. my name was on the cover of 14 magazines, and several were "feature"
      stories. 

 left: coaching the maryland team at the 2000 junior olympics/junior
nationals in orlando, florida. for 13 consecutive years (1991-2003), we won over 
half the gold medals and more total medals than any other state. 
i have a long history of using weird objects as a racket, from a clipboard
to just about anything else. it's just for fun,
but yes, i once did beat someone with an ice cube as a racket. i also beat 
a news reporter using his running mini-tape recorder as a racket, giving taped 
commentary throughout! 
here's
how i got started - 
blame it on marty reisman! i also do local exhibitions. see my "cartoon"
on the last presidential election! can you name all ten people?
a now ... my "table tennis resume."
