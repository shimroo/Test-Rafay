                                          					if it wasn’t for athletics and mt. sac, i don’t know where i would be. i wouldn’t
                                          be in the position i am now. i am very fortunate to have this village and this family
                                          here.

                                          					the community and support here is a blessing. meeting others that walked the
                                          path before me helped me grasp that it is possible no matter where you come from or
                                          past mistakes. success can be achieved.

                                          					being a first-time graduate student means that i am setting the bar for my children.
                                          college was never the plan for me growing up.

                                          					building community has been my favorite part of finishing my degree. some of
                                          my favorite things were the long hours of studying, reading, and putting together
                                          presentations. i found great joy in the process of labor because at mt. sac i saw
                                          the fruits of that labor immediately.
