jay has lived in san francisco since 1979. he worked for ibm for 15 years, purchased a victorian in 1988, and lovingly restored it over the years to its original grandeur. jay started the victorian home walk in 1996, after being downsized from ibm, in order to share his enthusiasm and knowledge of victorian homes.as a resident of san francisco, i have a great passion for our city's trademark architecture, victorians. the streets in our best victorian neighborhoods are too narrow for tour buses, and as a result most visitors miss these local treasures. i created victorian home walk to give people a chance to appreciate the victorians the way san francisco natives do, and to offer the seasoned traveler a tour "off the beaten path.” i am an active member of the san francisco travel bureau, san francisco tour guide guild, iglta, the victorian alliance, and san francisco architectural heritage” (jay).

reviews

 

the following are a select few reviews picked over the last two decades of our remarkable tour. in addition, checkout our reviews on google,  trip advisor and yelp!“great experience on our private tour”just wanted to thank you for such a great experience on our private tour. my 14 year old granddaughter and my 70 year old husband both enjoyed the history shared, architecture explained, and beautiful gardens observed on our tour last saturday, june 19, 2021. we all felt this private tour with your ability to personalize the information was one of the highlights of our trip.“private tours are best”this tour was a great way to learn some of san francisco's history.jay was very friendly and a great storyteller. i was a little hesitant about this tour only being available for small private groups, but that is absolutely the best way for this tour to be done.it allowed for great conversation and personalization based on our questions.“perfect birthday celebration”had a lovely private tour with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. it was a truly lovely experience for a group of locals that gave us a greater appreciation for sf. jay is a great storyteller and teacher, and we would definitely recommend the experience to both bay residents and visitors alike.“great team building event”jay led a fantastic architecture tour for our team. it's nice to walk around and look at san francisco with someone who sees the world like jay does. he tells stories of the city and matches it with a deep understanding of the details of san francisco architecture. i realized a new level of diversity of san francisco, and felt like i toured through 20 countries by the end. it was also a beautiful walk on a gorgeous day, without hardly any hills for those worried about sf's notorious steep streets :) five stars for jay's tour for a team building event!!“don't worry about the hills”this is one walking tour in san francisco that you don't have to worry about the hills. it was quite a hot morning when we did this walk, but thoroughly enjoyed it. being from the uk it was interesting to see the victorian properties. jay was very knowledgeable about the architecture and we had a visit to the queen anne hotel which was a real eye opener of times gone by. we ended up in union street which was an ideal place to conclude the tour by having restaurants and coffee bars and it was so easy getting back to union square by bus.“my husband even loved it”the tour was great! jay was right on time, informative and gave us great details about the city and how they structures evolved over time. my husband, who hates victorian homes, thought it was really interesting and cool. so for you couples out there--you guys don’t have to check your man card! afterwards he told us where to eat and shop. great tour for the money!!“jay deserves to be the number 1 tour guide in sf”a relatively low key tour, there were only 15 in total on a sunday morning tour. jay arrived promptly, warmly greeted us, and laid out the entire tour for us. the walking is breezy with level streets and gentle slopes, that don't take their toll on your knees! true to his word, we saw the golden gate bridge and the hollywood film locations among the victorian homes.jay was able to answer questions on demand, and was well versed in the architectural field. he was friendly without being invasive, courteous and approachable.the homes are so beautiful with intricate details and are hallmark features of san francisco.from peggy s.my friend and i cannot think of a single thing jay (our guide) could have done to improve the tour we took last saturday. it was thorough without being dry. there was time for photo taking, question asking, and a little wall-sitting for this senior citizen. it was so interesting and enjoyable that even though the weather was getting mistier and mistier, no one seemed inclined to quit early. he did not disappear the minute the tour concluded, but made certain we knew how to locate return transportation and lunch. as a result ,we found a new (to us), fun part of the city to explore and had a super lunch at one of the restaurants he mentioned. he's a wonderful ambassador for a city he obviously loves.from shannon d.had a blast with our tour guide jay. this was a fun historical tour that took us out of the tourist areas. i absolutely love victorian homes and was able to take about a hundred or more pictures. saw the "mrs.doubtfire" house, as well as jessica mcclintock's. saw some homes with windows designed by frank lloyd wright, and lots of beautiful "painted ladies".from mike and peg gon tuesday, september 16th, my wife and i took your victorian home walk. it was a most enjoyable and informative time and one of the highlights of our stay in san francisco. my wife has volunteered as a tour guide here in wisconsin for 16 years and when she speaks well of a tour guide, it is high praise indeed! the pace was perfect and we simply cannot say enough about the quality of the experience. thank you for offering such an enlightening perspective on this period of san francisco architecture.from shirley and keith g (u.k.)we recently visited san francisco and one of the highlights of our visit was the victorian tour walk. we live in a victorian house in england and how much more colorful and fresh are those of san francisco. it was fascinating to learn of the different styles of these victorian houses and to be able to go inside one was the icing on the cake. thank you for making the tour so interesting and so easy in terms of the amount of walking involved. we could hardly believe we had seen well over 100 victorian houses in the course of our walk. we would certainly recommend this tour to any other visitors to san francisco.from triciamy friends and i had a wonderful time on saturday on the home walk. we loved the queen anne and it was so interesting learning about the history of the victorian home era and seeing and being able to identify the different styles. and you were right, we did have the neighborhoods to ourselves except for those people who lived there. we are bragging about our adventure to all of our friends!!!! i'm glad you decided to go into this full time. it was worth the drive from fresno for the day!!!!
