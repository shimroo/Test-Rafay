2 week highlights!









a unique summer experiencecamp moshava combines traditional camp activities with exciting thematic programming in a zionist atmosphere of torah va’avodah.
enter our 400-acre campground on scenic buckhorn lake, near peterborough, ontario, and you’ll be welcomed by happy campers aged 7-16. the bnei akiva atmosphere that permeates our camp is characterized by daily tefilah (prayer) and shiurium (learning), but also finds expression in the team spirit built on our basketball court, in our arts & crafts programs, the communal singing as shabbat departs each week. at camp moshava, we strive to make each experience a reflection of the values that we hold dear.
more about camp moshava








 










one camp. countless possibilities.camp moshava believes that spending a summer away from home is an opportunity to break away from technology. connecting with people has become a more challenging task for this generation and camp gives campers the tools they need to get a sincere appreciation for nature, friends, and activities in fresh country air.
moshava helps our camp community to connect to the land of israel and the people of israel, while feeling proud to be an orthodox jew.  our campers gain so much from being surrounded by amazing role models, many of whom have grown up at moshava. come see for yourself why moshava has changed the lives of thousands of campers and staff.
see programs (by eidah)








integrating israel and religious content in a fun and informal way, with a great choice of activities is moshava’s strength. camp has a lot to offer the kids, but still has a warm, family feel.
elite collins






moshava’s major strength is the modern orthodox environment, shabbos observance, judaism in a fun environment, tefillah, ruach — ife lines for jewish kids in today’s environment.
rosalie armstrong newman








the strength of moshava is the friendship, the love you feel when you get to visiting day. the kids are happy. my boys could be at moshava waiting for other campers by the mid of january, with 3 feet of snow. moshava is like the best place on earth!
ian widman






moshava’s strengths are in modeling foundational skills and jewish values that develop character, leadership competencies, and a love for eretz israel!
