our mission

at fei, our engineering department uses the best of today's technology to scour the globe to find those lost minerals and natural substances necessary to produce products capable of reproducing the colors and textures that make up the tapestry of our past. 
                            
                            our studios teach not only the best of today's faux and decorative finishing techniques, but also the historical art forms of trompe l'oeil, faux bois, murals, grottesca, and classical ornamentation. the studios we have chosen to represent us are hand picked not only for their talent and accomplishments, but also for their continuing support for our firm commitment to ensuring that these age old art forms are not lost to future generations.
