tenant rights after a disasterafter a natural disaster – like an ice storm or a fire – renters often have questions about their rights. when a rental home is damaged by something that is not anyone’s fault, renters have some options. this handout has information about what the law requires from landlords and renters when a rental is damaged by a disaster. more information about issues with repairs is available on the oregon rentersrights website, www.oregonrentersrights.org

we say this land acknowledgment as recognition of truth. we say this land acknowledgment to show respect. today, there are 9 “federally recognized” tribes in the state of oregon. but before settlers came to take the land here in oregon, there were more than 60 tribes in this area. we acknowledge that we are on the occupied homeland of indigenous communities in oregon. in addition to the immeasurable loss of first nations land, and the lives of countless indigenous men, women, and children, entire cultures were wiped away. livelihoods were stolen. some of these atrocities were government approved. despite centuries of colonization, genocide, and racism, indigenous people are still here. we must think about what it means to occupy space on indigenous lands.we recognize the legacy of systemic oppression that enables many of us to be here. we also recognize and honor the strength, resilience and capacity of indigenous people in our region. land is not just merely the space that our bodies occupy; it is a vault of culture, story, art, history, and tradition.
