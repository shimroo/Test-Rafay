deal with repairs
if something’s wrong with your appliances, and you kept on using them, this may be another reason to blame why your energy bill goes up from time to time. this also decreases the energy efficiency every time broken appliances or wiring operates. as soon as you encounter the problem, immediately find the problem and call better electrical contractors for help in repairs. also, constant maintenance of acs are highly recommended. if ductworks need fixing, have it addressed as soon as possible. change the filters as much as you can, which is recommended every month.
unplug and turn off
turn off appliances that are not in use. this can be very basic but we often times overlook and forget this very simple idea. turn it off when not in use. common culprits of this problem are tvs, stereos, even laptops are just left turned on. and when not in use, remove it out from the socket, especially when you are going to be away for an extended period of time. make it a habit to unplug the appliances as soon as you’re done with it. little did you know, the accumulated energy consumption of plugged unused items can still cause significant sum in your electricity bill. this works on chargers as well. implementing discipline in your own household with constant practice can turn this act of turning off and unplugging into a habit.

december 3, 2018
by cody mahoney


tools have always provided us easier means to fix or make any job that comes in our way. sometimes, there are easy fixes in our home which actually requires little knowledge and skill in order to handle the job, but the problem is we lack the tools needed in order to address even the tiniest problem. let me help you put a check on your list on your next shopping at the hardware store.
ladder trays
i find convenience and comfort when i know that the cables are secured with ezystrut cable ladder because it fixes all the cables that are exposed in a room and that it is guarded to ensure that its coating will not be tarnished.
another perk that you could gain from this is that these are fire rated ladder trays wherein in cases that a fire becomes within its reach, the tray will act as an added protection which will not affect the cables and prevent cables from contributing to the fire which could potentially aggravate it.

screwdrivers
as you may be aware, screwdrivers vary in shapes and sizes. be aware first of the type of screws around your home, and the ones that you would commonly use, then get yourself the specific type or even a whole set so you would be able to screw in and unscrew any type. these are great for your tv wall mounts, blinds, desktop table, and so on. 
hammers
get yourself the general type of hammer which has both the ability to bash through a nail and pull it out. these claw hammers will be more likely useful for you rather than lump hammers because you won’t really be dealing with heavy materials that would require a greater brute force.
pliers and snips
standard pliers are there to help you hold, pull, bend, and twist small pieces. this will also help if you do not have the specific type of wrench wherein you will be able to untighten small nuts. another reason why you need this is that it will be able to help you reaching parts where other tools will have difficulty in accessing.snips are useful whenever you need to cut or strip the coat from the wire. another usefulness that it provides is you could cut other materials and even cut stems of your plants.these tools will always be sufficient to do the basic maintenance jobs around your home. with these, you can do the job yourself without having to pay the carpenter for it. in that way, you are able to decrease your costs for other repairs and maintenance jobs.
