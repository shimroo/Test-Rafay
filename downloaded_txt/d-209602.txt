|the orb - 2 - 01 - little fluffy clouds (live from washington dc '97) [u.f.off - the best of the orb]move is complete, thanks to my co-workers who helped me schlep stuff, and no thanks to the hypothermia that we all almost got for doing it when the temperature was 15 outside.still sorting and unpacking stuff, and some of my replacement things are showing up.the ups guy tried to deliver my new desk yesterday, but apparently took it straight to the apartment complex office (they sign for some packages) instead of to my apartment.  now, this is a nice desk - natural wood, computer-style with filing cabinets, keyboard tray, etc.  seleene_paris helped me pick it out (thanks hon!), and it's not exactly small.  there was no way that i was going to be able to get it back to my apartment, and i was worried how i was going to arrange it.so i walk over to the office, and run into the head maintenance guy before i even get inside, who recognizes me and asks to make sure everything's in the apartment and sorted.  there were a few hiccups, like a refrigerator not being in the apartment when i moved in, but everything's been taken care of, and i thank him.  i mention the desk, and his first response is, "i'll get the truck and we'll bring it over."  i didn't even have to ask; they simply did it.  by the time i'd walked back to the apartment, they had it leaning against the wall outside my door.yes, i'm still renting, but i found a darned good place to rent from.oh, and it's two blocks from work.  talk about reducing your carbon footprint... i don't even need to take the (biodiesel-fueled!) busses anymore, except for once or twice a month, for shopping that i can't do at the iga across the street.

george tiller's murder and some thoughts about history.
[jun. 1st, 2009|06:22 pm]
geoff ellingwood




okay, this post is going to piss some people off.  i'm well aware of this, and i'm even going to encourage it, to a certain extent.  the things i'm going to be talking about are controversial, the positions i'm going to present are going to make people uncomfortable, and i'm going to make people on both sides of the issue think twice about their perspectives.  so if you choose to read past the cut, keep in mind that i'm intentionally doing this to make you think.personal disclosure, i'm pro-choice, even though some of the things i'm going to say here are not necessarily going to come across as flattering to this position.now then.as many folks are aware by now, on sunday, may 31st, 2009, george tiller was murdered.  in a church, during services (although out in the narthex, and not in the chapel itself).  this man was an abortion provider, and the murder is likely to have been motivated by this.( from here on out, my comments get nasty...collapse )

wolfram|alpha
[may. 19th, 2009|06:59 pm]
geoff ellingwood




[tags|alpha, work]as many of you know, i'm working for wolfram research now.  i'm involved (although mostly around the edges) with their new product, wolfram|alpha.  there's been a lot of hype about this, up to and including a live web broadcast from the actual launch of the website.  it's been pretty chaotic, but a lot of fun for me.that being said, a lot of people don't quite get what this new thing is.  it's being billed as a "computational knowledge engine", which is a different thing altogether from a search engine, like google.  this is something that simply has never existed before, which is why so many people are having trouble figuring it out.  you can't use it to search for things, like the best value car, or the cheapest cell phone, because that kind of thing can't be computed, except by methods that would either be biased, or not be trusted, or both.  but for things that are computable, wolfram|alpha excels.  it builds on the computation power and symbolic interpretation of mathematica, and takes it to an entirely different level.  while mathematica is designed for professionals, wolfram|alpha is designed for the whole population, although many of the data sets are rather specialized.  as things stand now, this product is only starting.  it's at the first point where it's good enough to be used by the public, but it has a long way to go.  there's a lot of work to do, and a lot of things won't work, and there's a lot of data that hasn't been put in yet.so if you run across things that don't work, or that you think should be added, use the feedback form on the bottom of the page.  your feedback will help make it better.  i'm not just saying that, either - i'm actually one of the people who reads that feedback, and makes sure it finds its way to the developers.  so sending feedback will also help to ensure my future employment.  *grins*there's a lot of articles out there which show off what alpha can do.  i figured i'd show a few examples, myself.  so if you'd like to see some examples, ( click here to see them.collapse )

steam, the last remnant, and why my weekend plans are trashed.
[may. 1st, 2009|07:16 am]
geoff ellingwood




so, there's a (fairly) new square|enix rpg out, called the last remnant.  xbox 360 release, and pc, with ps3 soon to follow.  i had it recommended to me by bav101.since i have a new job (more on that later), i figured i'd treat myself and pick up a copy.  while at the mall this week, i stopped by the game stop in the mall, but they didn't have any pc copies.  apparently they're phasing out their pc games, because of "rampant piracy".  sounds like an excuse to me, but oh well.  turns out, the game was made available via steam, valve's download-based free service for game distribution.i've had a steam account for a while, and i was pleased with the results when i brought home my (store-bought) copy of the orange box.  so, last night i fired up the client and purchased a copy of the last remnant.  first of all, it was only $39.99 - no tax.  fair price for a new game, i figure.  second, the download was fast.  it's a 12 gb install, and it was done before i woke up this morning (and i started it right before i went to bed).  third, it just... works.  i didn't have time to get very far this morning (just to the point where i actually control my char), and now i'm off to work, but there was absolutely nothing for me to do.  click on the shortcut, configure my gamepad, tweak the video settings, and start playing.that's the kind of game experience i want.  simple, quick, painless, and it just works.  oh, and so long as i have my steam account (free, of course), i can download it again any time i want.  the fact that i have no physical media won't limit me at all.now, i'm off to work, and yeah, my weekend plans are fairly set now.  *grins*

|pissed]here is an article on salon.com which describes a pulitzer prize-winning series of articles in the new york times talking about how "some retired generals, working as radio and television analysts, had been co-opted by the pentagon to make its case for the war in iraq, and how many of them also had undisclosed ties to companies that benefited from policies they defended".you'd think that something like this would be all over the major tv news channels, right?  well, no.  in fact, they're supressing it.  here is an article from media matters which talks about an nbc segment which completely ignores these articles when discussing the pulitzer price winners for this year.there's something going on here, and i don't like it.the original articles are:behind tv analysts, pentagon's hidden handone man's military-industrial-media complexthese are new york times articles, so registration is requied (although if you use bugmenot, you can bypass that...).

some food for coding thought...
[jan. 15th, 2009|06:45 pm]
geoff ellingwood




[tags|programming]here is an interesting article to read.  at first, you might scratch your head and think, "gee, geoff, what does that have to do with programming?"  well, it's pretty simple.  the judge is upholding a ruling that says that calling something a "trade secret" does not mean you can keep the source code for a breathalyzer a secret from a defense team that might want to challenge it on the grounds that it was not programmed or designed correctly.  while this will mean that some cases of dui that should probably have resulted in convictions will be dismissed, the end result is much better.what it means to a programmer is that, if you're involved with a project that has serious implications (in this case, evidence can result in a conviction and jail time), you had better do it right.  and that's because your work can be gone over with a fine-toothed comb by a defense team.  and for something so serious, it darn well had better be able to stand up to inspection.even better, it's not a difficult stretch at all to see how this sort of a ruling might be expanded to other things, such as atm's - and even voting machines.  no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, i'm sure you want elections to be as fair as possible.  i know i do.this ruling only applies in florida for now, but i don't see any reason why it won't be extended.  so make sure you ship good code, if it's for something important.

video games and violence.
[jan. 13th, 2009|11:20 am]
geoff ellingwood




[tags|video games]this topic has always depressed the heck out of me.  i've played plenty of violent video games, and all i hear about them is that they somehow "cause" people to go do stupid things like shoot up their schools.  how exactly does that work?  these games don't teach you how to do anything other than use a mouse or gamepad to aim, and they certainly don't show you where to buy or make weapons.  there's a cognitive disconnection in making that assumption; a distinct reality gap that's being consciously overlooked.so, much to my pleasure, i ran across this blog entry (pops, originally from slashdot).  it's written by a psychiatrist, and is a summary of a study done by a psychologist and a sociologist which shows that video games do not lead to violence.  they point out that, especially for boys, video games are social activities (and as such, should - in moderation - be encouraged).  they do admit that people who already have a tendency towards violence or aggression may be drawn to violent games, and that those may affect them adversely, but that is a far cry from the "causation" that people want to believe.it's just not there, no matter how much you want to believe it.  it's not as simple as that.  for children, ultimately the responsiblity lies with (*gasp*) the parents!  did you know that the ratings on video games are put there - voluntarily - by the video game industry?  and hey, guess what, they're there for a reason!  a game rated "m" (mature) for sexual and violent content is not for kids.  if your kids have them, there's a problem - and it's your problem for letting them get a copy.people should not expect politicians to legislate this away somehow.  laws that impose penalties for selling games to minors aren't very effective, for the simple reason that the minimum-wage people who are selling them often simply don't care.  similar laws have done very little to curb underage drinking, for the exact same reason.  warning labels, which are the latest measure proposed, worked so well on music cd's and cigarette packs, didn't they?  all these things are is feel-good measures, that let people suffer the illusion that they are somehow doing something to help, when ultimately, there's nothing that can do on a large-scale level.if you really want to stop random violence, stop trying to blame video games and other red herrings.  look at the real questions - how are people getting access to the weapons?  (gun show loopholes, lax firearm registration, etc.)  what sorts of things really drive people to that sort of rage?  (bullying, mental illness, etc.)now, if you'll pardon me, i'm waiting for my world of warcraft server to come back up.

|black sabbath - the mob rules [mob rules]]i'm sure plenty of people have lots to say about how it was and wasn't won, but i personally have something slightly different to say.thank you, senator mccain.  nothing becomes your campaign like the way you left it.  no fussing around with recounts or court cases.  you bowed out graciously when the results became clear, and you told all your supporters - even cutting across the boos - to stand by obama, because he is going to be the next president.  history will remember you for many things, but the one thing that i will remember you for is you being a gracious loser.hopefully, people across the nation will listen to what you said.  barack obama is the next president of the united states, and we all need to get behind him, regardless of how you feel about his politics.  as the saying goes, we aren't out of the woods yet - there's still economic and military troubles all over the world that need to be dealt with.  the nation has chosen what it believes is the best executive for handling that, so it's time to toss aside party differences and get to work on making this a stable and productive nation again.that is all.

|metallica - 07 - hit the lights (live in paris) [the unnamed feeling]]so with the wonderfully cool fall weather, i'm starting to have a craving for warm things for meals.  so i took a few biscuit recipes from around the 'net, and as is my normal style, i tweaked and modified them.  extremely successful so far.the base: 2 cups flour  1 tablespoon baking powder  1/3 cup vegetable shortening, such as crisco  dash salt  dash granulated sugar  1 cup milk  preheat oven to 425 f.  mix dry ingredients well in a large mixing bowl, then cut in shortening.  stir in milk until completely mixed.  for best results, use warm milk (simmering it in a saucepan on the stove works quite well).  you may optionally knead out the dough gently 15-20 times on a flat board, lightly sprinkled with flour, or you may simply choose to make drop-style biscuits (i prefer the latter).either knead and cut biscuits using your preferred method or drop them directly onto a lightly-greased baking implement.  makes about 6 cut biscuits, 12 large drop biscuits, or 18 small drop biscuits.  bake for 14-18 minutes, depending on the size of your biscuits (smaller ones will require less time).variation 1 - garlic and herbwhen warming the milk, mix in some fresh garlic or garlic powder, to taste.  also add various herbs to the dry mixture.  garlic powder, cilantro, sweet basil, thyme, and sage all work quite well, from my experience.  no further changes necessary.  this will give you a nice herb taste to the biscuits, which makes them better as a side for a full dinner.variation 2 - chocolate!add 2-3 tablespoons of cocoa powder and 1/4 cup sugar to the milk while warming.  to the dry mixture, add 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1/4 cup sugar, and decrease flour to 1 1/2 cups.  you may optionally sprinkle the biscuits before baking with granulated sugar for a nice carmelized effect.more variations as i come up with them.  the chocolate ones are baking now... yum!oh, and i'm going to start using tags now, for what that's worth.

politicking
[oct. 5th, 2008|09:48 pm]
geoff ellingwood




so the mccain campaign has gone full-on offensive with their tactic of attacking obama's character.  the primary vector so far seems to have been obama's associations with william ayers, one of the founders of the weather underground.  admittedly, back in the 1960's, they were very bad people(tm).  they set off bombs and were what just about everyone would agree was a terrorist organization.  and that was forty years ago.  now?  well, ayers is a professor of education at the university of illinois, chicago.  and yes, he and obama live in the same neighborhood, and have served on a couple of different community organizations - all charitable ones.sarah palin says that this means that obama is "palling with terrorists".  really?  according to cnn's fact checker, not exactly.  "cnn's review of project records found nothing to suggest anything inappropriate in the volunteer projects in which the two men were involved."meanwhile, a slightly different story is surfacing from the left side.  the daily kos has a good summary, along with links to the original posting (it's in norwegian, so translations may be required).  suffice it to say that, in 1988, obama gave a complete stranger $103 in an airport to help her check an extra bag.  since she was taking everything she owned to norway to get married, this was very important to her.  further details on the website.i think the contrast is quite clear.  the obama campaign isn't trotting this story out, even though she received a formal letter from obama in 2006 when he was a us senator.  they also aren't harping non-stop on the keating five scandal, from a different economic crisis, in another era.  instead, they're continuing to talk about what their candidates will do to make the situation better.mccain, on the other hand, is attacking.  and using out-and-out baseless accusations that one could easily call fear-mongering.

so i'm sitting here at my desk, with freya on the back of my office chair, and i hear the cd-rom drive on the server (which is behind my head) open.  it seems that freya has figured out what the "eject" button is, and what it does.  after batting at it for a bit, she manages to give it enough of a shove to trigger the auto-retract mechanism.  at which point, she leaps off the chair (which almost throws me out of it, since it's suddenly unbalanced), and tears off into the other room, knocking over a stack of books on the way.who wants to bet that she'll try again later?

|brainiac]it won't surprise anyone that i'm a liberal, supporting obama.  but here (pops) is an interesting article by a conservative columnist (and former publisher of the extremely conservative national review) which offers reasons why conservatives should be supporting obama as well.  interesting food for thought, whether or not you agree.

|none]click here for picture (borderline nsfw, opens in new window/tab)as for cat...  i was in the bathroom, taking care of business, and freya as usual is working her way around my ankles.  she stops after a while, and i look over to see her sitting down.  in the shower stall.  i couldn't help but crack up laughing... the one place in the apartment that the cat does not want to be - and she's even gotten wet a few times from poking her nose in while i'm showering!  on the other hand, she's taken up the habit of joining me under the blankets again.  i think she likes being all warm and cozy under there, and she's not the least bit claustrophobic, so she often goes to sleep with me.

|brobdingnagian bards - do virgins taste better medley [a faire to remember]]this one is really easy - and really good.these portions are for either one very hungry person, or two moderately hungry people.  adjust accordingly.sausage gravy 1/2 lb. breakfast sausage (i use bob evans's sage pork sausage)  1/2 cup milk  1/4 cup sifted flour (approximate)  1 tsp black pepper  1 tsp salt  dash garlic powder  dash onion powder  dash red pepper buttermilk biscuits 1 1/2 cup bisquick  1/4 cup butter or margarine  1/2 cup milk preheat oven to 450.  brown sausage in a skillet, chopping into as fine pieces as possible.  while sausage is browning, cut margarine into bisquick in a large mixing bowl with a fork, then stir milk into the mixture until it begins to flake.  when sausage is browned, remove from heat, drain, and cool in the skillet.  take biscuit dough mixture in your hands and knead gently, making sure to clump it all into one mixture.  if it sticks to your hands too much, dry them well and rub a little flour into your palms.  separate into four equal portions, and form into 2" round discs, placing on an ungreased baking sheet.bake biscuits for 10 minutes.  while baking, add milk and dry ingredients - except flour - to the browned sausage in the skillet.  over medium-high heat, bring to a simmering boil.  slowly sift in small amounts of flour, stirring vigorously to avoid clumping.  the gravy will thicken quickly.  stop adding flour when it is just shy of the thickness you are looking for, and remove from heat.biscuits should be done at this point; place them on a plate, sliced in half, and serve covered in gravy.

|scooter - 10 - how much is the fish? [mind the gap (cd 2)]]you'll all enjoy this, i'm sure.so i'm heading to the store tonight, to pick up some stuff.  as i'm getting to the bus station, i spot a ford expedition coming.  my first thought is, "gee, not another bloody suv..."  then as it passes, i make out the license plate, taking a closer look.  clearly not from illinois.  in fact, it's from alaska.  okay, fine, so they probably need the four-wheel drive (passing over the question of what it's doing in illinois).  then i see what's on the license plate.  "brrr1"  i almost fell over laughing.  one of the few times i wish i had a camera phone.
