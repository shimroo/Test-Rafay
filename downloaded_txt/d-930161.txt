lamaze childbirth classes






lamaze education and practices are based on the best, most current medical evidence available. one day, two evening, 4 evening, and private classes! we can find times that meet your needs. they will fully prepare you for your birth covering such topics as the process of labour and birth, coping strategies, support for birthing person and partner, hospital information, pain medications, medical procedures, effective communication skills, breastfeeding and the first days with a newborn.


























fearless birthing class






a 5 week class series that is a complete childbirth class that includes all the essentials of a regular prenatal class, with a focus on mindfulness and the practice of deep relaxation. our minds and bodies continually interact with one another, and these interactions powerfully influence our fears. the focus of mindfulness and the practice of deep relaxation prenatally will help you become empowered to create a calm and peaceful birth experience.  


























postpartum doula services






postpartum doulas are skilled and knowledgeable about the care and development of infants as well as maternal recovery and adjustment. we provide non-judgmental guidance on newborn care and feeding, assist the mother with physical and emotional recovery, care for baby so mother can care for herself, and provide practical household assistance.


























breastfeeding class






breastfeeding, although natural, is a learned art. it takes knowledge and practice to become successful. studies have shown that pregnant women who learn about breastfeeding are more likely to succeed than those who do not. in our classes, we will have hands-on learning where participants will get to practice different positions, ask questions and learn what you need to know about breastfeeding before your baby comes.


























birth doula services






one of your doula's first goals is getting to know the birthing person and her partner and building a trusting and warm relationship so that by the time your baby is ready to be born you will know and trust all of your support people. your doula helps you to determine your goals for your birth, and works to help you meet those goals.  


























newborn class






designed to give you the knowledge and empower you to care for your newborn baby. parents will feel better prepared upon learning updated, evidence based information, while being encouraged to discover their own natural inclinations and responses to their babies.
