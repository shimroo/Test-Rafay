illinoisatlas.com is an ongoing 
              project of the center for governmental studies 
			  at northern illinois university. the center has been creating computer 
			  generated maps since the early 1990's. rather than maintaining these maps 
			  in digital archives alone, we felt that it would be more useful to us and 
			  to the public if we made these maps available on the internet. 
               we believe that the maps will be particularly valuable to educators 
              and the business community while, at the same time, allowing us 
              a means of communicating our services to potential clients.
 the maps available on this site 
              may be used free of charge. our only requirements are that cgs be 
              cited as the map's source and that it not be modified in any way. 
               we would also appreciate being notified if our maps are used in 
              a publication. in addition to the maps posted here, we have an extensive 
              collection of stock maps and can do custom mapping projects. the 
              cost for stock and custom maps vary based on size and complexity.
aside from a counter, we have 
              no way to gauge our usefulness to the public. feel free to give 
              us feedback on our site by using the "contact us" link 
              visible on the left-hand navigation bar near the top of every page, 
              or by sending us an email at info@illinoisaltas.com.
