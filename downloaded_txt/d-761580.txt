nobody died when clinton lied  


this is an interesting blog. read it. tell me what you think.  i'll tell you what i think. bush should be impeached and be tried for war crimes. nobody died when clinton lied-----------------i feel really bad today.  i don't know how long i can go on like this. i plan on going to the oncology clinic early in the morning and will sit there until someone lets me see the doctor. i don't have an appointment but someone has to do something for me. the people in the er didn't.  how long is a person expected to endure pain. the pain is just wearing me down more and more.i have been laying around trying to just rest, trying to find a comfortable position and i can't.   i remembered i have a bunch of apples i need to either put up in the freezer or bake something with them.  mom took me to the dallas farmer's market and we got over a case of  imperfect tomatoes.  most of them were perfectly fine after cutting out bruises and unsightly spots. i put two bags in the freezer and made some salsa. i also made spaghetti sauce with some of them.  i have about five more pounds to do something with.i made an apple cobbler and have about five apples left. i didn't feel like doing anything but i got it done.  i have a lot to work on and just hope i can get it all done.my cobbler will be done in about 10 mins. then i will go take a nap.

today...  


today i am feeling a little better. i have done nothing at all. i have tried to simply rest. sleep or lay still in a position that will not put too much pressure on the side with the tissue expander, or on the side with the lymph edema.this is sort of a balancing act.  if i sleep on the left side, that arm with the lymph edema swells up and i get pain from fluid retention. on the other side, the right, is where that tissue expander is and i think sleeping on that side is what causes it to shift around inside me. when asleep, i toss and turn, maybe pushing different muscles up against it. anyhow, it's painful and needs to go!i've taken some benadryl and that seems to help me rest better. i still wake every few hours.now i'm going to go and watch the end of fat camp.

upsetting  


i have been in serious pain for the past week. especially the past two or three days.  i finally decided to go to the emergency room and the result was they could not help me.the doctor was young and rude.  he was defensive when i expressed how i felt about the care i received.his supervisor was patronizing and the young doctor tried to interupt me when he overheard me talking to the supervisor.  i asked him to please allow me to continue talking without interuption, that i had already told him how i felt about his ideas on treatments.anyhow, i'm back home at 3 am from the er and i have a little more time to enjoy the pain relief i received while in the er. once that has worn off i am back to where i started.my oncologist will not be in until tuesday.  we'll weather this storm.i'll be fine. i'll be in some serious discomfort but i suppose i can survive it, however unpleasant it might be.now i'm going to try and get some sleep.

i know, i know!  


i missed more than a day. i missed several days.  i'm alive but not feeling very good. the battery on my cellphone is dead and i haven't even felt like getting up to find the charger and plugging it in. i'm just feeling that bad.lots of pain. nausea. weakness in the legs.  sleep has been hard to catch. tonight i will take a phenergan tablet. it's a strong dose, too. this will knock me out. i will sleep and hopefully feel much better in the morning. if i don't, i know that i have caught some sort of virus. i hardly have a voice. i can whisper and sometimes it feels like i might not be able to manage a whisper.but, the important thing is that i'm here. i'm alive. and i'm fine, regardless of my present discomfort. i'm sure it will pass. if not, there's always 911. right? whee!later. no fun links today.
