        volunteers are the backbone of non-profit animal welfare organizations such as ours. from dog walkers to adoption ambassadors, volunteers' contributions are vital to the well-being of
        the animals we shelter.


volunteer at hscc









        hscc's most vulnerable residents benefit tremendously from foster care, which provides them with time outside of the shelter for recovery from an illness or injury, or to receive extra
        attention and socialization.
