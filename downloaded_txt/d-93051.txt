welcome to sandi's site

						this site began as a private resource; an online 
						collection of notes and fixes that i use constantly as 
						part of my newsgroup work. as software and operating 
						systems evolve, so do the answer to problems, so i have 
						decided to use hyperlinks to my faqs for newsgroup work, 
						thereby keeping advice as up-to-date as possible.
i 
						now have a web site especially for internet explorer 7 - 
						check it out :o)

						my sites specialise in supporting users of windows 
						pcs.  but fear not, macintosh users have not been 
						left out in the cold.  i've tracked down some 
						alternative sources which i hope will be of assistance 
						to you.
						macintosh questions 

						i have had very little to do with the mac version of oe 
						or ie but there are mac devoted newsgroups available at msnews.microsoft.com. 

						click the appropriate link to subscribe:

internet explorer for mac
outlook express for mac

						or... here are some of the websites are available:

http://www.microsoft.com/mac/support/newsgroups.asp
http://www.macoptions.com/oe/faq.htm
						note: macemail has been removed - it is no longer a mac 
						support site
