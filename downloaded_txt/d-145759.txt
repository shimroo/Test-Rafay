protestant apologetics and theology




 

 apologist one
      who makes an apology; one who speaks or writes in defense of
      a faith, a cause, or an institution; especially, one who argues
      in defense of christianity.
apostasy 1)
      the public abandoning of a religious faith, especially christianity,
      for another. 2) a similar abandoning of a doctrine or party.
      [from latin from greek apostasia, renunciation]
apostate 1)
      one who has forsaken the faith, principles, or party, to which
      he before adhered; esp, one who has forsaken his religion for
      another; a pervert; a renegade. 2)
      one who, after having received sacred orders, renounces his clerical
      profession.
the dove noah released from
      the ark soared across the wide seas that engulfed the world,
      found no roost, and sought again the refuge of the great vessel.
      so man has departed from the truths of the bible, using wings
      of independence to seek distant horizons. but like the weary
      dove, through the years many have returned to the changeless
      certainty of god's word following years of aimless flight. as
      one generation begins to drift from the gospel, the following
      generation finds it anew, clinging tenaciously to its teachings
      as though they were the first to discover them.

faith disrupts, and where public disruption
isn't observable, faith hasn't occurred. if as believers we nevertheless
protest that we have faith, we are theologians; if we know how
to describe faith, we are poets; if we weep in describing faith,
actors. but only as we witness for the truth and against untruth
are we actually possessed of faith (adapted from "luther's
return," parables of kierkegaard, 1978).

 jim elliot is credited
      with one of the most poignant summaries of commitment to christ
      ever penned: "he is no fool who gives up what he cannot
      keep (this temporal life) to gain what he cannot lose (eternal
      life with christ)."
