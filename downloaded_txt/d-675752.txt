as many of you know i’m the owner, founder, editor and writer of adland.tv, the world’s longest running website devoted to all things advertising. i amassed the world’s largest collection of super bowl commercials as well as a treasure trove of some of the best — and worst— ads from all over the world.

after twenty-eight years, i’ve made the decision to take it offline. i don’t have the bandwidth to keep it going as i’d like to. because in addition to running adland, i’m also freelancing more than ever. and on top of that, i’m taking care of a parent who has alzheimer’s. 

at this point, the labor of love i literally built by hand has become more labor and less love. 
so i will be putting up the domains adland.tv, adland.eu, commercial-archive.com, ad-rag.com for auction along with the legacy nameserver sinless.org. contact me at dabitch@dabitch.net if you are interested and have a proposal. i've canceled all https://ko-fi.com/adland subscriptions, thank you for your support.

the symbolism between taking all those memories offline while caring for someone with memory problems isn’t lost on me. and that’s why i’m asking you to consider making a  donation to the alzheimer’s association.  https://www.alz.org/

          hi and welcome to this memorial. today we're mourning the tragic loss of my mother's first born adland. now my mom can finally rest and go outside and touch grass. that bold 3 detergent plus that finally she'll have time for me.

the "heart" is for all the great posts. and conversations about posts. even when we disagreed.

i'm sorry to see you take it offline. i was sad when osocio went offline, and when my former agency nuked all my posts i did there. 

but our industry is ephemeral. i stopped trying to hold on everything i produced years ago. i'm thankful for the friends i've made along the way, and the many things i have learned from them.

thanks for adland, åsk. it meant something to me.

you gave so much of your life, time, energy, and money(!) to make the world’s most comprehensive online repository of ads! we met because of adland back some 18 years ago when you hosted the archive on the hosting provider which employed me. this announcement is clever and shows your flair for the creative — it also cuts knowing a historical treasure is going dark. good to see your daughter and good to see you finally touching grass :)!

åsk, you did the impossible when women in the creative departments of advertising agencies(let alone mums) were not the norm. to build the excellent tool that adland is, singlehandedly alongside your day job, is just so epic.  i’m sad no one has come to you (yet) with an offer because that library should be preserved. i still hope someone, some org will. 👊

åsk wäppling well, in arabic we say "there are no custom duties on words" - which basically means talk is cheap. i can say words upon words, but they will all ring hollow. i take care of an aging parent who thankfully does not have alzheimer but working and blogging and eventually "life" comes a toll. much respect as always.

the creative industry is losing one of its great critics and curators. thank you for so many years of service. you've more than earned quality time with family and nature, real things. best to you and yours.

"record content before you know why. 

it’s ok to not know what content to focus on - especially in the early stages of starting your own video strategy. but if you wait to have your plan before you take action, you’ll miss key moments.

so get your camera, videographer, or phone and start documenting everything. thank me later.

did you know that on an average, running an online contest campaign helps you acquire 34% more fans? another interesting fact is that more people are consuming video content than ever before. in fact, video traffic was 69% of all consumer internet traffic in 2017. put these two stats together and the one thing seems obvious — online video contests are a great way to build a following for your brand. 

while an online contest is a great way to get new fans and engage existing ones, you need to consider key aspects carefully. read more top tips on how to make your next video contest campaign a success: https://lnkd.in/gyrajchg

"the lottery is crap. i never win." - someone who buys one ticket every 6 months.

let's face it, the chances of winning the lottery jackpot are lower than my dog's tolerance for anyone walking past my house. but there is a reasonable chance of winning something, even if it's only a tenner.

you know that email with the subject line "good news about your lottery ticket!" will be a massive disappointment. but there's a little frisson of excitement that you may have won big before you open it. it's like schrodinger's millionnaire.

however, if you only buy a ticket every now and then, your chances of winning anything drop massively. obviously, the more tickets you buy, the more chances you have of winning something. 

it opens up the opportunity to get lucky.

and that's my analogy for why you should post more regularly on social media. it's not about posting once and then sitting back and waiting for orders to flood in. it doesn't work like that.

it's about increasing the chances of potential customers seeing your stuff and getting to know, like, and trust you.

then you might win something.

kanye did whhaaat?

what kanye did for the superbowl commercial was nothing but excellent. you don't need pretty or expensive ads/content. you just need to do it!

think of any pattern interrupt and do it!
