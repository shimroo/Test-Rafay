ever notice the subtle cultural differences around us? that which we consider weird, different, or even corny. but turn it around, from someone elses point of view, there are also quirks in our cultures that we take for granted too! 

let's see if i can spot some of them as i travel across the continents.

	 mini y2k... in australia
    


australia tried to be different, and pushed daylight saving back a week for 5 states.source: theage.com.au - i'm sure my clock is right!!do you know how many friggin conference calls i called into last night to singapore and the usa, just to find that meetings were 1 hour later, and that all my microsoft outlook meeting calenders were telling me the wrong time? gosh  knows how many people messed up the same... trains coming into work yesterday were half empty.they reckon almost 3/4 of the adelaideans (is there such a word?) had no clue when daylight saving starts. all i know is, i have to live with screwy clocks and devices until daylight saving actually starts on april 6, 2008!i guess this is what happens when a good idea isn't matched up with the practical steps to achieve the desired result... or rather, lawmakers are out of synch with the complexities of how the world operates.labels: pms, stuff

	 language: lethal cocktail of malay + english
    


you know what? on most days i give singaporeans a lot of crap about their singlish... but i guess we aren't doing that great in malaysia either.spotted this outside a residential home while visiting angel in kota kinabalu on the weekend. *dilarang = forbidden/not allowed (in the malay language)

	 about me... and about her
    


since we last met on this blog, i've taken my non-single hood status one step further. we are now...going for marriage counseling!well, if only angel and i knew that we'd be 100% made for each other, then we wouldn't have gone down this path.*what the...??the point is, we're serious about each other. even though we are "in love", but are not certain that we're talking about all the things we need to talk about, doing the right do's, don'ting the wrong don'ts... rah rah rah. so we decided to go for marriage counseling even though we're not engaged or anything. wish us well!since she's in kota kinabalu and i am in singapore... i have to fly to meet her every so often to do 8 sessions of it. check out my travel calendar:thank god for mum's advice about saving $$ for a rainy day. bless her dear soul...oh incidentally, i'm blogging from kk. :)

	 announcement: maybe its about b****y time...
    


i have been simply overwhelmed by the concern people have given about how i used to blog, why have i stopped, why i forgot all about my fans when the girlfriend came along... rah rah rahok, so i'll try blogging again, amidst the 1,000 + 2 things i have to do everyday. maybe i'll lean it out and cut down on the graphics compared to way back then. i've got quite a few things to rant about singapore anyway.*pssst... they say you're getting old when you start using phrases like "way back then..."i missed you all! *blushes
