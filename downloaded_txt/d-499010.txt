 orton-gillingham and structured literacy tutors
 letrs trained tutors and teachers

homeschoolers
perfect for homeschoolers
it can be challenging for homeschoolers to teach children who struggle with reading. ultimate phonics provides homeschoolers with an affordable, effective program that makes it simple to teach beginning and struggling readers of all ages to be good readers.









do your students have these reading problems?






guessing and skipping
do they memorize whole words and guess or skip when they try to read words they don't already know?





slow, laborious reading
do they try to sound out new words but they read too slowly and laboriously to keep track of the meaning?





these are serious problems that cause poor reading comprehension, prevent students from becoming good readers, and block them from getting a good education.
most students who fall behind in reading never catch up. poor reading is a problem that holds them back as they get older. it negatively affects their self-esteem, their education and their future prospects.
it doesn't have to be this way...

what our customers say









i think this is the single best reading program out there on a computer. i have tried many of them and yours is the best by far.
steve horovitz, parent













this is by far the best phonics app i've come across ever! my son struggled to read for as long as i could remember and i tried almost every program out there including abc mouse and hooked on phonics. nothing worked until i came across this app. you guys gave us hope and my son is starting to read better already. he's getting more confident in his reading and doing better in school. i started to get discouraged until i found ultimate phonics. thank you!
epic harris, google play reviewer













i have been using your ultimate phonics reading program to help my 11 year old son who has dyslexia and other learning disabilities. i am amazed and relieved at his progress.
lori miller, parent

10 reasons why ultimate phonics works





because it teaches the foundation of reading
phonics is the foundation of proficient reading. mountains of research has shown that phonics skill is the greatest predictor of reading ability, including fluency and comprehension. unfortunately phonics is difficult for many people unless they are taught properly.
ultimate phonics thoroughly teaches your children or students the essential phonics skill they need for maximum reading achievement.





because itâs complete
ultimate phonics teaches all the phonics sounds and rules of english. by comparison, many other programs are incomplete and donât do a thorough job.




because it provides lots of practice
in the course of completing ultimate phonics your students read over 4,400 different words and 2,100 sentences, starting at a basic level and progressing to an advanced level. this prepares them to read books and other content at any level.




because it requires no special training
you donât need any training or teaching experience to successfully teach reading with ultimate phonics. all the expertise is built into the design of the software and the structure of our word lists and sentences. of course, if you are an experienced teacher youâll love the design and depth of our program.




because itâs easy to use
ultimate phonics is very simple to use. you just listen to your children or students read all the words and sentences in the program and youâre done! now they can read books and other reading material independently.




because itâs not an âedutainmentâ program
ultimate phonics is a 100% educational program. its sole purpose is to teach your children or students to read once and for all. in contrast, many other programs emphasize cartoon game distractions and only teach a little bit about reading.




because itâs suitable for all ages
ultimate phonics can benefit people of all ages who are beginning readers, poor readers, or non-readers. if you have young children just starting to read you can teach them to be excellent readers at an early age. if you have older children or adults with reading difficulties you can greatly improve their reading ability.




because itâs ideal for dyslexia
ultimate phonics is a direct, systematic, intensive phonics program. this approach is widely recognized as the best for teaching dyslexics and other problem readers.




because itâs affordable
at a low, one-time price for the complete program, ultimate phonics is one of the best investments you can make for your students' future. it enables you to give one of the greatest gifts of all: the gift of reading.




because it works
ultimate phonics is a proven program, supported by scientific research, that has been successfully used in thousands of homes and schools over the past twenty years. we 100% guarantee that ultimate phonics will bring major improvements in reading achievement for your children or students.
