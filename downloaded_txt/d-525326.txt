	 how many muslims won a nobel prize
	 
    


      this article can now be found at how many muslims won a nobel prize.

i have moved to a hosted site using movable type.  you can find all my posts at my new website:  planck's constant.

i liked blogger and it was simple and cheap to use, however i have noticed that a few anti-muslim websites have had a content warning splash screen (blogger "interstitial") thrown up which requires the user to click a button saying they understand that they may view objectionable content, for example: content warning
some readers of this blog have contacted google because they believe this blog's content is objectionable. in general, google does not review nor do we endorse the content of this or any blog. for more information about our content policies, please visit the blogger  terms of service


rather than wait for blogger to one day keep my readers from directly viewing my content for any reason, i have decided after two months of blogging to put my time and effort on a platform that does not depend on some jerk reviewing my site for objectionable content.

	 multiculturalism gone wild
	 
    


      sometimes we bend over so far backwards to accommodate religious practices that i expect soon to hear the high court of any western country allowing "honor killings" because they are so universally practiced and so ingrained in muslim culture.

      dubai is the muslim money laundering capital of the world. iran generates $200 million a day pumping oil; enough to lift the 40% of its population that lives under the poverty line. and that's an iranian poverty line, not like in america where the poor have homes and cars. the money instead shows up in iranian mullahs' bank accounts and beachfront property in the dubai palm islands.

      suppose every day there were 14,000 toasters blowing up and injuring their owners! you know we would have congress up in arms promising legislation to fix the problem. there would be funding for toaster education programs to teach homeowners on the proper operation of toasters. children would be taught to wear goggles whenever near a toaster and taught never to touch a toaster without adult supervision. visual-ed classes would have lessons on what to do in the event of a toaster malfunction.

      back in 1975 i bought my first computer, an ibm 5100 for $15,000 to automate my vending machine business.1  the first computer program i ever wrote was the game of life.   that was actually quite easy to program [using basic] and for my next  effort i wanted something of a challenge.  my brother pete was attending rutgers in newark at the time and told me that the most popular game at the computer department was star trek, a text based game written in basic [for a full description see wiki], which he printed out for me.

the key easily connects to any computer with a usb port with virtually unlimited space to store x-rays, mris, ekgs, and more. when plugged into a strange computer it assumes you are at a hospital or ambulance and brings up only the critical medical information such as conditions, medications and allergies that you have previously authorized.

suppose you lived in redistan, a country that allowed you to wear any color clothing you wished with the one proviso that if you ever wear something red once you cannot wear any other color ever again. if you dare to wear blue - you are killed if you are a male and flogged if you are a woman. once you wear red, your children must wear red and of course their children must wear red. blues can be married to blues or even to yellows but not to reds.
