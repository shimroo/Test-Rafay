bungalow jazz presents george delancy quintet, a house concert







next concert: george delancey quintet, friday march 12th

join becky ogden and a cozy crowd for bungalow jazz, an occasional series of combo jazz performances in the intimacy and warmth of becky’s unique east columbus home.

becky’s big old 1910 bungalow sits on an acre ravine lot on east fifth avenue (it’s a little hard to find: see the directions!) deeply connected to columbus’s jazz community, becky has long opened her house for friendly musical gatherings. since closing her columbus music hall, she still sees the need for venues where musicians and their audiences can mingles. hence, bungalow jazz, the casual “house concert” venue.

  the fabulous seven-foot mason hamlin piano sits in the living room, waiting for artists like mark flugge to bring out its warm and beautiful sound. after a post-jazz festival session, wes “warmdaddy” anderson said, “i love this room!”

 the combined first-floor space seats about fifty people with overflow in the dining room (home to the english pub bar familiar to denizens of the firehouse).

 every event is byob, with free snacks, desserts, soft drinks and coffee furnished by your hostess. byo goodies too, if you want to contribute to the munchies.

 and by all means, bring your own children: the atmosphere is family-style and welcoming.

pictures at the opening! chris steele exhibits a fabulous collection of antique penny scales






my eccentric friend chris steele is an artist, designer, model maker, inventor of of odd contraptions, spin-art virtuoso, founder of citizens for a better skyline (pioneering the first murals to appear in the short north), photographer, ceramist, and accumulator of assorted weird stuff. i first met him in 1972 when we opened benchworks, a fine crafts collective in german village. he brought an enormous old penny scale he had rescued from the then recent demolition of old central station. i agreed to let him place it at the entrance of our store and he came around regularly to collect his coins. the many scales he has kept on collecting throughout these past 4 decades now make part of the largest private collections of these once ubiquitous marvelous objects, sought by museums, history buffs and collectors all over the world. find out how you can see that amazing collection by reading below.-charlie

snowscape reality





 desolate snowed in street. shot with iphonelooks deceivingly peaceful! just found out about a 40 car pile up on the major freeway. scary. the snow is so fine you can hardly see it falling, but each hour adds about an inch and it won't stop snowing until morning. then comes the wind and high drifts. oh what fun.(it is kind of neat how the iphone created sort of a fisheye-motion effect. )

this beautiful picture of stan's house was shot with an iphone again. the real story is: the white car in front right corner, barely visible, is the same car i had been hopelessly trying to move out of that parking spot. gave up after trying for about one half hour and walked home. it looks calm but the white light is because the  air being saturated with millions of the tiniest sow flakes that have been falling like that for hours. the weatherman promises no let up until morning.  our cars may not be able to move for days. anyone out there with spare cross-country skis, snowhoes, or a snow cat?

our founders were not fundamentaists -





by harvey wasserman | february 13, 2010 -

"god made the idiot for practice, and then he made the school board."
--mark twain
 the new york times sunday magazine highlights yet another mob of extremists using the texas school board to baptize our children's textbooks.


this endless, ever-angry escalating assault on our constitution by crusading theocrats could be obliterated with the effective incantation of two names: benjamin franklin, and deganawidah.
but first, let's do some history:


1) actual founder-presidents #2 through #6 -- john adams, thomas jefferson, james madison, james monroe and john quincy adams -- were all freethinking deists and unitarians; what christian precepts they embraced were moderate, tolerant and open-minded.


2) actual founder-president #1, george washington, became an anglican as required for original military service under the british, and occasionally quoted scripture. but he vehemently opposed any church-state union. in a 1790 letter to the jews of truro, he wrote: the "government of the united states, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistances, requires only that they who live under its protection, should demean themselves as good citizens." a 1796 treaty he signed says "the government of the united states of america is not, in any sense, founded on the christian religion." washington rarely went to church and by some accounts refused last religious rites.


3) washington was also the nation's leading brewer, and since most americans drank much beer (water could be lethal in the cities) they regularly trembled before the keg, not the altar. like washington, jefferson and madison, virtually all american farmers raised hemp and its variations.


4) jefferson produced a personal bible from which he edited out all reference to the "miraculous" from the life of jesus, whom he considered both an activist and a mortal.


5) tom paine's common sense sparked the revolution with nary a mention of jesus or christianity. his deist creator established the laws of nature, endowed humans with free will, then left.


6) the constitution never mentions the words "christian" or "jesus" or "christ."


7) revolutionary america was filled with christians whose commitment to toleration and diversity was completely adverse to the violent, racist, misogynist, anti-sex theocratic puritans whose "city on the hill" meant a totalitarian state. inspirational preachers like rhode island's roger williams and religious groups like the quakers envisioned a nation built on tolerance and love for all.


8) the us was founded less on judeo-christian beliefs than on the greco-roman love for dialog and reason. there are no contemporary portraits of any founder wearing a crucifix or church garb. but washington was famously painted half-naked in the buff toga of the roman republic, which continues to inspire much of our official architecture.


9) the great guerilla fighter (and furniture maker) ethan allen was an aggressive atheist; his beliefs were common among the farmers, sailors and artisans who were the backbone of revolutionary america.


10) america's most influential statesman, thinker, writer, agitator, publisher, citizen-scientist and proud liberal libertine was -- and remains -- benjamin franklin. he was at the heart of the declaration, constitution and treaty of paris ending the revolution. the ultimate enlightenment icon, franklin's deism embraced a pragmatic love of diversity. as early america's dominant publisher he, paine and jefferson printed the intellectual soul of the new nation.


11) franklin deeply admired the ho-de-no-sau-nee (iroquois) confederacy of what's now upstate new york. inspired by the legendary peacemaker deganawidah, this democratic congress of five tribes had worked "better than the british parliament" for more than two centuries. it gave us the model for our federal structure and the images of freedom and equality that inspired both the french and american revolutions.
it's no accident today's fundamentalist crusaders and media bloviators (rev. limbaugh, st. beck) seek to purge our children's texts of all native images except as they are being forceably converted or killed.
today's fundamentalists would have despised the actual founders. franklin's joyous, amply reciprocated love of women would evoke their limitless rage. jefferson's paternities with his slave mistress sally


hemings, paine's attacks on the priesthood, hamilton's bastardly philandering, the grassroots scorn for organized religion -- all would draw howls of righteous right-wing rage.


which may be why theocratic fundamentalists are so desperate to sanitize and fictionalize what's real about our history.


god forbid our children should know of american christians who embraced the sermon on the mount and renounced the book of revelations...or natives who established democracy on american soil long before they saw the first european...or actual founders who got drunk, high and laid on their way to writing the constitution.


faith-based tyranny is anti-american. so are dishonest textbooks. it's time to fight them both.


harvey wasserman's history of the united states is atwww.harveywasserman.com, along with passions of the potsmoking patriots by "thomas paine." this article is written in honor of the spirit of howard zinn.

the arts upstairs "art and soul" exhibition





my good friends alan and lynn fliegel, live in phoenecia, ny, upstate in the mountains, 10 minutes from woodstock. the area has long been a refuge for many artists who have traded the hussle of the big city for the calmer, mellower life style found here. the monthly art openings at the art upstairs have become an important part of the arts and social scene in that enchanted part of the world. it is now also a successful art venue featuring talented and varried artists. the concept is very simple. any artist can bring on or more pieces for exhibit and pays a very moderate entry fee per piece. a part of each sale goes to maintain and keep the gallery open. this time of the year the mountains are beautiful and an art outing promises a terrific adventure. go! -charlie 

the arts upstairs will host an art lover's love-in in honor of valentine's day. the theme is heart and soul.  opening saturday, february 20th at 6 pm, with a romantic array of goodies and emboldening thirst quenchers.  the solo room featured artist is verna d'alto.
