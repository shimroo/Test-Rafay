dear quilting friend
it's here! my second children's book (co-authored with craig k. matthews), in search of dragon eggs...the legend of the black knight in the land of delphia with the quilt companion book, the queen's court. my joy and excitement are hard to contain. the children's book contains a stem experiment to dye the dragon eggs. great for the classroom, home schooled and for the young at heart. the quilt is a 12-block sampler depicting the shields of the 12 virtuous knights.
the love affair grew stronger when polygon4 and polygon5 joined the family! that's 21 shapes - the perfect polymates that play well together. check out all the new patterns that combine shapes for the next generation in my love affair with polygons. and if that wasn't enough, i've partnered with paper pieces to make all 21 shapes available in miniature! all polygon series patterns can be made in miniature. polygon acrylic templates is equal to polygon, polygon2 and polygon3 and polygon companion acrylic templates set is equal to polygon 4 and polygon 5. don't forget to get the polygon acrylic strip bar used to create pieced negative space for your modern designs.
just want to wet your feet with the polygon tools? start with a single pattern that only uses a single polygon tool; look for the polygon series logo.
