david brin's out of time series
would you want to be yanked out of time... if it meant you could help save the future?
all our best efforts in the difficult 21st century bore fruit, and in the 24th century, people live in the very opposite of a dystopia. only now their near-utopia is in desperate peril. suddenly, they need heroes with grit and determination, who can teach them how to face trouble and prevail. so they reach back through time to fetch such heroes...
... but only teenagers can survive the journey from our present to the future! so the heroes they bring forward must be youths from eras teeming with troubled hope — teens from today and from deeper in the past — who are "yanked" to an uncertain tomorrow, where only their courage and savvy innovation can save the day.



vivid tomorrows
can science fiction — especially sci-fi cinema — save the world? it already has, many times. and itâs not been all dire warnings. while optimism is much harder to dramatize than apocalypse, both large and small screens have also encouraged millions to lift their gaze, contemplating how we might get better, incrementally, or else raise grandchildren worthy of the stars. come along with legendary science fiction author and astrophysicist david brin on a quirky quest for unusual insights into the power of forward-looking media.find out more, or purchase vivid tomorrows as a paperback.

final thoughts ...
... for this page, at least ...








i am a member of a civilization
it's good that we have a rambunctious society, filled with opinionated individualists. serenity is nice, but serenity alone never brought progress. hermits don't solve problems. the adversarial process helps us to improve as individuals and as a culture. criticism is the only known antidote to error — elites shunned it and spread ruin across history. we do each other a favor (though not always appreciated) by helping find each others' mistakes.
and yet — we'd all be happier, better off and more resilient if each of us were to now and then say:
"i am a member of a civilization." (iaamoac)
step back from anger. study how awful our ancestors had it, yet they struggled to get you here. repay them by appreciating the civilization you inherited.
