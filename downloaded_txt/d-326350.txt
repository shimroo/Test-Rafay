“i am so grateful to have stumbled upon this organization. incorporating art into my everyday life has led me to become a more well-rounded person. the video, “the omelette,” brightened my day and i sent it to all my friends! thank you! your work has not gone unnoticed.”

— becca marin, student, about "have you had your art today?"



to find some peace and comfort please see this profound and exquisite rendition of a poem by kitty o’meara, performed by the remarkable renée fleming. music performed by john corigliano.




“this march, when measures to combat the covid-19 pandemic had begun around the world, a few hopeful voices resonated above the fear and isolation.one such voice belonged to kitty o’meara, whose heartfelt poem “and the people stayed home” was shared on social media, as readers embraced her message of resilience and healing.pulitzer prize-winning composer john corigliano was inspired to set the poem to music, and i was honored when he asked me to premiere it. ”

— renée fleming
