we are bikers paradise
at our essence, we are a small clothing company, that has been selling leather, denim and textile clothing in the uk, and beyond, since 1971.
all bikers paradise clothing has been meticulously designed and manufactured for decades. in the 90s, our leathers were at the forefront of new ce safety testing and have proved to be highly performing in the real world.
all bikers paradise clothing is now in the process of going through the latest safety certification and, until this is all complete, we cannot classify these products officially as motorcycle clothing. the certification process does take time and a lot of expense but you can rest assured that we are tirelessly working on it and that any bikers paradise product is made to our usual exacting, stringent specifications, that have proven to be of the highest quality over many decades.
