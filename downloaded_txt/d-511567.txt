family legacy

deliver the dream’s legacy of progress has always started with families at the heart of all we do.  for more than 20 years, we have been committed to providing programs that enable kids and adults living with serious illness or crisis to build bonds and form relationships with others who are experiencing the same in order to regain strength in mind, spirit, and family.  we are proud of our rich history and grateful to the dedicated families and supporters who have made today’s progress possible.  the victories of our past will lead to tomorrow’s success.
