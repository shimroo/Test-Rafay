oxygen - the missing link
your personal portable oxygen/o2 bar-concentrator


 


your brain is in charge of every aspect of your being – mental and physical.
 your brain relies on three things to be happy. 
1. proper nutrition  - balanced blood sugar/glucose 
                          2. stimulation/activation - more than 80% comes from movement 
                            3. oxygen/o2

oxygen/o2 is critical - your brain depends on adequate oxygen more than any other part of your body. as you age, you lose some of your capacity to utilze oxygen, approx. 1% per year. the older you get, the more oxygen deficiency becomes an issue.....
