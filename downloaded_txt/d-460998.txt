[frameready] listens to their client's needs and provides answers. this software has streamlined our business saving us several hours each week. it has improved our pricing structure and keeps all of our prices and inventory current. it has also helped us track the effectiveness of our advertising. in every way, frameready has improved how we do business. the investment we put into frameready has been returned to us a hundred times over.

the framer's workshop
berkeley, ca - framersworkshop.com
we wrote hand receipts on ncr self-designed quadruplicate forms for 30 years. [it has been] bliss with frameready. no lost orders, no lost art, no frantically searching for an order to match a frame from 5 years ago, no errors in pricing, no flipping charts around and using a calculator to figure out the price of a hand wrapped mat, no more wondering if we have more 16 x 20 ready mades in storage, no more price per foot or alphanumeric characters representing prices marked on samples, and no more having customers question our pricing!  it's all there. neatly organized. we love it. the customers love it.

i have been a promoter of frameready since 2005 whenever anyone asked. i like the mac platform running filemaker. we use filemaker for other applications in our business as well and continue to use it to solve problems and help with datasets from our church to our non profit affiliations like our symphony association. i will continue to think of all of you and our dear departed bert. he was very patient with me and all our phone calls before and after we were up and running.
