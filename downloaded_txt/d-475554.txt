who we are 



since 1957, new york festivals has set the benchmark for honoring creative content in all forms. today, we continue this legacy by celebrating the most exceptional advertising, television and radio programming from around the world. we honor the work by  presenting it to elite international creatives who use the nyf lens to judge it. this lens is lit by the wonder of a city where million-to-one odds happen eight times a day, enabling us to award creativity that both respects and defies history, unafraid to leap off history’s shoulders to innovate in new creative spaces. we construct real events in an unreal world to ‘show us something we’ve never seen before’.
