		  regrets: an interactive archive, public conceptual artwork, and action-research

		  regarding the human capacity for remorse.
		

		  a mobile booth and five nomadic backpack units roam public space in a
		  given community [formerly: linz, paris, santa bã¡rbara; below: cambridge, england]
		  collecting and displaying anonymous regrets from local people to comprise a
		  sociological database of time- and site-specific sentiment in the community.
		  in cambridge, after ten days collecting, local peoples' anonymous regrets
		  were displayed as large animated projections on the facade of the cambridge
		  city council guildhall in the city centre market square.

		  communally shared, but typically private recollections, each regret is like the
		  'tip of an iceberg', representing fragmentary evidence of a much larger hidden
		  narrative. together on public display, their random juxtaposition and comic/tragic
		  interplay approaches the epic poignancy of a history poem or saga.
		

		  the regrets global archive is still growing and contains tens of thousands
		  of regrets, so far in four european languages.
		  the next regrets local event anticipates a different alphabet.
