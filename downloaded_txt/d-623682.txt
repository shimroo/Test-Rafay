	 madame socialite-frootcake prachi madam has coffee with her power girl gang
    



madame socialite-frootcake prachi madam, member of ccfc, tolly, bengal club, inner circle, lsd (ladies study desk) and soon to be member of the one and only wine club has coffee with her power girl gang

i reached cafe mezzuna and spied neena immediately. air kissed my very dear friend and she started telling me about her long, boring tummy issues. these senior ladies are somewhat boring. thankfully, parna, renu and minu came and rescued me just in time.

i had to tell everyone about my prague, krakow, budapest and vienna trip and how we watched the deep, soulful opera in vienna. omg! what a touching experience. minu asked me who the tenors were, but i had to change the topic quickly. wtf remembers such details anyway? i had flooded fb with the selfies to prove everything anyway. neena also was in prague, so i had to quiz her about the shopping she did. obviously, like always she had to say she didnt shop much. if my husband was cheating on me openly, bhai, even i would lose all interest in shopping. i guess the purse strings must have tightened. i also took care to mention to parna that i checked out that twee patisserie she asked me to go and have afternoon tea at. who has afternoon tea in prague. only parna, i guess.

neena and i started discussing our lsd book club and i asked her how far she was through jorasanko. renu, the clueless chick that she is, asked if she could join the book club and neena had to put her in her place. these service class people! uff! ye professional ladies badi pushy hoti hain. 

i asked parna how her business was doing. so much fun. you see, bhawna had told me it was floundering and they had shut shop. parna brushed it off by saying she was getting a call. when she returned, parna had to quiz neena about her marital woes. this is becoming a pattern. how boring. we all know everything there is to know about it. waise bhi ye to ghar ghar ki kahani hai.

finally we started planning our next ladies day out to renu's bagan bari. nothing like getting some fresh, country air. yes, its only 5 kms from howrah. so? she's promised us some do with some artists. maybe i can score some cheap art that i can tell my friends in bombay, i paid triple for. they'll still think it is dirt cheap.

i asked everyone if they were attending the german consulate black tie dinner and everyone was. so, we'll catch up in a week's time again.

	 revolver rani
    



i knew a revolver rani in real life. my nani (maternal grandmother). i used to find the revolver hidden under her saris (she always carried a smith & wesson, until few months before her death)pretty much useless. my grandparents lived in rural up (like the wild, wild west times 100) and now that i have grown up, i realize why she carried it always. that's the only way she could live fearlessly and do whatever she wished, when she wished, in her environment. she was shit scared that one of her grandchildren would fire it by mistake, so when she was at home, it remained locked in her room, which was forbidden zone for everyone. of all my grandparents, i miss my nani the most. she was the only grandparent of ours, whose pride in her grandchildren pored from every pore and her love smothered us. we did not appreciate it while she was alive, but i truly wish every girl in india had a grandmother like my nani. 

i don't really believe in afterlife, but a small part of me wishes nani is somewhere flashing pistols, terrorizing bad guys and being a bad ass, and having a whale of a time.

	 someone marry my 35 year old brother - appropriate ladies please apply but only after reading this post
    



my aunt (father's sister) called up my mother, very unaccustomedly few days ago. she told my mother she had a rishta (matrimonial proposal) for my brother. now, my aunt, despite everything, is from old-school traditional up. my mother asked her if the girl (a doctor) in question:

drank
smoked
could dance (my brother is a very enthusiastic salsa dancer)
ate and could cook mutton.
ate beef, pork, seafood and fish.
would be comfortable in western wear/ bikinis/ skirts/ frocks.
was an atheist and never went to temples or her family never ever consulted any religious guru.

if the answer to any of the above was negative, sorry, would not do. 

my aunt was somewhat offended. then, to add insult to injury, my mother told my aunt, "forget my son, your brother has started annoying me a lot these days, since you are in the matchmaking business apparently, why don't you find me a good match? i think it is time i moved on."

i don't think my aunt will be approaching my mother for any more matrimonial proposals soon. 

jokes apart, if you are a well-educated, independent, single lady in the appropriate age range, and fit the bill, do drop me a mail.

	 bullying
    



living in maharashtra teaches people one thing well, probably from shiv sainiks - how to bully others when they don't like and agree with what they are saying and beat them with a stick to make it go away. 

that's what happened today to me and in disgust, i deleted my facebook account. i don't like bullies even if they are related to me and no amount of bullying will make it any different.

	 i will happily support your business, but spare me the csr angle and your charity
    



these days, i find myself increasingly being asked to attend events. this makes me happy because i like meeting people, doing fun stuff, being entertained, maybe eating an hors d'oeuvres or two and generally being sociable and spending my money in the vague direction of "art" and "culture". 

however, off late, every event, every business venture seems to have a charity hanging on its coat-tails. this annoys me a lot. why it annoys me is because, i know most people use it like a scam and to hoodwink their friends, family, social acquaintances, rather shamelessly, guilting them into opening up their purses. this is wrong and unethical on very many levels. if you want people to spend, make your business/ product/ service attractive and competitive, to make people want it and aspire for it. making people do so, under the guise of "doing good" will probably not make them repeat the action, and sooner or later people will realise that they are being hoodwinked. there is no shame in being a business owner or capitalist. in fact, in my eyes i will rate you higher than, if you tell me you are associated with a ngo/ charity. 

i am also amazed, when people i hardly know or have not met and spoken with for ages, suddenly pop in from the blue and ask me to support some charitable venture. why would i? i am happy being a charmless, friendless asshole rather than a sitting duck. i am happy to support a business or enterprise, because i feel it makes more sense and in a way is being more useful and contributive to society, than a silly little support group to inflate egos of bored housewives.

if you do need funds for charity or any social endeavor, just be upfront about it, rather than making people buy your stupid doodads. i will be serious about your charity, if i know it is just that and not a way to make me buy shit. i do support many groups doing useful work, but the moment they ask me to attend an art and cocktail event, i will bid them a fond farewell! i am happy attending such an event only for art, but i really dislike this idiotic trend of 5-star charity and doing-good. even a famous activist used up funds for booze and beauty parlors, so before getting sucked in to any such activity, do stop and think!

	 how to be a houseguest from hell
    




1. insist on visiting, citing concern, when host has met with an accident.2. after being categorically told that your visit will be very inconvenient, visit anyway.3. when your host is being rolled into the operation theatre, call and demand a car be sent to pick you up from the airport. then specify, which car and which driver.4. on reaching, visit the hospital at 10 pm, and demand to see the host, who is lying unconscious after being wheeled out of the ot an hour ago.5. the next day, land up at the hospital at 7 am, before your host is sponged, ready or has breakfast and his medicines.6. sit in your host's cabin for the next 14 hours. when his wife asks you to leave during the afternoon, so he can relax, ignore and say you will paste your butt in the cabin itself.7. lie on the couch, while your host's wife who has slept only for 3 hours the night before sits on a chair the entire time.8. talk loudly, gossip, be a general annoyance all through the 14 hours. keep playing candycrush loudly, when other people are trying to sleep.9. order host's staff and wife every few hours for tea, coffee. interfere in meal plans. give your unsolicited opinions.10. leave at night, only when asked by the host and then say, you are being insulted.11. insist your host speaks on facetime with your obnoxious and rude daughters, nevermind that your host is unwell and has just been operated.12. order host's staff around the next day, until you leave finally.

and then, after all this, expect royal, entitled treatment all through, for life. 

dear ladies, please note, if any of your male acquaintance gets married, behaving like this will ensure, you will be banned from the couple's life, forever.

	 quick pointers on how to decide what art to buy and how to buy it: for homes/ personal space
    



1. look at the painting/ artwork and see if it makes you think or happy.2. if it makes you happy and you are happy with the price, buy it. obviously, this should be avoided if you are high or drunk (yes, it happens).3. if you share your home space with a family, take a general consensus. art leads to many future disputes, because people are different and opposites attract. so what you like, may not be appreciated by your partner/ kids. be democratic. remember, after they kick the bucket/ set up their own homes, you are free to do what you want, until then, maintain peace.4. if the artwork makes you think, does it give you positive thoughts? there are very many artworks that are provocative or just depressing. 5. if the artwork gives you non-negative thoughts and you think it will not revolt you in the future, buy it.6. do not buy art for investment. it is stupid. the only people who benefit from art sales are art dealers and grand-children/ great-grand-children. 7. if you have lots of money to burn, cool. let's be friends! if you have a limited budget, buy younger artists, keeping the above in mind. 8. if you have a limited budget, do not be embarassed to ask the dealer for a discount. a 10-20% discount is easily achieved from most dealers. do remember, this is true in all countries. i have bought art from over 15 countries and have achieved this everywhere. however, be respectful of the dealer and the artist, while requesting discounts. niceness goes a long, long way.9. always request the dealer for an authenticity certificate. if the artwork is not new, ask for a trail of ownership.10. get invoices and avoid all-cash deals. this i recommend for 3 reasons: firstly, if the artwork increases in value, and you want to sell it at a later date, it will be easy to account for this sale. secondly, you can place a value on what you are leaving, after you. thirdly, if a dealer is willing to go through a shady deal, maybe the artwork is not the value that is being ascribed to it. 
11. never be afraid to enquire about prices of art. a lot of good art is cheaper than jewellery/ eating out and will give you far more pleasure!

happy collecting!
