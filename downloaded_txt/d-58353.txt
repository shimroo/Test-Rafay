bat cocktail du jour

part of:   brunch with tiffany ,   food ,   slice of life 


[breakfast: a trader joe's frozen croissant left to proof over night. green tea.]
i tested this cocktail over the holiday weekend and it got high scores. i wanted something that was seasonal and festive, but not too sweet.  i couldn't find pear nectar anywhere, but regular pear juice was probably a better option anyway. you could use prosseco or sparkling wine in lieu of champagne.


pomegranate champagne punch
ingredients
1 1/2 cups pomegranate juice
1 cup pear nectar
1/4 cup orange-flavored liqueur, such as grand marnier
1 bottle (750 ml) champagne
directions
in a large pitcher, combine pomegranate juice, pear nectar, and orange-flavored liqueur. slowly add champagne. serve over ice.

my favorite breakfast

part of:   brunch with tiffany ,   food 



this is my go-to breakfast. it's also great to have after you've eaten a heavy meal the night before or around the holidays. it consists of fage low-fat or non-fat (2% or 0%) yogurt (which is still creamy and delicious without being full-fat), 1/3 cup of dry organic oven-toasted oats (add or subtract to taste) and a whole chopped gala or fuji apple. you could add some honey or agave, but with the apple it's plenty sweet. i like this mixture of tangy greek yogurt, sweet apple with the texture of oats. you could add nuts or other kinds of fruit to the mix depending what's in season. sometimes i substitute silvered almonds for the oats..

a hot mess in paris

part of:   fashion ,   fugly ,   music ,   trick or treat 


[breakfast: ricotta cheese with pumpkin butter & white/green tea]

this picture of fergie wearing shorts in paris reminded me of when i was last in paris. i was shocked that all of the women and girls wearing short shorts had their legs covered in tights or stockings. no one was trying to look slutty like in la! another reason to love paris. of course fergie looks like she's trying too hard (or her stylist is). there is too much going on here. i know she's a musician and all, but with the hair, glasses, red lipstick, huge purse and long earrings, the look is ott. if only she had done some editing before she stepped out, sigh.

i see more stars

part of:   gossip ,   hollywood ,   la 


[breakfast: trader joe's frozen croissant]

--rihanna dining at kate mantilini for lunch with her security detail in tow. where were they when she was on my british airways flight? i always wonder howfamous people decide when not to use their bodyguards. brooke burke was also there with some of her kids. kate mantilini remains a place where you can see stars any time of the day. i like it because it's very nyc and has a menu with a zillion choices.  km also has the best booth seats ever overlooking wilshire blvd.
--zac efron and vanessa hudgens at the mondrian hotel on sunset a couple of  sundays ago.
--kevin dillon dining solo at joan's on third. joan seemed to have a crush on him.
--the hills being filmed at milk on beverly blvd.
--rick fox at crunch gym in hollywood.

i see stars

part of:   'ana' alert ,   fashion ,   food ,   gossip ,   hollywood ,   la ,   music 


[breakfast: 2 slices of multigrain toast with butter.]
 
hilary duff is quite the chic woman and healthy. the two pictures above show her at the airport recently. a lot of stars wear outfits that look like they'd be uncomfortable to fly in. hilary is good at dressing stylishly and looks comfortable. i also like the picture below of her from a couple of days ago in sherman oaks. 
i was surprised to see her at cube the other night dining with her mother? and perhaps publicist or stylist. hil was wearing a fedora and flared light blue jeans. my only critique of her is that she wears too much makeup. it didn't seem like anyone recognized her, but cube is the type of place where a celeb could go without someone wanting their autograph and where people are more into their dining companionn than people watching.

alexander wang for the gap

part of:   fashion 


[breakfast: leftover favorite scramble from toast. multigrain toast from breadbar with butter and strawberry jam.]

the newest gap design collaboration is with alexander wang, vena cava, and hat designer, albertus swanepoel . my favorte from the collection--all done in khaki, btw--is this motorcycle jacket by alexander wang and his a-line shorts. his other jacket is nice, but i think it's more mature. i tried on the vena cava dresses and they didn't fit me well, but considering that their regular collection dresses don't fit me well, i'm not surprised. most of the lines are available online, but the motorcycle jacket can only be found in stores now.these designs can be found internationally as well. they only arrived in store yesterday. grab them asap before they're gone.

my travel essentials for europe *updated

part of:   travel 


[breakfast: organic vanilla yogurt. 2 slices of turkey bacon. 1 slice of multigrain toast. green tea.]
1. black leggings -- if it gets cold, i can wear these under my dresses with ballet flats. 
2. two scarvesâone cashmere that i can also wear on the plane. the other one can be a lighter fabric or wool.
3. cashmere hoodie by b.chyll âi get freezing on most planes, so i invested in this sweater (i got it on sale) and i wear it all the time. you could also bring your own warm travel blanket and wear a regular hoodie or bring a warm, soft hat.
4. herban essentials towlettes âiâve written about these before. they come in different scents and can be used for other things besides sanitizing your hand since they are in aromatherapy scents like lavender (my fave) and mint. i always carry one of these in my purse.
5. bric nylon bag  -- it fits within a small bag and can be used for purchases on your trip.  i also love the feed 100 bag for day-to-day shopping and on trips because it folds and zips into a small package. feed 100 bag = 100 school meals for hungry children in rwanda.
6. kumaara luminizing eye treatment âi hate when my skin looks dull and my eyes look tired on the plane and from jetlag. this seriously makes your eyes look gorgeous and helps with fine lines. itâs unique. (http://www.kumaara.com)
7. jurlique hand cream in lavenderâmy hands and cuticles can get very dry and i need a heavier lotion than whatâs available in hotels. 
8. european flat iron and/or hair dryer âi bought a flat iron on sale at sephora in france that i like better than my one at home. (i finally cut 9 inches of my hair off and donated it to pantene beautiful lengths.  i use the flat iron on my bob.)
9. bose quietcomfort 2 acoustic noise cancelling headphones â these were the best gift ever. dk is totally jealous that my headphones are nicer than his. 
10.  world's softest cozy spa socks or target socks/ lightweight slippers (found in sock section) â i usually bring a combination of these because my feet get cold easily. there arenât always slippers available in hotel rooms and they are usually flimsy. i only use them after i bathe.
11. black cardigan --i bought a cute medium-weight one from h&m in may. this is a wardrobe must-have anyway.
12. wine/champagne bottle stopper -- a lifesaver. 
13. umbrella -- buy a cute mini from h&m, forever 21, or target. it's annoying to get caught in the rain and have to buy a cheap, overpriced umbrella

fashionista du jour

part of:   fashionista du jour ,   hollywood ,   rant 


[breakfast: leftover ny breakfast sandwich from joan's on third.]
 
jessica biel looks cute here. she always looks cute, though i wish her lips were real. i've seen her around town a few times now and she seems like someone who would be cool to hang out with. when i've seen her at restaurants, she isn't checking her lip gloss at the table, or running to the bathroom to make sure she looks photo ready. oh, and she eats food like a normal person. the problem with jessica biel is that she can't act. on the plane back home i tried to watch easy virtue. i had watched revolutionary road and was desperate to follow it with a light movie. after about a half an hour, i couldn't watch her anymore. can't someone send her to the best acting teacher in hollywood? i mean, she was playing this glamorous character who was also the first woman racecar driver. how much of a stretch is that to act? maybe the fact that movie was set in the 1920s was difficult, but still. in real life, jessica biel is an athletic tomboy who turns into a glamazon for pr related activities. i do hope that she will get some acting chops someday or be directed by someone who brings out an amazing performance.
