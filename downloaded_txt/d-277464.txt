horse slaughter, where is the verdict?





as a concerned animal lover, i have once again sent letters to my representative expressing my disgust with the act of horse slaughter.the horse slaughter was "supposed" to have ended march 10 2006 but instead the usda has is now decided to allow a new program called a fee-for-service slaughter of horses at three slaughter houses in the united states(two in texas, one in illinois).while it may seem as if the consumption of horse meat truly does not happen on a large scale. it does. just last week my husband was in switzerland at a hotel on business, he went to the hotel restaurant for dinner. he was utterly disgusted when he was faced with a menu item that read "horse steak - imported from texas" he thought he was going to be sick.although we may never completely abolish horse slaughter, we can still fight for what is right, and for the ethical treatment of those horses that are inevitably slaughter bound.for more information please visit the following websites:the humane society has a informative, yet sad article located atthe humane society stop horse slaughterhttp://www.aspca.orgyou will also find interesting reading at:http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/05/9/nojusticeforhorses9.05.htmhttp://allpoetry.com/column/1722703and if you are concerned about horse welfare please read this page, or at least scroll to the bottom and see what you find of interest.http://my.athenet.net/~nrsprntg/covertext.htmlthere is a video about horse slaughter so graphic that it made me cry, and i was not able to make it through the video completely. if you would like to see the footage, you can find them at this link from society for animal protective legislation this is another wonderful site dedicated to the protection and humane treatment of animals.if anyone has information on the verdict please e-mail me. i will post the information as soon as i find any results.remember only together can we make a difference.rhonda tatum -glimmering gems fine jewelry

well, i have shattered my foot - lisfranc joint and all.





i have shattered my foot. i am told that this is the worst of all foot injuries.i have smashed the lisfranc joint in my right foot.as if this is not bad enough, i am told that every other bone in my foot has at least fragments broken off of them.i went to the primacare unit directly after it happened, they said they could not see anything wrong with my foot. that i only had a ankle sprain.two weeks later, i go to the podiatrist, she takes x-rays and says i should just wrap it. she was a total loon, so i took my films to sports doctor, they say lisfranc so quick, that it makes me nervous.so i go for a second opinion and the other sports doctor says, lisfranc and other breaks too.now i have had a ct scan, they are all amazed that i can walk.i really do not have much pain. (oddly enough) and i am walking normally.i am not sure if i should have the screws and pins put in my foot or not.it appears that what i am supposed to be worried about is arthritis later down the road (i think).i have had other fractures, over 10 years ago, and i have no arthritis from them.now i have to decide if i should have screws and pins put in or not.i wonder how it will heal if i just leave it alone.has anyone else had this experience, and if so, how have you healed?thanks,rhonda tatum - owner

how to properly use a loupe?





do you know?do you know how to properly use a loupe?a loupe (correctly pronounced loop) put simply, is a small magnifying glass.a loupe has many uses, you should think of it as a essential tool for owners of all fine jewelry. it should not be limited to use only when purchasing a high quality diamond or wedding ring.with a loupe you can check for cracks in the stones of your jewelry.you can examine the shanks and settings of your jewelry to make sure that you are not going to loose a precious stone from your setting.you can look for inclusions that will help you to assess the value of the stone. and much more.what to look for in a good quality loupe:the number of lenses:one lens: loupes made with a single lens are generally of lesser quality, they will cause a distortion of the object you are magnifying.three lens: a triplet loupe is a magnifier that contains three lenses placed together in such a way that distortion and color problems are corrected.the x ratingunderstanding the x rating:loupes are labeled with a number, followed by the symbol x.think of it this way, x = times. for example, a 2x loupe makes objects appear two times their actual size and a 5x is five times the actual size of the object.overall:the best loupe for jewelry:a 10x triplet loupe. always purchase one with a black frame to eliminate distortion caused by light reflecting from the inside sides of the loupe.the ftc in the us requires that stone grading must be done under 10x magnification.the standard set by them states that any flaws that does not show up under 10x magnification are considered nonexistent for jewelry grading purposes.30x loupes:while bigger often seems better:30x loupes are far to powerful for anyone who is not extremely experienced in thier use.a 10x is sufficient to easily examine inclusions and fissures in gemstones and their use is relitively easy to learn.how to use your new loupe:technique:most important, practice, practice, practice.first: hold the loupe between the thumb and forefinger of either hand.second: hold the gemstone or piece of jewelry in the other hand.third: bring both pieces very close to the eye, you cannot see tiny flaws at a distance.if you wear glasses, do not remove them.you should keep the loupe approximately one inch (more or less) from the eye, and the object you are examining should be approximately one inch from the loupe.move the loupe in and out in very tiny increments until you have the object clearly focused.you are now free to rotate the object, and look for flaws.note:it is usually good to brace your elbows on a table or flat stable surface when viewing gemstones.a steady hand is most likely to find the flaws that a shaky hand may overlook.things you should consider before purchasing a gemstone.your loupe can be of great importance here:symmetry, is the stone balanced?are there the correct number of facets for this particular cut?how is the sharpness of the facet edges?hard stones should have sharp edges, most synthetic stones will have softer edges and will appear more rounded when viewing with a loupe.how is the over all proportion of the gemstone?are there inclusions, flaws, or bubbles in the gemstone?inclusions in colored gemstones are not necessarily a bad thing, they can provide positive identification that the stone is a genuine rather than a synthetic stone.flaws in colored gemstones usually do not reduce the value of the gem.bubbles are generally a sign of a synthetic gemstone, and you can learn quite quickly how to spot these flaws.are there chips or scratches or cracks in the gemstone?brittle stones tend to chip and crack more when they are placed into a setting, while soft stones often scratch easily.be sure to check at the prongs of the setting to check for chips and scratches that may have occured at the time of setting.so as you can see, the loupe can be a valuable tool in helping you locate that special piece of jewelry that is sure to become a family heirloom!
