skunkhaven.net is our domestic skunk care and 
      rescue site. we own and operate skunk haven™ shelter. we 
      are a 501(c)3 tax exempt 
      corporation.



we are an international rescue and assistance group that 
will help anyone with their pet skunks. if you need advice or can not care for 
your skunk any longer please call or email us for help. we have our aphis-usda license and ohio 
permits for transport and dealer activities. we have contacts in many areas that 
can help you!
we are dedicated to collecting and distributing information on proper dietary 
health, medical treatments, and traditional and non-traditional recuperative 
processes.
all of these efforts cost money, we are not funded by the 
government. even one dollar helps buy food for the skunks. all money will 
go toward skunks, medical supplies, food, bedding, toys, vet bills, etc.
please help keep the shelter alive 
by donating something. we are always in need of supplies and other items for the 
shelter.


you may donate here:
 
 

 








contact us if you have a pet skunk that 
you can no longer care for. 
would you like to adopt a pet 
skunk? you can view skunks that are available for 
adoption here. we have members 
and associates throughout the us, canada, and several european countries, and 
can provide direct support and assistance in almost all cases.
this website is geared to the betterment of captive 
born domestic pet skunks.  taking any animal out of the wild is illegal 
and has the risk of exposure to dieases.

warning > never let 
anyone touch or pet your captive born domesticated skunk or allow any of their 
pets near your skunk. if medical attention is needed, doctors and hospital staff 
are required to report bites by exotic pets to the local health 
department.  this even means if the owner of the captive born pet skunk or family 
member gets bit!!!! this may lead to your skunk being seized and euthanized to 
be tested for rabies. there is no quarantine period.   although 
there are no cases of our pet captive skunks having rabies, people who do not 
own captive born skunks still assume the worst.  
see hannah's and flower's story --->pet alert 05/2012

a suggestion is for you to at least have your tetanus shot up to date.  if your skunk bites 
someone and you want to spend the money, hire a lawyer to fight from having your 
beloved skunk put down and pay for the rabies shots that are required to be 
taken after the bite.  it's a series of five shots costing 
around $215.00 each.  sometimes the insurance company will pay for 
it.  you have to work quickly due to the fact that the health dept. wastes 
no time in killing your pet domestic skunk.never joke about being bit by 
your pet skunk. the wrong person eaves dropping can still report 
it!
note: this does not pertain to any animal that is 
taken from the wild; you are taking a risk when taking any animal out of the 
wild to make it into your pet.  it would be wise to leave the wild life 
alone. buy captive born skunks by breeders.
if you find a 
wild skunk please read the following>it is illegal 
to take skunks from the wild in most states, if you find an abandoned or injured 
wild skunk contact a wildlife rehabilitation center for assistance. if you live 
in ohio here is a list of 2024 wildlife rehablitators
to find a wildlife rehabilitator. if you 
live outside of northeast ohio, please click 
here to find a rehabilitation facility near you to take in injured or 
orphaned skunks. if you need a referral we can assist you with finding a legal 
rehabilitator in your area.
think twice before you take a animal out of the wild to make it your pet 
please read click 
here
 



new rabies testing may save our skunks from being put 
down. read about it here... dna 
test
if your skunk gets out of the 
house it may not come back again. there are 
steps to take before 
and after an unfortunate occurance.
warning about 
using metacam for pain
if your skunk eats chocolate, this 
is what you should do.
