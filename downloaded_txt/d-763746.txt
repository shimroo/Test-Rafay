 welcome to bronstein music!established in 1946, bronstein music offers repairs, rentals, and school-oriented sales to the san francisco bay area and beyond.on february 2nd, 1946, milt bronstein opened the doors to bronstein music on grand avenue in south san francisco after serving in wwii as general patton’s bandleader. upon his retirement in 1981, milt sold the store to two of his long-time employees, rich welker and don edwards, who each started working for mr. bronstein in their high school years. rich and don continued the mission of bronstein music, which is to provide quality instruments and service to musicians of all ages and abilities. in order to focus more on serving the rental and repair needs of school-based music programs, don and rich moved the store from its long-time home at 363 grand avenue to 305 3rd lane in south san francisco in 2018. in 2019, don and rich sold the store to ron graham, who worked at bronstein music for nearly 30 years as both a private woodwind instructor and repair shop manager.while the big store on grand might be closed, we are still dedicated to continuing the mission of serving schools and musicians of all ages and abilities.come on by and say hi!

 where do i park?
 the best place to park to get to our location is either street parking on linden, grand, or baden or in one of the metered spots in the public parking lots.
please do not park in the grand avenue hardware store lot! it is right across the ally, but it is their
private lot and they do tow unauthorized vehicles.  check out the map below for parking.  







   
recent reviews



   deangela s.10/13/2022

i'm so glad i was able to find this place. i needed to find some guitar picks for my cousin's birthday gift and the reviews confused me because i was not looking for music lessons or instrument repairs. i called and the guy who answered immediately told me that they had them so it was great! as soon as you see a red door, you have found the shop! the inside is full of instruments and the people in there know their stuff. they give excellent service.i got what i needed and more and i believe the items i got were reasonably priced. please support this place if you're looking for repair, an instrument and please call ahead to make sure they have what you're looking for.

 chloe c.12/7/2021

"for decades i've gone to bronstein music (music lessons, retail, and repairs) and i will keep going here to get my saxophone repaired. thanks to ron and staff for repairing so quickly too!"

 jay a.11/6/2021

"took my 60s classic vibe tele, which i wanted a setup with new brass saddles and convert to lefty. also had intonation issues and a low e kept slipping off the fretboard. jeff installed right handed saddles which i purchased incorrectly for a lefty conversion, he intonated the guitar, fixed the low e string, shaved the nut to how it should be. he went above & beyond & informed me of things i should consider, which i never thought of. great work jeff!"
