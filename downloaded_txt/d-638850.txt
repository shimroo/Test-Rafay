ralphie report: buffaloes break big 12 curse, win first conference game

it finally happened!

it happened! it finally happened!

it took colorado 14 games and nearly two months, but the colorado buffaloes have won their first big 12 game since 2011, beating ucf 76-63 to snap their 0-13 streak in conference play.

on a day when cu retired the number of legendary buff and nba champ derrick white, the vibes were magical at the cu event center. as you’d expect from a matchup between two of the the big 12’s bottomfeeders, this win wasn’t pretty. fans were treated to a forty-minute slop fest of a basketball game, but that slop fest was damn good if you’re a colorado fan.

both teams got off to a slow, undisciplined start. without starting guard jordan ivy-curry, ucf looked lost on the offensive floor. the knights’ shots weren’t falling early, as they had trouble finding good looks.

on colorado’s end, things weren’t much better. the buffs started the game shooting well, making eight of their first 14 shots from the floor and four of seven from three-point range, but turnovers negated cu’s advantage. colorado turned the ball over six times in the first 10 minutes of play, which allowed ucf to stay right within the game.

midway through the first half, it looked as though colorado was beginning to settle in. the buffs stopped turning the ball over and continued hitting shots, drilling four of their five fg attempts over a three-minute span to build a comfortable 25-18 lead over the knights.

immediately afterward, cu reverted back to their old ways, turning the ball over three times in only one minute to fuel a 10-0 ucf run. during that run, the buffs shot 0-7 from the floor. that knights run would erase colorado’s lead and put them in a 34-29 hole.

with only 1:36 left to play before the break, the buffs would regather and dig themselves out of that hole. cu would go on a 7-0 run, six points of which came from free throws, to put themselves in a good position heading to halftime. a bangot dak buzzer-beating layup would give colorado a 38-36 lead as time expired, being the first time the buffs led at the break since their trip to orlando to play ucf in early january.

colorado came back from the locker room and started to revert back to their old ways. they immediately turned the ball over twice in the first 45 seconds and shot only one of nine from the floor to start the second half.

the colorado team of the last few months would have crumbled under the pressure and been overwhelmed by the circumstances. instead, we saw a different group at the keg on saturday. the buffs responded to the adversity by banding together and completely locking down ucf, smothering the knights’ offense and forcing them to take ill-advised shots.

that lockdown defense would lead to ucf shooting only seven of 29 from the floor, which is good for a fg shooting percentage of 24.1%. from three, the knights were even worse, shooting two of 10.

with the opportunity for a conference win up from grabs, cu’s andrej jakimovski snatched it. the buffs’ lanky forward was automatic from the floor in the second half, making four of his five attempts and two three-pointers. jakovski, who finished the game with a team-high 15 points, did more than enough to push the buffaloes across the finish line.

the buffaloes turned the ball over 19 times against ucf on saturday, finishing the game with a less-than-ideal turnover margin of -11. how do you overcome such a massive turnover margin, you ask? the answer is by dominating the boards the entire game.

colorado finished the game with a whopping 52 rebounds (!!!) compared to ucf’s 29, good for a margin of +23. specifically, the buffaloes were elite off the offensive rebounds, snagging 16 o-boards and scoring 17 second-chance points.

while andrej jakimoski stole the show in the second half, colorado got contributions up and down the roster to beat the knights. assane diop was a menace off the boards, finishing with a career-high 10 rebounds. sebastian rancik continued his tear from lawrence, finishing the game with 10 points and seven boards. julian hammond once again proved why he’s the most consistent free throw shooter in the big 12, drilling all six of his chances from the line.

now 1-13 in big 12 play, the nightmare in boulder is over. colorado’s longest losing streak since 1985 has been snapped and is behind the team. 0-20 in conference play is no longer a possibility.

now for the bad news: cu’s schedule is brutal going forward. the buffs will play #10 iowa state in ames, baylor and #17 kansas at home, then will play a white-hot k-state squad in the octagon of doom and will head to lubbock for a showdown with #12 texas tech.

enjoy this win, colorado fans! this next two-week stretch might be rough, but now we have this to cling on to.

ralphie report: colorado (0-13) favorites over ucf in big 12 slap fight

the buffs have a chance to win their first big 12 game.

the colorado buffaloes haven’t won a big 12 game in more than fourteen years. sure, thirteen of those years were spent in the pac-12, but it’s about time the buffs notch a w in their new old home.

saturday afternoon might be cu’s best chance the rest of the season. the buffs will host the ucf knights at 1 pm (mt) as 1.5-point favorites according to vegas insider.

the buffs nearly won their last matchup with ucf. it was a back-and-forth affair in which neither team played well. cu pulled ahead at the very end, squandered that lead, and then were on the verge of victory before a slew of mistakes cost them the win.

the knights looked competitive in the following weeks, but they have dropped their last five. those have been competitive losses, although the same could be said about the buffs’ recent losses to kansas, houston and utah.

adding to the drama of this basement dwelling slap fight is that colorado will commemorate derrick white on the newly constructed wall of honor. white played just 34 games in a cu uniform, the last of which was an nit loss to ... the ucf knights.

perhaps colorado saw the writing on the wall — maybe they read my breakdown of a possible 0-20 season — and they wanted to inspire these buffs to avenge their bald brother.

or it’s a coincidence, a possible clue that maybe this project wasn’t well planned, and some higgsin, robys and scott, as well as a few other minor details, may have been overlooked.

ralphie report: travis hunter listed as cornerback ahead of nfl combine

the two-way star will be forced into a single position for the combine

leading up to this year’s nfl scouting combine, one of the biggest questions surrounding travis hunter was how he would be listed—cornerback, wide receiver, or both. on thursday morning, with the combine official participant list released, we finally got our answer: hunter will enter the combine as a cornerback.

this shouldn’t come as a shock to most. while he was electric on offense, his most natural position has always been at cornerback, where his elite footwork, instincts and ball skills make him a nightmare for opposing receivers. throughout the season, hunter locked down top receivers while still making highlight-reel plays on offense. his ability to completely erase one side of the field is what makes him such a unique and valuable prospect and it’s clear nfl teams see him as a generational talent in the secondary.

that said, this doesn’t mean he’s giving up on playing both ways. hunter has been vocal about his desire to continue playing receiver in the nfl and some teams could still be intrigued by the idea of utilizing him in special offensive packages. whether or not that becomes a reality will likely depend on the team that drafts him.

now, with the nfl combine set to begin on february 27th in indianapolis, all eyes will be on hunter as he prepares to showcase his athleticism, speed and coverage ability. he’s already a projected top-three pick, but a strong showing could solidify him as the first overall selection in the 2025 nfl draft (april 24-26 in green bay).

the world’s most handsome man adds another accolade.

he always had the looks, the skill and the hair to be a star. but now tristan da silva is officially a rising star, whatever that means. da silva has stepped up to the plate for the orlando magic, under the tutelage of forever buff jamahl mosley. this surprisingly plucky magic team needs his shooting and his defense with their current setup, and he has delivered. now look what happens:





rising star 

tune in to see tristan take part in #nbaallstar weekend at 7pm mt on tnt pic.nope/ivo4g0kuje

— colorado men's basketball (@cubuffsmbb) february 14, 2025​

click to expand...


da silva is averaging 25 minutes per game, 8 points per game and 4 boards per game while playing some nice defense. he’s really in a similar role that he was in for the colorado buffaloes, as a versatile offensive engine and someone who can defend 2-4. we love to see our beautiful boy grow up into a great nba player, and score it up again as another nba player found and developed by tad boyle and the buffs.

great job, tristan!

cu has 75 players on its current roster ... fans would like to fill out the roster with ten four-star transfers, but that's not realistic (or financially possible) ... if you had a budget of $2 million, with p4 transfers at $300k, how would you spend your money? ...
