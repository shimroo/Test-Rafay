2025 multiplex updates

posted on monday, december 23rd, 2024 
attn: club managers – thank you everyone for your feedback on the forms. do not use old forms.  the current forms are blue (150 bird multiplex) (updated 12/27/2024). the purple sub-gauge forms have not changed you can still use those (50 bird sub-gauge). the forms are at the bottom of this page.  when emailing your results be sure to include copies of all membership applications.  a fill-in membership form that can be saved and emailed is posted on our forms page – 2025-membership form (click to download) so you have it easily available.  if your club has conflicting shoot dates during the scheduled multiplex week and you need to reschedule contact multiplex@shootpita.com beforehand for an alternate date (48-hour notice is required).
new 2025
with the introduction of the new earned yardage table for 50-target events,  it is even more imperative that all clubs and/or cashiers submit their shoot reports and membership forms for new and renewals to the p.i.t.a. no later than 4:00 p.m. on the monday following the shoot for the multiplex. example: january multiplex is the 5 -11 reports must be received by monday, january 12, 4:00 p.m. pacific standard time.
this will enable us to keep accurate and up-to-date records for each shooter and ensure that information is accessible for shoots the following weekend.
multi-plex earned yardage is calculated on the entire number of shooters participating in the multi-plex so, we must know that number as soon as possible following the shoot.  this will enable us to calculate earned yardage so that anyone who earned yardage in the multiplex will be able to shoot the correct yardage the following weekend. a score of 50 or 49 is an automactic 1- yard punch those who shoot either of those scores should shoot the new yardage at the very next shoot.
any club who does not submit their shoot reports in a timley manner will risk revokation of their shoot certificate(s) for future shoots.
if you have any questions, please contact kay klundt at kay@shootpita.com or 208-312-0314.
