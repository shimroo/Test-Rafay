a better agricultural standardtraceability   transparency    trust












 

food alliance is a nonprofit organization that provides a comprehensive, whole system certification that addresses safe and fair working conditions, humane treatment of animals, and environmental stewardship for farmers, ranchers, and the food and beverage industries.farms, ranches, and food and beverage businesses that meet food alliance’s standards, as determined by a third-party site inspection, use food alliance certification to differentiate their products, strengthen their brands, and create transparency around social and environmental responsibility.






 






















our mission
food alliance champions farmers, ranchers, and makers creating a more resilient and sustainable food system, with practical, science-based certification standards and a shared goal of continually improving social and environmental outcomes.

our impact
businesses that use food alliance certification are addressing the complex issues that matter most to their communities. food alliance is more comprehensive than an organic certification, with standards and practices ensuring better conditions for workers, more humane treatment of livestock, reduced pesticide use, healthier soils, cleaner water, and enhanced wildlife habitat on millions of acres of range and farmland.
