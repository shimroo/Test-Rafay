alaska halibut fishing

fishing season: apr - sept
halibut - the fish that made us famous! over the years we've built a loyal following of savvy anglers who come to seward, alaska to chase halibut, the largest flatfish in the world. heated battles with these stealthy bottom predators have been known to tire arms, destroy tackle, and inspire legends.
our captains have a passion for halibut fishing and for teaching our guests the techniques most likely to pit them one-on-one with a big halibut. whether it's working a scampi jig in fluttering bursts above the ocean floor to entice a halibut bite or just dropping a big, juicy bait to the bottom and waiting for the strike, we will coach you every step of the way.

alaska salmon fishing

fishing season: king salmon may-jul; silver salmon jul-aug
fishing season: mar to oct
seward has long been recognized as the silver salmon fishing capital of alaska, and for good reason. the fishing here can be as good now as it ever was, and our captains specialize in consistently finding the action. our salmon fishing trips are hands-on fishing adventures where you might even encounter multiple species of ocean-fresh salmon in the same location. we have selected tackle on the lighter side allowing you to feel the bite and truly experience the one-on-one fight with these aggressive fish.
silver salmon are acrobatic fighters that love to leap and thrash, often making several blistering runs before succumbing to the net. that is, if they don't throw your hook first! 
the real beast in these waters is the alaskan king salmon. kings are aptly named for the sheer size they can reach, and catching a king salmon is on the bucket list of many anglers around the world. there is no place more spectacular to check this chrome-bright prize off your list than seward, alaska.

alaska lingcod and rockfish trips

fishing season: jul-sept
lingcod are a fish with an attitude! with sharp backward-angled teeth and giant-gilled heads, lingcod sure look ferocious. combined with their extremely territorial demeanor, they are skilled at handily shredding any jig dropped their way. while lingcod are often easy to hook, they prove to be an angry adversary at the end of your line. anglers love them for the fight - and they taste great too, with a succulent white flesh that rivals halibut. you'll often hook colorful rockfish at the same time - the "family friendly" fish that thrill adults and children alike!
