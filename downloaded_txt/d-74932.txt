all you wannabe pirates- here's the professional pirate talk book! the author sent me a copy for review. i have never seen a more informative, entertaining, and well-researched book about pirate talk anywhere. "the pirate primer is the first and only comprehensive guide to the world of pirate language... this is the authoritative work on the subject, containing every distinctive term, phrase, usage, and speech structure uttered by or attributed to pirates in film, television, literature, and historical accounts over the last three centuries."
