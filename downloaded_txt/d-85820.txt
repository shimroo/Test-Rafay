spam email purporting to sell sma member list







dear sma members,

please note that an unknown third-party has approached some doctors, offering to sell them the sma membership list for their own use. 

sma advises you to ignore and delete such messages, as you should with all unsolicited approaches that likely are scams. 

we wish to take this opportunity to thank members for alerting us to this spam email. sma will be making a police report on this matter.
