peter peter pumpkin eater





i keep eating.  actually, funny story - i can't stop.  i've been thinking that it's just because it's me, and i like to dig myself in as deep as i can and then worry over the overwhelming hole i've created for myself.  and yea, it is me - obviously.  and what i am about to say is going to solidify my reputation as a total retard (i truly mean that in the most politically correct way) but i think it may be because of my dog.  i was doing well - eating so healthy you would be jealous - then i took him the vet, and the next day i started eating like a pig.  i have been thinking, "wow, i'm not breaking down into uncontrollable hysterics at the possibility of having a sick dog - pretty.impressive" - yea, well, no.  i have become so accustomed to the ups and downs of being a binge eater (yea, that's right, i have an eating disorder) that i just assumed it was just another down - they often come on for no reason.  anyway, i just put the two and two together and there you have it - the reason for me being at my lowest/highest point (lowest for self-esteem, highest for weight).my dog has congestive heart failure - he is taking heart medications and is on a very strict diet.  he may very well be fine for a long time to come, but i guess i've been pushing down the twinge of fear about the alternative situation in regards to his health.  now i am thinking about it, and it's not a good thing.  this little dog has been the best companion i have had in such a long time - he loves me unconditionally, doesn't judge me, and just wants to sit around and cuddle.  he's been the only friend who hasn't, in one way or another, let me down.  he is there for me when difficult times hit, and he always remembers i'm around.  it may sound like i am a crazy animal person, and i am, but when you are a person with such a deeply-rooted respect for animals, it is acceptable to consider them "friends" or "family members".anyway, that's it - my dog is sick and i am eating pumpkin pie.

the girl who ate herself





i have this fantasy...every single day of my life, probably since the age of eighteen, i have had this day-dream that i lose this incredible amount of weight, and finally, after years of estrangement, i confront my "father".  i tell him how horribly his alienation of me has hurt.  how it has affected every corner of my life.  how i don't know if i can ever be who i am meant to be because of his neglect.these dreams are always dashed when i look in a full-length mirror and see how far i'd have to go to prove my point - that me being beautiful and thin won't change anything.  that he won't suddenly have the capability to be a true father because i am suddenly more in line with what his image of a "daughter" is.  this sick line of thinking has creeped it's way into every relationship in my life.  i cannot visit with certain people until, in my mind, i've lost a specific amount of weight.  i don't want them to look at me and see what i see - the slightly more prominent double chin, the gradual increase of the size of my arms, the way my pants fit.  i don't want them to feel about me the way i feel about myself - a mix of disgust and pity; remorse for the person i could have been if only i'd tried a little harder - if i'd eaten much less.today won't be the day i vow to change my life - the day i say, "this is it - the first day of the rest of my life".  it won't because i woke up to a breakfast of chips and diet coke.  i hope it will be tomorrow, but in my experience, that line of thinking has given me hundreds of last suppers and six week benders.  that line of thinking has given me devastating disappointment, in my mind what seems to be an extra thousand pounds, and more self-loathing than a person should have to deal with.i don't feel sorry for myself though - i am angry.  i shake with fury at the hundreds of memories i have - in grade eight, i swore that by grade nine i'd be thinner.  the year before i started university i was convinced that i could lose a hundred pounds in eight months.  when i was doing so incredibly well on l.a., i was convinced that all it took was a healthy attitude and nutritious food - that the issues which initially re-ignite my bad eating patterns could be completely ignored.  i have so much regret about lost opportunities.i am writing this because i want to make myself, in some way, accountable.  i want to be able to change my fantasy.  i want to be able to mourn for something that will never be, and then lose my dead weight for the proper reasons.

tragedy





it's weird.  the past couple of days, since the news of heath ledger's death, i have been really upset.  and i am not usually a person who gets extremely upset about celebrity death.  the only celebrities i have been genuinely upset about have been kurt cobain, phil hartman, and john ritter.  maybe because their deaths were so sudden and tragic, i really don't know.  all i know is that i have had this heaviness on my chest, making it difficult for me to focus on anything.  i was eating dinner tonight and i thought, "wow, he will never eat dinner again" - as lame as it is, the finality of everything just kind of hit me.  i see these things on the internet of the media chasing michelle williams as she tries to get into her home with her daughter.  and it breaks my heart.  i was watching the view earlier, and they spoke of the situation only briefly, which isn't a bad thing, but in the same conversation, they were laughing, and i just thought, "how can people laugh right now?  a man has lost his life, a mother and father have lost their son, and a woman and child have lost a man who probably meant the world to them".i don't know if this is some kind of subconscious pain i am having, you know, this is really me mourning my own mortality, i don't know.  all i know is that the entire situation is so incredibly sad that, at times, it kind of takes my breath away.  he was so talented.  he had a family and a two-year-old daughter.  and they will never get to see the man he was going to be.  it's just sad.

the best you can is good enough





right now i am listening to kid a.  it is weird how sometimes music is so connected to a specific memory or sense, and it's not even like you have to listen to it a lot.  i probably haven't listened to this album in years, and yet, the minute it started, i could almost put myself into the memory of when i first listened to it.  my mom had just gotten a new bathtub installed, which, if anyone had ever seen her old one, would know that was a big deal.  my good friend at the time had given kid a to me as a birthday gift, along with some bubble bath that smelled like mocha.  i remember the bathroom was super clean, and i had some candles lit, and just listened to it and was relaxed and calm.  i also remember the weather outside - there was still snow on the ground, but it was quickly melting as the weather was getting so sunny and warm with spring.and here's the funny thing.  i have so many memories like this that are attached to music, and more specifically, to the past.  that is all that i do.  think about what is behind me.  maybe it is because seeing a truly visible future is difficult for me.  not having anything to do with depression or lack of wanting a future, but just because right now, there is nothing on which to base a real future.  and while i have been sitting here, listening to a good album and looking at my past, i have realized something, maybe not revolutionary to my life, but still, a realization - maybe the reasons as to why i cannot gain control of my eating, my emotions, my dependancy on my mother, my fear of losing friends, both old and new, are all tied to the fact that i never look ahead.  while there is nothing really visible, i don't even try to imagine one.  i assume that if i let go of relationships or truly be alone in the world for awhile, that means it will always be that way.  but maybe that's the thing - it's like how people say, once you truly give in to something, that is when you get everything you really need and want. i have this new, really great job.  it makes me feel like i have some sort of place.  and yet, i refuse to quit an old job.  granted, that job was offered to me at a time when i was utterly desperate, but still, this job doesn't give me anything anymore.  so why can't i simply say good-bye, especially when those i have been closest with there are now leaving?  maybe its a step i need to take.  maybe i need to let go of these things i have been hanging on to.  it is just so hard.  unless you have had almost no friends and only one real family member you can rely on, and have lived entirely on your own, you don't know how easy it would be to just vanish.  to become someone who simply exists, and doesn't really register or matter to anyone.but maybe that is how all the people who have just disappeared and become completely alone came to be in that situation.  maybe they wouldn't let go of things that hindered them.  maybe they didn't take a chance on themselves, and just chose to go along with the days, the months, and the years instead of really living their own lives.  and i guess i have to make a choice - what is scarier - taking a chance and letting go of memories, hurt feelings, and people, or holding on to it all?

see you in the next life





i was thinking a lot today about what i want to do with my life; where i want to be in a few years.  i have almost completely decided that what i want to do is have something to do with women's shelters and programs that help women who are trying to escape from abusive situations.  maybe i am just being some kind of idealistic feminist right now, but it is just something i connect with in a very strong way.  maybe it was always supposed to be this way.  as most who know me know, my mother was abused by my father, and i was abused by my ex-stepfather - in both situations, a man had total control over the entire household, and as such, had a complete ability to bruise the lives of the people around them.  maybe by me being so interested in and passionate about women's rights and feminism, i am in some way healing myself of the emotional hits both my mother and i have taken - full circle or something.  or maybe it is just because i am so entirely sick of living a life in a patriarchal society where men can get away with so many things without a question or second thought.  maybe i don't want to live my life under the impression that a man can make me "whole" - whatever that really means, and i'd like to be a part of that realization made by someone coming out of an abusive situation.i know that next semester i am going to volunteer for the women's collective at my school.  i am also going to see about volunteering for a local shelter or something.  i think that, slowly, i am beginning to change into a very different person - a better person, and people are going to be surprised.  i am going to try really hard not to be selfish or a total bitch.  i am going to actually get off my ass and exercise, get that whole situation sorted out, and i am going to change.  it's funny, so much of my time is wasted, pining away for a life i don't have - boyfriend, living together, travelling, all of that.  i get jealous of my friends who have boy issues because i am not there in any way, and far from it - this all connects to that fact that my "biological clock" has been ticking since i was eleven.  but on the other hand, i feel so lucky.  i am learning to be truly happy on my own - as my own authentic person.  most of my friends, even female family members, are not, and may never be at that point.  they depend so heavily on the idea of fulfillment as something only connected to having a boyfriend or a mate, and in response to that thought, they sometimes make bad decisions or get into situations where they no longer have control over their own lives.  while i want that someday, very badly, to be married to a tall, dark, and handsome man, and have children, i know that true success only comes with being complete with yourself, and until that happens, true happiness with another cannot be accomplished.  and i am proud of that - the fact that i am slowly becoming hapy with who i am as a human being, and it being totally unrelated to how men view me.  however, i will admit that being hit on by creepy, middle-aged, mexican men does push me to go on the treadmill a bit more.however, despite my realization about the future, i still want to have something to do with animals, because so much of who i am is based on my love and utter respect for them.  until recently, i have been so bogged down by emotional crap that i couldn't even deal with attempting to think about the future, but at this moment, i am having some clarity, so i wanted to write down my thoughts.

dirty old man





today i am feeling like shit.for a while last summer, it seemed as though, for me, things were looking up.  a year of school done with good grades, losing weight, steady part-time job - everything felt okay.  november rolled around, and the fog of bad eating, not giving a crap about school, and losing all self-control fell over me, and until a week okay, i had completely given up hope.  suddenly, i realized that if i ever want to be relatively close to my ideal - husband, health, maybe some kids, i have to get my act together.the shitty thing about losing hope and then finding it again is this: suddenly, you are looking forward to tomorrow; the future, and while looking ahead, you realize how far you still have to go.  until a week ago, since november, i have not cared.  i would wake up, go to school or work, talk to friends, all under the guise that i was okay - meanwhile, i would go home every night and cry and sit and eat and numb the pain of whatever it is that picks away at my soul.  now, i care, and am feeling a bit better.  i am just pissed off that i have let my "life" get to this point.  i am so far removed from my ideal, and it sometimes seems like it is too steep a hill to climb.this is all because some creepy old guy asked me out today.  how lame is that?  i couldn't even pretend to be polite or somewhat gracious - i just let my utter disgust become apparent.  and i was truly revolted.  why could he possibly think that i could ever say "yes" to a request such as that?  i might be overweight and alone, but i do not care how much society says i should settle - i am not that desperate!so yea - today, i feel like shit.
