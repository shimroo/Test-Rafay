pick-up service available


to use our free pick-up service, call your budget rental location directly at the location phone number listed on your reservation confirmation. pick-up service policies (hours of availability, allowable pick-up distance, etc.) vary by location so it's important that you call the location and make arrangements for pick-up at least 24 hours before your desired rental time. when you call the location, be ready to provide all applicable information including precise address, exact time of pick up, and a phone number where you can be reached at that time. please note that an off-airport budget location cannot pick you up at an airport that has a budget location. in this case, either you must rent your car at the airport location, or provide your own transportation to the off-airport location where you prefer to rent

does car rental include fuel?











to ensure a seamless start to your journey, our vehicles are rented with a full tank of fuel. it would be appreciated if the vehicle was also returned with a full tank; however, if this is not possible, a refuelling charge will be applicable. the option of pre-paid fuel is on offer at select locations, and the exact rate of the refuelling charge will be available upon vehicle collection.
