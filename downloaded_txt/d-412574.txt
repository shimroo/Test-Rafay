“john kenna, owner of water, color & stone is incredible at what he does. he is an expert at many forms of landscapes and walkways using all kinds of stone, beautiful stone walls built to withstand the test of time, recreational areas with built-in fire pits and grilling areas, and the list goes on. he can take the most boring front yard or back yard and make it into a place of beauty and escape even if the house is in the middle of an urban area.”
