we are committed to guiding you through the claims process with care and determination.
learn more about asbestos claims.


the government have today (24th october 2024) announced that the estates of certain deceased infected victims of the contaminated blood scandal can, from today (24th october 2024), apply for an interim payment of £100,000 under the infected blood compensation scheme.

making the claim for this interim payment on behalf of an estate of a deceased person can be very complex. in scotland the claim can only be made by the executor of the estate. an executor can only be appointed by the deceased’s will or if the deceased died intestate (with no will) by the court. there are strict rules about how the executor distributes the deceased’s estate to family members and other beneficiaries. this includes compensation such as the interim payments announced today.
in terms of our fees, we will not charge you any fee for completing and submitting the application for the interim payment. we expect our fees for applying for an award under the infected blood compensation scheme to be met under the scheme and by the government. the government will pay up to £1,500 for legal costs for executry work. we will defer our fee until the interim payment is received in order that applying for the interim payment will not put you out of pocket.
thompsons are experts in the infected blood compensation scheme and are here to help and guide you through this complex process. if you would like to apply for the £100,000 interim payment on behalf of the estate of a deceased infected blood victim complete our online form and we will be in touch with you.
please note: not all estates can apply for the interim payment at this stage, although other estates will be able to apply for an interim and a final award in the hopefully near future. at this stage an estate can apply if:

the infected victim was registered with an infected blood support scheme (such as sibss), the macfarlane trust, the eileen trust, the skipton fund, the caxton foundation or mfet ltd before 17 april 2024
neither the deceased, their spouse nor their estate has received an interim payment as a result of the recommendations of the infected blood inquiry or under the infected blood compensation scheme
