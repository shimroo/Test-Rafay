welcome to 
              shepherd church
in everything we do at shepherd, we seek to lift up christ so that the world would believe (john 3:14-15 and john 12:32). we want to come alongside you in your journey with god, so that as you are saved in christ and become strong in christ, you can serve christ and share him with others!
