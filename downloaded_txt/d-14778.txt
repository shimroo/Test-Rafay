‘more black designers’ is the new black

the 2024 mcdonald’s change of fashion program is focused on driving change when it comes to black representation in fashion. the industry frequently pulls inspiration from black culture, but doesn’t always embrace black creatives. after all, only 7.3% of american fashion designers are black.*
so, we’re pairing five, rising black designers with five fashion insiders for career-changing mentorships. the program will also provide access and resources, and give their brands a chance to shine.
