living on marco island, fl: what to know before you move
  

a palm tree-lined paradise surrounded by the gorgeous blue-green waters of the gulf of mexico, marco island is a dream destination for florida homebuyers.
with warm, sunny weather year-round, beautiful beaches, abundant outdoor recreation, and premier shopping, dining, and golf — life on marco island feels like a vacation every day!
thinking about buying your next home on marco island? here’s everything you need to know before making the move.
 about marco island
photo credit: katherine welles 
situated just off the coast of southwest florida in collier county, marco island is part of an island chain known as the ten thousand islands. it is the largest and most populous of the ten thousand islands, covering about 24 square miles, with around 16,500 permanent residents. during the winter, the population more than doubles as seasonal “snowbirds” come down to escape the cold winters of the northern states.
 who lives here 
the population on marco island consists of a mix of families and single residents, as well as a large community of retirees. with plentiful sunshine, beautiful beaches, and an abundance of outdoor recreation and golf, marco island is one of the most sought-after retirement cities in florida. there’s also growing interest in marco island among remote workers and families looking for a more leisurely lifestyle, as represented in the city’s booming real estate market.
 the marco island lifestyle 
a splendid blend of beautiful beaches, unspoiled nature, and outdoor recreation, marco island offers a fun, leisurely island lifestyle. it’s also a haven for boaters, kayakers, anglers, and pretty much anyone who enjoys being on the water.

 marco island weather 
like all of south florida, marco island has a tropical climate, which translates to mostly sunny, breezy, warm weather year-round with hotter, rainier summers and cooler, drier winters.

 cost of living on marco island 
the overall cost of living on marco island ranks 13% higher than the national average, with housing costs being the main factor, ranking at 169% higher — but this is typical for island living in florida. while the cost of living on marco island may be higher, florida does not have any state income tax, so depending on where you’re moving from, you may still see some savings in your annual expenses.
 marco island safety 
marco island is one of the safest cities in florida; in fact, it was ranked the #1 safest city in florida for 2024 by safewise. statistically speaking, marco island is considered 68% safer than the national average and has extremely low crime rates. of the reported crimes on marco island, most involve non-violent, theft-related incidents. the city also employs full-time police, fire rescue, and emergency healthcare services for residents.
 marco island schools 
marco island has several top-rated schools serving pre-k-12 students, including public, private, and charter school options. students seeking higher education have access to several colleges and universities, as well as technical schools, less than an hour away in the neighboring cities of naples and fort myers.
 things to do on marco island 
marco island is full of beautiful beaches and waterways, nature preserves, and premier shopping, dining, and golf. it’s also just a short drive away from the florida everglades, naples, bonita springs, and other popular southwest florida destinations, so there are always plenty of fun things to do!
 explore the beaches & go shelling
photo credit: paul harrison 
marco island has six miles of picture-perfect beaches to enjoy, including marco beach and tigertail beach, which are famous for their sugar white sand, turquoise waters, and abundance of seashells. whether you prefer strolling, swimming, or shelling, marco island beaches are some of the best in the world!
 take advantage of fishing, boating, & watersports
photo credit: sunflowermomma 
with the gulf of mexico to the west, numerous bays and coves to the east, and nearly 100 miles of inshore waterways, there’s no shortage of things to do on the water on marco island. enjoy fishing, boating, kayaking, paddleboarding, and much more in this island paradise.
 explore golf, nature, & outdoor recreation
photo credit: sunflowermomma 
whether you prefer hitting the hiking trail or the back nine, marco island has plenty of gorgeous greenery, wildlife, and seaside sights that will take your breath away. play a round of golf at the island country club, take a stroll through the marco island nature preserve and bird sanctuary, or enjoy a leisurely bike ride along one of the many bike paths around the island.
