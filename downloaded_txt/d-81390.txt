viasat satellite internet will get you online with a secure connection for all the devices in your home. you’ll have a wired and a wireless connection and you can use both at the same time to bring the internet to all your enabled devices. viasat will provide all the equipment you need for your internet signal and will professionally install all of it so you’re online before the technician leaves your home. within no time you’ll be working online, streaming shows, shopping, managing your finances, and so much more.
you’ll get the satellite dish that will be installed and secured outside your home, along with a modem and a wi-fi router. the modem and router may be combined into one unit. the modem will connect to your dish via a cable that your installer will run from the dish to inside your home. the modem translates the internet signal coming from the dish for use with your devices. the wi-fi router picks up the signal and makes it available to all your wi-fi enabled devices. you’ll set up a secure wi-fi network in your home for all your devices so that you won’t have to be wired in the router to be online. viasat will maintain the equipment and provide free technical support whenever you have a question. you’ll also download the viasat mobile app on your smart phone to allow you to manage your account, check your data use, and more. 
satellite internet is a great solution for getting online in rural and remote communities. even in cases where federal funding has been allocated for increasing internet access that access may not be implemented yet due to challenges with infrastructure, labor, regulations, administrative delays, and so on. satellite internet doesn’t depend on trenches being dug or wires beings strung anywhere. ground stations intercept the radio signal coming from the satellites and transmit that to your satellite dish at home. depending on the carrier you choose there could be one or two very large satellites in space or a series of very tiny satellites that hand off signals from one to the other and transmit to dishes on the ground. because these satellites are in space their signals can overcome topographical challenges. 
depending on your location, you’ll have a range of viasat internet plans to choose from and will have the option to also add phone service.  viasat plans start as low as $50 per month for slower download speeds of up to 12 mbps and go up to $200 for faster download speeds of up to 50 mbps. it’s a wide range to fit your budget. a download speed of 25 mbps qualifies as broadband and viasat has plans at that level as well. for a general browsing and email, streaming standard-definition video, shopping and social media, the slower speed will suffice. but for telecommuting or streaming hd content you’ll require a higher-speed data plan. all viasat plans are unlimited data insofar as you do have a fast-data monthly cap after which your data continues to be unlimited but is de-prioritized (slows down) until the new billing period starts.
