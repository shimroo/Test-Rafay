                                       i have trained at martial arts america for over 9 years to attain my blackbelt.

as a hyper kid with little self control my mom decided that martial arts would be a good way to learn self discipline. for 9 years, our head teacher as we affectionately call mr. t trained us. i grew mentally and emotionally becoming a confident disciplined student in both high school and our martial arts studio.

                                       i started tae kwon do here at the age of 4 1/2.

i recommend this program to anybody looking for self-improvement. it has transformed me in ways that could not have been done by any other program. thank you martial arts america for becoming an integral part of me, shaping me for my future.

                                       my 8 year old son has been training with martial arts america in fremont, ca for nearly 3 years now and he absolutely loves it. his confidence level grows with each new belt rank as do his skills as a martial artist and as a quality human being.
