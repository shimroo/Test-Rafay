happy new year from all of us at gwb!about great wine buysgreat wine buys is portland's oldest independent wine shop - established in 1984. we're located where the irvington and lloyd neighborhoods meet in the inner northeast. we stock over 1500 wines from the world's top wine regions, including more than 400 from some of the northwest's best (and hard to find) wineries. our size allows us to be selective - we taste almost everything to make sure it's worthy before putting it on the shelf - so our friendly staff can help you pick the perfect wine for any occasion. we offer case discounts, tastings, food and wine pairing suggestions, wedding planning and registry, glassware, accessories, nationwide shipping, and much more.
