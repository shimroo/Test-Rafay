welcome to xmlblaster home page




what is xmlblaster?
         xmlblaster is mom (message oriented middleware) with a lot of features.
         
         xmlblaster is a publish/subscribe and point to point mom server
         (message-oriented middleware) which exchanges
         messages between publishers and subscribers. the message is described
         with  xml-encoded meta information. messages may contain everything,
         gif images, java objects, python scripts, xml data, a word document, plain text - just anything.
         
         communication with the server is based on corba, xmlrpc, rmi or socket, and
         subscribers can use xpath expressions to filter the messages they
         wish to receive.
         if for some clients corba is too rigid as communication
         protocol, other protocols like email or http may be plugged in.
         
         xmlblaster uses the sun xml parser for xml parsing, and xt from
         james clark for xsl parsing.
         
         this is the publish/subscribe middleware server you have needed many times
         before, now available for free to glue together your distributed client/server application.
         
         the xmlblaster server is pure java.
         note that perl, c/c++ and java (applications, applets, servlets) client demos are in the xmlblaster testsuite,
         and we are working on tcl and python demo clients.
         you should be ready to go with your preferred development language.
            
features:

free for private,commercial,education use (lgpl - license)
message orientated middleware (mom)
language neutral (corba / jacorb)
