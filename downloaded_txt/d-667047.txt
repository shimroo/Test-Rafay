murphy beds are by far the best way to handle your housing situation if you have a small space and many people living there. you can even put a murphy bed in a studio apartment. studios are becoming mainstream in large cities and this is by far the best way to handle the living situations because you can have a couch under your bed or even a desk.
murphy beds come in all sizes- from king, queen, double, and even singles. you can also get many types of finished wood and even a particleboard (not as good of a quality as real wood). when you choose the right murphy bed you want to make sure you measure your apartment first.there is shelving behind a murphy bed so you want to make sure it’s going to fit in the apartment and lay it out properly. if you do not have an apartment that you can actually measure properly, you can always go online and find a map that is going to show how your house is laid out. make sure your murphy bed is a high-quality product because this is something you’ll be moving daily and putting away so you can use the space for other things. a lot of times people keep their murphy bed down. once the bed is made, you can put the bed away easily. you could even have a guest sleep on it.
high quality materials are used best for a desk and a murphy bed combination. you need to make sure that they can handle the motion from set up to settling down. make sure that you are buying a high-quality product that is finished well because you want to make sure you don’t spin through the wood with low quality labor and low quality wood.
the couch and the bed are also very important. you do not want the couch to be too firm because guests will not use it if it’s too firm. and also how the bed layers to the back is really important. if it’s not a long enough couch then people will not feel it’s comfortable either. if you’re looking for a bed, this is your place to start.
when you’re setting up your murphy bed you want to make sure that you strap it against the wall, as this will secure your bed when putting stuff on the shelves. if the bed shakes too much things will fall off the shelves so make sure you secure your bed to the wall. use the right brackets as you want to make sure it’s earthquake proof if you live in california. this makes your bed and living situation more solid.
