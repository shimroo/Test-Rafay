customer testimonial about cleaning aluminum horse trailer with streak master’s aluminum trailer cleaner and black streak and stain remover






































when i have an aluminum trailer problem, i jump over to barrel horse world forum and see if i can get answers. i usually find the answer without even posting. my aluminum and white skinned horse trailer got out of hand and when i had it done last at the truck wash with the aluminum brightener it still looked bad. i started to ask about an aluminum trailer cleaner i could use myself. i came over to this forum and saw the advertisement for this aluminum trailer cleaner. i was skeptical and my husband told me to save my money. a few weeks ago, i saw the advertisement again on barrel horse world. when i saw..money back guarantee...i thought why not? i ordered but kept everything i needed so i could send it back. yesterday my husband and i got after it with him telling me it wasn't going to get the oxidation, bugs and black streaks off the painted aluminum trailer area and the aluminum trailer cleaner and brightener wasn't going to cut thru whatever i got on it when i went to the car wash to fix what the truck wash didn't. we were both amazed as the bugs, oxidation and black streaks came off the white skin aluminum horse trailer so easily. the aluminum trailer cleaner, brightener, and restorer was even easier to use..wow! thanks greg and thanks for being so nice on the phone when i asked a bunch of questions about my aluminum horse trailer.best aluminum horse trailer cleaner, brightener, and restorerthank you, kathie, for the pictures and testimonial about cleaning your horse trailerrefences: aluminum cleaner black streak remover  pontoon cleaner
