welcome

                                                are you ready to shape the future as a computer scientist?
                                                as our lives increasingly move online, we need thoughtful and christ-centered problem solvers to create the technology that allows our economies to function.
                                                think about what you could achieve—and the influence you can have—in such a dynamic field!
                                            

                                                our graduates have made their mark at companies including amazon, nike, boeing, mcafee, microsoft, intel, and oracle.
                                                are you ready to bring your influence to some of the most innovative companies across the globe?
                                            

                                                our program will introduce you to the fundamental principles and mechanisms of modeling, abstraction and problem-solving using computers, with an emphasis on core technical skills, real-world problem solving, and hands-on experience.
                                            

                                                we invite you to learn more about our program, explore our majors and minors, and catch up on the latest news & updates.
