sustainable production practices



protecting and preserving forests by using high post-consumer recycled fiber products to replace virgin fiber.



reducing pressure on our waste stream creating more demand for wastepaper and increasing use of recycled fiber.



decreasing water usagerecycled paper manufacturing to make high post-consumer recycled fiber papers uses up to 25% less water vs. virgin paper.



reducing greenhouse-gas emissions 



reducing the amount of wastepaper sent to landfills reduces decomposition, and trees continue to sequester carbon in forests.



the manufacture of high post-consumer recycled fiber products requires less energy than virgin paper production.
