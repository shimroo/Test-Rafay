'i love music, yeah, music is my life" - that's what henry told us a few years back - playing the cello at the front https://t.co/wmqfftzq4y 1 year ago our amazing open orchestra performed at beverly school last week, we keep getting bigger and better. #celebrateartsmark @openorchestras https://t.co/6tfkfprgij 1 year ago thank you to the wonderful @livemusicnowuk for the performance from harpist ruth. our students enjoyed watching her perform, interacting and asking questions. https://t.co/o0kmjhpt8a 1 year ago
