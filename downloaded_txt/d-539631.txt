the center regularly hosts iconic exhibitions, festivals, concerts, master classes, film screenings, theatrical premieres, and artists’ workshops.
in the wake of general interest in loft projects (re-equipment of industrial buildings), the territory of the former factory was transferred to the center for contemporary art. today, the center has become a real focus of cultural forces: exhibitions, biennials, festivals, concerts, master classes are held on its territory, author’s galleries, schools and workshops work.
the center for contemporary art regularly hosts iconic exhibitions, festivals, lectures, film screenings, concerts, and theatrical premieres. art galleries are located on its territory.
guests can visit the creative workshops of renowned artists, designers and photographers.there are also various educational projects functioning here.
in search of an answer to the crisis of modernity, philosophy associates itself with art.differences are understood here as a resource for mutual understanding and mutual enrichment of understandings. distancing in relation to the imposed identity is proposed; aestheticization of one’s own personality; self-presentation in the context of cultural diversity; the politicization of the self in individual aesthetic experience.
the world of art becomes a place where active self-formation and comprehension of the future fullness of human existence takes place. the museum of contemporary art can be viewed as a space for self-identification. research into the processes of identity formation with the help of contemporary art remains relevant.
