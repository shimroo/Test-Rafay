the latest:  eaton fire in altadena•  service interrupted —  scheduling is on hold.  if you have a confirmed service coming up, i’ll be in touch.  if you would like pilates equipment maintenance in the future, please visit the service page.•  online posting ongoing — don’t miss the latest in used pilates equipment for sale, pilates teacher employment,  studio space for rent, and pilates studios for sale. updated february 18.•  the eaton fire destroyed our adorable altadena home and everything in it.    cindy and i are safe and comfortably evacuated. •  our friends have organized a gofundme for cindy and mikael, and we are very amazed and appreciative. •  world central kitchen is the real deal.  feed the hungry people high quality food, that’s it.  wow.•  the people of “the denas” (altadena / pasadena) and surrounding communities have stepped up mightily to support one another.  the lincoln ave christian church, the fraternal order of eagles on woodbury, the pasadena job center and la michoacana de dena on lake ave, the assumption of the blessed virgin mary on orange grove ave, flintridge center on mountain st, and be pilates on washington are just some of the places we have seen people volunteering, giving, sharing, and lifting in-and-up.  • a big thanks to the businesses who have donated, especially van’s shoes and clothing, old navy, vouri, j crew, and the local pasadena shoe heroes at run with me.•  some dear friends and neighbors lost their “everything” too:  cindy has been friends with cynthia bassham since university of washington.  now a theatre and voice professor, cynthia — along with her husband, the renowned audiobook narrator simon vance — returned to find their home and neighborhood reduced to ashes.  [gofundme for cynthia and simon].  and mikael has been friends with sheetal gandhi since college days.  now a pilates teacher, sheetal, her brilliant husband sattva, and their 2 small children fled their altadena home as the fire approached.  the fire left nothing behind.  [gofundme for sheetal and sattva].•  if you “love your apparatus”, you may recognize the photo above as the remains of a balanced body reformer.  the metal risers are visible at the top, the revo springbar is near the bottom, and in the lower right corner of the photo is the bolt that secured the footbar to the wood frame.-- mikael salazar, the pilates guy llc
