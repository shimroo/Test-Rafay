                                       my kids have only been going for a short time but the instructors are great with all the kids. they are so patient even with my son who has a hard time focusing. i get asked every day if they get to go to karate. it is great to see them excited to go and i love watching the classes. i don't think we could have found a better place. give them a try you won't be disappointed.

                                       we love apollo's! everyone who works there plays such an important roll in the kids lives. the confidence boost alone would keep us coming back but the kindness, compassion & discipline shown from everyone is not something you would get at just any karate place. they are more like family. they get to know each and every child personally and go out of their way to make them feel special.

                                       hello, i am a 32 yr old female, and i have never been in shape before; didn't even do sports as a kid. my friend convinced me to come to class with her. i started may 1st at apollo's and after 1 month of working through the initial soreness is when my addiction began. i love taking the karate and cardio classes. i enjoy that my workout is learning a valuable life skill. i was never happy with weights, treadmills, bootcamps, or zumba type things. it was tedious and i couldn't make myself enjoy it. at apollo's, instead of focusing on the numbers on the scale, i am trying to perfect my technique on a punching combo or a back thrust kick! i am moving up the chain of karate belts and becoming better every month. i was losing weight on the scale with just dieting, but in the last 4 months i've lost 2 pant sizes! (disclaimer: i come 4+ times a week and am kinda dieting.) the biggest positive is that it's a fun, thorough workout that doesn't get boring, and between the staff and students, you will feel like part of a family.

                                       apollo's has enriched and changed my life, benefiting me both physically and mentally. not only does my training keep me motivated to stay in shape, while giving me the tools i might need to defend myself or my family.
