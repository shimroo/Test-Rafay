                            bermuda to woods hole. in this 5-week program, students 
                            learned oceanography and conducted research at sea.

project 
                    oceanica's goal is to integrate education with oceanographic 
                    research and exploration, and to develop educational resources 
                    and programs available to college and high school students, 
                    as well as to k-12 educators. project oceanica was established 
                    in august, 2001 with initial support from the noaa 
                    ocean service – coastal 
                    services center. currently, oceanica receives funding 
                    from a variety of sources and is housed within the college 
                    of charleston's department 
                    of geology & environmental geosciences.
