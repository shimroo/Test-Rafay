walking the red carpet at the jackass 3-d premiere





october 13th was the big hollywood premiere of jackas 3-d with a red carpet.  rick kosick from the jackass 3-d crew told me to come onto the red carpet with the cast.  johnny knoxville, my best friend, and i were interviewed on tv on the red carpet and we took pictures together.  the showing of the movie was so funny and awesome.  i'm at the end of the movie.  on the left side of the screen, the credits are rolling while the picture of the movie is still going with me in the middle of the right side of the screen doing my prank with preston lacy.

i'm heading to washington to meet president obama





to help support the historic signing of rosa's law, i will be traveling to washington on friday.  the bill will ban the use of "mentally retarded" and "mental retardation" in relevant federal laws.this is a huge step forward in our efforts to eliminate the word "retarded" as a derogatory phrase aimed at people with disabilities.

my appearance on "fox & friends" to protest the ben stiller movie "tropic thunder"





fans and friends,i am on the board of directors for special olympics international and tim shriver the chairman and ceo for special olympics wanted me to go on this t.v. show fox and friends with him and talk about this movie called tropic thunder with ben stiller. this movie makes fun of people with disabilities by calling them retard 17 times in the movie and tim shriver and i were talking about how this movie should be boycotted.tropic thunder even makes fun of people who have different races.the actors who performed in this movie are not respecting people with disabilities.using the word retard is hurtful and painful.people with disabilities have feelings just like anyone else.i am greatful the the hosts had me speak out and have me express my feelings.thank you so much for letting me on the show with my bestfriend tim shriver.hopefully you will invite me again to talk on your show.thank you for everything you've done.to watch, please click on the link below"fox & friends clip 8/14/08"

big man on high school campus





last week, i went back to high school.coral springs high school hosted a special screening of the ringer projected on the football field, but i missed the screening because i was working late. the main thing was that denise from the leadership group told me that your fans are here to meet you. so i signed their autographs and took some photos with them and they called up thier friends and girlfriends and boyfriends and i spoke to them and i said some lines to them from the movie. then i went back home feeling good about myself.

the dark can't hide this kind of fame





it was 1 a.m. on tuesday.  the power went out i waited 6 hours for the florida power and light company to arrive.  when the repair man came he held a 12 volt flashlight to determine the cause of the problem- then suddenly he said to me as he put his flashlight directly on my face "where do i know you from?"  "the ringer," i said. "yeah man that was the movie with johnny knoxville you were his roommate - it was very funny!"
