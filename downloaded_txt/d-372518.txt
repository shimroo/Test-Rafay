finally, an update





 my wip list – update of this old list1. weaver’s mini shawl – measures fifteen inches and it is growing – worked on it some during vacation.  has been finished for a while, and wearing it today, have already made another.  2. anniversary shawl – need to join new skein in an invisible way. joined, finished, did not like, frogged, the yarn in the process of becoming a baby blanket. 3. red shawl - made with brown sheep cotton fleece.  no progress, have not even looked at it for a while.  4. blue toe-up sock – on the foot, done with the toe increases.  completed, gave away.  5. washcloths, always a washcloth.  yep…6. wool shawl – my longest running project, simple triangle and very boring. i have been working on it for at least 3 years. i worked on this some a couple of months ago. the end is in site. have been contemplating a border. same spot as before.7. bulky sweater – about 8 inches into the remake of this. i made it once and had to frog as it was way too big even though i checked gage and everything. too bulky for a carry along project. hopefully i can work on it soon as i want to wear it this fall.  still not finished.  have been taking it to knit night and working at least one row.  8. highland triangle shawl – made with black silky wool. not much progress on this lately, as it requires concentration and a good light.  frogged.  the edges were not working; the pattern bored me in black.  will probably try again in a different yarn and color.  but not any time soon.  9. cozy – made with knitpicks memories sock yarn in the easter color way. i am on the second all of yarn. second ball color was off.  project frogged.  never want to try cozy again.  this yarn is slated to be made into an entrelac bag.  10. missy lace scarf – on the body and i think on the second pattern repeat.  worsted version frogged.  11. baby blanket – definitely on the back burner.  still on that back burner, considering frogging.  12. fluffy neck ring on the round loom thingy – doesn’t grow much cause i would rather use needles, but this yarn does not want to cooperate with needles so it went on the loom thingy.  still lounging in the closet awaiting an inspiration to work on it.  13. camo hat about to be frogged since it came off of the needles in my bag. i don’t even remember this project.  14. bulky variegated shawl – finally found the yarn and need to get back at it. will go very quick. finished.  it generally is the shawl that is at my desk to ward off the a/c chill.  new wip list – 1.    happy feet socks.  easy take along sock project.  supposed to be for me, want them to be taller so i can wear them with my boots.  2.    multi directional scarf.  easy pattern, cheap yarn, mindless project.  have several planned from other cheap yarns.  3.    baby blanket.  was supposed to have finished last friday.  did not finish yet, had a yarn barf delay.  rethinking whom to give it to.  i have several things ready to start and even more things that have caught my interest.

storms





just a quick update about us and the storms that rolled thru tuesday night.  the bad stuff was either south or east of us.  we were not without drama.  when we left work, it was still dripping a bit and it appeared that the main storm had passed that area.  we got about halfway home and traffic slowed to a stop.  it started slowly moving soon.  when we saw the area with the flashing lights, we saw that several people were being turned around but that others were being let thru.  when we got closer, we saw that all of the trucks and suvs were going thru but that the cars were being turned around.  since we now have a suv with decent clearance, we were allowed thru.  about a mile further up the road, the water was over the road at least 6 inches deep for about 10 feet of the road.  we made it thru with no problem.  by the time we got home, we were not even using the windshield wipers as the rain had stopped.  we did get a little more rain and lots of wind before it was all over.  if we looked out the back of the house, we saw an awesome sunset beneath the clouds.  when we looked out the front of the house, we saw a double rainbow in the foreground but the dark storms on the back ground.  the rainbow was really neat looking.

finally, an update





i recently won an ebay auction of wool yarn in the hanks that was extremely smoke-stink-strong.  i could not tolerate even petting the yarn.  i bought a cheap bag of potpourri from wal-mart that had a pretty strong smell.   i poured a good portion of the chips into an airtight bag (with the yarn) and closed it securely.  i left it that way for a few weeks and it now smells fine.  i wound it over the weekend and had no problems with it. we had pretty high winds over the weekend; saturday was gusts of 60+.  i sat in my chair by the patio door and watched the overhead power lines skip like jump ropes.  plenty of dirt flying around too.  the doggies did not want to go out at all and i did not blame them.  i only ventured out a couple of times to rescue things that i realized were blowing away.  we lost 3 of our 5 hummingbird feeders that we had neglected to take down yet.  our security light appears to have lost either the bulb or the wires leading up to it broke.  the power company is coming out to fix that.  but the main loss was that the back side of our kinda barn blew out.  we had wanted to redo it so now we have the reason to do it.  we are not sure if our homeowners insurance would be of help (not sure of the breakdown of the outbuildings on the insured items and it if would be more than the deductible) so do not know if we will be making a claim yet. i did get some knitting done on saturday.  i knitted the cuddly bunny in the dmc senso on size 2 needles.  it is white with flecks of pink and purple in it.  i have to assemble it.  it is only about 3 inches across so i decided to make a pacifier holder with it for a friend who is due in may.  i just need to figure out an appropriate fastener to hold it to the baby.  i did a couple of more rows on the wool shawl yesterday.  i know it will soon be to hot to work on it, so i want to get it done.  i so want to start another project.  i really really really really need to work on the ufos that i already have, but start-itis it really starting to bite me…. i found some metallic stuff (on clearance at hl for really cheap) that is like the perl cotton for the perditas, decided to wind it, did not think i needed the swift since it was so small of a hank and i had to wind it by hand as well.  the first hank was fine.  the second, my favorite, a sparkly dark royal blue, started to wind it, and next thing i knew it was a tangled mess.  the metallic element made it almost impossible to untangle and by the time i did, the metallic filament broke.  wahhh.  at least it was not expensive stuff…
