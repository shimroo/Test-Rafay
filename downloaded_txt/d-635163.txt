customer feedback



john was the person working with me. he was courteous, very professional in his contact with me. never a problem with him whatsoever.

i would give the people at gerber collision on amos avenue in baltimore 10 stars if i could! becky, rod, and famous amos deserve bonuses, if not raises, for their 1st class customer service. we live in a world where professionalism, courtesy, flexibility and kindness are in short supply, but this team is off the charts with it! thank you for a painless process, and the return of my car in better shape than i gave it to you. they even cleaned the inside! wow. greatly appreciated and would recommend your services to anyone.
