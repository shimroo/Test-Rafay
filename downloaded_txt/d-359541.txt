australia's genetics institute for agricultureaustralia's genetics institute for agricultureaustralia's genetics institute for agricultureaustralia's genetics institute for agricultureaustralia's genetics institute for agriculturevale andrew swan vale dr andrew swan, chief scientist, animal genetics and breeding unit (agbu), a joint venture between the nsw department of primary industries and regional development and the university of new england. the world lost a tremendous person on 14 december, 2024 in professor andrew swan who was known to many as simply ‘swanny’. andrew was doing one of the things he loved in this world and that was cycling. he was racing with the armidale cycling team on a remote road outside armidale as he had done many times before on a sunny saturday afternoon when four of the cyclists were tragically hit by a car. andrew died at the scene. andrew had a few loves in his life and his love for his wife kim, deputy director at agbu was obvious to all who knew them. together they raised three children and recently were thrilled to step into a new chapter as grandparents, with the grandkids also calling andrew 'swanny’. besides a strong member of the local cycling community and devoted family man andrew was a giant in his field of animal breeding and sheep genetics research globally. he combined capability with humility, two traits that don’t often trend together but are both required for meaningful impact in industry outcomes and also in the lives of those he worked with.  andrew grew up in the riverina region of new south wales near wagga wagga, before attending the university of new england and graduating b. rur. sci. with ﬁrst class honours in 1986. his honours research project was on crossbreeding hereford and simmental cattle, and with that background he joined the animal genetics and breeding unit as a phd student studying multibreed genetic evaluation methods under the supervision of hans graser and brian kinghorn. following his phd studies, he moved to the csiro animal production laboratory at chiswick near armidale and began a long career in sheep breeding. at the time the industry was dealing with the crash of the reserve price scheme and an over-supply of stockpiled wool, so the focus of breeding research turned to improving wool quality using new objective measurement technology.  at the same time andrew was participating in the development of the breeder-led system of sire evaluation trials run by the australian merino sire evaluation association (amsea). working with the advanced breeding services group of nsw agriculture (now nsw dpird), he contributed to the across-ﬂock evaluations published in merino superior sires from the early 1990s. as a result of this involvement andrew joined the sheep genetics technical committee in 2004 which developed the ﬁrst industry-wide merino genetic evaluation launched as merinoselect in 2005. following this landmark industry achievement, andrew joined agbu in 2006 to continue working on the merinoselect and lambplan evaluation systems delivered through meat and livestock australia’s sheep genetics service. in subsequent years andrew contributed to the introduction of breeding values for new traits, including carcase and eating quality traits, components of reproduction, and breech ﬂy-strike indicators, and selection indexes focused on breeder needs and strategic industry targets. andrew also participated in the development of genomic resources and technologies in the sheep crc, assisting in the transition of merinoselect and lambplan to genomic evaluations. in 2022, andrew was the first to step into a new chief scientist role for agbu where he had greater reach across the genetic improvement portfolio including influence on beef evaluations through breedplan. most recently andrew was quite energised working with the agbu team he mentored to develop a combined lambplan evaluation including both maternal and terminal sheep. he was also looking forward to push the frontier on multi-breed genetic evaluations for beef cattle, coming back to the roots of his phd. andrew’s talents were broad and besides a deep understanding of genetic evaluation methods and programming he was also quite talented in multiple-trait economic selection decisions and recently built a new platform called biodex to better model animal growth and feed requirements,  which is going to be critical to breed for lower emissions. ‘swanny’ will be remembered not just for his scientific acumen but for those that had the pleasure of his company, his dry wit and strong commitment to make sure those around him were enjoying life. at an agbu christmas party, he was able to convince colleagues to not only buy bikes but to commit to training for a multi-day bike ride to support cancer research. this quickly evolved, a peloton of 20+ at times, bringing together work colleagues from agbu and across the wider academic and industry community. the friendships built under the duress of a steep hill, and the laughs shared, made for a stronger team in the face of adversity. he had built a strong team of early career scientists, a sure sign of leadership.  the livestock industries in australia and globally have suffered a deep loss. a talented scientist and friend to many, devoted to quietly making change and helping others along the way.  researchfor nearly 50 years agbu has been researching genetic markers that improve the healthiness and productivity of a range of species.using massive datasets on animals and plants worldwide and creating highly complicated algorithms, our team delivers knowledge and tools that help breeders identify the best animals and plants. through our partners, this information is then made available and useful for breeders and producers in all industries.the economic contribution that agbu has made over the years is immense, and underpins continuing improvements in productivity and profitability in the industries we work with.engagethe close links and collaborations with commercialisation partners and with industry direct are vital to the existence of agbu.our scientists work closely with partners and industry to create a conduit for innovation that sets the standard world-wide.the agbu culture that has grown from a visionary founder is centred on the combination of excellence in r&d, attention to delivering funders' needs, and to developing a strong and deep understanding of the needs and goals of the end users - tools for determining the value of the genes of individual animals and plants, at an industry scale.studywe supervise postgraduate research students across a range of animal and plant species. to view a list of our current and completed phd student research projects,
