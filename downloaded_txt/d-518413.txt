this intranet site is being continuously updated; it's a work in progress in sync with the course. not everything will be perfect. have a look around regularly to stay updated.
intranet: (working definition) a website used internally, that will dynamically evolve to address timely needs of users for collaboration and coordination

  

this site is the home base for all me 310 resources. refer to the missions tab to stay up to date on current assignments. 

most of the pages are restricted to registered users, but visitors can read about this year's projects and review the calendar.
lectures will be archived under resources.lectures in the left menu. 
me310abc 2024-2025 update enrolled me310 students will have access to the  me310 loft (located on the second floor of the peterson building) and its resources (e.g. 3d printing, soldering, etc) while practicing covid-19 university/county "hygiene best practicesÂ” (course code ehs-2470-web).  more information will be provided at the first day lecture
we also started a pre-class survey q&a, based partly on your responses to the pre-class survey. (you need to be registered on our310 intranet to access this)
