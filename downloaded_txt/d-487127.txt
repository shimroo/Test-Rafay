meet our students







 






the thing that i will miss most about clare is the people. i'll miss walking down the stairs of my accommodation, castlebrae, and straight into my friends ' rooms. i'll miss walking to castle street to cook dinner with friends after a long day of lectures and libraries. at the time, we knew that the university experience of living surrounded by your closest friends was to be cherished, and i'm thankful we made the most of it.
