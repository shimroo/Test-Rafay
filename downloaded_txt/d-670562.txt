website monitoring and performance testing
having a website is great, but if it's down then it's not helping you at all. also, if your website can't handle the load of your visitors, then that's not a good thing either. you need to ensure that your web server can stand up to the amount of visitors that you get, and the best way to accomlish this is to perform load tests on your website. this is something that our load testing servers and other load test tools can do for you so that you don't have to do it yourself and with the lowest level of technical understanding required, so you don't have to be an it manager to understand how it wokrs and make it work for you.
