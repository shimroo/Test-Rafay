noticeafter 28 years, our store on south congress has closed. but take heart! we are now open at our new location in johnson city, (a short drive from austin), under the new store name: camino you can still contact us directly if you’re interested in bedazzled skulls or other products. thank you so much for all of your support over the years! we’re sorry to go, and will miss being at our location in austin, but look forward to seeing you soon in the hill country!contact
