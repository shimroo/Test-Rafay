the splra is a coalition of tapers and traders dedicated to sharing live and rare recordings. the splra was formed in 1997 and has been revived in the fall of 2005. it's goals include location of high quality recordings, preservation of all shows past and future, and distribution to the masses at no cost.
 visit splra.org for more information... 


when starting in 2003, at the time almost no visual information was available on the net. with help of family and friends, in times of financial hardship and after 1,000's of hours of scanning, research, frustrations and laughters, spfreaks is the result.
