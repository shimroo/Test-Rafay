brook forrest white, jr
my work is about energy and motion. i want to express vitality. glassblowing provides an arena where the medium equals my intensity. the fire, the heat, the physical action and the teamwork stimulate my creative drive. the process allows me to transfer a bit of myself into each piece, thereby encasing a portion of my passion within the glass.
color engulfs my work. the relationships i build between the coloration, patterning and forms offer a glimpse into the soul of my glass. i desire to capture something that is almost elusive, but i strive to reveal a sliver of the realm of pure fire and light.
