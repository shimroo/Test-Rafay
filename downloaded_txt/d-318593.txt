quahog 5 news dedicated to the animated series, family guy

thank you for visiting quahog 5 news, a web site that was dedicated to one of the funniest animated series. the content below is from the site's archived pages. 
do you remember where you were when you first learned about family guy by either hearing co-workers or friends talking about the show or luckily coming across it on tv while flipping channels? i happened to be staying with my family at a fabulous vacation rental on maui. we had just returned from a full day of exploring several beaches on the western shore of this tropical hawaiian island'. we had gone snorkeling in the morning when it was calm and then spent the afternoon wind surfing. we had been told that maui is the ultimate windsurfing destination with its steady trade winds, clear, warm water, beautiful beaches, and outrageous surf. it didn't disappoint. but we were tired as the evening rolled around and i just wanted to be a couch potato. i was surfing the channels (sorry i couldn't help myself), and came across family guy. pretty soon everyone was sitting around the tv watching show. it was funny, irreverent, and had us laughing with some of its outrageous dialogue. i fell in love with the show.
when i recently i discovered that the domain for quahog5news.com was available i brought it to the attention of the folks at the web archive project who help preserve classic websites for use by educators and media buffs. they were able to obtain funding from tng/earthing because the company's ceo, bob sakayama, was a huge fan of family guy. he provided technical assistance and personnel to get a restored version of the original website back online. so now everyone can enjoy learning about how family guy evolved and survived to continue to entertain us all these years
family guy. family guy revolves around the life of the griffin household; peter, the man of the house, is the loving father of three children and husband to lois. lois, along with the household dog brian, are the only members of the family to provide some form of reason to her family. between stewie's devilish schemes to sabotage his family members, chris's apparent lack of any common sense, and their talking dog brian who amazingly is brighter than them all, family guy provides for entertainment on end.       
in early 2002, fox network pulled the plug on family guy. fortunately, season dvd sets have been produced with all three seasons for sale. in fact, due to these incredible dvd sales in 2003, family guy returned to the fox network in may of 2005 with the premier of season 4. furthermore, family guy's popularity sparked the creation of the family guy movie family guy presents stewie griffin - the untold story.
i hope that you will spend some time navigating through my family guy dedication. please use the links at the top of this page to view and navigate the site.

here you will find the most comprehensive guide to family guy's history.
how it began
seth macfarlane originally came up with the idea for family guy, titled "life of larry" at that time, while studying at the rhode island school of design. life of larry (found in our videos section) was based around a middle aged slob (peter) and his talking dog (brian), who was named steve. cartoon network quickly hired macfarlane and allowed him to create a sequel to life of larry, dubbed larry and steve, which was to air as part of the "what-a-cartoon!" show. for those unaware, what-a-cartoon! was a mid-90's show with its main purpose to showcase cartoons; the powerpuff girls is one of the more famous shows that started here. fox executives saw the shorts, and offered macfarlane the chance to evolve the show, which later turned into a contract for family guy.
the series takes off
on january 31st, 1999, immediately following the super bowl, fox aired the episode "death has a shadow." the first season was contracted for seven episodes, mainly to introduce the show to the us, and in the event that the new series failed, fox was not under any hefty obligation.
season two began on september 23rd, 1999 on fox. 
containing 22 episodes, season two started many controversies, which many would argue lead to the cancelation of the show. "when you wish upon a weinstein" was never actually aired until season two ended; cartoon network aired the episode on august 6th 2003, while fox didn't air it until over a year later. however, the airings did not come without editing; the line "even though they killed our lord" was changed to "i don't think they killed our lord." the family guy dvd has both the original line and the alternate line, but cartoon network was asked to use the alternate. cartoon network did air the alternate line, but with closed captioning on, the original is seen. also, when fox finally showed the episode, the scene where lois asks quagmire for his keys was edited so it wouldn't imply quagmire pleasuring himself. the episode "road to rhode island" had scenes cut which included osama bin laden passing security gates with guns (which, ironically, was written before the attacks, but was scheduled to air after the 11th). at the end of season two, the show was officially canceled, but not announced.

why family guy was canceled is still a topic of debate. 
fox claims poor ratings along with expensive production costs caused the show to cancel itself, but many can view that as a cover up. perhaps if fox didn't move their timeslot, or at least kept their time the same every week, poor ratings would not be a factor. while this controversy is going on, cartoon network was playing reruns, and their ratings prove to be excellent; beating dave letterman and jay leno. did fox want the show to be cancelled? liability issues?
despite being cancelled, contracts allowed a third season. unfortunately, family guy lost their time slot, so airings of family guy were sparatic. season three started july 11th of 2001, and contained 21 episodes. during this season, fox announced the show's cancellation.
after the shows cancellation, fans began to speak out against fox by creating websites and signing petitions. the biggest petition gained over 10,000 signatures in only a few weeks, and ended with almost 140,000. the petition can still be found online here: http://www.petitiononline.com/savefg2/petition.html
