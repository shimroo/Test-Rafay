on waves of midnight blue –
we shoved off in the boat –
it mattered not where to –
anywhere at a casual knot.

we entered a world of darkness
none but us could see –
one of two black firmaments
distinguished by a cool breeze

and then, cradled by whitecaps –
we kissed – you kept me warm.
that the hour was so late
was inconsequential.
