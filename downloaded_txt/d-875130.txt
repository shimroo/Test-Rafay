why choose safety first driving school



you only learn to drive once, and that’s why it is very important to make the right choice.



instructors:all of our instructors are required to have extensive background checks, which include fingerprinting through the state of new jersey and the fbi check. in addition to being state certified, each instructor must complete an extensive “safety first certification” course. this includes learning universal teaching techniques that have been developed for all instructors. this universal system for instruction guarantees that all our students are learning properly. instructors are also required to pass our own written exam and defensive driving courses, as well as crash avoidance training classes.



universal instruction:each instructor is trained to follow the safety first curriculum with clear goals outline for each lesson. while you are likely to have the same instructor for all of your lessons, if another instructor needs to take over, our standardized curriculum ensures each instructor is covering the same topics in the same order.



our vehicles:choosing the right vehicle was no small task for us here at safety first.  the toyota prius stood out as the best choice to offer you a safe and comfortable environment to learn. in addition to the standard safety features offered by the prius, all of our vehicles have been equipped with a set of passenger side brake controls for use by our instructors.
