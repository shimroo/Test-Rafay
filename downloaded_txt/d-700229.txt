the la verne church of the brethren continues the work of jesus peacefully, simply, together.
we create a christian community, called by christ to be inclusive, caring and peace-minded.
we affirm that people of any race, ethnic identity, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, age, economic status, faith tradition, or life situation are welcome in our congregation.
we believe in compassionate service, stewardship of creation, respect for diversity and nonviolent reconciliation for differences among all people, nations and faith traditions.
we claim no creed but the new testament, as exemplified by the life of christ. we strive to follow the way of jesus.
through these efforts, we seek to grow ever closer to the mind and heart of god.
