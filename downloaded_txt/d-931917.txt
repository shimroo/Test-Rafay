	 food grade silicon chocolate mold instructions
	 
    





a last... a practical use for food grade silicon.freakcitysf has produced a recipe and instructions on how to make a han solo carbonite chocolate bar... well, how to make your own mold for chocolate, anyway. and it's got rave reviews from those who've tried it. "i happened to have the idea of making a han solo in carbonite chocolate bar as well as a life mask of my mom!," she writes. "the life mask was my mom's birthday/mother's day present, han solo will be my brothers b-day present."anyhow, shuffle on over for the full drum, along with a photo. i'm just happy to have finally solved the mystery of what you use food grade silicone for!
