ang catholic bishops’ conference of the philippines (cbcp) nagdesisyon nga himuon nga national shrine ang
diocesan shrine of our lady of the assumption sa maasin city. ang maong desisyon gihimo kagahapon, 
hulyo 6, atol sa 128th plenary assembly sa cbcp nga gipahigayon sa chai conference center sa
 cagayan de oro city. kahinungdanon niini. gitukod isip parokya niadtong 1771 sa mga misyonaryong heswita, ang simbahan gidedikar
ngadto sa our lady of the assumption niadtong 1843 ubos sa mga franciscano. nahimong katedral kini niadtong
1968 sa dihang ang bag-ong diyosesis gipili si our lady of the assumption isip patrona.niadtong agosto 15, 2018, ang imahe sa our lady of the assumption nakadawat ug episcopal coronation
 nga gipangulohan ni kanhi arsobispo sa manila, cardinal luis antonio tagle. ang bantugang imahe sa
shrine nakadawat usab ug laing episcopal coronation niadtong agosto 13, 2022, sa usa ka seremonya
nga gipangulohan ni papal nuncio archbishop charles brown.ang pag-designate niini nagtimaan sa unang national shrine sa eastern visayas nga rehiyon, nga
nagpakita sa papel sa simbahan sa maasin isip usa ka mahinungdanong sentro sa debosyon ug pilgrimage.

𝐉𝐮𝐧𝐞 28, 2024 i the anti-spaghetti wires task force

the anti-spaghetti wires task force continues its commitment to enhancing road safety and
minimizing visual clutter by systematically organizing utility cables across the city. their recent operation
focused on barangay tagnipa to tunga-tunga, along tomas oppus street (uccp church to corner ataviado street), as part of their ongoing efforts to tidy up urban landscapes.


significant progress has been made in untangling and organizing the previously chaotic wires that
cluttered the city streets. this initiative not only improves the visual appeal of these areas but also
reduces the risk of accidents. councilor mikee mercado is at the forefront of these efforts, receiving full
support from the sp members under the leadership of vice-mayor maloney samaco.


mayor nacional mercado expressed his gratitude to team pogi, led by tito rojas, as well as dict
and miss fah carbonilla from globe who serves as the team leader for partner telecommunications
companies including soleco, pldt, globe, pvoi, vinjah, mctv, queens link, cool geeks, and
dito telecommunity corp. their cooperation and continued support are greatly appreciated.

march 18, 2024 i state of the city address mayor nacional v. mercado



today, march 18, 2024, i delivered my state of the city address (soca). the report i presented today
is deeply rooted in the foundational principles of 𝐍𝐀𝐂𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐨𝐧 𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐄𝐋𝐒 
—a framework meticulously crafted for inclusive development and guided by the ideals of the
𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬' 𝐒𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐆𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬 (𝐒𝐃𝐆𝐬). 

the sdgs, a set of 17 interconnected global goals, represent a visionary roadmap
for addressing pressing social, economic, and environmental challenges to achieve a
more prosperous and equitable world:

  
               

1: no poverty
2: zero hunger
3: good health and well-being
4: quality education
5: gender equality
6: clean water and sanitation
7: affordable and clean energy
8: decent work and economic growth
9: industry, innovation and infrastructure
10: reduced inequalities
11: sustainable cities and communities
12: responsible consumption and production

13: climate action
14: life below water
15: life on land
16: peace, justice, and strong institutions
17: partnerships for the goals


these principles serve as the bedrock of our government, the scaffolding upon which our progress stands,
shaping our approach to governance and development. by aligning with the sdgs, we demonstrate our
unwavering commitment to serving our people by striving for what is right, just, and sustainable in a global standard.


likewise, i presented all the projects and programs implemented last year and lined up for next year.


i would like to thank all our partner agencies, provincial government of southern leyte led by our governor damian mercado
and our sangguniang panlungsod, under the leadership of vice mayor maloney samaco, who has consistently
 served as a robust counterpart to the executive department in all endeavors of the city.



as my term of office nears its conclusion, i commit to each and every one of you:
i will leave no stone unturned in my mission to elevate
maasin city to new heights. despite the challenges that loom ahead,
 let us remember that true greatness emerges from resilience and collective effort.
together, we can conquer any obstacle, no matter how daunting. #maasinajonay
