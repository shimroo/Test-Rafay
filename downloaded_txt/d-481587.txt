welcome to the sno-jets club!







fun never goes out of style, which may be why the sno-jets are the oldest, not for profit ski club in southern colorado, established in 1952. we host a seemingly endless list of year-round activities, events and entertainment both on and off the slopes for active people like you.






if you’re 21 years of age or older and like to meet and mingle with people who love fun, this is the club for you. you can participate in as many or as few activities as you want, based on your time and interests. check out our event calendar, then check us out in person at one of our summer events.

summer memberships are available for $15 and run from 1 may until 30 sep 2024.  summer memberships are a good way to try out the club, as we have lots of summertime activities.  our spring into summer party around the end of may is the second biggest party of the year -- included with all full-year and summer memberships.  the biggest party is our membership party in late september to start off the new season!

in september we'll open up the 2024-25 full memberships, which allow signup for ski trips, of course, and also attendance to any of our other adventures, parties, and events throughout the calendar year.  early bird rate ($45) applies during september; full price ($55) takes effect after the membership party on 9/29.
