"we wanted a beach location while staying in santa teresa, and tropico latino met our needs perfectly! our room was large and bright with a totally handy kitchenette.
the restaurant was great and the menu has a bunch of great salads, among other things! the greens come from the hotel’s own organic garden.
the staff was friendly and helpful. my husband and i loved it here and will be back!"
