                                        i was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful basket. it did not come with the white basket but that did not matter.  i live in delaware and ordered on line. when i arrived at elizabeth’s service i was so happy the arrangement was more lovely than depicted in this photo i also called to thank the shop. this was a very sad time for me but this warmed my heart. again thank you for not disappointing me. julie s.

                                        i had a terrific experience ordering through grayrock florist. not only did they create a beautiful bouquet but they also called me and were extra careful about the delivery date and location. top top service for a sad and mournful event.

                                        my mama loved her mother’s day flowers.  she said the delivery person was nice and polite, which must have been hard due to all the deliveries that needed to be made that day and on next day, sunday, mother’s day.

you made her day! thank you so much!
