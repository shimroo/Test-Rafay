 lisakaye291965     sands motel  me and my fiancã© decided to book the sands motel. i was pleasantly surprised by the motel. i knew not to expect a 5 star hotel and did my research before booking. it worked for what we needed. we stayed in the apartment room. it was nice and spacious. the motel is a walk away from the beach. not far at all. the beach is more secluded and it was beautiful. ocean city is literally like 5mâ¦  lscopel481     sands motel  nothing fancy or lavish but all you need when located just 1 1/2 blocks off a beautiful beach. room was small for king sized bed. bathroom was tiny. pool was great, just outside room. people were even greater. it is also at the quiet end of the strip but near great restaurants and shops.  robert p.     sands motel  i stay here because of the pets but i will say the new owners has cleaned this place the best way possible. it is a basic necessities place but we didnât come to the area to sit in the motel room. no issues with the check in and this motel is so close to the beach. you donât have to worry about the issues that you would deal with in ocean city.  billy k.     sands motel  i spend most of my time on the beach or venturing around so it was the perfect place to rest my head. room was a little outdated with some rust but overall clean and the pool was nice. staff was very friendly! great location near shops and a very short walk to the beach!  shelby n.     bungalow 8  beautiful ** clean** home with great location, close to everything! perfect for large groups!  michael s.     bungalow 8  my friends and i really enjoyed our stay here. it was very conveniently located and very close to the beach (less than a 2 minute walk). debby was very helpful if we had any questions and wanted to make sure that we enjoyed our stay. the house was beautiful and clean ! i had a great time here and would definitely stay here again if i found myself in ocean city.  kayla j     bungalow 8  would absolutely recommend it to anyone. beautiful property.  par r.     bungalow 8  this was a great property! so close to the beach. it was the perfect place to spend a weekend away with my running friends. staying at bungalow 8 let us do less running and more breathing, disconnecting, and spending time together.  candi h.     bungalow 10  this property is a convenient, off-boardwalk location. we had a family of six, and had plenty of room. itâs located a couple of blocks from the ocean and right in the thick of the lower boardwalk action. itâs not loaded with amenities, but the description they give is accurate and the property manager communicates very well and offers a detailed summary of what is include and expected up frontâ¦.  bob s.     surf inn suites  very nice motel for basic accommodations. the bathrooms are a little outdated but rooms are very clean. an excellent value and great centralized location. just steps from the beach. the staff was very friendly and helpful! i would definitely stay here again.  nicole n.     bungalow 10  this house was perfect for my family to stay at. it is rented out by the buckingham hotel and we have been coming to the buckingham for years. there staff is always friendly and helpful. the only downside that some may find about this house is that it is a few blocks away from the beach. we actually enjoyed the distance because it took us away from the commotion. and since we had a parking â¦  drew     million dollar view  our family had a lovely stay. itâs so great having a pool on the property!  stacy c.     million dollar view  the house was nice. the location was great. there was so much to do. we really enjoyed this vacation.  suzanne s.     million dollar view  our family stayed in this wonderful home july 22-29, 2017. after many years of summer vacations this is the first place that we all said we are coming back next year. this home is perfect!!! the house has more than enough space for the family to gather or for one to sit quietly and read. at night, sitting in the screened in porch looking across the bay at the lights in ocean city - amazing!!! sâ¦  tanya h.     million dollar view  this was the best of both worlds, a self contained resort (pool, hot tub, dock, views, etc), but minutes to all the crazyness of the beach town. we totally enjoyed unwinding and relaxing , the perfect place for our family to catch up with each other. the house had enough space for all 9 of us, never did we feel cramped or in the way of each other. we will be coming back for years to come toâ¦  steve     million dollar view  lovely home, ** beautiful views** , lots to do, privacyâ¦. had it all. great week enjoyed by everyone. i would rent this again.  bonnie m.     madison house  we came down to oc for bike week with 8 of our friends and stayed in the madison house. what a perfect spot ! walking distance from the boardwalk, beach, and majority of events we wanted to attend. the set up was great, very clean- 3 bedrooms, large family/dining/kitchen area. and the front porch was perfect for hanging out, watching the bikes drive by. the staff is exceptional - ladiesâ¦  lindsay b.     madison house  i must say this is the best place in oc md to stay. i have reported this before and will keep doing until the end of days. the rooms are clean and the service is great. you are only about 50 yards from the main part of the boardwalk and the prices are awesome. if you ever get a chance to take more than 5 people, look into renting the house for a week. we stayed in the house 2 years in aâ¦  brian a.     madison house  rented the house for sunfest and we have in the past along with the normal rooms during the summer. i would ** 100% recommended** madison beach to anyone who wants to stay in oc md. great price and the best staff. i look forward to 2016 and a great place to stay.  bcallensr     buckingham hotel  we stayed for a few days because we got a great rate and really liked the location. the hotel itself is rather simple, no frills. itâs updated and clean, rooms are basic and nicely include mini fridge and microwave. if youâre looking for somewhere thats clean to sleep and shows thatâs close to the beach, i recommend this hotel.  ashley c.     madison beach motel  the room was clean, the ac was cold, and it met my expectations. i expected an old school, oc beach motel and that is exactly what i got. the staff were all friendly, the guests surrounding my room were nice and it was a great location. the shower is tiny, but that is to be expected in a motel of that era. if i needed to come back for another quick trip, i would stay at madison beach motel â¦  michelle p     madison beach motel  this hotel is exactly as others have described. great location, friendly staff and clean. this is an older motel and doesnât have all the bells and whistles of a modern hotel. we came for a quick midweek get away and ended up staying an additional night. the room was clean, air conditioner worked, it was quiet at night (we even had a room of younger guys staying next door). rooms are small â¦  p1p3p4     madison beach motel  the staff is the very best in ocean city. i stay here two different weeks a year. they donât get no better than deborah , joe, and felecia. the staff in the office are awesome as well. the rooms are clean and anything you ask for you get. i would highly recommend this motel to anyone.  gatessharon     madison beach motel  another great trip to ocean city!
