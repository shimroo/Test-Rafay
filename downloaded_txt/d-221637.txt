 godâs buffet of provisionby timothy r. butler | feb 13, 2025  at   5:10 pmit feels like the news cycle has been particularly wild since i happened to start preaching through psalm 8 in mid-january. busyness has a way of making us forget where we really are. this psalm from king david seeks to help remind us of how things really are.
   josiah cummings's bookby dennis e. powell | feb 12, 2025  at   9:54 pmdo all families have a deep corporate interest in genealogy? i hope so, because it is fascinating and satisfying. the subject swoops in unannounced and occupies my days every few years. though i’m by no means an expert, i think i’m a relatively skilled dilettante and have a long, strangely constructed family tree to prove it.

  a coup is only a coup if it is a coupby e. ryan haffner | feb 05, 2025  at   2:39 pmscreaming âcoupâ doesnât make it so, though it might help someone perform one in the future. these disproportionate reactions, even from ordinarily reasonable folks, will not help stop the real or imagined problems of the new american administration.
