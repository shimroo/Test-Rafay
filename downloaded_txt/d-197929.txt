we save lives for a living

from concepts to complete solutions
what mustang survival offers is beyond just simple products – they provide trusted and reliable complete solutions that are among the most innovative in the industry.
the concepts for their products come from the real life needs of users. from protecting kids, boaters or fishermen that unintentionally fall overboard to providing military teams with the flotation, hypothermia and acceleration protection they need as they head straight into harm’s way, their products are designed to give them all the best chance of survival should they need it. in fact, their products have often been featured on television’s tactical to practical show - a strong statement about how the benefits from one solution often spill over to become solutions for another market.
many of mustang survival products are researched, designed, tested and manufactured right where they are conceived. mustang survival is proud to be one of the unique companies in the industry where they control the entire product cycle, from initial research and product prototype design, to product testing and final production and quality assurance.
