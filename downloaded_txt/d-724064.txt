									hear from our happy customers
								





the home exceeds all of our expectations. the build team was extremely detail-oriented and made sure that the house was perfect. adam wiley was fantastic, getting every detail and everything extra that we ordered, and some we didn't, but he made it happen anyway, truly going above and beyond for customer service.zackary v.greenpoint | georgia




from the beginning, brett was great in showing me the models and was always quick to respond to my questions and concerns. britt was also there for me and my questions on the building side. i was very impressed with the detail and truly happy to call this my home.dan l.presidents pointe | west virginia




my experience with stanley martin has been top-notch! everything was superb, from the sales manager, christy bissen, to adrian, the building manager, and nick, the assistant building manager. they worked hard to bring my dreams to fruition. the experience was smooth, communicated accurately and effectively, and completed on time. they were always available to answer questions and address concerns. this was a seamless process.nikki h.the falls | south carolina
