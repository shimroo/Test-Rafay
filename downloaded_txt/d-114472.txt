about polygraph testingeverything you need to know 







about global polygraphworldwide since 1987 



















lie detector testing 











selecting a qualified examiner can be challenging, considering what is sometimes at stake. we understand the importance of this decision, and will never refer you to an untrained examiner, or one who uses a technique not validated by scientific research. if done correctly, polygraph testing is on average 90 to 95% accurate (click here to see the research). we offer only true polygraph services. do not be fooled by offers of voice stress analysis (vsa), which the u.s. government has determined to be unreliable

how to set up a lie detector test with us 











the process is simple… select the lie detector testing location where you would like the polygraph test to take place, then complete the registration process. exam prices can also be found on our test locations pages. once you decide to hire one of our polygraph examiners, we will ask you for some information needed to conduct the exam. a deposit will be required which will be applied towards the overall exam fee. within two business days, the polygraph examiner handling the selected area will contact you to schedule the exam at a date and time that is convenient for both of you. we guarantee you will receive a quality polygraph test by an apa certified examiner in the geographic area you selected. the examiner will work closely with you to design the best polygraph test questions to resolve your issue. keep in mind that a properly conducted exam may take 1½ to 3 hours to complete. following the lie detector test, upon request, a written report will be provided to you at no charge.***** click here to see what sets us apart from the competition *****
