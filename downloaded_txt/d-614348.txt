what is the booster bath?made in the usa and recommended by top veterinarians, the booster bath is simply the most elegant, convenient and functional dog bath available for home and light commercial use. available in a variety of colors booster bath products eliminate most of the issues with home pet bathing: slipping and sliding, chasing the shampoo bottle (and the pet), backaches from bending over, lifting the pet into and out of the tub and messy bathroom cleanups. the problems we used to have with pet bathing are over; replaced by elevation, containment, drainage and 360° access to your pet!
