graduate testimonials






testimonial






























hawaii healing arts college taught me invaluable tools and helped me gain confidence as i’ve created a fulfilling career in the healing arts. their massage techniques gave me a competitive advantage in the workplace and clients in california have loved the fact that i trained in hawaii. my journey as a healer has grown to include nature-based mindfulness, spiritual travel as well as thai-influenced bodywork done on a mat in the california redwood forest, which was inspired by instructors at the college. thanks to hawaii healing arts college, i went from serving my country as an active duty service member to serving my community as a spiritual mentor and healer. my body of work now includes inner calm and stillness through nature connection, drum meditations, and spiritual travel. visit my website at www.justinspyres.com! thank you all for being a foundational stepping stone toward my vision to be of service to humanity!  -justin spyres  































it’s already been more than a year since i finished my course and it could not have been any better. words can not describe how thankful i am, about what i’ve learned from all of you guys and how well you prepared us for the healing work outside the school. i’ve found a wonderful and inspiring job as a spa manager on a resort in the maldives and i’m working with therapists from bali, india, and thailand. it’s been such a great journey and i was also able to learn new things as well as deepen my knowledge. a big, big thank to the while hawaii healing arts college team!  -elisabeth lorbeer  































from my very first time meeting the admissions manager marlena and walking into hawaii healing arts college, i felt that this was where i needed to learn the art of massage. i chose the winter intensive program because it allowed me to get my hours done faster and i could still maintain my job, and my family time. although it can be very intense, it never felt that way. all the instructors were professional, yet personable. it really showed me that they loved what they do. hawaii healing arts college showed me that being a massage therapist is more than a job. it’s a passion. i also really liked how after graduation they also offered continuing education classes. i am now working out of hhac as a licensed massage therapist as well as independently. it was one of the best decisions i have made.  kaaina lacey-nahale, lmt
