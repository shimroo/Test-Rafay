interviews and statements:
20+ years experience conducting interviews and taking written and recorded statements.
					i have taken statements with respect to nearly every type of criminal defense case, as well as any insurance/siu claims.
					signed and recorded statements can "lock" in a witnesses testimony.
					questions are prepared in advance to assure all relevant lines of inquiry are thoroughly addressed.
					thoroughness in preparation is essential because we may only get one shot at an important interview.







background checks
what is the victim's reputation and character?
					 do significant witnesses have a reputation for dishonesty in the community?
					you need to know! 
					an inquiry extending beyond cori can yield the kind of information you need to impeach their testimony.







locates and skip-tracing
discovery services investigations has had great success locating witnesses and other parties.
					police may not interview everybody. those they do interview may not be forthcoming.
  					additional witnesses can be identified that aren't available through the normal course of discovery.
					extensive resources have amassed over my 30+ years as an investigator. police have access to everything they need, so you need an investigator who has established other sources of information.







miscellaneous
trial preparation and litigation support.
					there is a lot of research to be done, and you need to be assured that all the avenues are pursued.
					collecting witnesses background information for possible impeachment takes time, but can make all the difference. the more information you have, the more confident you can be in the defense of your client.
					scene investigations with photos, diagrams and measurements are conducted at the equivalent times f day (and similar weather when necessary) to reproduce a more accurate re-creation.
					insurance defense investigations,accident scene investigations and analysis, document retrieval and more is available as you need it.

"it is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished,
 for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished.
but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die,
then the citizen will say, 'whether i do good or whether i do evil is immaterial,
 for innocence itself is no protection, and if such an idea as that were to take
hold in the mind of the citizen, that would be the end of security whatsoever.' "
john adams dec 4, 1770
