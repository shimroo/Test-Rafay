â  â  the club discussed the possibility of having an "outreach judging show" the first weekend in october. david was going to see if the church rectory would be available to host this one day event. he would ask for saturday and sunday availability from the church. judges from the ne judging center would be contacted after we have a date.we talked about whether it would be open to the public, and if vendors would be invited. there would be no formal exhibits. gros and stos would be invited. it is a chance to have your orchid judged.â volunteers would be needed. we should supply lunch for workers and vendors.
â 
heads up for february 22- the northeast plant show at the oncenter.
and dues are due.
we had a fabulous show table. and our auction was very fun and the club made lots of money.â â 







â 

â 
~ â  â membership - dues are now due! if you haven't paid yet, then you will be dropped from the email list for newsletters and will not receive links to the zoom programs .â since we have been holding meetings with speakers both on zoom and now in-person, we have resumed collection of dues. please contact sue finger is you are not sure if your dues are paid. thank you!




we have had a few volunteers for officers, and still need volunteers for other positions like newsletter editor. if you have ideas, questions or suggestions, please contact jerry, judi or jan. â 
â 
we have shifted to posting, viewing and talking about orchids on our facebook page. the link to our page is on the toolbar to the left. check out our facebook page; there are people from around the world who visit and upload orchid pictures, questions and comments. if you have orchids flowering now or they did flower during the last few months but meetings were canceled, head over to facebook and upload these pictures and chat with people there!â 
at our previousâ 2022 fall show and sale, there were 3 aos awards given! show and aos awards pictures will soon beâ uploaded. pictures of flowers, displays and artwork can be viewed on the show pictures page.
we are now collecting dues for 2024 since we are holding meetings with paid speakers. if you would like to receive links to our meetings, then please submit your 2024 dues by march 31st to â club treasurer sue finger - thanks!

our orchid club is now on facebook! check it out here and let us know what else you think might be good to have on the site.

our main website now hosts two photo galleries. one is our the show pictures page where images from our orchid shows can be viewed, the second is the virtual showtable page, which shows previous years' member's flowering orchids, which hadn't cooperated by flowering during a show or meeting. this page has been superseded by our facebook page, where members and many guests post and share orchid pictures. there are native orchid pictures which can be viewed; both links can be found to the left.â 
â 
also a reminder that our newsletter and website have a section where members can post a list of orchids or orchid-related items they wish to sell/buy/trade. if you are a neighboring orchid society (including canada) and will be having an orchid auction, these can be listed there as well as on our events calendar. send requests to newsletter editor chris smith 
(csmith23 at twcny dot rr dot com) and your list will be put in the newsletter and on our website. please submit your request at least two weeks before the next scheduled meeting - thanks!
â 
hope to see you at our next meeting or event!
