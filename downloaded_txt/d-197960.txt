established in 1944, obrycki's started as a bar in baltimore's historic fells point neighborhood and in short time we became well-known for great steamed crabs and the best and freshest crab cakes in town.though we've grown, and moved from our original location, our goal has always remained the same: to create a one-of-a-kind enjoyable experience centered on great chesapeake regional food.we focus on using fresh blue crab meat in our menu items. and, we realize that as we grow, it is impossible to duplicate the "authentic crab house" feel of our original restaurant in our new locations. we will promise you this; our standards and quality at any of our locations are, and always will be, "authentic."
