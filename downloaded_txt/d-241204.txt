back to back buffalo news best of 716 winners: best italian restaurant & best wait staff

































kitchen appreciation fee
$1.00 per guest (optional)
the kitchen appreciation fee was started by many and found success in providing an incentive to reward the back of house for working those long shifts and holidays. we have found this to be very rewarding as the back of house felt like part of the family when working hard to be rewarded by the customers, not just the front of house staff who legally cannot share their tips with them. also, note that the fee is optional and can be removed from your bill. any further questions, please contact us directly at (716) 825-3675 ext. 4.
