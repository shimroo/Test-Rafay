water meter upgrades begin the week of feb. 3 

attention public utilities customers: over the next several weeks, gloucester county will be replacing its water meters at every location. here's what you need to know:- hst is the contractor doing the work.- water might be interrupted briefly during the change out of your meter.- please make sure vehicles or other items are not impeding access to water meters (they are typically located at the end of your driveway near the roadway).new meters will allow customers to access their usage in real time and will alert public utilities staff immediately when a leak is occurring. it's also important to know that once your meter has been switched, water might be discolored or have air pockets the first time you turn on your faucets, and just running it for a couple minutes should take care of it.please contact public utilities with any questions you may have at 804-693-4044 or publicutilities@gloucesterva.info.














current conversations podcast features public utilities topics















this month, the current conversations podcast features katey legg, director of public utilities, as she explains some exciting advances being made in public utilities billing and infrastructure. in this episode, you will learn about the new advanced metering infrastructure (ami), which will save both the customer and the county in the long run, as well as a new e-billing feature available to customers. for more information on either of these topics, please call public utilities at 804-693-4044 or e-mail publicutilities@gloucesterva.info.
