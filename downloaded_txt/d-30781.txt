aim
        :- to provide an ever expanding record of all norfolk public houses and
        many of their licensees.

        the archive is based upon licence records, newspaper articles,
        business records, sale & auction documents and directories. 
        many entries may differ from directories, but this is only where
        other reliable records prove the directory entry to be out of date or in error.
        where dates are marked
          * the information 
		giving the landlords name has not specified the name of house, but other 
		sources suggest location with some certainty.
        if
          ** is used then 
		there is some degree of doubt.


names marked (?) are as transcribed from hand written records and may
        be subject to correction.
        if dates are shown 1854 -1869 then this indicates the spread of directory
        entries.
        where dates are given as 1854 to 1869 then there is some certainty that
        the licensee was present over that period.
        in some cases the names given may be owners or managers, not the
        licensee. 
in the 
		lists of licensees, the first date given is the earliest yet found.
		where the date of issue of first licence is known, this will be stated.
the dates of death given may in some 
		cases, be the date of registration of death, rather than the actual day.

pages are updated on at least a weekly basis.
