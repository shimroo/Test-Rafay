clients say 


















						i just wanted to let you know how pleased we are with the (zontec) ozone equipment we purchased from you. it has performed flawlessly.

the ideal situation is a room with no odor. we have been able to achieve that with the ozone equipment your company provided. we treat every occupied guest room daily and feel that this is an integral part of the formula that helped us to receive a circle of excellence award in 1992 from hampton inns.

i hardily recommend your product to anyone in the hotel business.					





clark byramhampton inn 






						about a year ago we purchased a portable zontec machine to try out in our guest rooms instead of air freshener. the housekeeper and guest response was so positive that we purchased a unit for each of our housekeeping sections.

we are extremely happy with the results. the units are used daily in each room to ensure that the rooms smell fresh when the guests check in. we have also utilized the units in the conversion of smoking rooms to nonsmoking rooms with excellent results.

i would highly recommend that any hotel consider these units are replacements for their current air fresheners.					





victor g. martin, c.h.a.best western 






						nothing was a sure fix until we purchased our first (zontec) ozone generator and this is the purpose for my comments.

let me tell you, it solved our problem within a few days and in doing so it made us happy, our guests happy and even our housekeepers happy. that's a trick in itself! we now have four machines, one for each service cart and our staff uses them each and every time they service a guest room.

there is much emphasis placed on "environmentally" clean rooms which obviously includes air quality. guests no only appreciate but demand fresh smelling / non smelling rooms and your ozone machines allow us to exceed their expectation. even our aaa field inspector was very pleased to see our staff use them.					





bob and cheryl kaneladd brook inn 






						as you know, guest satisfaction is high priority in the hotel / motel industry. providing a "fresh air" atmosphere in each room not only pleases our guests but encourages out guests to return.

purchasing the zontec pa200 was a sound investment. with its easy operation and effectiveness in eliminating offensive odors, the unit is well worth the initial cost.

after using the unit for a short time we received many compliments. guests are enjoying the odor free rooms and are pleased with the "fresh air" smell.

i would personally encourage other companies to try your equipment.

						it saved us a great deal of expense and time in converting these suites (to non-smoking suites).

we asked our non smoking staff members to try and find any offending odors, they could not.

we are using this machine daily in our suites and plan another purchase in the near future.

i am sure that for the price, compared to the money spent on chemicals for suites, that other hotels will see where they can save when they try your product and keep their suites fresh.					





mike perrymarriott residence inn 






						a short note to tell you how great we think the (zontec) pa200 machine is at our hotel. it removes all odors and when we run out of non smoking rooms, we can just sit the machine in there for approximately 20 minutes and you cannot tell that someone had ever smoked in this room.

my. executive housekeeper thinks it is the best thing that has happened to make his work easier. spray deodorizers can in no way touch this machine.

covid-19 & ozone 



ozone has been proven to kill 99.9% of pathogens in the air including sars coronavirus and influenzas such as h5n1.  there is no current research to substantiate such claims for covid-19.  the similar makeup of covid-19 to sars leads experts to believe that ozone could be comparably effective against covid-19, but peer-reviewed evidence is lacking at this point in time.ozone destroys viruses by attacking the nucleic acid core, damaging the viral rna.  covid-19 is an enveloped virus. effectiveness of ozone against enveloped animal viruses has been supported by peer reviewed research for decades. ozone renders other enveloped coronaviruses ineffective by attacking the envelope proteins, preventing the virus from attaching to normal, healthy cells. without the ability to invade living cells, viruses are unable to infect by replication. it is plausible that ozone will also be effective at incapacitating covid-19 as well.my wife and own zontec ozone generators.  i am an engineer and my wife has a bs in chemistry and a ms in biology.  because of that, we are not salesmen and won’t make claims that haven’t been scientifically proven.  there are many manufacturers that produce ozone equipment. anyone claiming that their ozone equipment will kill covid-19 may be right, but until testing currently being conducted is completed, it is premature to make such claims.stay safe,jeff and sjaan armentrout
