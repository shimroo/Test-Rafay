ghoulie games
by pete vigeant & bryan vitale
the number one source of camp songs and general silliness on the world
						wide web.
welcome! i know we haven't been active for quite some time (many... many years),
					so here's the responsive update that y'all deserve! please note that (almost) every song includes a video, which take a bit longer to load.
here you'll find my ever-growing list of camp songs and anything else i want to include for
					those who work with the young or young-at-heart. if you have any suggestions or songs that i missed
					(i know there are many!), please contact
						me!
this site was created by the completely surrounded. check out our website to learn more about our work: playful experience design & large games for all people.

it rolled through the garden

													and into a bush

													and then my poor meatball

													was nothing but mush
the mush was so tasty

the tree was all covered

													all covered with moss

													and on it grew meatball

oh...

													there ain't no bugs on me

													there ain't no bugs on me

													there may be flies on some of you guys

													but there ain't no bugs on me

													oh...

													it ain't gonna rain no more no more

													it ain't gonna rain no more

													how the heck could i wash my neck

													if it ain't gonna rain no more

													oh...

													i've been workin' on the railroad

													all the live-long day

													i've been workin' on the railroad

													just to pass the time away

													can't you hear the whistle blowin'

													rise up so early in the morn

													can't you hear the captain shouting

													"dinah, blow your horn!"

													dinah won't you blow?

													dinah won't you blow?

													dinah won't you blow your horn no more?

													dinah won't you blow?

													dinah won't you blow?

													dinah won't you blow your horn?

													someone's in the kitchen with dinah

													someone's in the kitchen i know

													someone's in the kitchen with dinah!

													stummin' on the old banjo - and he's singin'-

													fee, fie, fiddly-eye-oh!

													fee fie fiddly-eye-oh oh oh oh

													fee, fie, fiddly-eye-oh!

													stummin' on the old banjo!















 the peanut song








found a peanut

													found a peanut

													found a peanut last night

													last night i found a peanut

													found a peanut last night 
broke it open

													broke it open

													broke it open last night

													last night i broke it open

													broke it open last night 
...it was rotten...

													...ate it anyway...

													...got sick...

													...threw up...

													...called the doctor...

													...it was busy...

													...called the hospital...

													...it was busy too...

													...had to walk...

													...it was snowing...

													...got pneumonia...

													...was hit by a meteor...

													...so i died...

													...went to heaven...

													...didn't want me...

													...went the other way...

													...didn't want me either...

													...woke up...

													...found a peanut!
											














 the princess pat











the princess pat
[repeat after me]the princess pat

													lived in a tree

													she sailed across

													the seven seas

													she sailed across

													the channel too

													and brought with her

													a ricca-bamboo
a ricca-bamboo

													now what is that?

													it's something made

													by the princess pat

													it's red and gold

													and purple too

													that's why it's called

													a ricca-bamboo
now captain jack

													had a very fine crew

													they sailed across

													the channel too

													but their ship sank!

													and yours will too

													if you forget

													a ricca-bamboo
											














 the water spout








the water spout


													have you ever been down the water spout? 
to the very bottom of the water system... 
there you'll find a little alligator

													who goes by the name of alfred

													and you know, he's mine! 
i lost him. 
i threw him down the water spout 
and now i'm feeling lonely 'cause he's gone. 
i miss him.
											














 the wishy washy washer woman











the wishy washy washer

														woman
way down in the valley where nobody goes

													there's a wishy washy washer woman washin' her clothes

													she goes (wash motions)

													she goes (wash motions)

													she goes (wash motions)

													she goes (wash motions)

													that's how the wishy washy washer woman washes her clothes

												
way down in the valley where nobody goes

													there's a wishy washy washer woman dryin' her clothes

													she goes (drying motions)

													she goes (drying motions)

													she goes (drying motions)

													she goes (drying motions)

													that's how the wishy washy washer woman dries her clothes

												
way down in the valley where nobody goes

													there's a wishy washy washer woman foldin' her clothes

													she goes (folding motions)

													she goes (folding motions)

													she goes (folding motions)

													she goes (folding motions)

													that's how the wishy washy washer woman folds her clothes

												
'pickin' her nose'

													'eatin' oreos'

													'paintin' her toes'

													'puttin' on pantyhose'

													'sayin' goodbye...

													...frog on the bump...

													...wart on the frog!

											














 titanic








titanic
oh,

													they built the ship titanic to sail the ocean blue

													and the people said that the water would never get through

													oh, the lord...s almighty hand said the ship would never land

												
(chorus)

													it was sad when the great ship went down bom-b-bom

													it was sad, so sad, it was sad, too bad

													it was sad when the great ship went down to the bottom of

													the

													husbands and wives, little children lost their lives

													it was sad when the great ship went down bom-b-bom 
it was off the english shore ...bout a hundred miles or

													more

													when the rich refused to associate with the poor

													so they put the poor below, so they...d be the first to go 
(chorus) 
oh, the little children cried as the water rushed inside

													and the men on deck prayed the lord to pass them by

													but the hero saved the weak as the boat began to leak 
(chorus) 
oh, the moral of this story, as you can plainly see

													is to wear a life preserver when you go out to sea

													the titanic never made it across the ocean blue
