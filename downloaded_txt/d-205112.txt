our process


fine furniture frames begin with excellent raw materials. we source our domestic woods from regions known for their quality as well as european beech for even more flexibility. before any wood is cut, it is drawn and designed by our skilled engineers. all products are drawn in cad which integrates with our cutting-edge cnc technology. with the use of our advanced machinery, products are cut, shaped, and sanded.
