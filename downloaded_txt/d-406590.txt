	 sauteed chicken livers
	 
    


 sauteed chicken livers    this recipe was found in one of the movie fanzines of the 1940s.  it was said to be a favorite of actress/pianist diana lynn, who usually played the friend of the star during that era.  you have to like chicken livers to like this dish and my dh and i certainly do.  it is a quick and easy meal, and i hope you enjoy it, too. -- posted by lorraine of az fish in red gravy almost like a catfish coubillion of which if using this recipe takes a lot less time to prepare. most cajun women have to work similar to the rest of american society. always nice to get a shortcut recipe to cajun cooking.

	 fish in red gravy
	 
    


 fish in red gravy almost like a catfish coubillion of which if using this recipe takes a lot less time to prepare. most cajun women have to work similar to the rest of american society. always nice to get a shortcut recipe to cajun cooking. pineapple beef balls    from the same international cookbook -- posted by recipe junkie chocolate chip cookie brownies    this is like a chocolate chip cookie with a brownie baked on top. it has a huge yield, but they'll go fast. i got the recipe from &quot;one pot chocolate desserts&quot; by andrew schloss. enjoy! -- posted by aunt cookie kashmiri garam masala    i use this in my roghan josh. use the freshest spices you can source.  store in an airtight container in a cool, dry &amp; dark place. i've guessed the timing - bashing those cardamom pods varies each time!  australian measurements used. -- posted by mischka

 whole grain honey mustard potato salad    just something i whipped up for dinner. -- posted by ailsa of new zealand glossy chocolate sauce    this is good on hot or cold desserts, and it freezes well. pour into a freezer proof container, seal and keep for up to 3 months. thaw at room temp. -- posted by kittykitty

	 herbed pork medallions
	 
    


 herbed pork medallions    this recipe calls for tenderloin and goes through a few steps, but i'm too lazy for process!  i pretty much always just use chops or butt steaks and throw everything into my huge frying pan on the stovetop.  keep the pan covered until the meat is cooked and then continue cooking, uncovered, until all the juice is gone, stirring a few times throughout.  either way, it's delicious!! -- posted by swan valley tammi olive tapenade ala dawn (olive salad)    this delicious spread is great on crostini or in a sandwich.  i use this on my bagletta and tunaletta sandwiches i posted here.  you can easily halve this recipe if you desire, but it keeps very well in the refrigerator. -- posted by dawnie2u

	 finnish cabbage and tofu over rice
	 
    


 finnish cabbage and tofu over rice    this is from &quot;sundays at moosewood,&quot; with a few minor changes. the recipe as written calls for pressed tofu, but i like to freeze the tofu instead. when it's thawed and the moisture has been squeezed out, the texture changes to chewy and firm, rather than slippery and mushy. i always use the one-pound blocks stored in water, rather than the silken type. -- posted by aunt cookie miss ollie's crawfish or shrimp etouffee miss ollie had been in our household for a long time. she was one of the best cooks around. our family loved when she prepared this etouffee.
