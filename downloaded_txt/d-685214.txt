2024-20245 tucker boatwright festival of literature & the arts
the nature of representation
the nature of representation asks how our understandings of “nature” have been shaped by representational practices in both the aesthetic and political senses, exploring how the current climate catastrophe is inextricable from colonialism and anthropocentric worldviews. the festival features contemporary writers, artists, and thinkers who don’t take for granted that language is merely human, that there are other “natural” languages, and that attuning to those other languages allows us to tell stories that disrupt the violence of man.

humanities center
2024-2025: how (and why) do we represent nature?
this question invites us to consider “representation” in both its political and aesthetic meaning. “nature” is represented in paintings, poems, scripture, music, dancing, novels, laws, regulations, equations, activisms, advertising campaigns. this question asks how environments — and often their relations to human concerns — are represented across media, geographic and cultural contexts, and different historical moments.
