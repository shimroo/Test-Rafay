cape cod ski club






















the cape cod ski club was formed in 1978 by a group of skiing enthusiasts. there are now over 425 members, and now, many are snowboarders! members range in age from 21 to 80+. although most members live on or near cape cod, some members live as far away as california, florida, and even europe!
the club offers many trips to members from december to march including day trips via motorcoach,  new england overnight  "u-drive" trips, and fly trips. members also organize various off-season activities including kayaking, biking, golfing, and sailing. club news is published periodically via email blasts, facebook, and this website.

breckenridge ... another blue sky trip!

the plane took off from colorado just as new england was getting dumped on! good timing! although no fresh snow while at breck, members enjoyed bluebird days and excellent conditions ... and fresh powder on the departure day! great ski in / ski out location at the base of beaver run lift and convenient to town. another spectacular trip with a fun group!
