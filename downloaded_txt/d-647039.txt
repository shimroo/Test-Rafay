generative artificial intelligence (genai) greatly attracts   the public's interest; thus, this research investigates discussions   between experts and members of the public about this new technology   on social media. using computational and manual analysis of x   (formerly twitter) data, we investigated discussion topics, the   roles discussants — including both experts and public — play,   and the differences between experts' posts and the public's replies.   moreover, we examined the dynamics between the discussants' roles   and social media engagement measures. we found that the public is   not only actively contributing to the discussion of genai on x, but   also becoming knowledge co-producers alongside experts in the sphere.

bridging the gap between scientists and the public: “science v. story”

emma frances bloomfield's “science v. story: narrative   strategies for science communicators”, presents ways to improve   science communication in the face of declining public trust.   bloomfield's work highlights the power of narrative, demonstrating   how anti-science movements have effectively leveraged storytelling   to popularize their messages. if scientists adopt narrative   strategies, they can bridge the gap between the scholarly community   and the public and make complex information more accessible and   relatable. bloomfield's approach provides a roadmap for navigating   the complexities of science communication in an era where many   people are swayed more by personal connection than credibility or   facts.

forensic science has become a standard feature in criminal   investigations and trials. however, it can often be a challenge for   experts in courtrooms to communicate scientific evidence clearly to   lay audiences through verbal expert witness testimony alone.  the   evidence chamber is an interactive experience engaging public   audiences with forensic science through a mock trial. this study   explores the effectiveness of using comics to support the   understanding of forensic science by non-experts. the results   suggest comics were effective at aiding the audiences' comprehension   of forensic science evidence and in the future comic-based aids   could support juries' comprehension of scientific evidence.

scientists are increasingly expected to share their research   with the public using learner-centered strategies that build trust,   such as engaging in relationship-building activities. a growing   number of science communication training programs have been   developed to address this need but little is known about whether and   how scientists value such programs. in this paper we examine   scientists' experiences with the stem ambassadors program (stemap),   a science communication training program that aims to build   relationships for open-minded exchange between scientists and the   public. we discuss benefits and challenges for scientists when using   the stemap model for public outreach.

homes was a citizen science exploratory project, aimed at   investigating the presence of airborne microplastics in people's   homes. participants placed passive samplers in their homes, using   low-cost microscopes to see and take pictures of their samples.   the methods developed are promising, however there are a number of   pitfalls to avoid and key considerations. this practice insight   explores successful approaches and identifies barriers and   limitations when embedding co-creation and participatory citizen   science approaches to a research project. this piece focuses on the   methods and engagement with participants, rather than on   microplastics findings.

in recent years there has been an increasing call for new   modes of climate change communication. these calls have gone beyond   classic consensus-building and fact-sharing to addressing affective   dimensions and meaning-making in relation to the climate crisis.   in this article we reflect on a proof-of-concept climate change comedy   project — “climate change is not funny!”. building on   audience and performer insights, we reflect on the effectiveness and   affective dimensions of comedy as a climate change communication   method, as well as institutional and funding constraints on delivery.   finally, we introduce how we designed our project to go on making an   impact beyond the grant's lifespan. by empowering professional   comedians to embed new research-informed climate change material   into their regular sets, we argue that our approach can amplify the   reach of climate communication activities, and in turn provide new   forums for individuals to engage with the most pressing aspects of   the climate crisis.

science communication has seen a trend of diverse communicators in recent decades, who adopt different identity strategies to gain audience trust. this study focuses on the strategies used by three different groups of science communicators, including scientists, citizens and institutions, as well as the potential effects that may arise from these different strategies in terms of audience trust through quantitative content analysis. the findings show that communicators have biases towards using different strategies. there are also significant differences in the trust effects generated by different strategies used by different science communicators in different science topics. this indicates that the effect of science communication varies for different groups of science communicators and different science topics, and it is difficult to generate a universally applicable model, which further corresponds to the current trend of ‘diversification’ and ‘contextualization’ in science communication research.

this practice insight explores how translation and multimedia formats, such as video and audio, can enhance science communication efforts to combat community-driven misinformation and build trust within communities. focusing on a national hiv survey, it details strategies for countering misinformation spread via platforms like facebook and whatsapp, which falsely accused data collectors of criminal activity. the research team’s response included multilingual, multimodal digital communication and community engagement, demonstrating the effectiveness of this blended approach in restoring trust and dispelling misinformation in diverse social and linguistic settings.
