		notes:
	

		1. an email to be shared: (i'm rather late with thie one) 
		a "dustoff crews of viet nam war congressional gold medal award" was created.  it is unbelievable this award was limits to the pilots and crew members of the us army.
		as we all know marine squadrons flew medivacs on a daily basis. 
		please, each of you to write your congressmen and senators and request this be rectified to include all pilots and crew members from each of the services.
		here is a link to the bill, be sure to include as the title the line below in the subject line of your email,
	    so the congressmen and senators will know exactly what you are referring to in your email.
		subject: s.2825 - dustoff crews of the vietnam war congressional gold medal act
https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2825/text


		2. this "thank you" email added to the 1969 history page.

					something new we are very excited about, our own stephanie hanson caisse, author of a corpsman's legacy and a corpsman's legacy continues, has started a newsletter called the swifty spotlight.  she gets all kinds of snippets and tidbits of news about the squadron, so she decided to share it with the rest of us.    if you would like her to sent one directly to you, i am sure you can get on her mailing list by contacting her through her website or facebook.

dedication

						    dedicated to those marines, and others, who served with marine medium helicopter squadron 364
						    during their time in the corps.   this site represents the collective efforts of all
						    former members of hmm-364 who believe their history, and the part they played in conducting
						    aerial support missions should be preserved.   in some cases the "purple foxes" relate,
						    with appropriate reverence and respect, incidents relative to their counterparts who did
						    not "come home alive".  all who view this historical account of hmm-364 should appreciate
						    that a complete history of our squadron must contain information relative
						    to all of our former marines and navy corpsman.


							further, it should be noted that hmm-364's illustrious legacy should not appear to diminish the
							contributions of our other 'marine brothers,' be they aviation, ground or support units. 
							there existed at these times in our marine corps a great deal of mutual respect among all marines
							who endured the experience of war.  therefore, where possible, credit will be given to
							individuals and units which were associated with developing this  historical account of the
							"purple foxes" to cultivate and promote the same esprit de corps which existed then and today.
						    

							    contributions to this site are respectfully requested which might cover, but not limited to,
							    subjects such as those listed in the 'table of contents' above and, we encourage submissions
							    from those marines we supported.
