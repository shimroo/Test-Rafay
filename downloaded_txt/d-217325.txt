the covenant of unitarian universalist pagans (cuups) is an organization dedicated to networking pagan-identified unitarian universalists (uus), educating people about paganism, promoting interfaith dialogue, developing pagan liturgies and theologies, and supporting pagan-identified uu religious professionals.
the covenant of unitarian universalist pagans (cuups) was chartered by the unitarian universalist association at the general assembly in 1987 for purposes of enabling:


networking among pagan identified uus; providing outreach of unitarian universalism to the broader pagan community continentally.
providing educational materials on paganism for unitarian universalist congregations and the general public.
promoting pagan - jewish & christian dialogue; encouraging the development of theo/alogical and liturgical materials based on earth and nature centered religious and spiritual perspectives.
encouraging greater use of music, dance, visual arts, poetry, story, and creative ritual in unitarian universalist worship and celebration.
providing support for pagan-identified uu religious professionals and ministerial students; and fostering healing relationships with our mother the earth and all her children.
