the dream job





received the rejection call today.  uh huh.  "you did very well, it was a hard decision, but the other candidate had more relevant experience.  we really liked you and want to keep you details on file."  i should be happy that i got to the final 2, beating out others who probably had more film experience than me, for a job at the most desirable company to work for in the independent film industry.  getting this far through what was a very competitive job application process has given me a confidence boost.  i can probably get a job at any boring company and get paid heaps more, but i don't want to.  i'm not going to rely on looking for jobs online anymore either - it's all about making the right contacts in the right companies.  i will not give up on getting my dream job, but in the meantime, i still want to leave my current job for anything else because i've had enough of babysitting incompetent people who would fail a grade 1 spelling test.  urgh, enough of complaining about my current job.  the only positive thing to come out of my job is a really funny script i'm writing about the oddballs/losers/stupid people there.  time to start networking and building more relevant experience.

never been more nervous...





i applied for a job at my dream company and was one of two selected for a second round interview.  they'll let me know the outcome tomorrow or monday.  the only times i've ever been this nervous was when i was waiting for my uni placement and high school results.  it's 4.49am and i've only had half an hour of sleep.  i don't think i will sleep tonight.  i hope to god they ring me tomorrow.  i don't want to spend the weekend in anguish.

trentham





we drove into the one-street town a few minutes before sunset.  the murky greyish-blue sky, bare trees and moderate rain fall were all the elements needed for the making of a ghost town vibe.  my quirkiness radar piqued upon driving past two street signs on a residential street - one an old peoples crossing, and the other a ducks crossing.  from that moment i knew that there was going to be something to like about trentham.we went to trentham to eat at a recommended german restaurant.  since we couldn't find it, we stopped in front of a victorian era hotel to ask for directions.  the hotel was unfortunately borded up - a sign of a lack of tourism in the town.  we walked to the milk bar/fish & chips store around the corner to get directions.  two spirited and large old ladies ran the store.  the louder one of the two wore a sailor's hat and a porcelian white set of large dentures, which produced a very toothy smile.  they told us the german restaurant closed down but told us to visit mrs marples tea room instead for beautiful foccacias.  i noticed this cute cottage cafe during our five minute drive through the entire town.we moved the car to park in front of the trentham hotel pub, which was next to mrs marples.  i alighted the car first, and was greeted by a young guy smoking outside of the pub.  his ears were accessorised with two large black disks, and he looked like every other dark haired muso fanboy in the city.  i guessed he was into punk/pop or emo.  expecting the town to be comprised of single middle aged men and old people, i was surprised to see a young guy, especially one dressed like him.  he complained about being forced to smoke outside of the pub now, given it was the first day that the non-smoking laws took effect.  we walked into the brightly lit, fireplace warm cottage that was mrs marples tea room.  it was a cafe and store that had on display typical old people country items like patchwork quilts, porcelian plates and tea pots, dolls, teddy bears, knit wear, yarn, soaps, and second hand books.  i've also never seen this many golliwogs in my life.  the cliche word to describe this country cafe is what else but charming.  a middle aged lady was working behind the front counter and making drinks.  her mother worked in the kitchen and brought the food out, always with enthusiasm about the food and care for the customers.  they both were blonde and wore pink sweaters.   we settled on a table in front of the fire place and ordered devonshire tea.  the scones were cushiony soft and warm, served with a generous amount of thick double cream and strawberry jam.  quite possibly some of the best scones i've eaten.  my friend had chicken soup that looked like it was made with love.  the aroma of the herbs and spices was drifting through the air, and it was brimming with large chunks of vegetables - not something i often see in soups nowadays.  the tea was served in an illustrated porcelian tea pot and a little tea cup with gold brim.  the entire dining setting was the epitome of quaint and ladylike.    the two ladies from the milk bar walked into mrs marples soon after and commended us for going by their recommendation, and we whole heartedly agreed with them about this lovely cafe.  i thought it was cute that they could close their milk bar when they felt like going for a coffee.  being a small town, they of course knew the owners of the cafe and they started chatting about the goings on in their life and the town.   later on the young guy from outside the pub opened the door cafe to boldly ask the owner if he could smoke inside here.  she told him to go away and everyone burst out laughing.  of all places to smoke, mrs marples would be the last.  the old ladies and the owner gossiped about the guy and said he was the mad brother of some guy in town.  the old ladies complained about his black disc earings.  to top the quirky evening off, a slightly mental steve buscemi lookalike walked in to chat with the owner and ask what he could buy from her with the few coins he had in his pocket.  at that point i knew trentham would be a good setting for a film about quirky small town people.i'd like to sit at mrs marples for a day to observe the colourful people, and especially evesdrop on their conversations.  i felt like i was watching a cafe scene out of the gilmore girls, where different locals come and go during the day, interacting with the owner and people around them.

i will not give in!





fuck having to sleep early (before midnight) to get enough rest for the next work day.  there are so many things to do and learn in this world, i'm not going to let an eight hour work schedule prevent me from living life at night.  i wish there was a pill i could take so i could stay up for 24 hours without any side effects.  i resolve sleep whenever i feel like it.  coffee was commercialised for a reason.

we are fun





what does "i like to have fun" actually mean?  i actually don't like having fun.  i like to stay at home on a saturday night to do soul enriching activities like read, write and watch movies, while everyone else is walking about in skimpy dresses in the cold.  suzie also likes to stay home on saturdays to draw and read.  so maybe we don't like having fun.  there are people who like having fun, and there are people who are fun.  it's a natural state of being.  we fall into the second category.  you know what, we refrain from going out on saturday nights because we're sick of getting into fights with attention whores who acuse us of stealing the spotlight from them.  we can't help it that we're fun without even trying.  hah.  shove that down your skanky low cut dress.it's a good thing that suzie likes eating (especially goods of the baked variety), because i enjoy baking.  in fact, she only talks to me in the hope that i will bake something again one day.  i think when looks at me she pictures my head as a cupcake, with my hair as the frosting.  she smells cupcakes the moment i enter a room.  suzie will be delighted to know that franz ferdinand will be releasing a new album early next year.  at the gig we are going to wear t-shirts with each other's photos on it (printed on our matching skull t-shirts) so we won't lose each other.  omg, in ten years time we will look back at photos of the band and say "omg, those red and navy striped t-shirts are so 2006."

junk mail 26/6/07





loulou came running down the stairs all in a panic, she ran through the living room into the kitchen and straight to the back door.usually little help is needed from you, but its wise to stay close to be sure that the mothers lack of experience does not cause any problems. mating west highland white mating west highland white it is important that your westie is mated at the right time if she is to conceive. i was advised to only let loulou eat three placentas? they may well develop swollen breasts and may even produce milk.

junk mail 25/6/07





so, he turns out to be a bargain basement bionic man.it turns out that this vagrant is from a long lost line of samurais. my samurai wont go before the cameras until next year.the film revolves around a german general's plan to snuff out adolph hitler at the height of world war ii. "the latest indiana jones production news? along with the batmobile we are introducing a new vehicle, the batpod, a new batsuit and some classic characters in the joker and harvey dent.exclusive: gianni nunnari on ronin and scorsese's silence!"the wachowski brothers said to me one day that they were always disturbed that their nieces and nephews could never see their movies.contest: win huge prizes from license to wed! they will be appearing alongside tom cruise in the project.an entire line of action play items will allow boys to role-play being the dark knight. there is no word on when the film will start shooting." jaylath maintains that standard dvd still has a bright future and that "digital delivery" is "set for large gains in the coming years.
