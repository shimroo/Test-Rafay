dean boyce's statement on amicus brief filed by president bollinger

president bollinger announced that columbia university along with many other academic institutions (sixteen, including all ivy league universities) filed an amicus brief in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york challenging the executive order regarding immigrants from seven designated countries and refugees. among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values america has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”

this recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within columbia engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. as a school of engineering and applied science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. it is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.
i am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. we are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as columbia.
sincerely,
 
mary c. boyce
dean of engineering
morris a. and alma schapiro professor
