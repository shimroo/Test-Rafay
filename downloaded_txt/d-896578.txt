rees concert line lever harps 










the arch of a walnut aberdeen meadows harp with our autumn leaves ornamentation.





from our 36-string aberdeen meadows harp to our 27-string morgan meghan harp, all of the harps in our rees concert lever harps line are built around what makes this harp the best harp for what you want to do. whether you are playing for yourself with your 30-string shaylee meadows harp or sitting in on an irish session in your favorite pub with your 34-string mariposa harp, the job of every harp we make is to respond to and reflect the player. we demonstrate our commitment to this concept by going so far as to make two of our harps, the aberdeen meadows and the mariposa, in more than one range…because we know every player really, really, really is not the same. we also make a double harp version of our mariposa, shaylee and morgan meghan harps. if you really want to blow an audience away or if you are really serious about using a harp for music therapy, double harps are remarkably well suited to the purpose. if you are looking for something smaller, less expensive or lighter, head on over to the website for our famous harpsicle® harps. however large or small, simple or ornate, your harp should bring you nothing but joy. joy is the point of what we do.accessories, electronics & strings










a battery powered fishman loudbox amp. perfect for gigs on the go.





having the right accessories for your harp can make all the difference. from that extra string set, to an amplifier that is well matched to rees lever harps, to a sturdy stand so you can stand and play your lap harp while on stage, we work hard to see the world from the perspective of our customers and then supply the accessories that will make your journey with your harp seamless. head on over to our marketplace and browse but be careful, there may very well be that something you just have to have!



make yours extraordinary



at rees we believe that a harp should not just be a reflection of your musical voice but of your artistic aesthetic as well. for some people, the eloquence of the woods speak for themselves. others are drawn to our classic ornamentation. then there are those who find that nothing but an utterly unique work will turn their harp into their treasure. whatever your desire, our team of artists are here for you and welcome your ideas and dreams.the basics and the science of the harp










find out why the soundboards of good harps “belly up.”





because of the massive amount of string pressure on the soundboard of any harp they have challenges most other stringed instruments do not. find out why the soundboards of good harps belly up…but not too much, and why not all bridge pins are the same, and why rees concert line harps have asymmetrical soundboards. explore the elements menu to get down to the details about why we make our harps the way we do. the general harp info. menu is filled with all sorts of basic information which is not specific to our harps but is often widely misunderstood even from within the harp world. the harp care menu is exactly what it looks like, it provides tips for how to do all the most basic harp care and harp repairs. explore!
