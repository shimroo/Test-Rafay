legal  newsboi  reporting status



boi update 1/26/25: supreme court ruled but another case in texas keeps boi required filing on hold! per fincen's website related to beneficial ownership information reporting: "in light of a recent federal court order, reporting companies are not currently required to file beneficial ownership information with fincen and are not subject to liability if they fail to do so while the order remains in force. however, reporting companies may continue to voluntarily submit beneficial ownership information reports."



january 23, 2025, the united states supreme court stayed the “universal” injunction ordered by the 5th district court of appeals in mchenry v. texas top cop shop, incorporated, et al. case no. 4:24-cv-478. the result appears to be that the reporting requirement is again in effect. the supreme court’s opinion does not specify any extension of time in which to comply with the cta reporting requirements. at this time, further guidance has not been added to the fincen website.fifth circuit’s merits panel vacated a portion of the decision of the motions panel, reviving the nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the cta. the result is that currently, there is a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the cta and all reporting requirements, including the boi reporting requirements. see the fincen alert dated dec. 27, 2024, found at https://fincen.gov/boi:2025 court holidaysthe 2025 court holidays are out.  14 for broward, 15 for dade, and 17 for palm beach.   all three counties are now celebrating juneteenth and rosh hashanah  but only dade is celebrating yom kippur. broward is no longer taking off for columbus day.  for christmas 2025 dade gets scrooged with one day off  and santa has stuffed palm beach’s stocking  with a five day weekend.  happy 2025!new flood disclosure requirement. effective october 1, 2024, a seller must complete and provide a flood disclosure to a purchaser of residential property at or before the signing of the sales contract.new law for extrajudicial removal of unauthoried occupantsjuly 1, 2024:  florida statute  82.036  comes into effect  authorizing extra-judicial removal of unauthorized occupants  by filing a complaint with the county sheriff.   in broward the sheriff recommends you come to the main office (2601 w broward blvd, fort lauderdale, fl 33312)   and request the forms in person  and pay the sheriff’s fee. gov vetos state preemption of short term rrentalsjune 2024:  governor vetoes law preempting regulation of short term rentals to the state of florida.  both local governments and the short term rental industry are delighted.  the bill proposed new regulations that would prevent local governments from enforcing existing ordinances or passing any new measures exclusively applicable to vacation rentals. instead, these measures would have to apply to all residential properties, effectively limiting local control over vacation rentals.restriction of foreign interests in florida real propertyeffective july 1, 2023  a new florida law criminalizes the purchase of certain florida real estate by certain foreign nationals and for knowing violations by sellers and title agents.requires addendum to purchase and sale contract and buyer affidavit of compliance.click here  to read more  to to access the new required forms.citizens of cuba, china, venezuela, russia, syria, north korea and iran have until the end of january to register certain real estate with the florida department of commerce, under a law passed earlier this year. the consequences of not registering with the state include steep penalties — $1,000 per day — and even property seizure.state pre-emption of all county & municipal residential landlord tenant laws.  30 day notice of non-renwal statewide enacted6/29/23:  hb 1417 signed into law   effective july 1, 2023.   all residential landlord-tenant law pre-empted to the state.   all county and city residential landlord tenant laws now void.   notice of non-renewal period for  month to month tenancies  and notice of rent increases,  now 30 days statewide.   there are no more 15 day notice or 60 day notices.tip:  notices of non-renewal / rent increases issued on the day of july 1st  can take effect july 31.   the same notices  issued before or after july 1,  will take effect august 31.fee in lieu of security deposit law enacted6/2/23  hb 133:  signed into law allowing tenants to choose to pay a monthly fee in lieu of a security deposit  if offered by landlord.  the fee is not applied toward any damage for which the tenant remains liable.new clerk of court appointed for dade6/9/2023:  juan fernandez-barquin  has been appointed clerk of court  for miami-dade county.  the appointment is for the remainder of harvey ruvin’s unexpired term, through the 2024 election.new florida law requires landlords to run background checks on all employeesflorida enacts “myia’s law”  june 27, 2022, f.s. 83.151 requiring landlords to run background checks on their employees and extending the notice period for notices of intent to enter a rental premises from 12 to 24 hoursyou can order florida compliant background reports here -

areas of practice



real estate closingsbuying real estate is a complicated business. the answer to why you need an attorney is easy to understand by asking yourself a simple question: “who at the closing table is loyal to you?” many people are surprised to learn that real estate agents have no duty of loyalty to put the buyer's or seller's best interests ahead of their own.real estate closing steps



unlawful detainerunlawful detainer applies to persons occupying a dwelling unit as a guest of the person in lawful possession ( the owner or rightful tenant ). more about unlawful detainer



evictionsevictions are filed in the county court of the county where the property is located.  the first step is to terminate the tenancy. evicting commercial tenantsevicting residential tenantscosts & fees



tenant screeninga large percentage of tenants that we evict have a history of evictions. the landlord does not make money evicting tenants. save yourself the aggravation by screening your applicants.request a tenant screening



ejectmentany time an occupant of a dwelling unit has a claim to ownership of the property,  you will have to file an ejectment in circuit court to remove such person.  this is not a summary proceeding.  the defendant will have 20 days to file a responsive pleading.   the case will take many months.  what constitutes a claim of ownership?a contract to purchase the property.  an option to purchase the property.  even if said contracts/options have expired.  a claim to the property in probate.  spousal rights under florida homestead.contact us for further information about filing an ejectment.
