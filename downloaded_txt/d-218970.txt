sligo,ireland: history, heritage, irish folklore, information and news from county sligo, ireland






 
 










 


 



welcome to irish traditions, heritage and folklore at sligoheritage! 

        "...each age is a dream that is dying/ or one that is coming to birth..." 





for
        the devotee of irish history, heritage, mythology or folklore, county sligo 
        in the west coast province of connacht, has everything. for those who 
        take time to read the landscape, every stone and hill has its own unique, 
        often bloody, story to tell. here one can literally trace the dramatic 
        tendrils of our nation, from mythological origins through a turbulent 
        history to a modern nation. in its lofty mountains, its winding rivers, 
        its jagged coastline, god has created here a land blessed by time and 
        unspoiled by time or man. 
the mighty prow of 'bare benbulbens head,' made famous by the poet w.b. yeats, defines the county sligo landscape. this is the 'yeats' country', a countryside rich in history, folklore and mythology. in drumcliffe churchyard the poet himself lies at peace in the sligo soil that inspired much of his work. 





my name is joe mc gowan, host of this, county sligo's only heritage site.  my interest in heritage, folklore and history has led to the writing and publishing of several books on the subject. these web pages have been created to give the visitor an understanding, not just of sligo's history, and heritage, but also a taste of current events.






knocknarea, final resting place of  maeve, iron age queen of connacht 


unfolded here are the beliefs of ordinary 
        people, their superstitions, customs and way of life. our journey revealing 
        the character of ireland, and county sligo in particular, is a microcosm, 
        not just of sligo, but of a romantic ireland on the verge of extinction. 
        in a series of articles the lives of historical figures and events will 
        be told. the warp and weft of everyday people, their existence mostly 
        uncelebrated and unsung, will be discovered here too.

"how many, ignorant of their own country, 
          run eagerly into foreign regions to search out and admire whatever curiosities 
          are to be found, many of which are much inferior to those which offer 
          themselves to our eyes at home": linnaeus
