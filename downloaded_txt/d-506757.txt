choosing perseverance in 2025






that prayer of loss and hope has brought me through rough days, days of completely uncalled for sufferings. despite it all, i persevered, and like the tree and butterflies on my sleeve, even change and loss brings beauty. as the tree loses its leaves, it allows for new and better growth. it is beautiful. as the caterpillar enters the darkness of the cocoon and the disgusting process of transforming, it is beautiful in its change. even this moment, with its pain and anger and disgust, can be one where beauty peaks through. even in the midst of this, we can persevere and improve and make the world we deserve.

accepting 'death' at the end of 2024






i love tarot. i have read tarot cards as a means of grounding myself, finding hope when i’ve felt at my lowest and grasping motivation when i just can’t seem to hold on to it. one card that i have grown to love but has been given a bad reputation is the death card. at first glance, the death card is scary. you have a skeleton in armor riding a horse into a gruesome scene of loss. despite this, i think that the death card and what it represents can be really positive.

night cannot last forever






even amid the cold of winter, we keep showing up for each other by rendering mutual aid, fighting against unjust restrictions, standing with marginalized communities that have become the targets of state-sanctioned violence, and by building our capacity to imagine a world free from the familiar oppressions of the past.in that way, our dearest calling is not to keep producing or even to keep resisting, but rather to keep actively and creatively hoping — to keep engaged in believing that spring is coming in the future despite the real and frigid winter that grasps us today.

we take care of each other






this has not been an easy year. but after a challenging election season and finding out 2 out of 5 members of our team have cancer (myself included), we’re managing to stumble through with lots of grit & grace.now more than ever, we’re learning the importance of patient-centered care, whether it be for abortions or cancer treatments. i’m proud of everything we’re building at faith choice ohio, but most of all, for how we care for one another and those whom we serve.

bodily autonomy is the ballgame






without a fundamental agreement that people have a right to govern their own bodies, society can sanction a whole host of evils. people can be forced to give birth against their will. children can be forced to use bathrooms they never chose. adults can be forced into sterilization without consent or convincing.anything is possible when you no longer have to value someone’s expertise over their own body.

 hope in us: a pastoral response to the election






beloveds, may we not lose hope or grow weary in doing good. hope may be frail, but it is enduring and never in vain.in this spirit, i leave you with these self-care resources & reflections below from our entire team who give me endless hope. when words escape me, my team reminds me to look beyond myself at the reservoir of strength that is within our community and among the marginalized — yet astoundingly resilient — communities that we serve.

never give up: ohio's prophetic task






even now, as our faith communities express joy at the outcomes of this last year, we know that our hope — that final task of the prophetic community — is rooted in something deeper than winning elections or succeeding at our strategic objectives.our movement is fueled by an indomitable sense of collective perseverance — of showing up for each other time and time again, making real the truth of our solidarity that no illusion can obscure or deny.

i'm voting for issue 1 because of my faith — not in spite of it






as i wrote in a recently published op-ed, “issue 1 will ensure that ohio protects the fundamental rights of our citizens to control their own bodies — by the government, or by someone else’s faith convictions — to give birth in a free and prosperous ohio.” i am voting yes on issue 1 because of my faith — not in spite of it: “issue 1 is about putting ohioans back in charge of their families’ personal medical decisions – and that’s exactly where my christian faith tells me they belong.”
