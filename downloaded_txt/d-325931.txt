welcome to levering orchard, celebrating our 116th year in 2024. recently levering orchard was named one of the “15 best cherry orchards in america” by tasting table magazine, a prominent food magazine, citing, among other distinctions, the orchard’s “unforgettable u-pick experience.” as always, this year you can pick your own cherries at reasonable prices, and if you want cherries already picked, our pickers will do their best to pick them for you. now, more than ever, going to a farm, being outdoors, getting away from crowded places, and buying fresh, local fruit is a great experience for the family. it’s fun, safe, and educational for children and adults alike to spend time on this beautiful mountain.
while continuing his second career as a best-selling author with nine books, twenty-six plays, and a hollywood film to his credit, owner frank levering also carries on the tradition started by his grandparents in 1908. in addition to apples and pears, levering orchard features 33 acres of cherry trees with an amazing 59 varieties to choose from — imagine! we call it cherry mountain. ours is the largest and most beautiful cherry orchard in the south, and has the greatest selection of cherries both sweet and sour.

picking dates for 2024
because of a labor shortage that is affecting most businesses and farms right now, we can not guarantee already picked cherries this year. we will try our best to pick enough to meet demand, and almost always we can do that. but if at all possible, please bring pickers with you if you are unable to pick cherries yourself. picking your own is fun, relatively easy — and cheaper!
we estimate the orchard will be open for sweet-cherry picking on saturday, may 25. this date is estimated — we may in fact open up several days earlier — or later —  in accordance with the weather. be sure to call or email before you come! the numbers are 276-755-2224; 276-755-3593; or (less reliable, because of cell phone reception) 276-730-4722. email us at franklevering1@gmail.com. again, we can not guarantee already picked cherries this year. to be sure you get cherries, please pick your own or bring pickers.
sour cherry picking will begin saturday, june 1st. if you have any questions, please call the phone numbers listed above or email us before you come. because of labor shortages and high demand, we can not guarantee already picked sour cherries. but we will do our absolute best.
also, because of high demand, we strongly advise that you come for sour cherries as soon as you can after we start picking.
bumper crop of fall apples!
the apple season begins on labor day, september 2. you can pick your own apples every weekend, saturday and sunday, starting on saturday, september 7. pick-your-own apples continues into october. sales from already picked apples continue into november.
payment: cash or checks only. no cards.
