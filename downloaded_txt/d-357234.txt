teachers union & bureaucracy in illinois fight trump on immigration

                            authorities and the education establishment in illinois are gearing up to resist federal immigration law and try to block enforcement to protect illegal immigrants, setting the stage for a potential showdown of historic with the u.s. government.

illinois homeschool freedoms at risk!

                            over the years, we have loved being able to tell people that illinois was among the best states with homeschooling freedoms. that is thanks, in part to a 1950 case (people v. levisen) in which the illinois supreme court determined that the term "private school" included instruction given to a child at home, as long as the instruction was adequate.

the budde system

                            a while back, in the first decade of this century, moody publishers offered a prayer journal notebook by e.m. bounds. this methodist minister died in 1913. during the 70-plus years of his life, he wrote several books on prayer. one of his classics is titled power through prayer.

state lawmakers want to legalize prostitution – to increase safety?

                            back in may 2024, we warned our readers in an email alert about the fact that some state lawmakers were preparing to push legislation to legalize prostitution in the land of lincoln. equality illinois, the state's largest lgbtq+ lobbying organization based in chicago, is one of those groups who hopes not only to pass this proposal...

generation z has an identity crisis

                            for years, the colson center has been dedicated to not just encouraging a personal relationship with jesus, but also challenging christians to use the lens of scripture to comprehend all of life.

language and the battle over life

                            52 years ago, seven out of nine robed men in washington, d.c. banged the gavel and declared a death sentence upon what would turn out to be 65 million (and counting) human beings in america. i refer to the infamous roe v. wade scotus decision of january 22, 1973. and they twisted plain language to usher in this death sentence.

when personal autonomy becomes your moral arbiter

                            personal autonomy is not a great moral standard, but culture treats it like it is. although not a new idea, its increasing prevalence and the rate at which it is being used to make moral decisions brings it into the spotlight.

did the target boycott work?

                            over the past two years, heavy pushback has worked against “pride” and “woke” agendas implemented by a variety of companies. among these companies are walmart, ford, harley-davidson, toyota, and more who are all taking steps back from their dei initiatives and lgbtq+ support.
