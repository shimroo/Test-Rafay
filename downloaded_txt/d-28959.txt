market status report



trend:
the market is moving sideways for the moment. the bulls have an upper hand, but the bears are also not sleeping.  on the other hand, we cannot say that the bears are very happy, but they do not want to change their positions yet. in fact, there is not much appetite for confirming bearish patterns.


money flow:
currently, the bulls are stronger and more money is flowing into the market.  you also have to know that the bears are not very comfortable and they are closely watching the market for a timely entry.




overbought/oversold stocks

sopa  society pass (nasdaq) [overbought]


sopa    (nasdaq) [overbought]








the chart above shows how sopa displayed a rally after the buy signal which was issued on 01/31/2025. since then, the gain in this stock stretched to a whopping 288%. we see, however, enough hints pointing to the fact that the conditions are now ripening for at least a market correction.  our system confirmed this emerging bearish mood by issuing a sell signal. the signal has just been issued, so it is not late to run to safety by selling this stock. it is still early to say if this is a decisive market top or merely a correction but it is evidently the right time to take the profits in order to prevent any disappointment in the future.
