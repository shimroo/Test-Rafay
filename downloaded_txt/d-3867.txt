volunteers, not amateurs

8 january 2013:
        apache openoffice is developed 100% by volunteers. apache does not pay for developers, for translators, for qa,
        for marketing, for ui, for support, etc. of course, we're happy to accept
        donations to the apache software foundation, to
        keep our servers runnings and for similar overhead expenses. but our products are developed entirely by
        volunteers.
      

        some users are initially worried by this statement:how can software for free, developed by
        volunteers, be any good?read on for an answer...
