        the mayor's message      

visit the mayor's pagedear residents,as we eagerly await the start of summer, i would like to share some borough happenings and keep you informed of some important dates for your calendars. first, my compliments to the ho-ho-kus shade tree and beautification committee for their stellar work in beautifying downtown. it has never looked better, and the municipal building now fittingly represents ho-ho-kus as a premier town in new jersey. the borough was among the first municipalities in nj to deliver a fully compliant water delivery system which maximized the opportunity for grant funding and debt relief for the project. the fact that we had a shovel-ready plan ahead of almost everyone else in the state not only allowed the borough to secure a loan with favorable rates, but we also were able to obtain $1 million savings off the top for debt forgiveness. this saved our residents not only a million dollars but set a substantial portion of the remaining debt at 0% interest, with the rest at very favorable rates, resulting in more savings. the 3rd annual ho-ho-kus day is scheduled for september 7th. this event has become a very successful celebration and is a great occasion to reconnect. we hope you can join us! lastly, i want to take a moment to recognize the significance of volunteerism. as i have said often, our volunteers are the lifeblood of ho-ho-kus. as we look to the future, our community stands strong and unified on the good will of our neighbors through friendship, service, dedication and commitment. i would like to personally thank each and every one of our volunteers for their contribution.congratulations to all our graduates, and best wishes for a safe and healthy summer!mayor thomas w. randall
