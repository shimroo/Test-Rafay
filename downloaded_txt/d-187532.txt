“tiziou smartly blends the seriousness of social activism with the pleasure of person-to- person connection, and it is a joy to see his installations […] the world feels so splintered and out of joint that pieces with an emphasis on community and union feel necessary and timely. tiziou proves that “individual” does not have to mean “separated,” and that the perception of “otherness” can be eased through common understanding.”—alix rosenfeld, broad street review





hi there. my name’s jj.
at its heart, all of my work is about paying attention—looking & listening, noticing the beauty that is already present in the community and shining a light on it. i strive to create safe spaces and compelling frameworks to bring people in and to facilitate new connections.
i’d love to walk with you sometime.
