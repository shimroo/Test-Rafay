599 4100how does a dallas injury lawyer prove their case? a personal injury case’s value is determined by several factors, including the severity of the injury, liability issues, and the ability to collect against a defendant.the severity of the injury is the first thing to consider. because of the severity of the injury, a more serious injury usually necessitates more compensation. the medical bills, future treatment needed, loss of earnings, physical impairment, disfigurement, pain and suffering, and other possible damages caused are all considered.the next factor to consider is the liability issues. if the defendant is entirely to blame, you should be able to attribute 100 percent of your damages to the defendant who caused them. if a jury decides that the injured person was partially to blame for the accident, the amount that person can recover will be reduced by whatever percentage the jury assigns to the injured party. the ability to collect from a defendant is another important factor to consider when determining the value of your case. if the person who caused your injury is indigent, has no insurance, no property, and no money you might not be able to collect from that person. the law office of doug goyen gathers the evidence required to prove your damages, establish liability in your case, and locate any insurance or other assets that may be available to

caused by negligence. texas categorizes these damages for injury cases as economic damages and non-economic damages.1) economic damages are compensation for actual economic or pecuniary loss (losses measured in money). texas civil practice and remedies code, section 41.001(4). common economic damages recoverable in dallas injury cases include:past and future medical bills: the amounts of medical bills incurred in the past and future to treat your injury.earning capacity lost in the past and future: the amount of money you could have earned if you hadn’t been injured.property damage: in an accident case, property damage such as damage to your car, computer, phone, or glasses is recoverable. for example, in a car wreck, your property damage claim may include the following items in addition to the actual damage done to the vehicle:rental car expenses, or if you used your property or vehicle for business purposes and lost some of your income while the vehicle was unable to be driven, are recoverable in a car wreck or accident case.storage: you will be charged if your vehicle was towed from the scene and stored in a storage yard. in the event of a car accident or a motor vehicle wreck, this is recoverable.total loss of property: if your vehicle was destroyed and cannot be repaired, you are entitled to the vehicle’s pre-accident value.diminished property value: if your vehicle has been repaired but is now worth less money as a result of the accident, you have the right to compensation for the diminished value of your vehicle.loss of services: a husband or wife is entitled to compensation if they are unable to perform their normal household duties as a result of the injury.2) non-economic damages are awarded to compensate for physical pain and suffering, mental or emotional pain or anguish, loss of consortium, disfigurement, physical impairment, loss of companionship and society, inconvenience, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to reputation, and all other nonpecuniary losses. the texas civil practice and remedies code, section 41.001(12).compensation for past and future pain and suffering is allowed, based on a jury’s common sense, knowledge, and sense of justice. in order to settle a claim, the value of pain and suffering is determined by imagining what a jury – who does not know anyone involved – will think the value is.past and future mental anguish: defined by how your physical injury has caused significant mental anguish, beyond disappointment, resentment, embarrassment, or anger, and how it will continue to do so in the future.loss of a body member or mental function: if you lost an arm, leg, hearing, or mental function or capacity as a result of the accident or injury, you may need to claim this injury separately from physical impairment or disfigurement to recover damages for the harm caused.loss of consortium: if your injury was severe enough that you could no longer enjoy the companionship of your family members, you are entitled to compensation for the harm done to your family relationships.physical impairment in the past and future: how you have been physically impaired in the past and how you will be physically impaired in the future as a result of your injury. physical impairment is texas’ definition of “loss of enjoyment of life.”disfigurement in the past and future: how the injury physically disfigured you in the past and how it will physically disfigure you in the future.emotional/mental trauma (bystander injury): if a close relative witnesses the event in some way, such as witnessing a loved one

injuries handled by our dallas injury lawyer for a variety of reasons, the law allows for the recovery of injuries caused by negligence. restoring the injured person to the position they would have been in had the injury not occurred. a court’s only option for carrying out this compensation is to award money. holding wrongdoers accountable serves as a deterrent to wrongdoers and their insurers to implement safety policies and correct bad behavior. wrongdoers are required by law to pay for the harm they cause. in negligence cases, the following types of injuries are common:head injuries and

characteristics of the injury, tbi is typically classified as mild, moderate, or severe.facial injury: facial injuries include injuries to the mouth, face, and jaw. these range from minor facial cuts and lacerations to more serious issues like broken teeth and facial bones. fractures in the lower or upper jaw, palate, cheekbones, or eye sockets are all possible.eye injury: a black eye, bleeding in the eye, burns and irritation, corneal abrasions, injuries from a foreign object, orbital fractures, retinal detachments, pvd injuries, and floaters from pvds or retinal detachments or fractures are all examples of eye injuries from trauma.detached retina: when an accident victim’s head collides with a forceful object, such as a window, steering wheel, or windshield, a break or tear in the retina can occur. if left untreated, this tear can result in a retinal detachment, which can cause permanent damage to one or both eyes and, in severe cases, blindness.pvd eye injury: pvd (posterior vitreous detachment) is a condition that occurs when the vitreous membrane separates from the retina. this condition is defined as the separation of the posterior hyaloid membrane from the retina anywhere posterior to the vitreous base.eye floater injury: severe eye injuries are not cheap to treat. repairing a detached retina or performing a vitrectomy to remove floaters can cost thousands of dollars. if your eye injury was caused by someone else’s negligence, you may be entitled to compensation.back injuries: back injuries can occur as a result of car accidents, falls, assaults, and other traumatic events. back injuries are commonly characterized by pain, tenderness, pain with movement, coughing, sneezing, or laughing, stiffness, difficulty moving, difficulty standing up straight, muscle spasms, bruising, swelling, and radiating pain down either leg or both.neck injuries: neck injuries are an all-too-common side effect of a wide range of accidents. these injuries can have long-term ramifications. if you have suffered a neck injury as a result of someone else’s carelessness or negligence, you may be able to seek compensation to cover medical and other costs.burns

medical equipment and supplies, followed by physical therapy and multiple surgeries.leg injury: people can sustain a variety of leg injuries as a result of trauma caused by negligence. they include upper leg fractures, lower leg fractures, dislocations, knee injuries, ankle injuries, and foot injuries.ankle injury: ankle injuries are serious injuries that can occur as a result of car accidents

achilles tendon, dislocations, compartment syndrome, and amputations.knee injury: many victims of negligence suffer knee injuries that include soft tissue, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and joint damage. due to the blunt force trauma or twisting of the knee, a traumatic impact can result in a fracture, dislocation, cartilage tear, sprain, or strain.acl tear in knee: acl tears are severe knee injuries. it is one of the four major ligaments in the knee. it runs down the middle of the knee diagonally. it also provides rotational stability to the knee.pelvis & hip injury: a pelvic or hip injury can be extremely debilitating. these injuries can occur as a result of a direct hit, a severe twisting motion, or even the compression-type motion seen in trip and fall accidents and car accidents.chest injury: trauma-related chest wall injuries can include chest wall injuries, sternal fractures, shoulder girdle fractures, contusions and hematomas, rib fractures, and flail chest.arm injury: the humerus, radius, and ulna are the three bones that make up the arm. medical treatment, including surgery, is likely depending on the location of the injury and the severity of the fracture. blisters (contusions), sprains (ligament injuries), tendon injuries, pulled muscles (strains), ruptures of the bicep or tricep tendon, fractures, dislocations, shoulder injuries, elbow injuries, hand injuries, and wrist injuries are all common arm injuries.wrist injury: depending on the severity of the wrist injury, the victim may require extensive medical treatment, including

lawyer cost? there is no fee unless and until you win! in injury cases, personal injury lawyers work on a contingency basis. there is no need to pay anything upfront. the lawyer is only paid if they are successful in your case. the texas disciplinary rules of professional conduct rule 1.04(d) fees, defines a contingency fee as a “fee contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered.” this means the attorney cannot collect the fee unless a certain result is obtained. in personal injury cases this means that if the lawyer is unable to recover any money in your case, the lawyer is not paid.personal injury attorneys charge a percentage of the amount recovered for your claims. in practice, this transforms into a performance-based contract. the better your attorney performs in your case, the more money they make. this aligns your lawyer’s interests with yours in personal injury cases. in texas, a contingency fee is determined by the lawyer you hire (some charge a higher percentage), but it is typically 1/3 of the amount recovered for your injury case and can rise to 40% if a lawsuit is required.no fee unless you win call (972) 599 4100 free consultation and
