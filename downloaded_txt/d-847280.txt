*************************************************************************************************************
the combination of covid 19, age, assorted aches,
pains and infirmities have made necessary the definitive close down of tla's
remaining business activities effective december 31, 2022. 
it has been a good run and i thank all of those who
helped make the business a success over the years.
there are lots of capable younger people out there now
who can provide the kind of services i have enjoyed doing over the years.  
i wish them all the best fortune..
