our mission:silkroad creates music that engages difference, sparking radical cultural collaboration and passion-driven learning for a more hopeful and inclusive world.





















silkroad’s uplifted voices brings together a stellar lineup of performer-composers from the silkroad ensemble in a series of pieces that highlight each artist’s musical storytelling. these compositions, often inspired by their homeland, ancestors, community, and family, represent previously under-recognized voices from around the world, offering a fresh perspective on the history and migration of music.
