what's new
we are in the process of scanning w. 
t.'s first book, a
history of jefferson, county, texas, which will be a work in progress
for some time.  this book was 
w. t.'s master's thesis at lamar university
and was published in 1976.
there are now 468 articles published on this site.  up to this
point most of the work has been relatively easy, since the majority of what is on the site
to date was written within the last decade and was therefore already in electronic form.
some of the newest articles represent the beginning of the next
phase, converting work that was done in the prior three decades into electronic
format.  sabine pass in the civil war was originally published in the east
texas historical journal in october 1971.  this article was scanned in from a
photocopy of that document.   scanning is imprecise at best, and downright error
prone at worst. our best efforts to find and correct these errors are being employed, but
the process is slow.   naturally, we welcome any feedback with regard to errors
discovered by our readers.
