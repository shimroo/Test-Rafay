          💡watch those incident to services! the oig knows this is a huge area of non-compliance. 

it is imperative to fully understand and communicate this concept in order to stay compliant if your practice relies on apps for the care of your patients. 

ask yourself: is the 15% reimbursement boost between billing under a physician vs. an app really worth the risk? 🤔 if you’re on the fence, check out the oig’s list of settlements & self-disclosures related to this topic.

announcement soon for five additional and necessary diversity crna 2025 information session & airway simulation lab workshops!

marginalized rns before applying to programs with diverse crna mentors and actively engaged in the immersion model for diversifying nurse anesthesia programs

fun fact: out of a 65k crna workforce, only 4% are black crnas, 4% hispanic crnas, 3% asian crnas & 0.7% indigenous crnas

repeat after me…i will be a crna!!

          pediatric clinicians (of which i’m definitely not one, but i listen well) will frequently tell you: children are not just little adults.

that goes for clinical criteria used to diagnose pediatric conditions, and associated cdi and coding work. and in particular, respiratory failure.

i was glad to see acdis and the american college of physician advisors (acpa) collaborate on an important new white paper, “developing pediatric respiratory failure criteria.” the paper is part 1 of a two-part series addressing respiratory failure in both pediatric and neonatal populations. part 1 focuses on the pediatric population (patients older than 28 days and younger than 18 years). neonatal patients will be covered in part 2.

normally acdis white papers are for members, but non-members can access it through nov. 8. see link below.

while the paper offers clinical information and definitions, it does not offer a formula for wholesale adoption. rather, its purpose is to help healthcare organizations develop, refine, and validate their own internal criteria. 

the paper does offer some helpful baseline criteria. from the paper:

💡 “respiratory failure is the inability of the respiratory system to meet the body’s oxygenation, ventilation, and/or metabolic requirements. it is important to know the values and presentations that are considered to be within the defined limits of each patient population. any underlying condition, process, or trauma that interferes with oxygenation or ventilation can result in respiratory failure.”

it then adds context for the pediatric population, listing examples of cardiopulmonary diseases, infections, neurologic disorders, traumas, and complications secondary to medical interventions.

these are worth reviewing for any cdi or coding professional as the basis for compliant query.

it also covers acute, chronic, and acute on chronic respiratory failure, as well as its three types (hypoxic, hypercapnic, combined).

perhaps most useful is discussion on clinical signs, symptoms and diagnostics, which should prove helpful for clinical validation of a respiratory failure diagnosis—potentially staving off payer denials. per the paper:

💡 “documentation should include indicators such as: tachypnea, bradypnea, retractions (e.g., intercostal, subcostal, suprasternal), head bobbing, nasal flaring, grunting, cyanosis, diaphragmatic breathing, diaphoresis, lethargy, confusion, difficulty feeding, tripoding/posturing/ extended airway, wheezing, stridor, crackles (fine/coarse), diminished paradoxical movement, flail chest, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, acidosis (respiratory/metabolic).”

whether “the dark half” (i.e., payers) adopt similar diagnostic criteria to level the playing field and play with a common set of rules remains to be seen. but i applaud the effort.

have you read the paper? does your organization struggle with pediatric respiratory failure (if you even have a pediatric cdi program)? leave a comment below.

          heads up to those of you in the billing industry. regulations are always changing. he is correct you do not want to end up in an oig audit! being proactive in billing rather than retro active is always the best.

          “we failed her miserably. she left or nursing altogether.”

the healthcare industry is facing a critical nursing shortage, and inadequate training is driving many nurses away from the profession.💔 during the pandemic cynthia l. garza, dnp, rn, cnor, was the director of surgical and endoscopy services in a brand new 59-bed hospital with 3 ors, 2 endoscopy suites, and a cath lab—and the facility lost 60% of its perioperative nurses. recruitment efforts for experienced or nurses were falling short, so cynthia tried to onboard a nurse with no prior or experience.

without a structured framework, the attempt failed.

this experience drove home an important lesson: nurse retention requires support, structure, and teamwork. cynthia rebuilt her approach by collaborating with surgical teams and using evidence-based onboarding strategies to create a more sustainable future for her team.

✨ with tools like periop 101, she found a way to provide the consistency and guidance her nurses needed to succeed. the results?

💡 two nurses trained during the program are still thriving years later.

📉 turnover costs reduced significantly.

💙 a stronger team, better prepared to handle challenges.

cynthia’s story is a powerful reminder of the impact thoughtful training and leadership can have—not just on nurse retention, but on patient care and team morale.

          the importance of proper wound care
wound care is a critical aspect of healthcare. it is a specialized field that focuses on managing and treating wounds.
proper wound care cannot be overstated.

          good morning. alonso. it is really simple. get in contact with your coder in your facility; request the icd-10 codes for clabsis, ssi, etc. the reason behind this is that the final person dictating the final diagnosis of the patient is the physician. so, you may think there is a hospital infection, but the physician will classify the condition as different i usually request the information by the 15 of each closing cycle. that will give you a perfect picture of where you are in terms of accuracy with your hais. take care.
