what's a gem electric vehicle?
 



 






it’s not a golf cart. and it’s not a highway vehicle. it’s an electric vehicle (ev) engineered for local streets. unlike golf carts, gem electric cars are street legal on most roads 35 mph (50 kmh) or less and travels at a maximum speed of 25 mph (40 kmh). additionally, gems are engineered to exceed low-speed vehicle (lsv) federal safety standards.the 2025 gem redefines lsv performance with more than 30 modern ev enhancements that deliver a driving experience that replicates automotive standards. the core of the design is improved performance, serviceability, parts availability and new technologies.

easy, flexible ev charging 







whether you travel a few miles or drive all day, our gem electric cars offer flexible battery and charging options to ensure your vehicle is ready to move when you need it. our chargers plug into public ev charging stations and 110v outlets—the same you’d use to charge your smartphone. and, just like a smartphone, you can bring your charger with you, for easy charging when you’re on the go. we also offer two fast charger options and solar panels for convenience and off-the-grid charging.

safe 



federally classified a low-speed vehicle (lsv), gem electric vehicles are held to a higher standard than the typical golf cart. gem exceeds national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) lsv safety standards through several features including an occupant protection system (ops) that is roof crush certified, high-back, forward-facing bucket seats for all passengers and optional hard doors for a fully enclosed cab. with a max speed of 25 mph, gem promotes a safer environment for pedestrians and vehicles to coexist.  











 



sustainable 



							gem is a sustainable ev that doesn’t sacrifice quality, payload capacity, or the ability to seat up to six people. with zero co2 emissions and optional solar panels, gem enables cities, communities, and campuses to meet their sustainability goals.						











 







stylish 



gem offers premium finishes to fit your style, including a panoramic roof, 16-inch sport wheels, vegan leather seats and a roof rack. with our full portfolio of options, you can build a vehicle that best suited to your needs and application. 







 







cost-efficient​ 



gem evs have a far lower total cost of ownership compared to vans and trucks. with no fuel costs and lower maintenance costs, gems provide savings without compromising productivity. in addition to saving on maintenance and fuel costs, you may be eligible for electric vehicle incentives or rebates.  



























put gem electric vehicles to work 







gem electric vehicles provide innovative new ways to think about safety, sustainability, cost-efficiency, and convenience—especially if you’re moving people and goods across college campuses, resorts, city centers, residential communities, government bases, and other micro-environments. with 10 pre-selected packages ranging from maintenance to deliveries, we make it easy to find a work vehicle for your application, no matter the job or climate.
