spam filtering with procmail
current version: 20030115



about junkfilter


junkfilter is a
procmail
-based filter system for electronic mail.  procmail is a popular and
powerful mail-processing program available for nearly all unix systems.
this means that junkfilter doesn't work on windows, aol,
hotmail, yahoo! mail, juno, webtv, or any other type of system--just unix
(bsd, linux, solaris, etc.).

junkfilter filters a wide range of spam using many different
types of filters.  it is configurable on a systemwide or per-user
basis.  is unsolicited commercial email (uce) filling up your mailbox?
can't stand the thought of webmail-style throwaway email addresses?
take control of your inbox: filter out 90+% of that spam with
junkfilter.

older releases of junkfilter were licensed under the terms of version 2 of the 
gnu general public license

obtaining junkfilter


i strongly suggest that you 
read the readme file before you download or try to install.

then you can:

download the current release,
view the files in the current release,
browse the cvs tree [sourceforge.net], or
checkout from anonymous cvs [sourceforge.net].


if you are a freebsd user, you 
may want to use the

freebsd port/package of junkfilter instead.

you can also download older releases, but i really don't
recommend it.

help improve junkfilter!


help improve junkfilter!
if you know procmail, or would like an example of a working
procmail-based tool of medium complexity to play with or 
hack around on, take a look at the junkfilter code.  there 
are lots of ways to improve the system.  please submit 
bugs (and preferably patches) to the management systems at
sourceforge:


bugs:  
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=113498&group_id=13498&func=browse

patches:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=313498&group_id=13498&func=browse


bugs, patches, questions, and comments may also be posted
to the junkfilter-users mailing list or to the author.  note
that emailing the author directly has the lowest probability
of receiving a timely response. 



if you can't use junkfilter


(if you don't have procmail or access to procmail (through a shell 
account on your isp), you could
try myles white's 
filtering strategies for popular programs such as eudora, outlook,
netscape, and pegasus. they're not as good as procmail, but they're a
whole lot better than nothing.)



contact


i hope the junkfilter junk mail filtration system is of use to 
you.  please contact the author for
more information.
