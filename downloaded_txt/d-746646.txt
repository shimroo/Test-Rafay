bible gateway : rom 1;  typing practice. 8 first, i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.9 god, whom i serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his son, is my witness how constantly i remember you10 in my prayers at all times; and i pray that now at last by god's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.11 i long to see you so that i may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--12 that is, that you and i may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.13 i do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that i planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that i might have a harvest among you, just as i have had among the other gentiiles.14 i am obligated both to greeks and non-greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.15 that is why i am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at rome.16 i am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of god for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the jew, then for the gentile.17 for in the gospel a righteousness from god is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: "the righteous will live by faith." 18 the wrath of god is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,19 since what may be known about god is plain to them, because god has made it plain to them.20 for since the creation of the world god's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.21 for although they knew god, they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 although they claimed to be wise, they became fools23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.24 therefore god gave them over in teh sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.25 they exchanged the truth of god for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the creator--who is forever praised. amen.26 because of this, god gave them over to shameful lusts. even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.27 in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.28 furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.29 they have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. they are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. they are gossips,30 slanderers, god-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.32 although they know god's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

	 bible gateway : rom 1; next section - retyping
    


bible gateway : rom 1;  8 first, i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.9 god, whom i serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his son, is my witness how constantly i remember you10 in my prayers at all times; and i pray that now at last by god's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.11 i long to see you so that i may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--12 that is, that you and i may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.13 i do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that i planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that i might have a harvest among you, just as i have had among the other gentiles.14 i am obligated both to greeks and non-greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.15 that is why i am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at rome.16 i am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of god for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the jew, then for the gentile.17 for in the gospel a righteousness from god is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: "the righteous will live by faith." observations: verse 14-17 are already fairly familiar and will come easily. verse 8-10 not too bad (first verses in a section are usually quickly learned) but 11-13 will be tougher, as they're both middle verses and longer.

	 bible gateway : rom 1; preliminary observations
    


bible gateway : rom 1;  verses 1-7: note how often "calling" is mentioned:1 - called to be an apostle5 call people...to the obedience that comes from faith6 called to belong to jesus christ7 called to be saints.suggests that paul has a lot to say about "election" in this book? key verses: 16-17i am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of god for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the jew, then for the gentile. for in the gospel a righteousness from god is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: "the righteous will live by faith." in part i think i like that last bit better in kjv, "the just shall live by faith." it has a rhythm.suggests that paul has a lot to say about salvation, righteousness, and faith in this book? verses 18-32: the famous "wrath of god" section. often cited for the verses (26-27) describing homosexual acts as shameful, indecent, etc and included among the things people did first when they turned away from the knowledge of the creator. verses 18-23: wickedness = suppressing the truth that god has made freely known through creation. "his eternal power and divine nature" paul says we all see clearly, but in wickedness we pretend not to see them. how are god's eternal power and divine nature seen by man, then? in creation? in our own hearts? will paul elaborate further on this subject? (from memory, i don't think he does?) seems worth exploring. this section makes me think of blink and seth's "natural" understanding of the existence of god as derived from his creation: seth, with his iq of 193 and ability to grasp things in an instant with the clarity most people need years to understand, looked at the world around him and saw it had to be designed, ergo there had to be a designer, so he acknowledged a belief in god. all this by logic, not faith. is this how god's divine nature and eternal power are known? or is it by signs - miracles and such? or by the spirit giving witness in our hearts (that's from galatians, right?)? i don't think there's anywhere in scripture a more eloquent - and elegant? - expression of man's fall than in this section. it's so simple: god was knowable, but man preferred to suppress that knowledge; man turned from creator to the creation; god gave them over to the ensuing depravity. it neatly sums up the state of a fallen world. paul's (somewhat exhaustive?) list of fallen man's depraved traits is handy, too. every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, depravity. envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice. gossips, slanderers, god-haters, insolent, arrogant, boastful. they invent ways of doing evil! disobey their parents, senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless - they not only do things that deserve death but approve of those who practice them. paul never was one to be subtle with the truth!

short answer: i teach latin.

~*~

long answer: i teach latin. i am an actor, a choir director, a cheerleader, and a counselor. i am a scholar and a babysitter. i live more in the past (like, around 509 b.c.) than the present, but the present is richer for it. i cajole adolescents to memorize esoteric lists of noun-endings and verb-conjugations, and i smile when i see the light go on as they experience the reason why they learn these lists. i recreate history. i dress up in a roman matron's stola. i get teenagers not just to dress up in stolas and togas, but to recline among their friends *on* a tabletop the way the romans would have reclined *at* table. i quote catullus and ovid and seneca and make them relevant to britney spears and the president and the girl who just dumped you and the big test you forgot to study for. i give life to olympians who all the kids know "never" existed. i make the root of western civilization come alive and set kids to speaking in its language: i teach latin.
