    a little something 
about catfish
 a mississippi catfish inspector describes the taste of catfish as sweet, like a pecan. noted food critic craig claiborne swears farm-raised catfish are the finest freshwater fish in north america. in fact, catfish have been served to numerous dignitaries ranging from prince charles to assembled western leaders.jumpin' catfish! the modest southern catfish must have jumped on the popularity bandwagon! all through the south, cotton and soybean farms have been turned into catfish farms where genetically superior catfish are cultivated for size, flavor, and texture. once mature, they are loaded live from the ponds and released in the processing plant, still swimming. now that's fresh!our farm-raised, grain-fed catfish is far superior to his muddy river cousin. scientifically-bred and carefully tended, he has all but acquired a pedigree now that gourmet magazine rates him the third-best-selling fish in america.higher in protein than most meats, our freshwater catfish is becoming exceedingly popular among health-conscious american diners-and with good reason. not only is our catfish low in cholesterol, fat, and calories, he also rates high in aesthetic appeal since he has no fishy smell.it is also nutritious, healthy and downright delicious. now, will we see you at the annual world catfish festival in mississippi next year, or at least back at the jumpin' catfish restaurant next week? come on down!  voted
