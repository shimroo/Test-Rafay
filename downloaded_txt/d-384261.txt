we have used the agents at duke warner realty for years and they are always outstanding. they have always been knowledgeable, courteous, and worked hard to get us what we want. their building is beautiful, and i love the location on the westside too. overall, a very good office that’s been going strong for many, many years. i would highly recommend them!

 



        jen b.

susanna was an incredible partner during the purchase of our home. her knowledge of the area is deep, and she knows how to assess a home in ways we never would have thought of (down to which way a driveway faces and if it’s likely to get icy in winter!). she was also quick to vet contracts and uncover and guide us through any issues. she is a great communicator who clearly provided all the facts we needed to make decisions, and offered her opinions when we asked. she truly went above and beyond helping us from start to finish, and she’s tirelessly cheerful besides. we’d work with her again in a second.

        bend resident    

duke warner realty is a great office full of friendly and knowledgeable agents. they’re the oldest independent office in town, and who wants to deal with a big chain company? plus, the brokers are real people who ski, hike, run, cycle, fish, hunt, and enjoy the outdoors just as much as the people moving to town. duke warner is the obvious choice for any real estate transaction!
