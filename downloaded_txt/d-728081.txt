'just one more slice to lay me to sleep, i need it to cure me from falling away from everything, i don't mind being the only one, but it would be nice to have another other.'so today i did it again, it fucking sucks that they have to judge what good are frineds now huh the only friends the understand it ilse, frankie, and andrea but all they know it parts of the whole story, andrea, is handling my anorexic side of the story. frankie is handling my emo side of the story. && ilse i handling my mental compassion side of the story. if you put all of the together make whole three- fourths of me you wanna know about the onw - furth side of the story? well sorry can't tell i don't know what's there any more.
