we believe family matters.
the love and protection of a thriving family is vital for a happy, healthy childhood and successful future.
as part of our global community, you help give loving families to children, strengthen families to prevent separation and provide life-saving services to children and families in emergencies.

	give the gift of family




























what we accomplish, together 
for more than 75 years and in 130 countries, we’ve been raising children with all the encouragement and resources they need; we support their transition into adulthood, while strengthening the families and communities around them.
an estimated 220 million children–1 out of 10 worldwide–are at risk of growing up alone. but, together with our supporters, we're working tirelessly to end violence against childen, neglect and exploitation–​breaking the cycle of abuse so that every child grows up safe, healthy and educated.
with our innovative, family-based model, we provided safe homes, loving families and essential resources to more than 600,000 children in 2023. and we won't stop until every child is raised with love, respect and opportunity. are you with us?
