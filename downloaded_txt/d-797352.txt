     mcdr is the oldest membership-based organization in maryland dedicated to promoting the use of mediation and supporting
the mediation profession.  we have a proud history of successfully advocating for allowing multiple professions to practice mediation,
halting attempts to restrict the practice some fifteen years ago.  mcdr is the first organization to establish performance based criteria
now in use as a national model, part of an ongoing dialogue on quality assurance and mediator credentials.
