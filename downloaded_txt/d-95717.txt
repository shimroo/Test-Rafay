volume 
                      2. the foreword and dedication -- the 
                      american gi -- who we are and what are we doing here? 
                          

                      volume 3. "the way we were" stories from individuals 
                      during the war years. these stories are sometimes heroic, 
                      sometimes funny, poignant, or simply memories that must 
                      not be forgotten. this volume has two sub sections: 


in harm's way,  
                        page 1 -- page 
                        2 --stories from the front like: "about d-day 
                        plus 5 on saipan, i was watching for japanese soldiers 
                        along the beach who were sneaking in to give directions 
                        for artillery fire. i was sitting in the turret of an 
                        armored amphib. about 2300 i saw the faint outline of 
                        what appeared to be a marine walking along the beach. 
                        there was no moon and the only light was from a fire burning 
                        about one hundred yards away. japanese soldiers had a 
                        habit of wearing u.s. marine helmets and carrying m1's 
                        when they could find them. in the dark they were hard 
                        to identify by a silhouette. when the guy got within 50 
                        feet, i asked the usual "who goes there?". the 
                        answer came back in perfect english, "its me, gi 
                        joe. a marine like you." so i aimed about 8 inches 
                        below the outline of his helmet and shot. the next morning 
                        there was one dead japanese officer in the sand. i never 
                        heard of a marine calling himself g i joe. i don't think 
                        i ever will.

                        home front, page 1    
                        many wonderful stories about life at home during the war. 
                        one, a lovely, privileged debutante who rolled up her 
                        sleeves and joined the war effort. another, a beautiful 
                        widow who struggled through it alone. several more, for 
                        example, a child's reaction to the blitz in london.

                            some are just ruins. one is the german pow camp in 
                            clinton ms (near jackson). "the good people in 
                            clinton and jackson, ms just couldn't give up their 
                            southern hospitality long enough to run a proper prisoner 
                            of war camp! read this wonderful story of a pow camp 
                            so good that the german prisoners come back for reunions!"

                      and sent around by people who were moved by them. gordon 
                      sinclair's "the americans" or, believe it or not, 
                      when the us mainland was bombed by the japanese. i don't 
                      mean balloon bombs or shelling by a submarine, but actually
