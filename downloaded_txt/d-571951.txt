macbook pro + hp thunderbolt g4 dock = multiple displays


leave a reply 


ha!  i‚Äôll bet you thought this blog was dead.  well, it was almost dead, but isn‚Äôt anymore (hopefully).
today i‚Äôm going to talk about how to use a hp thunderbolt g4 dock with a m4 pro macbook pro laptop to get multiple displays to work.

psa: this is why we wear helmets


leave a reply 


so sunday, september 10th started out like most years at the evanston bike club‚Äôs north shore century ride.
the weather was perfect, a bit chilly, but nothing arm & knee warmers couldn‚Äôt handle.  i had a great group of people to ride with.  it was shaping up to be a fantastic day for riding.
everything was fine until about mile 41.
a group of cyclists there were ahead of me had suddenly stopped for no apparent reason.  i tried to stop, but couldn‚Äôt.
the last thing i remember was yelling out woah!
about 15 minutes later, i was standing next to my bike.
i don‚Äôt remember anything between those two points.


police were called, ambulance was called, statements were taken, etc.  the person who i collided with had taken off, which was disappointing.
the paramedics checked me out and said it was my choice as to go to the er or not ‚Ä¶ however, in the case of a crash (especially considering the helmet damage), they recommended i go to the er.  i deferred to their expertise.
i went to the lake forest hospital er and was checked out ‚Ä¶ they did a ct scan and took x-rays.  luckily, everything was where it was supposed to be and they saw no problems.
after getting discharged, and being picked up by ginny, we went back to the starting point to pick up my bike.
it was a mess ‚Ä¶ handle bar scraped up, bar wrapping torn up, derailleur hanger bent, etc.  the next day i took the bike over to crank revolution. nothing damaged beyond repair. i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll have my trusty steed back in a few days.
as for me ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm still feeling some aches & pains from the crash, but they are fading.
i‚Äôm not going to let this crash dissuade me from riding ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll just be more careful when approaching another group of riders.
based on the condition of my helmet, i doubt i would have walked away from the crash if i hadn‚Äôt been wearing it.
moral of the story: please wear a helmet when riding a bike (pedal or motor). they work.

application performance


leave a reply 


recently i‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts on linkedin about application modernization and the performance gains that are being realized by using sql and modern programming techniques.
this reminded me of an experience i had waaayyyy back when i was a programmer for a system/36 consulting firm.

udf on macos and linux


leave a reply 


recently i wanted to have the ability to use ssh to log in to my amazon lightsail instances from my work laptop.  for privacy reasons, i didn‚Äôt want to put my ssh private key permanently on the laptop and i didn‚Äôt want to put the public key for my laptop on the lightsail instances.
since i‚Äôm very comfortable with the unix command line, i decided to put a new (password protected) private key on a flash drive so i could use that key to log in to the linux instances.
the problem is permissions.
ssh won‚Äôt let you use a private key file with open permissions. if the key file is world readable, it will display an error and refuse to use it. there isn‚Äôt a workaround that i‚Äôve been able to find (other than recompiling ssh from source with modifications).
this mean that the most common flash drive file systems (fat, fat32, & exfat) can‚Äôt be used.  none of those file system formats support permissions.
i could have formatted the flash drive using the macos hfs format, and installed the necessary packages on my ubuntu laptop to support that, but i wanted to go for something more generic.
after some research, i decided to give the user defined file system (udf) a try.
i did have to install udf support on the ubuntu system, but that wasn‚Äôt a big deal.
sudo apt-get install udftools
to format the flash drive on my mac, i used this command:
sudo newfs_udf -m blk -v <label> /dev/disk<n>
important to note, the device file (/dev/disk<n>) must be the device itself, not a partition of the device (on mac systems a partition will be denoted with ‚Äòs9‚Äô after the device name where 9 is the partition number, for example /dev/disk4s1).  
after the udf file system is created on the flash drive, you must ‚Ä¶ eject the drive, physically remove the device, and re-insert it. the device will now show up on the system as ‚Äú/volumes/<label>‚Äù.
interestingly, the owner of the mounted device is the currently logged in user.
macbook-pro:newkey david$ ls -l /volumes/flashdrive/
total 3
-rw-------@ 1 david¬† staff¬† 1073 jul 11 10:11 aws-key
i copied the new ssh private key file to the flash drive, made sure the permissions were correct, and ejected the drive.
i then inserted the drive into my ubuntu system. it mounted correctly right away.
i was then able to log in to my lightsail instances using the command
slogin -i /media/<my linux user id>/<flash drive label>/<private key file> ec2-user@<aws hostname>
interestingly, when the udf formatted flash drive is mounted, the owner is the logged in user, but had the correct permissions.
user@linux:~#: ls -l /media/user/flashdrive/
total 2
-rw-------- 1 user¬† user¬† 1073 jul 11 10:11 aws-key
so far it‚Äôs been working well.  i‚Äôm pleased with this little project.

the box


leave a reply 



this story comes by way of my brother mitch‚Ä¶
my brother specializes in database analysis for non-profits.  as such, he‚Äôs usually very involved in the organizations‚Äô data centers.
one such organization he worked for many years ago had received a grant that included the ability to do a major upgrade to their data center.  as part of the upgrade, they had to increase the cooling capacity of the hvac system in their computer room.
they selected a contractor and had the upgrade installed. they then proceeded with the upgrade their computer systems.  everything was working fine. until the next day.
they came into the computer room and found that it was over 80‚Ñâ!  
the obvious cause was that the hvac system hadn‚Äôt been sized correctly or was malfunctioning.
the organizations policies required that they had to get 3 quotes before selecting a contractor do any repair work.
so they found 3 contractors. one of the contractors quoted $20,000 to completely replace the existing hvac system. another contractor quoted around $10,000 to upgrade the existing hvac system.
the third contractor came in, looked around the room, picked up a box that was lying on the floor, placed it over the thermostat that was controlling the existing hvac system, taped it to the wall, and said ‚Äúno charge‚Äù.
apparently the new hvac system that had been installed was blowing cold air directly on the thermostat.  so, when the system detected that the room was getting warm, it would turn the a/c on. it would immediately detect that the room was cool enough, and turn off the a/c.  clearly the a/c wasn‚Äôt running long enough to cool the room at all.
the moral of this story‚Ä¶
sometimes the solution requires thinking outside the box‚Ä¶sometimes the solution requires thinking inside the box‚Ä¶sometimes the solution is the box.

cardboard analyst


leave a reply 


have you ever had a problem that has you absolutely stumped ‚Ä¶ and you ask a co-worker for assistance or post a message to an online forum (like a midrange.com mailing list) for assistance.
then, quite soon after you ask for assistance, you finally discover the answer yourself?
this is what i call the ‚Äòcardboard analyst‚Äô phenomenon (i‚Äôve also heard it referred to as ‚Äúrubber ducking‚Äù) ‚Ä¶ where the person (or people) you are asking for assistance don‚Äôt necessarily provide direct assistance, but force you to look at the problem from a different perspective.
it‚Äôs my theory (which may or may not be backed up by research) that forcing your brain to break the problem down into terms that you can describe to someone else, gives you a new perspective on the problem and new insight into what the problem actually is.
personally, i‚Äôve found that if i just try to explain what the problem is to someone (even my wife, who‚Äôs not super technical), i‚Äôm able to find the solution i want. occasionally, i‚Äôll be explaining a problem to someone in my office when my voice will trail off and i‚Äôll start thinking about another avenue of exploration. often i‚Äôll thank the person i was talking to for their assistance ‚Ä¶ to which they will respond ‚Äúglad i could be of no help‚Äù.
oddly enough, the person i am talking to has to be able to respond ‚Ä¶ often asking me questions that make me think about it. i once tried using our cat as a cardboard analyst ‚Ä¶ but it didn‚Äôt work üôÇ .
so next time you‚Äôve got a problem that‚Äôs got you particularly stumped ‚Ä¶ try explaining it it someone. you‚Äôll be surprised how much help someone can be even if they don‚Äôt have a clue what you‚Äôre talking about.categories
this is a repost of an article that appeared on the imho blog.

job search observations


1 reply 


as some of you may know, last year i started searching for a new job.  due to the pandemic, it wasn‚Äôt the best time to start such a search, but ultimately i was able to find a new position that i‚Äôm really happy with.
while most of my experiences with potential employers were positive, some were distinctly negative.  this post is going to outline some of those negative experiences (without being specific) in hopes that companies may learn from them.

speed up time machine


leave a reply 


if you‚Äôre using an apple mac computer, you may have observed that the fantastic backup system time machine, may run slowly.  this is especially noticeable when you are doing the very first backup (when it has to backup the entire system).
i was frustrated by this a while ago when i purchased a new hard drive to do my backup‚Äôs on.
after a bit of digging, i found that time machine‚Äôs performance is throttled so as not to impact system performance.
there is a way to remove performance throttling using a system control statement.
debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled
if you use the sysctl command to set this to 0 (zero) then time machine will not be throttled. if it‚Äôs set to 1 (one), it will be throttled.
i created a little script called ‚Äòspeedup-timemachine‚Äô that lets me turn the option on and off.
‚Äòspeedup-timemachine on‚Äô will remove the throttling.
‚Äòspeedup-timemachine off‚Äô will return the throttling.
 below is the script.  just copy the script, paste it into a text editor, save the script to a location on the path, and make it executable (chmod a+x scriptfile).

check for zoom update in ubuntu


leave a reply 


at work we use zoom extensively for meetings. we also use ubuntu linux on our laptops.
unfortunately, zoom doesn‚Äôt have a very good update mechanism for its client in linux.
because of this, i created a script that would check for a new version of the zoom client and, when there is, download it and notify me.
