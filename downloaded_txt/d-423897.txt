because there is strength in unity

marshall plan for tribal nations

the concept of a marshall plan-like investment for tribal nations draws on the same restorative justice, political, and economic principles that underlay the european marshall plan. through a domestic tribal nations marshall plan, the u.s. would recognize and take responsibility for the trust and treaty obligations arising out of its permanent occupation of tribal homelands and our massive cession of resources that built the foundations of today’s america.
