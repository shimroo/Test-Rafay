2011 round table of the year -- civil war trust
established on 9 may of 1991, the bull run civil war round
          table was founded to bring together those who wish to expand
          and share their knowledge of the civil war. we accomplish this
          goal in a number of ways: through lectures, research, field
          trips and in active participation in the preservation of civil
          war sites. by regularly presenting knowledgeable, respected
          civil war historians and scholars, writers and lecturers, it
          is the intent of the brcwrt to honor the memory of those who
          gave "the last full measure". 
the brcwrt is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.
