"because of the preemie family assistance fund, our family was able to pay our rent so we are not homeless. i have two other kids, so we are very happy to get this grant." - kayla , grant recipient and mom of preemie twins






✸ ✸ ✸ ✸ ✸
'“the fund has alleviated stress and tension from my family which has allowed us to focus on what really matters, spending time with and taking care of our son. when i arrive at the nicu for a visit with my son, he was crying and fussing as i walked in, but the second he heard my voice he stopped. almost like, 'oh, mom's here! i'll be okay now.'" - grant recipient, preemie mom
