cawed on





 cawed onclackamas riverbank 2025we are called on,   like the raven,to take back the sunlight   from onewho would keepour world in darkness.this frosty january   the raven caws, unseen,as we descend   on a shadowed pathwhere cedar and firdapple sunlight.and we are cawed on  to call, to cry, to convoke, to cackledeep from the backs of our throats   we are now called onto gather and make noise, much noise,like the raven, to defend and protect.like this clever corvid   we are called on to rise up, to shape-shift,   to make magic,to smartly take that which has beenunformed and re-form anew.and we will be called on   over and over, to go backinto the darkness, again and again,   without fear, like the raven —cawed on to go back and retrievethe light we have left behind.

seven-year-olds still have wings (a monologue)





this is the result of my first venture into script. the class i took was memoir to monologue[at rise: grace, a teacher,
on a school playground in the rain. she’s holding a pink envelope.]
the last thing i want to do on a rainy saturday
in june, is go back to the school. but that’s what teachers do, right? they
show up for their students, even when they’re tired, even when there are only 5
days left before summer break. it’s been a tough year. this rain, like tears of
exhaustion…and today, grief. 
i have to be honest with you, i barely knew you, what with
quarantine, and masks, and as a movement specialist, i see 500 students a week.
it takes me several months to learn everyone’s name, but i remembered your name
right away; lennox, such a unique name. still, i only saw you twice a week at
best before the pandemic. maybe that’s why it was more important than ever for
me to show up today. i feel guilty, like i neglected you, like i didn’t take
the time, when i had the time, to know you. like maybe i could have
prevented…no, i can’t go there. there was nothing i could have done.
[grace fingers the pink
envelope] 
this? the pta lady gave it to me. there’s a
painted lady butterfly inside. i just wasn't ready, earlier today, to let her go.
lennox, it’s a scottish name meaning “with many elm trees.” elm is the liberty
tree with interlocking grain used for wagon wheels, chairs, and coffins. how do
i know that? i’m a teacher, i like to learn.
[grace chuckles] 
i googled it. did you know that about your name? do you feel the liberty
of your name? i saw your liberty, your freedom, when you danced. i saw your
light, i remember your light, not just the lightness of your hair, but of your
feet when you skipped around my gym. i remember the lightness in your eyes and
on your wings when you leaped. 
[grace sighs quietly to herself] 
yeah, seven-year-olds still have wings. it’s a cool thing. wings…i
didn’t know that you loved butterflies. but now that i think about it, i saw it
when you danced, the way you would flit and float. so, it’s fitting, today,
that the pta dedicated this butterfly garden, your garden with a release of
painted lady butterflies. the flowers, the lupine, hollyhock, cosmos,
sunflowers, they’re all just little starts right now, like you, in first grade,
just starting, supple green stalks of limbs and the promise of blossoms…futures…blossoms
in patches of dry dirt that nobody paid attention to before. they’ll pay
attention next fall. the rain is a good thing today, watering those tender baby
shoots, masking our tears. i forgot my raincoat, but i have my umbrella, the
big one i take out for bus-duty when all of you are standing shivering and
unprepared. did i shelter you once with my extra-large umbrella? i don’t
remember. there were a lot of people at the dedication: your mom, of course,
and grandma, all the first grade and kindergarten teachers, oh, and girls from
your girl scout troop who painted stepping stones for the garden. there was a
lady who remembers you from the senior center that you used to visit. quite the
humanitarian, huh? 
[grace pauses as if listening]
oh, that means you are kind and thoughtful to other humans. she said you
were a wonderful storyteller and brought many smiles to their faces. i learned
a lot about you today–– not enough, though. there's still a lot i want to learn
about you, lennox, but for now, have a sublime summer.  
            [grace
releases the painted lady butterfly from the envelope]

oneing





today, the first sunday of vacation, i still cannot rest in the scared, mother-womb darkness. tomorrow is the first day of winter yet robins roost in the bare maple branches, not one or two, but 10 or more, waiting, annunciating the advent of...what? this advent i signed up for a course with matthew fox and mirabai starr about julian of norwich. the opening mediation was a hebrew one, a call to "oneing" with the creator: "listen, oh you, who struggle with the infinite, all is one." that's a progressive translation for sure. the arabic prayer, shahada, the oneness of god, "la ilaha, illallah." while the literal translation is "only one god, allah," not being a literalist, i hear this as god is one and one is god, panentheism, interrelational, nameless, formless intimacy with all. this is a call to enter the liminal mystery i so value. the unknown mystery we reside in daily now, the thin place, the white space we have been walking through as a result of the pandemic. nothing is certain and very little in our control. we are called to surrender to the unio mystica, the flow, the oneing, the ecstasy of "union with reality."this summer i hired a leadership coach who led me to design this intention for living, "how am i hyphenating the collective-self between known spaces and unknown graces into co-creative liberation and wholeness?" i am present daily with this intention purposefully phrased as a question and have found that the covid upheaval, the racial protests, the political corruption, all of it has not been a surprise, nor has any of it diverted my flow. i feel companioned as a sister anchorite with julian. radical recluse in my quarantined home, yet, one window open to people/students, to serve, and all those busy beehives, producing...and words of unity and love, liberation from god of retribution, wholeness acquired through recognition that through god we are what we are and we are all one.yesterday i made st lucia lussekatter (swedish saffron buns). they took all day to encourage the yeast, wait for two risings, knead and knead. i felt impatience in the time it took, having not made bread outside of a bread maker for years. the demand for patience, for waiting, for delayed gratification has been the primary challenge of 2020, with vacations cancelled, travel shut down, teaching plans rerouted, social gathering delayed. our morning reading this vacation is rockwell kent's "wilderness," about his christmas in alaska in 1918. we had planned to read it after our alaska trip last summer, which was delayed until 2021. these delays and rerouting have actually sweetened the anticipation and will no doubt heighten the awe when the world opens up to a new day and i step more fully into a new way of being.our outdoor christmas lights burnt out last night...the circuit blew and will not recharge...so now, we have some imposed darkness along a street of festive lights...i wait, like the robins, each day, for the wonder and awe of both the mirth and the mourning. it all matters. i write you this while listening to gary richardson's guitar meditations and hold thoughts of your being, your spirit, in my heart until we can safely meet again in person.

garden table blessing





at the garden table  it is easy to bless the tomatoes ripening on the vine bite-size, grape-like and ready to burst open in my mouth communion  it’s easy to bless the basil that wafts poetic at every picking and brush against the water can. collard greens with rainbow stems, easy potatoes, brown eyes planted as a science experiment sprouted purple-white blossoms with surprising yellow centers who knew such a lumpy bumpy mass of starch would be one and the same with these delicate stem-y appendages.

 
it is easy to bless all in this little garden corner: the maiden hair fern operatic hibiscus mondo grass and morning robins a concrete buddha accompanied by a ceramic, moss-covered rabbit wind chimes and hummingbirds even the invading blackberries challenging the ivy for ownership of the hillside  what about blessing the old patio furniture that survived 15 years and 5 moves or the terracotta mask purchased after a year of sobriety spider webs, neighbors cat droppings what about the citronella candle that chases away mosquitoes what about the mosquitoes?bless the mosquitoes and begin.

where do her words go?





“…we encounter each other in words, wordsspiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed,words to consider, reconsider…” excerpt from praise song for the day ~ elizabeth alexander where do her words go?do they merge with all the other words ~smooth verbs at the cocktail hour,bubbling, barbecue babble,or do they whisper through the equinox ~emerald-green dusky wordsdissipating into starlight? where do her words go?do they course over a spiny mountain range,nestle in juniper snags, bridgelike rainbows and trailing blackberries,or are they slammed in car doors,rushed along freeways of unknown destinations? do her words drift like puffs of black cottonwood ~summer snow that lands on the very onewho needs her words the most?or do they randomly swimlike those squiggly black linesbehind the closed eyes of the sunbather? she feels responsiblefor these words that come to heron light-rays, sound and shock waves,from nerve endings and heartbeats,weighty little words to consider,words wanting a wide embrace where do her words go?on yellow freesia vibrationsto pollinate years from here?her words, quaint and queer,are merely a stone’s throw in a river ~who knows how far the ripples go?

facilitating change…let grace come in  
“…through
every vicissitude of heat and cold, calm and storm, up-heaving volcanoes and
down-grinding glaciers, we see that everything in nature called destruction must
be creation — a change from beauty to beauty.” ~john muir
are destruction and creation all part of
the same design system? i just finished reading the only kayak by kim
heacox. he references muir’s quote above and asks, “if the land can heal and
begin anew, can we too...[and]…does that which nurtures us in turn deserve our
nurturing?” i sit silently in my kayak, my cradle of resilience, stroking the
surface of sparks lake in southern oregon, ready to receive the healing power
of water. i listen to the soft slip-slap of the wake on my boat and wonder
about reciprocity, about giving back to the water, about the ripple effect of
my palm on this place. 
i came here to release, to heal,
regenerate after four wrestling months of quarantine, questions, passionate
protests, and tragic loss. let grace come in. i came here for water’s wisdom, her
ancient knowledge ~ the survival song of lilies rustling against the side of my
boat. let grace come in. i came here to hear the fledgling herons’ boisterous,
prehistoric screech for mother’s piscine supper of regurgitated carp. let grace
come in. the haunting coos of the mourning dove, the chipper chicka-dee-dee-dees, and the red-winged blackbirds’ conk-la-ree-ree-rees
all harmonize with the heron and the lilies to create riffles of new song. let grace come in.
my summer vacation officially started on
june 20th. i had hoped to kayak that first day of vacation, to catch
up on my poetry writing, to hike, and explore more of the pacific northwest. instead,
i worked. we arts educators are all worried about our jobs next fall. so last
week we scrambled to create (and push through to the powers that be) documents
that reflected proactive plans for facile and creative transformation of
teaching spaces and methods. simultaneously, i engaged in a new leadership role
with tlan, began leadership coaching with sea
change design, and started this facilitation class. i continued to feel energized
from the last trimester; i had remained strong, positive, and centered all
through the transition to on-line learning — leading the way for arts
integration, and facilitating discussions about re-structuring for next fall.
but then, the saturday before the last week of school, my asst. principal
called. one of our 1st graders had been murdered by her father, who
then took his own life. where is grace?
that news broke me ~ i trembled and sobbed
with shock, grief, and anger, but then went right back to work. in my tla
facilitator role, i provided poetry and resources to my colleagues in addition
to designing a virtual field day for students’ last week of school. two weeks
later, i tried to write my own grief poem amidst the cacophony that is my most
inhospitable workspace (and my brain). i could not do it, all my reserves were
spent, and i cried again from exhaustion, so much loss, and grief. let grace
come in.
 
“nothing is lost, only forgotten…the land
remembers us in an enduring embrace.” [1] during
this quarantine, i had forgotten nature’s power to heal and restore me. i had
forgotten the importance of going outside, the value of my bare feet in the
grass, the sun and rain on my skin, the lilacs and lavender, and thrum of
hummingbirds dive-bombing the scarlet columbine. let grace come in. joy
commented in the podcast that birds are singing more now. the robins wake me at
4:30 and i don’t really mind. let grace come in. ironically, in the last months
while humans stayed indoors, the out-of-doors started to heal: flora and fauna
thriving instead of just surviving, pollution began to clear around the world,
an unintended, unimagined consequence of our quarantine. let grace come in. by
doing less, we gave more to nature. let grace come in. i really could not fully
grasp the irony of that, but i knew that i had forgotten about the healing
power of nature for me. i knew i needed the enduring embrace of land and water.
i closed my work computer and headed for sparks lake. let grace come in. … 



awake now
from a gloomy hibernation, 
i notice columbine in bloom 
and last year’s barren apple tree 
bearing spurs. anna’s hummingbird 
flits merely feet away from me ~
her name is joy.
 
she was, all winter, an always
presence of possibility,
but my eyes were closed, my mind shut 
to her iridescent green crown, 
ruby-throated chirping contrast
to my gray song.
 
 
today, following a season
of black, i wear scarlet again, 
the red that attracts her to me,
beating vehemently between 
honeysuckle and apple trees.
the hummingbird 
 
in crimson pursuit, reminds me 
of my power to fly backward
or forward, or to just flutter
my wings in place, pollinating
and consuming all the honey 
nectar of now.

for geraldine pearson





“…there’s a poem in this place—in the heavy grace…” * of the “do not resuscitate” notice tacked to the mudroom door at blackberry hill farm — a heavy grace in the stained country curtains on the kitchen window, open for flies to buzz in from the barn and land on the breakfast, uneaten. there is a poem in this place where flies can dine freely on home-made pies before dying on sticky strips hanging above the kitchen table. there is a poem in this place where a lamb nestles at your feet under that same kitchen table, while another lamb is served for easter dinner. there is a poem of heavy grace in this place.  death is daily and unsentimental on blackberry hill. foxes in the hen house, cows stuck in the mud, bummer lambs abandoned by ewes, and ponies neglected by their driver who chose to die at home. a heavy grace in vulnerable surrender — a pastoral release to swollen, weakening limbs, to broken branches, dried leaves, and lips unkissed, and scars softening where breasts had been. a release to humming out of key, love songs from apple orchards in the 30s.  there’s a poem in this place and a heavy grace in finger tips limply reaching out from the hospice bed, eyes averted, the oregon horse woman whispers, “luv you guys” for the first and last time. a heavy grace, an end to that grooming criticism of who one should be. in death, there is poetry and there is ice melting in the last crystal glass of hendrick’s gin. tonic soothes and our chapter ends, giving way to the cliché, trite, simple, surrender — the poetry of loving one just for who one is, or is that “whom”? loving for the first and last time. no goodbye, just a wisp of a hand hold, dry skin on skin, fingerprint to fingerprint an acknowledgement of this heavy grace.  *excerpted from amanda gorman, in this place (an american lyric)

lupine







beleven lupine

 

belief, be-lieve, be leaves. i believe 

you can eat the greens of oregon sorrel

like a shamrock salad, and you won’t die.

i believe in bleeding heart blossoms, 

the power of salmonberries to make me smile 

and ah the awe of a single raindrop 

in a wide lupine cup. but i don’t believe 

that skunk cabbage really stinks 

(even though i know it does).

 

i believe in rolling
rivers and peacock blue twilight.

i believe hoot owls are wiser than we.

i believe in the mystery of the silent moth

forever circling, circling, circling a flickering flame.

i believe in deathly attraction ~

loving hard, to the bone, then letting go.



i believe in the majesty of towering cedar

and that the knots in wooden fences

eventually all fall out, leaving peep holes 

for the curious and the brave.

but i don’t believe in fences or pearly gates.



i do believe that death is just a simple part of life,

but i’m not so sure that jesus died just for us

i believe in the blessed resurrection of trillium

every march, every year, after the woodland violets

and just before solomon’s seal and i believe

in emerald lupine with regal purple stalks

and pods filled with seedy promise.















beleven is a dutch word meaning to experience, live, go
through, or openly profess/practice a faith or conviction.
