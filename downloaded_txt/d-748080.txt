our servicessplit second timing has the most up-to-date inventory of race management equipment of any race management company in south florida.
the staff of split second timing are all paid employees who have been doing their jobs for years, and are experienced in their positions. no one has to be trained on race day except the volunteers in the “as needed” areas.
split second timing arrives at the race site hours before the first volunteer will be there for the days activities. when the first participant arrives, they are greeted with a set up finishline and fully set up registration area. all volunteers are in place and are trained in their assignments by sst employees!
