sacha baron cohen's the dictator



paramount pictures announced today that sacha baron cohen’s new comedy the dictator will be released worldwide on may 11, 2012. the studio also announced that larry charles (borat, bruno) has come aboard to direct.as the press releases states: "the film tells the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed. it is inspired by the best selling novel zabibah and the king by saddam hussein."uh-oh. sounds like this film is going to be offensively funny. but, then again, we've come to expect that from mr. cohen.

the help



i just finished reading the help, and i absolutely devoured it... what an amazing book! so i'm psyched that the help is coming to the silver screen! i can only hope the film is as incredible as the novel.set in mississippi during the 1960s, the help stars emma stone (star of the breakout hit, zombieland) as skeeter, a southern society girl who returns from college determined to become a writer, but turns her friends’ lives—and a small mississippi town—upside down when she decides to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent southern families. academy award nominee viola davis (eat pray love) stars as aibileen, skeeter’s best friend’s housekeeper, who is the first to open up—to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. despite skeeter’s life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories—and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly—and unwillingly—caught up in the changing times.based on one of the most talked about books in years and a #1 new york times best-selling novel, the help is a provocative and inspiring look at what happens when a southern town’s unspoken code of rules and behavior is shattered by three courageous women who strike up an unlikely friendship.the help is currently in production and is slated for release in 2011.*getty images

poster for tangled



walt disney pictures presents tangled, one of the most hilarious, hair-raising tales ever told.  when the kingdom’s most wanted—and most charming—bandit flynn rider (voice of zachary levi) hides out in a mysterious tower, he’s taken hostage by rapunzel (voice of mandy moore), a beautiful and feisty tower-bound teen with 70 feet of magical, golden hair.  flynn’s curious captor, who’s looking for her ticket out of the tower where she’s been locked away for years, strikes a deal with the handsome thief and the unlikely duo sets off on an action-packed escapade, complete with a super-cop horse, an over-protective chameleon and a gruff gang of pub thugs. in theaters this holiday season in  3d, tangled is a story of adventure, heart, humor and hair—lots of hair.tangled comes to theaters on nov. 24, 2010.
