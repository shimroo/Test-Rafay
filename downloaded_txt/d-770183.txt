judy and i attended the "conceal carry" class and were amazed at the information provided by doug and perry.
after a day at ammo alley, we are now ready and qualified to take the next step to obtain our "conceal carry"
thanks doug and perry for way you presented the information in a professional and fun way

tom bear






ammo alley is, by far, the best indoor shooting range within 50 miles of columbia. doug is always friendly and helpful, the lanes are well maintained and clean...it is worth driving from columbia whenever i want to shoot rather than using the local options.

greg grimes






recently visited this fine establishment with my son and some friends. have to say it's a great indoor range and the people are friendly. can't wait to go back and put some more rounds down range

john williams






i just recently took my ccw class there and everything i had questions about up to this point, perry and doug answered. there is a lot of useful information that comes out of this course. some of which i knew, others i didn't. no one likes being cooped up in a classroom for 8 hours, but neither of them made it seem like it was that long. if you are wanting to learn more about gun laws, up and coming laws or gun safety, give them a shout.

stephen lepper






i completed the ccw course with doug and perry 2/13/2016. they are fantastic instructors with plenty of experience and knowledge, easy to understand language/nomenclature, skillful demonstrations, and comedic timing to make the class enjoyable and engaging. i will be recommending this class to my family and friends!

timothy davis






doug is a great teacher in the use and safety of all guns. if you need someone to show you the rules, laws, and use of a gun, contact ammo alley sporting center. they also have a great and safe indoor shooting range.

barb & rick lepage






i have been raised around guns my whole life. i took my ccw class there today and learned so much more. doug and perry was great on keeping the class interesting and fun. they are both great instructors. i highly recommend anyone wanting to get their right to carry to take it at ammo alley.

waylon shewmaker






perry & doug are awesome teachers, they teach about gun safety in a way even i could understand, i thoroughly enjoyed the class and learned a lot, thank you doug & perry for taking your time with me and teaching me so much.
