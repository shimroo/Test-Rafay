	 welcome cameron andré sauvé
	 
    


well, just over two years ago we welcomed kayla into this world. this week we’re welcoming our new baby boy: cameron!  cameron came into this world on june 2nd at 8:27am, healthy, awake, and much bigger than we expected… over 9lbs 8oz, and 22”! we thought kayla was pretty big at 7lbs 15oz, but looks like we’ve got a big boy on our hands. he’s tough too, already pulling his head up and looking all over the place. here are a few shots from the delivery room: later in the day kayla and grandma frey came to visit. kayla gave cameron a green fuzzy blanket, and cameron bought kayla two puzzles, and a new drinking cup!  and it wasn’t too long before we were able to come home. kayla and grandma even made a sign welcoming cameron   and since we’ve been home i’ve been snapping a bunch of pics of cameron whenever possible.  and for one last set of pictures i wanted to put up a comparison of kayla and cameron on their first day to see if anyone notices a resemblance… here’s kayla on her birthday:  here’s cameron on his birthday.  anyhow, cameron and kayla have both been getting along very well since cameron came home. grandma frey is here to help out until next tuesday, and we’re just very happy we have two beautiful and healthy kids. we are so lucky.

	 christmas 2011 in ontario
	 
    


well, i know this post is a bit overdue, but so is our new baby, and i’m thinking if i post this it might make him come a bit sooner  cheryl posted a great summary of our christmas in seattle, but kayla got 3 christmas’s this year, the other two were kitchener, and sault ste. marie. anyhow, it all begins with a flight… by now since kayla has flown all over the place she’s pretty used to the airport. hawaii, florida, and a bunch of ontario flights… she’s travelled more distance than i had well into university. here she is excited to reach the toronto airport:    we were to stop in kitchener first and visit with amy and rj, lindsay and ryan. we had a great time. kayla of course loved opening presents again   racing games? yeah, kayla can play ‘em:  cheryl and i managed to sneak out while kayla was hanging out back at the house. we played some indoor mini-putt. i’m not sure who won, but it probably wasn’t either cheryl or i    one of the great things about southern ontario is being able to visit other folks we know. in this case we were able to go and visit with amanda (and marcus), and cheryl went over to visit becky and haley as well. as you can see sledding was the activity-du-jour. (that means activity of the jour for those who don’t speak the language.)     after not too much time it was again time to get on a plane…  this time to sault ste. marie where grandma and grandpa sauvé are now living in a new house on saint joe’s island… kayla was pretty impressed, but then again, she seems excited as long as we’re going somewhere new  this was my first time visiting the new house, and my parents had very recently moved in. right on the lake this is a great location to hang out, it even has a sledding hill! kayla was right at home… grandma and grandpa had bought some nice toys to make sure their granddaughters (and potential future grandsons) would have a great time while visiting, and i think kayla had a good time with all the new toys…  the dinner setup… nice:   bah humbug! in seattle, kayla has limited ability to just step out into the snow. in northern ontario, there is unlimited ability to do so in the winter     and then there was gift giving… kayla loves gift giving… here is kayla, kayla hugging grandma, kayla playing with uncle mike, and uncle steve reading to kayla..  what christmas visit would be complete without the traditional spaghetti dinner at auntie nina’s house? this is where we’re able to catch up with our cousins vince and bryan, auntie nina and uncle bill… .  kayla looked pretty ready to head home though by the end of our visit   back at the cottage auntie mary, and katherine had come to visit: kayla playing with more toys courtesy of grandma and grandpa sauvé: and kayla gets her first haircut from grandma sauvé:   now, we had time to play outside too, kayla particularly liked sledding on the gt’s where she was also pumped up about getting pulled to the top of the hill..     and this snowman (which lived well into the spring) got a lot of attention from kayla. it’s not as big as the one we made in seattle, but it definitely broke my back less   at the end of the trip kayla had a great time playing in the toy helicopter in the sault ste marie airport… no coins required for her to have fun!
