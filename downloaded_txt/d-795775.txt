unknown encephalitis lived experience - steven's story of his mum
my journey took an unexpected turn when encephalitis struck my family, taking away my beloved mum. it was a devastating blow that changed my life in ways i never could have imagined. at the same time, i was learning my craft as a teacher, trying to support my students and navigate the complexities of the classroom, all while the world was in the grip of the covid-19 pandemic.

seronegative autoimmune encephalitis lived experience â matt's story
those two weeks were a blur i know only through stories from my family and doctors. i was tested for serious illnesses like eee, west nile, and zika, all of which came back negative. then things got even more frighteningâi began losing vision and experiencing double vision, though i donât remember this myself. my body was scanned for cancer, but thankfully, that came back clear too.
