customer testimonials







i‚Äôve recently opened my own grooming salon, and as i began comparing products on the market, plush puppy stood out head and shoulders above the rest. the science and care behind the products¬† are not just marketing points‚Äîthey are 100% accurate and backed by real, tangible results. the way your products work with a dog‚Äôs coat, enhancing its health, shine, and overall condition, is unmatched. seeing this first hand in my grooming work has been nothing short of eye-opening.
from this point forward, i will only be using plush puppy products in my salon. the results speak for themselves, and i‚Äôm thrilled to be offering my clients nothing but the best. i‚Äôll also be recommending plush puppy to my fellow dog groomers‚Äîif they haven‚Äôt made the move yet, they really are missing out.
thank you for continuing to set the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù in dog grooming products. i‚Äôm excited to incorporate plush puppy into my business and to share its incredible benefits with the wider grooming community.

i‚Äôm one of your wholesale customers and just wanted to say a huge awesome thankyou. i bought the natural conditioning shampoo as i was looking for something for long flowing coats. i do 4 breeders borzois, and heaps of other long coated dogs as i love doing them, so i was looking for more products to help as i dry these guys to reduce knots. the omg spray was a game changer but this shampoo made such a difference to these borzois who have gorgeous healthy coats. the boys are both studs and her pet dogs as well.
many thanks 
what the floof dog grooming.








victoria swalling




omg!!! the ultimate wooden pin brush is everything it promises and some! this brush is my new best friend ‚ù§Ô∏è i love it!!!
it glides through wet coat, removes tangles without breaking the coat, adds lustre to the coat as it massages the skin and releases the natural oils and after bathing and drying 2 x 5month old maltese, no hair left in the brush!
i will be ordering another!
thank you plush puppy ‚ù§Ô∏è

i used the ultimate extra long pin brush on my long coat german shepherd and it is the best! finally i have found the right brush and i wanted to let all long haired shepherd owners how good this brush is, and that my boy actually enjoys the brushing process now!¬† it just glides through his coat effortlessly. we also use the blue porcupine brush for finishing.

the plush puppy herbal whitening shampoo is brilliant on my bernese mountain dogs. their whites are blinding & their black is shining & glossy. cannot recommend it highly enough! omg spray is probably the best product on the market for daily use in keeping my boys immaculate for the public.
