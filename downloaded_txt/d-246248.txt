many of you know me from my decades of writing about cars. to date i’ve authored eight best-selling and critically acclaimed award-winning books, and my writing is regularly featured in publications such as the new york times, business week, usa today, and others. i am a contributing editor to road & track magazine, as well as having long served as editor-at-large for sports car market and american car collector magazines. for 18 years i wrote, created seminars and content, and was a valuation expert at hagerty. i also spent a number of years sourcing, driving, and presenting cars on screen for the “muscle car flashback” segments on the tv show “musclecar” for spike tv, back when i had a lot more hair i might add.
in 2012 autoweek named me as an automotive industry “mover and shaker” for my contributions to the collector car world. oh, and my “shelby cobra fifty years” was named “the greatest car book of all time” by esquire magazine. both very unexpected and humbling accolades.
so why this “car dealership” you are visiting now? that’s a great question!
well, i am a car collector (hoarder, according to some) but i also sell a very small number of extremely special cars. many of these come from my personal collection (most of which can be seen at the comer collection website) when i decide to change up the roster a bit.
all of this stems from what could be considered a somewhat unique background. i was a jesuit educated kid with an automotive engineering degree who was studying architecture. but despite those great and lofty intentions, i decided early on that i’d rather be turning wrenches or doing bodywork. that led to a variety of jobs in the car world, most with a lot of lacquer thinner usually involved to clean my hands at the end of the day. in 1991 i founded the simply named “colin comer automotive services” from my two-car garage and began restoring cars as a side hustle from my day job at car dealerships. by 1993 i made the plunge and made this my full-time gig by renting a $900/month 1,500 sq. ft. shop and changed the business name to colin’s classic auto. eventually i added in a dealer’s license (long story) and specialized in selling late-model high performance and specialty cars, while still restoring everything from pre-war cars to 1960s ferraris for customers, and muscle cars for myself. over the years the restoration side of the business expanded greatly, culminating in a 22,000 sq.ft. of shop space with nearly everything done in-house right here at cca. i officially retired from restoring cars for customers in 2019, but still enjoy the therapeutic nature of doing a few for myself every now and again. but needless to say all of this has been quite a ride! cars are the great equalizer and i’ve met so many amazing people from truck drivers to movie stars to rock legends to presidents of car companies and, well, even royalty. all because of our shared love of cars.
colin comer is “the appraiser”
if you like knowing what certain cars are worth, and why, you should check out “the appraiser“. each episode features real owners, real cars and no bs appraisals from yours truly. it’s an antiques roadshow for us car people.

shopping advice
chances are, because of the small number of cars i sell you won’t end up buying a car from me. but no matter where you buy my advice is to educate yourself on the make and model you seek. research any example you find. align yourself with a trusted expert in those cars. auction descriptions and advertisements can often be deceptive, fantasy or contain serious sins of omission. as my good friend bruce meyer says “buy the best and only cry once!”
the goods
browse my current listings on my inventory page. i’m likely the lowest volume collector car “dealer” on the planet, so there usually isn’t much there. but if you like quality over quantity i promise you’ll appreciate the level of cars i do offer!  if you don’t see what you want listed please email me, as i know of and can find great cars that are available privately for the benefit of all involved.
consulting
i can help with authentication, inspection, consulting and auction or private party acquisition services. or, if you have a great car or collection that you’ve decided to sell i can help with that, too.
have something to sell?
i’m always a top-dollar cash buyer for exceptional, rare cars of any stripe. if you have something that is the best of the best please email me some photos, a short description and a price and let’s talk! click here to email colin
the last word(s)
to start any of these conversations just shoot me an email: click here to email colin again, since i’m a one-man enterprise, email is far better than calling as i’m almost always in the shop, on the road, or locked in a room writing far away from the shop phone.
