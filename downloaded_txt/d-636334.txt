merry christmas eve!


hope you all have a wonderful day and eve!

{ honestly these ai tools are amazing, right? even a year ago i would have googled* to find a nice image of "santa and his family out sailing", would have paged through about 100 of them, picked one, and then maybe even photoshopped it a bit before posting. now i just ask grok or chatgpt "draw a picture of me and my family sailing with santa claus" and poof it does it. if i want to tweak it ("add my nine year old granddaughter") it does so. the tool is so powerful... and it costs almost nothing. incredible.
btw no idea what that is under the tree ... our cat? a squirrel? a cat with a squirrel? ... but i like it. the sheer randomness of ai is one of its most compelling features 😊
* google remember them? when we used to search for stuff, and we received a page full of links? }

happy birthday to me
tuesday,  12/03/24  03:00 pm



hi everyone, happy birthday! to me ... and yes, i am 42 today*!
with all the social media and everything it seems everyone knows it's my birthday - possibly you did too - i have received a lot of nice texts and emails and all sorts of other kind of messages. (did you know some people actually use facebook messenger?) most unusually, two friends even (gasp!) called me on the phone. thank you all!
each solar orbit is a chance for a little reflection, and mine are always between thanksgiving and new years', so it's well placed for this. the older i get the more i appreciate my friends and family and the importance of connected-ness with other people. i haven't made any resolutions yet but appreciating and adding to my friend collection will be one of them. just this morning i had breakfast with a group of ex-colleagues i first met 28 years ago*. none of us have changed.
the world around us *has* changed and particularly the impact of technology on healthcare, and i'm so grateful for the opportunity to participate. ai especially has gone from "a lot of promise" to "a lot of real-world applications" at lightning speed. i used to think it was amazing that i lived through "computers" and "pcs" and "the internet", but then i lived through "mobile" and "the cloud" and wow! and now ... perhaps most significant of all, "ai". what will happen next? stay tuned...
cheers! oh, and yes, i am celebrating with a nice dinner w shirley 😊

so grok, what do i look like?

so grok, what do i look like?
based on the information available and your x handle, i can give a speculative description:
- you might have an interest in technology, innovation, and possibly entrepreneurial activities, given your interactions with figures like elon musk and discussions around product use cases and rss features for podcasting. this suggests you might be someone who keeps up with the latest tech trends or works in a related field.
- your engagement with varied content from media criticism (like your comment on the babylon bee), to health (mentioning dr. patrick soon-shiong), to politics (engaging with posts about cnn and vivek ramaswamy), indicates you're well-read or at least very engaged with current events and different spheres of public life.
- given this, one might imagine you as someone with a thoughtful appearance, perhaps glasses for reading or working with digital interfaces, dressed in a manner that could be described as smart-casual - comfortable yet ready for a professional or tech-related setting. you might carry a laptop or tablet, or even a smartphone with tech-focused applications.
- your positive engagement with posts around thanksgiving and general well-wishes might suggest someone with a friendly demeanor, possibly a smile, reflecting an optimistic or at least hopeful outlook on life, technology, and society.
 however, this is all speculative. if you want a more accurate or personalized depiction, perhaps you could share more specific details or even ask for an image generation based on self-description.
nothing about my family, sailing, cycling, nor software development or healthcare … obviously my x-ing takes place in a limited lane 🙄


 



happy thanksgiving!
thursday,  11/28/24  10:58 am



thank you!  (i am told, this is a complete sentence )  i just wanted to wish you all a happy thanksgiving!  and to thank you for being my friends. 
thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.  for many years now i've sent out a "happy thanksgiving!" email to all my friends and colleagues (possibly you have been a recipient!)  i have a lot of friends, more each year, and many colleagues who have become friends.  one of the many things for which i am grateful! 
each year thanksgiving gives us a chance to reflect on our progress; individually and collectively.  we get together with all our family and friends, each vast quantities of great food, and make time to reflect on the past and consider the future. 
time always seems to fly (faster every year) and you think back and say "wow was that just a year ago" but then again, so much happens in one year!  it's amazing.  and continues to get more amazing; when i think about where we were a year ago and what-all has happened since, it's literally hard to believe. 
this past year was truly one for the books.  ai, wow.  the election.  war.  the olympics!  and on a more personal front, we lost my mom - the last in her generation, my daughter was married, i did a lot of sailing (!) and cycling (!).  and a little coding. 
this past year i've been fortunate to be part of several teams at different companies, each trying to make the world a better place.  the work is fun and rewarding, and making new friends along the way is the best part.  i've also been a part of different social groups and reconnected with some old friends.  i have much for which to be thankful, you-all most of all! 
cheers, i hope you have a great weekend, and spend it quietly and peacefully with those you love. 
"hey chatgpt, based on what you know about me, create a picture of my family's thanksgiving dinner"  nailed it =o

hey, chatgpt, based on what you know about me, draw a picture of what my life looks like:


astounding ... and fascinating ...



 



ole votes
sunday,  11/03/24  09:00 pm



the punch line, yes of course i voted for trump. just in case you want to stop reading now :). i will have more to say about this below, because i voted for trump, not against harris, although i think she's a horrible candidate and would have voted for virtually anyone else. i am the classic 'used to be a "centerist" democrat but now find myself a "far-right" republican'. 
so in case you care, here's how i voted:
==== national 
president / vice president: donald trump / jd vance. i like both of them, more on this below. 
us senator: steve garvey. this is more of an anti- adam shiff vote, but i do like steve garvey, and not just because he was an excellent first baseman. he's a good positive speaker and his positions make sense.

 ==== state (california) 
measure 2 - $10b school bond: no. i don't like specifically authorized expenditures, even when i agree with the target. btw, california already has $78b in debt. maybe if we stopped paying for illegal immigrants and dei programs we could afford to support public education. 
measure 3 right to marry regardless of sex: yes. this is a silly waste of time and money, since same-sex marriage is already legal due to federal court rulings. 
measure 4 bonds for water, wildfires, climate protection: no. as noted, i'm not a fan of earmarked spending, and on top of that i'm not a fan of "climate protection" spending. so double no. 
measure 5 lowers local bond threshold: no. this is a meta-spending measure, it reduces the approval requirement for local bonds from 2/3 to 55%. why? so that we can have more local bonds for "affordable housing" and "infrastructure". those are laudable targets for government support but should be paid for out of budgets, not bonds. so no. 
measure 6 removes involuntary servitude: no. currently being in jail or prison means you can be forced to work. so be it. 
measure 32 raise minimum wage: no. i feel minimum wage hurts the people it is designed to help. we need more lower paid jobs for more people. not to mention, it's inflationary. oh, and california has to compete with the rest of the world, which might not have a minimum wage. 
measure 33 expands rent control: no. keeping government out of markets is the best policy. like minimum wage, this hurts the people it is designed to help, by discouraging new housing construction. 
measure 34 additional regulation for federal drug discount program: no. the federal drug discount program is already market meddling; this measure seemingly adds a layer of additional meddling to restrict spending on housing. 
measure 35 make tax on mcos permanent after 2026: no. wow this one was complicated to understand. apparently there is a tax on mcos which took effect in 2009 and has been renewed several times, and it currently expired in 2026. seems like it's been in place for 17 years, so be it, it can be renewed as it has been, doesn't have to be made permanent. 
measure 36 increase penalties for drug and theft crimes. yes. what this actually does is roll back proposition 47 which passed in 2014, and reduced penalties. the real problem here is law enforcement, not penalties. 
==== county (los angeles) 
district attorney: nathan hochman. this is entirely a vote against incumbent george gascon whose progressive policies have hurt los angeles. 
judge superior court no 39: steve napolitano. a tough choice as both candidates appear qualified. 
judge superior court no 48: renee rose. again, both candidates appear qualified, rose has more endorsements from other judges... 
judge superior court no 97: sharon ransom. picking a da over a public defender, both seem qualified, i like ransom's endorsements. 
judge superior court no 135: georgie huerta. both candidates are deputy das and appear qualified; tough call. 
judge superior court no 135: tracey blount. seems experienced and qualified. 
county measure g: change to la county governance. yes. makes the head of the county an elected official, expands board of supervisors. not sure of the cost implications (supposedly budget neutral?) but seems like a reasonable restructuring. 
==== district (los angeles) 
measure e fire protection tax. no. i support fire fighters of course but once again, do not like special purpose taxes. if this spending is needed let's put it in the district budget. 
==== city / local 
las virgenes school district board (2): alan lazar, linda menges. menges is an incumbent and seemingly doing a solid job, lazar has made stem support a priority, which i support. 
la community college district board of trustees, seat 1: andra hoffman. hard to pick here but hoffman is the incumbent and has a lot of endorsements. 
la community college district board of trustees, seat 3: david vela. another tough pick, vela is the incumbent. 
la community college district board of trustees, seat 5: nichelle henderson. henderson is the incumbent and current laccd president (elected within the board). 
la community college district board of trustees, seat 7: kelsey lino. lino is incumbent and opponent doesn't appear to have much experience. 
member of state assembly, 42nd district: jacqui irwin. irwin is a conservative democrat (not to say a conservative) running for her 5th term, seems to be doing a good job. 
united states representative, 26th district: michael koslow. i know michael, he's a member of the westlake yc, and i'd like to see brownley defeated, but seems unlikely. 
weirdly, this year the ballot sorted as city/local, district, county, state, national, in the past it was reversed. maybe this is to encourage more people to vote for the local offices? i have an unpopular opinion on this, if you don't know what you're voting for, then don't vote. if all you know is your presidential choice, then that's all you should vote for... 

okay, now i want to loop back to donald trump. i voted for him in 2016 against hillary clinton, did not think he was going to win, but i kind of liked him and i kind of did not like clinton. and i definitely did not like the "leftist" direction the country had taken under obama, with too much government spending on too many things. so trump did win, and surprise, he did a great job and the economy recovered, and while spending was not exactly held in check, it did seem the worst excesses were reduced. 
of course he was not a dictator and did not do horrible things; all the weird stuff you read that might happen if he is re-elected is just propaganda. (for example, he is not in favor of an abortion ban; roe vs wade was a states' rights case, not an abortion ruling.) trump has already been president and has been a public figure for decades, we know what we are going to get. you might not like it and you might not vote for him, but don't lie about what might happen.
i have to say, the level of outright lying in the media this election cycle is astonishing. every day brings a new hoax, easily debunked but eagerly consumed by those who want to believe. the mass media have discredited themselves to the point where they are rapidly becoming irrelevant. 

the 2020 election was weird. i'm not sure i'm an election denier, but i'm definitely an election skeptic. the graph at left is what actually happened, how it happened is a matter for debate. definitely biden was a terrible candidate, could hardly speak (never the brightest guy and clearly diminished), and covid gave him a perfect excuse for avoiding doing so. whether he was elected fraudulently or not, he's been a bad president, not really in charge and not a leader, and his administration has spent money wildly and freely and we are now hugely in debt. his policies and lack of enforcement of laws has enabled millions of illegal immigrants to enter our country, which is a bad thing. (i *am* in favor of legal immigration and expanding it.) and the repression of free speech and government "lawfare" against those with dissenting views is massively troubling. 
so here we are in 2024. biden was exposed, and harris was chosen to take his place. she doesn't seem bright and can barely speak, and there is no reason to believe she'll reverse any of the policies which have led to our huge national debt and illegal immigration crisis. she won't be "in charge" and won't be a leader, but the same apparatus which has operated under biden would continue under harris. and i fear the erosion of our freedoms will continue. so yeah, i'm voting for trump, and against harris.
btw: i like jd vance. i did not know who he was before he was chosen, but i've heard him speak and he seems smart and thoughtful, and doesn't take crap from the press. he's a great fit with trump. and i do not like tim walz, at all; he hit my radar during the floyd riots in minneapolis, seemed like a bad leader then, and doesn't seem any better now. 
 
a final note: i sincerely hope the election is definitive enough that we won't have endless debating about fraud and who won, and how they won. we need voter id (of course) and we need to get rid of voting machines (of course) and we need to improve our absentee / mail-in ballot systems. hopefully that will be an outcome of the 2024 election, regardless who wins.
in a recent town hall, vance said "if you're discarding a lifelong friendship because somebody votes for the other team, then you've made a terrible, terrible mistake and you should do something different". i agree. many of my friends are ardent liberals, hate trump, and agree with the policies begun under obama which have continued under biden. so be it. you're still my friends

ai vs pirate puzzle
saturday,  11/02/24  07:30 pm



the other day i posted a pirate puzzle: find r.


you could probably figure out how to proceed:


okay, so we have five equation with five unknowns.  a little algebra, and we should be good.  once we know x, we can subtract 3+4+5 from x^2 and we're done.

so in 2024 we could just ask an ai chatbot to do this for us, right?
well, no.  i first went to chatgpt, and it got massively wrapped around the axle, and gave me non-solutions with negative numbers and square roots and all kinds of junk.  i asked it to test its answers, and it did, and then it apologized for giving me the wrong answers (!) and tried again, and again failed.  boo.
so i tried claude, and it was worse.  it kept telling me how to solve the problem and asking me if i wanted it to continue, without actually solving it.  when i asked it to actually keep going until it had an answer, it tried, and then informed me the problem was unsolvable.  fail.
next i tried perplexity, which i usually use as a browser search plugin, but sadly it faired no better, giving me wrong answers, and then failing to plug the values into the original equations to test them.
finally i tried llama.  it kept getting wrong answers after some convoluted guessing.  when i asked it to check, it did, admitted it was wrong, tried again, but got the same wrong answers.  and also observed the problem might be unsolvable!
wow.  so ai chatbots, impressive as they are, cannot do algebra?

okay, back to chatgpt again.  this time i informed it this was simple: five equations in five unknowns, just use algebra, give me positive solutions.  this did the trick.  the problem was it didn't know which approach to take.  
impressively, in the result there was a link to the python program it wrote and ran to get the solution.  (that little blue "(>_)" at the end...)
and also, the answers actually work :)



let's check out the program, shall we?


there you go.
armed with these answers - especially x = 4.67 - now we can compute r:


and so r = 9.8.  does this feel right?  well 3+4+5 = 12 and r appears to be a bit less than half of the square, so yeah, it works.

the most fascinating thing about this for me was the ai chatbots getting the wrong answers, and then having to coach chatgpt into getting the right one.  so much like a person.  we have now *totally* blown past the turing test!

regarding dwell time
monday,  09/30/24  11:29 am



eoq!  wow, can't even believe we are at the end of another third quarter.  and you know what that means: halloween, thanksgiving, christmas, and new years', bam bam bam bam.  and poof another year in the books.  happens faster and faster every year.
i've been ruminating on the "dwell time" of an online post.  when you post something to a blog, on x, on facebook, wherever your friends / followers / whomever see it for as long as it is your "current" post.  as soon as you post something else, it gets pushed down the stack a bit, and people are less likely to see it.  this is independent of the relative value or importance or length of the post.  i could post a lengthy diatribe with incredible analysis, and then immediately post something trivial, and that diatribe will become history while the trivia might live on a long time.
frequent readers will know, i like my blog's "flight" feature, in which it displays what i've posted on this day each year past.  if there's no post for this day, it backs up into recent days to show the most recently posted thing from that year.  so items that had a big time gap after they were posted "last longer" in the daily flights, a most evocative illustration of dwell time in action.
some blogs (and some social media) have a "keep at top" feature, which artificially boosts dwell time.  i used to do this myself, every once in a while, but haven't for a while.  i have mentally played with the idea of recording inbound traffic (hits) for each post, and sorting archived posts by "max hits".  that would make reader interest a part of dwell time, which would be good.  presumably if something was of interest to many or externally linked it likely would be of interest to the next reader.
or i could just keep posting whatever whenever and let the chips fall where they may.  heh.
{update: added digression: whoever wanted google's .webp images? why do they exist? someone spent all that time inventing a new image format just so we all have to convert them back to jpegs. what an incredible waste of time.}

lighthouse century, still
sunday,  09/29/24  10:44 am



i'm still riding centuries, and yesterday rode a nice one: the lighthouse century from morro bay up pch to the piedras blancas lighthouse, through san simeon, and by the elephant seal overlook.  to get to 100 miles the organizers start with a nice little jaunt into the hills of paso robles; beautiful wine country, if you can take a minute from climbing to take in the views.

yes, it was a great ride, and yes, i am quite proud of myself for being able to ride a century in under six hours; "only" 5,200' of climbing... but still!
i've been playing with the various ways to record video of a ride from my gopro, and this little clip contains several of them: straight video, speeded up, time lapse pictures, turned into a video, and "posterized" video to turn it into effectively a timelapse sequence.  not sure yet of the best way.  i do like taking pictures during the ride and embedding them; for all that the gopro is amazing, the iphone pictures are better yet, and you can really see the difference on a cold and cloudy day.  and with my phone i can shoot "sideways", whereas the gopro is always pointed "down the road".
 onward!

perplexihelp
sunday,  09/29/24  10:15 am



among all the amazing capabilities of perplexity* and honestly, c'mon, it is amazing, right? one of the biggest for me is that it has completely replaced online help.  for some time now we were sure that google was always better than a product's own online help, but now perplexity is amazingly better.
* if you're not using perplexity instead of google as your default search engine, you're missing out
i'm editing a video with adobe premiere - a timelapse of the lighthouse century i rode yesterday, since you ask :) - and wanted to know how to change a video segment from 29.97fps as recorded by my gopro to 1fps as i want it added into my video.  so i asked perplexity*: "adobe premier how do i change the frame rate of a segment" and it tells me to use "interpret footage".  well that's a good answer but not the one i want, because it changes the segment's duration, so i next type** "without changing the duration" (leveraging context) and it tells me "use the posterize time video effect" which is exactly the right answer.  saved me many many minutes, and essentially makes premiere itself more powerful, since it opens up many more of its capabilities for me.
* by "ask" i mean, "typed into my browser's search line"
** by "next type" i mean, "typed into the perplexity chat below the search result"
and you know what perplexity costs? $0... what a time to be alive!
