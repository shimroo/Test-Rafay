high volume of work while maintaining high standards for workmanship and quality.  the team also processes the ultimate “can do “ attitude while taking on all task asked of them with a positive attitude. the team worked hard with clayco with coordinating and scheduling their portion of work on the project.  the team took initiative to go beyond the expected parameters of the job and that’s why i feel they have the intangibles and are  a great success in the work place. billy & gary’s work ethics and communication skills add value to wherever they work .the proof is how well their team
