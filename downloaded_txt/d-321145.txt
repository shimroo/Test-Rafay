rip kc carlson 


my husband of 25 years, kc carlson, passed away last night, february 8, 2025. he had had cancer for a couple of years and alzheimers for longer, so i am glad he is no longer suffering, and that his body has caught up with where his mind had gone. kc had a long and varied career in comics, doing just about everything at one time or another. in addition to his best-known work editing the superman and legion of super-heroes […]

author vs. illustrator 


author vs. illustrator is a children’s book that wonderfully explains how two people can work together to make a comic story. it’s written by donald lemke and illustrated by bob lentz. it’s an oversized hardcover, but the two characters — writer don is the yellow one with spiky hair and artist bob is the softer pink one — talk in color-coded dialog balloons, often with more than one “panel” (but with no borders) per page. so it really walks the […]

the dog sitter detective plays dead 


the dog sitter detective plays dead is the third in the cozy mystery series by antony johnston, just out. i previously enjoyed (and reviewed) the first, the dog sitter detective. this one’s even more fun because we see our protagonist, gwinny tuffel, return to her previous career of actress. she’s playing dr. seward on a gender-swapped vampire movie called draculania. but she’s still got a dog companion. the production happens to be filming on location in an old manor house […]

the mysterious affair at styles: first in the mini mysteries line 


now that fandom has become more acceptable and doesn’t make its practitioners social pariahs, and earlier fan generations now have children or grandchildren, you get some very interesting products for young ones. previously disposable entertainment is often transformed so that adults can share their love with their kids (whether the kids are interested or not). take, for example, the first in the mini mysteries children’s book line, agatha christie’s the mysterious affair at styles, as written by marci kay monson […]

somerset holmes 


i checked out somerset holmes because of my sherlock comics website. turns out this comic has nothing to do with the great detective. but it was a history lesson on its own, showing that trying to break into movies via comics is nothing new.

sue & tai-chan volume 5 


what better to relax with during a cold winter month than a charming, low-stakes comic about two cats and their everyday lives? i say low-stakes, but sue & tai-chan volume 5 does start with a bit of drama. older cat sue and kitten tai-chan have been locked out of their home with their human gone. it’s a role reversal, as normally teacher sue is the calm, reserved one, but she’s panicking, while tai-chan knows what to do. and thankfully, the […]

sherlock holmes: crimes for christmas 


i love an advent calendar. during a cold, dark month, where the pressure to do just the right thing for other people can become overwhelming, it’s nice to have a daily gift to oneself. here’s a new style one, a type i wasn’t previously familiar with, with content that’s a gift for any sherlockian: derrick belanger’s sherlock holmes: crimes for christmas.
