“the real suwannee river does not rise in any part of georgia.  it rises in the highest mountains of the human soul and is fed by the deepest springs in the human heart.  it does not flow through the northern part of florida, but through the pleasant, sunny lands of memory.  it does not empty into a material sea, but into the glorious ocean of unfulfilled dreams. it is far, far away, but the heart is ever turning to it, because there’s where the old folks stay.” james craig, 1893, ny telegram evening post
