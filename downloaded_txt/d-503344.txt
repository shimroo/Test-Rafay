just a quick note to all of you out there in cyber – space. . .because of the low interest rates and money coming out of the stock market and going into a hard assets (like a corvette that you can park in your garage) and my ability to locate some very nice corvettes, we are selling the corvettes i’m finding here in sunny california as fast as i can go through them! sometimes they are sold before i can take the pictures for you to see! if you are endlessly searching for that perfect, affordable corvette, call me!i may be buffing that one out and getting it ready for pictures!we ship world wide!
