we root out ignorance, hatred, and inequality wherever they live…


in courtrooms, in fine print, in emergency rooms and classrooms, in boardrooms and living rooms, in systems, institutions, and language, in private and public spaces - and replace them with knowledge, empathy, and justice.


community impact
 










the work of achieving, nurturing, defending, and ensuring equality and acceptance for all of us takes all of us.
