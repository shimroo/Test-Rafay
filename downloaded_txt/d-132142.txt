if you haven’t any charity in your heart, you have the worst kind of heart trouble. -bob hope








i was there. i saw your sons and your husbands, your brothers and your sweethearts. i saw how they worked, played, fought, and lived. i saw some of them die…-bob hope








…i saw more courage, more good humor in the face of discomfort, more love in an era of hate and more devotion to duty than could exist under tyranny. -bob hope








i have seen what a laugh can do. it can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful. -bob hope








when we recall the past, we usually find that it is the simplest things - not the great occasions - that in retrospect give off the greatest glow of happiness. -bob hope
