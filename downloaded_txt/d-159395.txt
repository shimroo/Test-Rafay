	why come here?	
a place of belonging, inspiration, and acceptance



our students love coming to school.  students at msa consider themselves part of a unique family of artists and scholars all accepting of each others’ unique talents, interests and perspectives.  this campus-wide sense of unity and support builds confidence and individuality in a safe and secure environment.  when students feel welcomed and supported by staff and fellow students- success will ultimately follow.



we're the school all parents wish they could have attended.



we hear everyday from our vibrant and active parent community that they’d wished for a school like msa when they were young.  we understand completely.  give your child the gift of access to outstanding academics and world-class arts training right here at manatee school for the arts.

 both my children attend msa- and i could not be happier that they are. it is an outstanding program for them. they have both become a and b students because of their excellent teachers. the best part is that they enjoy going to school.
