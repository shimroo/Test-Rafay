please give and support the red dirt relief fund!
the red dirt relief fund provides a safety net of critical assistance for oklahoma music people in times of need.
the red dirt relief fund, inc., is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that has provided more than â $640,000+ to oklahoma music people in need since its inception in 2013.
it’s been said musicians don’t have insuranceâthey host benefits. it was the tough truth in this quip that led red dirt musicians and fans to begin an organization to serve music people in times of need.
financial backing to begin the fund grew out of one very special event in stillwater, oklahomaâthe birthplace of red dirt music. the event, called red bull gypsy cafã©, brought over 30 of the scene’s most talented and successful singer/songwriters together in april 2011 to perform in pairs at intimate live music venues around stillwater.â  all ticket proceeds were used to begin the fund.
but the story doesn’t start, or end, thereâ¦keep reading to learn more about the music and its history.
critics say that red dirt can best be likened to the indie genre of rock ‘n’ roll as there is no definitive sound that can be attributed to all the bands in the movement. it has been described as a mix of folk, rock, country, bluegrass, blues, western swing, and honky tonk, with even a few mexican influences. some say it’s a state of mind as much as it is a sound âa sound that successfully closes the gap between rock and country.
