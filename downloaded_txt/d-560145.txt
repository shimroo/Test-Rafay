everyone i know says that anyone can die. but its my belief that you only die once you believe you can. there are many points in history when people believed that they were immortal and for the time they thought that they did not die. as an example hitler, before he was a dictator he was in wwi. during which he had multiple times were he should have died but did not and he began to believe he couldn't die. many years later he had many attempts on his life. one that most remember was when a time bomb was placed in one of the columns behind the podium where hitler was to give a speech in the burgerbrau beer cellar in munich. he suddenly ends his speech and departs. eight minutes later the bomb explodes killing eight people and wounding sixty-five. another time was when he was making plans and a briefcase containing a bomb was placed under the map table 5ft. from him and when it went off and he was only slightly wounded. yet when his empire had fallen and he believed he could die he killed his family then himself. thus proving my theroy.
