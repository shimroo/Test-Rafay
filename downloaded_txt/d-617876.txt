beware of the atms:


ever wondered why there are so many atms on zante these days?  it's because the banks have discovered a trick of processing transactions in pounds instead of euros allowing them to use their own exchange rate, a process called dynamic currency conversion (dcc).  the table below shows the comparative cost of obtaining €100 from the most common atms if you follow the default option of processing the transaction in gbp, and looking at the receipts left behind by other customers most people are still letting the atms steal up to 10% of their holiday money.
if you ignore all the inevitable warnings and choose the other option to do the exchange in euros, you will find that they will cost significantly less as the bank have to the use the visa exchange rate in the transaction. this should apply to any atm that you use and you must be given the choice. it's also a trick being used by some retailers and restaurants. it is generally accepted that if you are ever given the choice to make a card payment in gbp always decline the option and pay in euros as you would expect.

get as many euros as you feel comfortable taking with you before leaving the uk
not choosing the default dcc used by atms always gets a better exchange rate
never use a card for transactions of less than 100 euros
avoid euronet atms like the plague!

the truth about the zante shipwreck:


many people believe that the ship was smuggling contraband cigarettes and ran aground after being pursued by the greek navy.  the truth is somewhat different.  the ship was sailing from kefalonia to albania when it suffered a mechanical failure on the return journey. with no control and bad weather preventing any rescue the ship ran aground at navagio on october 2, 1980.
mv "panagiotis" captain charalambos kompothekras - kotsoros has released the full story about what happened.

the history of zakynthos:


although ancient writers attest that zakynthos was only inhabited during the 15th and 16th centuries bc, thucydides mentions that the first settlers were achaians from the peloponnese. we have only mythological sources to account for the island's prehistoric years, but these, however, may well contain grains of historical truth.

popular beaches:tsilivi beach  (231 comments)a big sandy beach able to accommodate everyone from the neighbouring resort and more. lots of tourist facilities on hand.kalamaki beach  (209 comments)4.1   probably the best place to actually see a turtle. just wade about in the shallow water and if they are about you will soon spot one.laganas beach  (162 comments)it's as busy as you'd expect from a club 18-30 resort, but keep walking and you'll find a long stretch of beach where development has been prevented by the marine park.alykanas beach  (150 comments)4.0   a big sandy beach which rarely gets crowded despite new tourist developments nearby. plenty of tourist facilities nearby without feeling overly commercialised.argassi beach  (138 comments)often criticised, mainly because in many places there is no beach! at least the water is shallow with a sandy bottom making it good for bathing.for a relatively small island zante has more than its fair share of fine beaches, one of the main reasons for its popularity with tourists and the loggerhead sea turtles.  all of the main resorts (with the exception of argassi) have excellent beaches on their doorstep, and if you venture outside of the resorts there are plenty more to discover.view all beaches on zante
