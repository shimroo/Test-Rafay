please note . . . i am unable to reply to requests for personal research. i'm not a professional genealogist, and my efforts in my own ancestor quest as well as supporting my web sites take about as much time as i can spare away from my own family and job. please take some time to browse through this website! you will learn about many resources and other types of help that are available to you. have fun!
