 covid-19 updates
sun international supports the south african government’s approach to containing the spread of covid-19 while resuming economic activity through the gradual and phased reopening of businesses. our south african hotel and casino properties will remain closed until we receive permission from government to reopen. given the uncertain nature of the virus, we are unable to say when this will happen.
we appeal to all south africans to abide by the rules of the different lockdown levels.
for regular covid-19 updates from the department of health, visit sacoronavirus.co.za
