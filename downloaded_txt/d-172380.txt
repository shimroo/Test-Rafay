i've moved to mastodon for social networking. my photos also get syndicated to instagram, bluesky, facebook, threads, and linkedin - so you can get the latest wherever you hang out, but i don't  visit these sites often/ever. 
you can also add the rss feed to your newsreader and get the latest picture updates in your news feed. you can also signup for the picture of the day email above, and get the latest posts in your inbox.
besides my photography on photog.social, i also maintain a mastodon account on famichiki.jp, where i talk about life in japan, us & japanese politics, privacy, web, design, and music.
