about the book


 


the mighty
water-wheel at laxey mines in the isle of man has been set in motion. in its
great shadow, sarah and patrick have fallen in love. it is a love that must be
kept secret, for patrick is irish. sarah’s mother — judith — has lost her mind
and blames an irishman for her husband being imprisoned ‘across the water’ in
liverpool, where she can never visit him.
the two young lovers desperately desire to wed and be together, but judith’s
increasing madness, which began when she lost some of her childer to a savage
disease and deepened on her husband’s incarceration, proved too strong a pull.
sarah’s deep loyalty to her mother also stands between the lovers, indeed life
itself thwarts their every effort to find a way toward their happiness.
patrick’s friend — robert — is going to australia to make his fortune mining for
gold and has asked patrick to accompany him. with no other option and seemingly
with the cards stacked against them, patrick and sarah are both heartbroken.
knowing that her mother will never recover from her illness and will always
need her support, sarah tells patrick he must go with robert to make a life for
himself without her, and to forget her, and the love they share.


 


about the author


the author was born
in scotland a year before world war ii started, but swears she didn’t cause it
…
in january 1968 she arrived in australia as a ‘ten pound tourist’ with her,
then, husband and four children. 
after the breakup of her marriage after twenty-five years the author was
contacted by a man named mike kelly, whom she had known in her teens and had
had no contact with for nearly thirty years. mike’s marriage having broken up
around the same time as the author’s. on learning she was ‘on the loose’, he
obtained her phone number by courtesy of his mother — international telephone
enquiries — and the author’s mother, so rang to see if she was okay.
one thing led to another, they were married in 1988 and the both returned to
the isle of man to start a new life. on mike’s retirement, five years later,
they followed the summers and spent half their lives in australia and the other
half in the isle of man. 
in their months on the island each year, they ran a daffodil and plant nursery
and were well known throughout the island for their roadside stall, where they
sold their daffodils and plants.
as age caught up with them, they realised it was time to settle somewhere
permanently. being the warmer country, australia won, and they moved there in
2014, to live in a retirement village in lakes entrance — one of the prettiest
spots in australia.
this, they both feel, will suit them until they climb in their boxes (but not
for a long time yet) and move on to higher places.

the global warming hoax unveiled










poor 'wooden' al can't seem to catch a break. for eight long years they
made him cover for charismatic horndog president, slick willie, who could make
panties drop and women swoon even at a funeral.


poor al couldn't even keep his own wife. then they made him run for that
office, which he actually won in the popular vote in 2000 but was robbed of it
by the supreme court. "what now?" poor al wondered, knowing he was
still under faustian contract to the dark lord and a pact with the devil is
forever.


his next assignment was even worse. they put him out front as lead
spear-catcher in their latest scheme to rule the world-- "the global
warming hoax." poor al didn't have a choice. when the dark lord spoke, al
had to jump.


they thought a couple of world wars and some fairly serious genocide
would do the trick to completely subdue us back in the 20th century, but it
didn't so they decided to change up their game for the 21st, and get us to
voluntarily put ourselves under their yoke.


the new scheme--we'll give it code-name "crispy planet"--was
created to manipulate world temperature data and produce the scariest ending
imaginable--a world slow-roasting itself--and they would blame it all on us
deplorable human cockroaches and our fossil fuels!


"it may already be too late to save yourselves," we were told
by apostle al, "but maybe, just maybe i know a guy, who knows a guy, who
can save you!"


all we had to do, we were told, was give up everything that made life
comfortable or enjoyable, and hand over our god-given rights to the dark lord.


if we did that, these benevolent globalist barons might save us, but we
only had a few years to capitulate to their command--oh, and pay the $134
trillion ransom under the paris climate deal, which was part of the scam.


alternatively, they would let us drown in our own waste and spawn as the
waters rose to engulf us, or they would let us fry to a crisp as the unyielding
sun got ever hotter.


they weren't sure which, but it would be a terrible ending!


according to washington post journalist, ben bagdikian, just 15 of these
progressive billionaire wanna-be rulers control 82% of world media and are for
the most part singing in unison, whatever the topic, which i suspect is not by
accident.


no matter which channel or network you turn on, they are even using the
same text most days like a bunch of mockingbirds, so it wasn't hard for this
cohesive handful of progressives to manipulate public opinion and they did a
splendid job of it.


most people in the world today now believe the global warming hoax
rather than what they see with their own eyes and feel on their own skin 20
years later.


a fellow progressive of today’s globalist barons from the national
socialist german workers party, joseph goebbels, was fond of saying, “if you
tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to
believe it.


the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the
people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie.


it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers
to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by
extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the state.”


today's progressives live by goebbels’ big lie maxim too, and the few
scientists back in 2001 who stood up against this big lie--the global warming
hoax--such as dr. keith briffa and professor phillip jones, were quickly beaten
back into submission.


ultimately, they were forced to falsify their own data to match the big
lie. they were threatened with excommunication from the church of pseudoscience
and would be cast into irrelevance in global warming hell if they did not do
so, they were warned.


most real scientists, however, are finally admitting that the emperor is
naked (though you don't hear much about that either), but it is true.


in fact, 31,487 real scientists--just in america--have signed a petition
stating "there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of
carbon dioxide, methane or greenhouse gases is causing, or will cause in the
forseeable future, catastrophic rising in the earth's temperature."--while
al gore and the hole-in-the-ozone gang still claim "99.9% of them"
are in unison that "crispy planet" is just a couple of big macs away
due to farting cows and humans who like to breathe, eat, stay warm, and go
places.


nobel prize-winning physicist, dr. ivar gaiera, recently added his name
and support to the global warming petition, calling out the globalist hoax to a
completely deaf media--though it is one of the biggest pieces of news so far
this century.


he revealed the truth about how the hoax came about back in 2001 saying
that there were only 18 so-called 'scientists' who worked on this
unsubstantiated allegation of human attribution in the first working group of
the ipcc (intergovernment panel on climate change) report (#ar5) back in 2001.


dr. gaiera also revealed not only their names (listed below), but that
at least three of them were just students, not scientists. i've yet to see poor
al gore's scientific credentials and we now know that the man behind his
'evidence' lied about his credentials.


so, let's take a look at the chart that apostle al and a man falsely
claiming to be a "nobel prize winner", michael e. mann, used to fool
the world--now famously known as "the hockey stick graph"--ostensibly
showing our planet speeding to its end, 20 years ago. this chart was achieved
by manipulating the data, and completely leaving out numbers that did not match
their thesis, including the entire medieval warming period between 950 and 1250
a.d. —during which wine grapes were being grown in northern england—and the
hottest years in recorded history such as 1910 and 1944. in short, it was a
calculated fraud. 


instead of "crispy planet", however, data since 2000 shows
that there has been no warming in 15 of those years and that the average
temperature of the earth's surface has cooled by 1.4 degrees in just the past
three.


the southern ice cap is larger than ever, and 90% of the world’s islands
and atolls are larger than a decade ago, ending the claim that ocean are
rising.


some scientists are now warning of a mini ice age, while globalists
still cling to the hoax in hopes of fear-mongering their way into a modern
feudalism with just two classes as there were throughout most of human
history--ruling elites and peasants--with no one in the middle (except maybe
their media and political servants).


so where do we go from here?


that's the $134 trillion question, isn't it? the hoax may have been a
good thing in the long-run, as badly as i hate to admit it, as it has made all
of us more aware of the consequences of our actions.


also, i'm still very worried about real environmental problems like the
great pacific garbage patch of floating plastic covering 1.6 million square
kilometres in the pacific ocean, and the dangerous decline in bee populations.


these are actual problems in need of real solutions, but we can quit
being audacious enough to think that we can destroy mother earth so easily with
normal human behaviours.


actual numbers show that we cannot, though we should treat our home with
far more respect, and that will be my own takeaway from what has now been
dubbed “climategate.”


we can also stop worrying about overpopulating the planet, as absent
parts of india and africa, populations are actually declining or in free fall.


once these regions and societies advance even slightly--especially if
the safety valve of flooding other continents with their unwanted is brought to
a halt--they will quickly realize what every other maturing society has learned
and be no different.


ancient towns in europe, such as sambucca, sicily built by the greeks
and voted ‘most beautiful’ in italy are selling empty homes and villas for as
little as 1 euro, just to get people to come there.


entire villages in france and spain are uninhabited already, and the
same will eventually happen throughout the world, especially if the dark lord
loses to the light and people outside these zones of over-breeding remain free.


the best way to save our planet is also the simplest. adam smith gave us
a formula for the success of any nation, "peace, easy taxes, and a
tolerable administration of justice.”


simple, right? but few nations have ever been true to these principles
of success for long. economic freedom, limited government, no more laws than
absolutely necessary and any place on earth will thrive and stay beyond the
clutches of the dark lord’s desire to rule us.


we will escape their latest attempt at world rule as well--and i give
the new president of the united states, donald j. trump, much of the credit for
that when he cancelled his nation’s participation in the paris climate accord,
putting the world on notice that he wasn't buying their story--and he's now
been proven right. the biggest hoax in human history has been unveiled for what
it was.


note: these are the 18 'scientist/students' according to nobel prize
winner and physicist, dr. ivar gaiever, who started the global warming hoax

papua terrorism risk










three indonesian soldiers were
killed in an ambush by separatist militants armed with small-arms and
spears/bows in the nduga district of indonesia's papua province on 7 march. the
attack was claimed by the tentara pembebasan nasional papua barat (tpnbp), or
west papua national liberation army, the armed wing of papuan separatist
organization organisasi papua merdeka (opm).


the increased tempo of attacks
indicates that some tentara pembebasan nasional papua barat (tpnbp) components
have adopted a more aggressive strategy, most notably the faction led by
ekianus kogoya, which claimed the december 2018 attack and was blamed by the military
for the 7 march 2019 ambush. various organisasi papua merdeka (opm)-affiliated
factions have waged a persistent low-level insurgency in papua since the 1960s
against perceived indonesian occupation and exploitation of the country's
mineral wealth; the threat has never previously escalated beyond sporadic
guerrilla operations. notably, ihs markit recorded 14 separatist attacks in
2018 - more than the previous four years combined - and three to date in 2019.
the tpnbp also claimed a 2 december 2018 attack that killed 19 construction
workers involved in building the 4,300 km trans papua highway, a high-profile
government development initiative linking sorong in west papua to merauke in
papua.



 


increased spending on
infrastructure and other development projects by indonesian president joko
"jokowi" widodo is not turning the population against the insurgents.
in fact, the government's development initiatives and the state's heavy-handed
response to separatist activism are already exacerbating local anti-government
sentiment. the 2 december 2018 attack, for example, was conducted the day after
more than 500 protesters were arrested for participating in pro-independence
rallies, and notably, more than 20,000 people were reportedly displaced in the
military operation that followed the attack. projects such as the trans papua
highway are also viewed by papuan activists as an attempt to extend the state's
reach into previously inaccessible interior regions. this said, there have been
no clear indications that continued popular support for independence or at
least self-determination has translated into increased tpnbp recruitment.


the tpnbp's reliance on
traditional weapons to supplement a shortfall of military-grade weaponry
indicates that the group is unable to properly equip its existing fighters, let
alone equip and integrate any substantial intake of new recruits. the tpnbp's
claims of several thousand members are likely to be exaggerated; authorities
have claimed that kogoya's faction probably comprises fewer than 50 fighters.
this reflects the group's longstanding lack of funding. the majority of funds
from diaspora sources are likely still prioritizing political pro-independence
activism over insurgent groups. although low-level extortion has targeted some mining
operations in papua, there are no indications that the group has sought to tax
the local population, on which it is reliant, at least for passive, if not
rudimentary, logistical and intelligence-gathering support.


the trans papua highway and the
grasberg mine (operated by freeport inc.) are the primary commercial targets at
risk in the coming months. these two sites are symbolic of indonesia's
perceived exploitation in papua, and attacks targeting them to date do not
indicate an increasing risk to commercial assets more broadly in the country.
given limited capability, the majority of insurgent attacks will still focus on
security forces and those being directly deployed in construction work for the
highway project given their accessibility. aviation risk is also elevated for
low-flying aircraft in the region because of deliberate targeting or
misidentification. following the ambush on 7 march 2019, military helicopters
recovering the bodies of soldiers were engaged by ground fire; no major damage
was reported to the helicopters.


indicators
of changing risk environment


increasing risk


an election win for opposition presidential
     candidate prabowo subianto will indicate the formation of a new government
     that is more likely to favor a heavy-handed military response against the
     tpnbp than the current jokowi administration.
a heavy-handed state response to tpnbp
     violence, extended to political pro-independence activism and civilian
     population, will probably increase popular support for militancy as the
     most viable method of achieving objectives.
tpnbp operations increasingly targeting the
     trans papua highway will probably provoke further military deployments and
     direct confrontation with insurgents and risk further alienating the local
     population.



decreasing risk


prominent pro-autonomy/independence diaspora
     figures clearly distancing themselves from tpnbp operations and use of
     violence more generally will probably undermine the group's appeal and
     local support networks.
increasing international pressure on the
     indonesian government to limit its military response, particularly from
     australia, the european union, and the united kingdom, will encourage more
     development-focused initiatives as a means to further assimilation in papua.
the indonesian state moderating its military
     operations against the tpnbp, thereby de-escalating the security situation
     and delegitimizing the tpnbp's use of violence to achieve political
     objectives, will further deter any recruitment to the tpnbp.
