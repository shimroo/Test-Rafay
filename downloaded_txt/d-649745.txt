365/365







so unless you've been living under a rock, you know that i've been doing project 365. officially finished my second year yesterday! that's 730 days in a row. yeah. i am crazy. i will probably be continuing. going through all of my pictures always makes me think i could've taken much better ones. haha. so i guess we'll keep going until i'm actually good. :p all of my 2010 pics are here: project 365: 2010and i made a video again this year with all of them and one of my new favorite songs from my friend bill: tags:  bill, photos, project 365 (2010), videos, year in review

march 12 of 12







i know i've claimed to have forgotten about 12 of 12 before. but i never really forgot forgot. i would not remember to take pictures until after my shower or something. but today? today i really totally and completely forgot. i didn't think about it yesterday and put my camera out. i didn't remember in the morning. i didn't even realize when i was doing calendar in the classroom and putting up the 12. i was at work, in the cafeteria handing out ketchup to kids during lunch and suddenly realized that it was the 12th and i had not taken a single picture yet. but at least i finally remmembered. that was close, lol.as always, check out chad's blog for more on this project.

december 12 of 12







another year of chad darnell's 12 of 12 comes to an end, and i almost wasn't able to post my pictures! dead computer, old card readers, annoying junk. but i went and got things figured out today, and am finally able to get some photos up. since i don't have my computer, they're all straight out of the camera this month. no fancy tweaking or borders. oh well. here's what i did on a rainy saturday: 9:35am - kitchen - helping dad making cookies. and by "helping" i definitely mean watching him do the work while i eat dough.( read more...collapse )tags:  12 of 12, christina, elayna, friends, i love l.a., photos, picspam, sarah, tv

10 red balloons







yo. my internet is dead right now. it's annoyng. i called tech support an hour ago and they said there was an outtage up in bakersfield and we're on the same server? so blah. hope it comes back soon 'cause i have things to catch up on! and i need it tomorrow...the nerdfighter community is trying to win $40,000 for charity tomorrow. darpa (the military people who invented the internet) is having a contest to celebrate the internet turning 40. they're launching 10 big red weather balloons around the us tomorrow and the first team to find the location of all 10 wins!if my internet was working i'd link you to a video about it, but here's how you can help! if any of you happen to see a big red weather balloon during daylight hours tomorrow, tell me where it is!!! or even if you hear about someone else seeing one somewhere. we need an address or intersection near each balloon. they could literally be anywhere in the continental united states, but will be visible from roads and somewhere public. so keep your eyes open while you go about your day tomorrow. :)tags:  internet, nerdfighters
