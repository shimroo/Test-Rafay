at yccc, we‚Äôre proud to have a diverse and dynamic group of individuals serving on our foundation board. barbara grillo is one member whose adventurous spirit and deep commitment to community service make her an invaluable asset to our team.recently, barbara completed the coastal route of el camino de santiago, also known as the way of st. james. this network of ancient pilgrimage trails winds through france, spain, and portugal, ultimately leading to the cathedral of santiago de compostela in spain, believed to house the remains of the apostle saint james.barbara described the experience as ‚Äúa journey of reflection and renewal‚Äù and shared that the 170-mile trek from porto, portugal, to the cathedral took 13 days. traveling with four friends, she noted that ‚Äúeach day presented new wonders, from breathtaking beaches and serene forests to charming villages and bustling cities.‚Äù staying in albergues (pilgrim hostels) added authenticity to the adventure. impressively, barbara avoided blisters until day 12, and even with them, she said the trip was ‚Äúone of the most exhilarating experiences of my life.‚Äùanother exhilarating experience in barbara‚Äôs life is serving as a ycccf board member. beyond her adventurous spirit, she brings a wealth of professional expertise from her career as a hospital administrator with the mainehealth system. barbara joined the board six years ago after retiring, drawn by her belief in yccc‚Äôs mission and inspired by the leadership of dr. fischer. she has remained an active and enthusiastic advocate, committed to supporting yccc students and helping the board address financial barriers that might otherwise prevent students from achieving their goals.when she‚Äôs not contributing her talents to yccc, barbara enjoys life in kennebunk with her husband and their golden retriever, gia. they‚Äôre proud parents of three adult children and doting grandparents to two grandchildren, all of whom live nearby in new england.barbara‚Äôs adventurous spirit, dedication to education, and community-focused mindset embody the values that make yccc‚Äôs foundation board exceptional.
