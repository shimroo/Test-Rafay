                                                  on-site or virtual training courses:design control and risk management

accelerate your project schedule with ‘design control compliance for  fda & iso’ and ‘risk management & iso 14971’ training for your project team to  get everyone working together with a common understanding.



  



                                                        on-site or virtual training courses: 

                                                    software compliance, v&v and iec 60601
‘software  compliance’,  including ‘software v&v’ during development can delay a project and  result in submission rejections. train your team how to achieve compliance  without slipping milestones. plan early for ‘iec 60601’ certification  requirements to prevent costly re-design and delays. 



  



                                                    on-site or virtual training courses:quality system regulation & iso 13485:2016

prepare for  your fda or iso inspection/audit by training your company on the ‘fda  quality system regulation (21 cfr part 820)’ and/or ‘iso 13485:2016’.  consider training your own ‘auditing’ team to perform internal audits.



  



                                                      on-site or virtual training courses:

                                                    complaint handling & mdrs, process validation

‘complaint  handling, mdrs, capa’, and ‘process validation’ are very high on fda's list of  warning letter citations every year. these are areas you can expect fda and  notified bodies to audit closely.


  



                                                on-site or virtual training courses:

                                                    510(k) and ce marking (new mdr & ivdr)

‘510(k)  submissions’ & ‘ce marking’ is the lifeblood of most medical device companies. we will be teaching how to  create and submit a 510(k) submission package and how to ce mark your devices.
