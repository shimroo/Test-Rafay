jodiesg fit is like a second home to me. all the friendly staff make me feel so welcome and are very approachable unlike other gyms in the toowoomba region. over the past few months i’ve being going to sg fit, i’ve established lifelong friendships with both trainers and other members.








student ai don’t know how to thank you for guiding me in the right path during my bad times. words can’t explain how thankful i am.








student bi would like to thank you for all your help and support throughout this stressful process. i really appreciate your guidance; without it i may have suffered a greater consequence. it’s been a pleasure conversing with you, i’m very grateful for your time. thank you!








student ci really appreciate what you do for students. i am grateful i had somewhere to turn for support.








student dthank you so much for your support and assistance, it’s making this process a lot easier to manage and i find i’m not as mentally drained after talking to you.
