march 2020the guy bourdin estate is pleased to announce the upcoming exhibition “postwar parisian avant-garde”  (pariser avantgard der nachkriegszeit) at kunsthalle "talstrasse" in halle, germany.the exhibition will be opened between march 15 to june 28 2020 and accompanied by a catalogue. though guy bourdin is widely acknowledged as an artist of exceptional inspiration, he has remained in many ways an enigma. this exhibition will focus on his crucial formative years. while he painted with real commitment and drew obsessively, it was as a photographer that he was destined to make his mark. painstakingly salvaged and dusted down, sorted and examined as the precious archaeological fragments that they are, the photographs exhibited in "pariser avantgard der nachkriegszeit" illuminate the crucial first years of bourdin's image making – between 1949, the year of his return to civilian life after military service in the air force, and 1955, the year of his first commission for vogue.
