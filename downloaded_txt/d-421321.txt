    when to buy and when to sell could very well be the question of all
	questions when it comes to trading or investing in stocks, futures and options.
            the answer though, could very well be found in technical analysis. it's been suggested time and time again, that technical analysis is
	indeed the most reliable method for trading the markets. and chart pattern recognition would certainly fall
	under the category of technical analysis.
