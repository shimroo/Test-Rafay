this page uses frames, but your browser doesn't support them. 
  the page i have created for browsers that don't support frames is not nearly
  as robust as the frames version.  you might consider upgrading to a
  recent version of internet explorer or even heaven forbid netscape.
if you cant or wont upgrade
  to a frames capable browser, this link will let you get to most of the
