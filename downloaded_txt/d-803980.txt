custom golf ball packaginggolf box is the #1 supplier of logo golf balls with custom packaging in america. we customize high-quality golf balls with business and corporate logos. we print custom packaging with your logo and colors. our goal is to create maximum value for every promotional dollar you spend.in the past, corporate customers have had limited options when looking for custom golf ball packaging. golfbox specializes in putting logos on both the golf ball and it's packaging.now, with custom golf ball packaging bearing the same logos as the golf balls, there's no confusion about who provided the corporate gift, promotional product, or trade show giveaway.  even when the golf ball is separated from the packaging, everyone knows where it came from.we can also include a qr code on the golf ball packaging, allowing users of smart phones to easily access your website. immediately promote your company and it's website using coupons, directions to your location, and contact information.as a result, custom logo golf balls and packaging can be used by any business that wants to promote an event or commemorate a special day. logo golf balls are perfect for promoting golf tournaments, sports teams, personalized gifts, fundraising, bachelor parties, and more.most of all, custom-printed golf balls bearing your company logo can serve as unique and highly effective networking tools. business and golf are closely linked. for decades, the practice of giving golf balls as business gifts has been a common practice. it continues to be an effective means of fostering good relationships in a corporate and business environment today.companies have imprinted their own logos on a multitude of golf ball brands over the years. in the process, these companies have increased golf ball sales dramatically, raising market awareness and improving brand visibility and recall for major golf ball manufacturers. however, for many recipients, the brand on the ball is even more significant than who gave the gift itself. this presents a dilemma for the corporate gift giver, who would obviously want to be associated with the gift, especially if it is a well-regarded brand of golf ball.a common problem for corporate gift givers is that their brand is often neglected or downplayed in the process of giving the gift. with standard packaging, only the golf ball bears the logo of the company, with the package totally absent of the company logo, or any identifying mark for that matter.because the golf balls are typically presented to the recipient while still in the box, the receiver usually won’t have any idea who the gift is from. even if the recipient takes the time to open the box, the golf ball brand will typically command more attention than the logo of the corporate giver.golf box provides an elegant solution to that dilemma by offering full custom packaging along with golf ball branding. by providing a comprehensive packaging solution that incorporates a unique package, and logo on top-shelf golf balls, we present a unified and cohesive corporate image. this effectively imprints a company’s brand in the minds of the receiver.this eliminates any disconnect between the custom-printed golf balls, and your brand.golf box makes the process of giving away golf balls a more effective and rewarding marketing tool.
