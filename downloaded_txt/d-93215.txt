this website contains over 100 pages of information about living and buying a home in mount dora, eustis, tavares, leesburg, howey-in-the-hills and the northern lake county 
						florida area.
 
lake county is unlike anywhere else in florida with rolling hills, huge natural lakes, miles of forested hills and spectacular 
						scenery. nominated by numerous national magazines as one of the best places in the us to retire, 
						mount dora is the crown jewel of lake county. 
						founded in 1883, this quaint lakeside town sits 266 feet above sea level. antique shopping and great restaurant dining are a way of 
						life in mount dora. the annual mount dora art festival draws nearly 200,000 people annually. the world famous icehouse theatre is 
						located nearby and the shores of beautiful lake dora are a short walk from downtown. the town is especially know for its spectacular 
						christmas decorations centered around the downtown park where every tree is covered with over a hundred thousand sparkling lights.
 
eustis is a charming small town that is currently in the process of completely reinventing itself. in 2003, the waterman hospital, which dominated 
						the downtown eustis skyline for many years, relocated south to highway 441. this move created a large new downtown area ripe for 
						development. eustis is a unique waterfront city with a downtown area virtually on the shore of lake eustis. the city docks are open to 
						the public and it is possible to dock your boat and walk a short distance to dine at restaurants and browse the many small shops that 
						line the downtown streets.
 
the city of tavares, located on the north shore of lake dora, is the county seat of lake county. the 
						courthouse, police department, jail, departmental offices and courts are all located in the center of 
						downtown.  this waterfront city has gone through a major renaissance in recent 
						years. as "americas seaplane city", downtown tavares has been transformed from the seat of government business to an attraction of major interest.
 
   mount dora and all of northern lake county florida is a wonderful place to play, live or retire. we hope you enjoy this website and will 
						contact us if you have any questions or would like to arrange a tour of our area. we live and work in the mount dora area and would love 
						to show you around our beautiful town!

						customers return to us time and time again. finding a buyer for your property or finding the right home is just the beginning of the 
						process. in truth, much of a realtor's work begins after the contract is signed. numerous issues can derail an otherwise great sale. 
						accessibility, timely response, follow up, financing, prompt inspections, compliance with regulations, paperwork and attention to 
						detail are just a few things that can turn a otherwise good real estate experience into a nightmare. judy is an exceptional realtor, which 
						means she is not only a great salesperson, but a skilled negotiator, a detail crusader and a caring and thoughtful people person.
