the liturgical tradition of the lutheran church has been a hallmark of our worship practices for centuries. music has played an intentional role, whether as a prelude to worship, hymn, offering of thanks, canticle, or expression of praise. all are invited to join the martin luther college wind symphony for “prayer and alleluia,” a concert of works for wind band that reflect the various roles music serves in our liturgical tradition.
the concert will take place on sunday, february 23, at 3:00 pm in the chapel of the christ.

mlc forum presents ask any girl
february 28 – march 1, 7:30 pm; march 2, 2:00 pm
(martin luther college auditorium)
meg wheeler feels stifled in her small hometown where she’s just graduated from college. so meg comes to new york intent on enlarging her horizon—and by that she means finding a husband. she moves into a boarding house in manhattan that’s filled with attractive girls, most of them just as eager as meg to find the ideal man. meg has a unique ability to invent plausible statistics. however, when meg tries her homemade statistics on the mathematically inclined miles doughton, head of an advertising firm, the system fails. however, meg finds herself fascinated by miles’ younger brother evan, so miles decides to give her a hand in snaring evan. join us to find out if things go according to plan in winifred wolfe’s ask any girl. 
tickets ($8 adults, $6 students/seniors) will be sold at the door only, beginning 30 minutes before each show time.

wels national band festival at mlc
martin luther college is pleased to host the 2025 wels national band festival march 7-9. this festival has been an annual tradition since 1960 when luther hs-onalaska wi and wisconsin lutheran hs-milwaukee collaborated to present a festival concert. the event has grown significantly over the years and now includes students from 22 wels high schools from all over the united states.
this year, approximately 100 student musicians will come to the mlc campus for fellowship, fun, and many hours of rigorous rehearsal. it all culminates in the festival concert, “instruments of praise,” on sunday, march 9, at 2:00 pm in the chapel of the christ.

can’t make it to the concert? watch it on our livestream. 





“i was really impressed with the 10 young adults from mlc who helped with hurricane cleanup in panama city. they represented their savior and their school very well. all of them were self-starters, and every one worked hard . . . not a slacker in the bunch. they were polite and attentive. these future teachers and pastors give me great hope for the future!”
pastor john huebner 
“dmlc and now mlc will always hold a special place in our hearts. we have seen firsthand many blessings for our families and ministries, and join others in thanksgiving for this special school.”
connie scharf
“martin luther college is a special place for students to learn how best to serve the lord with their gifts as public ministers of the gospel.”
mlc day donor
“this institution is blessed with faculty and staff members who are exceptionally committed to the mission of preparing students for ministry, who are exemplary in their care for and involvement with students, and who are gracious in their relationships with colleagues.”
the higher learning commissionof the north central association of colleges and schools
“i thank god for the privilege of sitting at the feet of christian teachers and professors who molded my life so to speak in god’s ways.”
carol gronholz
“i know the lord is smiling on mlc for the work being done to train those who will teach god’s word to the world. there is no work more important.”
jack ulrich
“reflecting on the quality of education that i received at mlc and the quality of the professors that i had throughout the program, i don’t think i could have found that care and attention anywhere else.”
gretchen hintzms ed 2015, leadership emphasis 
“i love the fact that everyone is so friendly and genuine at mlc. it amazes me how everyone smiles and says hi even if you’ve only chatted once. the unity of the student body is very apparent to me, and the faith that unifies them is incredible.”
