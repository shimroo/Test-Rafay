​the aims and objectives of the alliancecurrent members of the alliance



​the aims and objectives of the alliancethe parenting programmes' alliance was formed at the beginning of 2015 to provide a forum for programme developers' voices to be heard at national policy level, to work together to influence policy and practice in the development, commissioning and provision of parenting programmes by:

promoting and supporting best practice
sharing knowledge and experience
acting as the voice of parenting programme developers and providers


the group appointed an independent chair, dorit braun, in january 2016.  after discussions with parenting uk as the membership body for parenting professionals, it was agreed that the ppdg would sit as a working group of parenting uk who would provide secretariat support.
