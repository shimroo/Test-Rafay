welcome to emergentmind.org!
this site has been set up as an open venture between scientists, scholars,
meditators and all 
 those who believe that we are approaching a conceptual
threshold in our understanding of how 
 physics, physiology and consciousness
interact.
for the past few decades, experimental evidence has been accumulating
in almost all areas of 
 science that non-local and mind-directed effects upon the
physical world are more ubiquitous than 
 we had so far cared to admit. as
institutional research becomes more open about these matters, 
 a theoretical
framework is beginning to emerge. we may have, at this point, a vague idea about 
the extraordinary potential lying in store for humanity, but we are still very
much at a loss about 
 how to approach this "new science".
the east has the benefit of thousands of years of experience in this field,
but the language of its 
 investigations seems so intuitive, so subjective, that
it is almost untranslatable in scientific jargon. 
 and yet, translate we will
have to: the greatest challenge lying ahead in the decades to come will be 
 the
design of appropriate experiments and "test particles" in order to
explore the strange geometry of 
 the mind-matter continuum. 
we believe that both east and west  can benefit from joining efforts at
this point. such  steps have 
 already been taken (for example, by the
repeated meetings between the dalai lama and western 
 scientists, as described in
the  mind-life series). if this endeavor is approached with the right mix of 
humility, awe and determination (as opposed to the arrogance that has
characterized much of our 
 scientific progress), we believe that the goals of
both traditions can come to fruition: for a persuasive 
 proof of the
"holographic paradigm" is most likely to tear down the barriers of fear
and cynicism and 
 facilitate a mass transition toward the ideals of compassion
and spiritual fulfillment.
however, in order to build a new culture, we must first construct its
language. to that aim, we have 
 devised this site with the following functions in
mind:
 


to make investigators with different backgrounds familiar with the
    questions, impasses and research 
 directions being followed in other fields
    of study.

 


to provide an archive of  articles pertinent to the scientific
    research of mind-matter connections.

 


to provide a forum for the exchange of  ideas between scientists, scholars
    and all those who feel 
 they may be able to offer practical insights into
    this question.

 


last, but not least, to contribute to the development of that critical
    mass necessary to precipitate 
 the new  paradigm shift. 

 
online casino & the science of winninghave you ever wondered why gambling is sð¾ popular? why have people enjoyed it for thousands of years before we even existed all over the world? it all lies in our heads. getting something that you expect is exciting, but nothing is as thrilling as unexpected wins. this is how our brain functions and there is not much we can do to fight it. the dopamine levels increase and with them our genuine feeling of happiness does the same. thinking about it, we spent our lives looking for happiness, that feeling of being blessed by the gods, the faith or just random magic, no wonder this hasnât changed from ancient times until now. people love to take risks, to believe, to hope. and now, so many years after the revolution and evolution of gambling, online casinos have even made it even easier and much more entertaining to enter the world of bets. if iâve somehow sparked your interest, the online casino reviews by casinoreviews.co.uk could be your first step in the risky yet so attractive world of online wagers! 
 
note to our guests:
this project depends on everyone's contribution: please become part of it
by promoting it, visiting 
 regularly and posting all new information/ideas you
deem relevant.
