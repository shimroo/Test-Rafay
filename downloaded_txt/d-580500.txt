baptism in the bible

and now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the lord. (acts 22:16)
the bible teaches that baptism is essential to salvation. it is at the point of our baptism that we enter the kingdom of god and depart the kingdom of darkness. our deliverance from sin involves a passage through water, which to anyone who knows the old testament should not be surprising. it is at our baptism that we die to sin and are raised to walk in newness of life. it is at our baptism that our sins are washed away. to reject these facts is to reject the word of god. the denominations proclaim that he who believes and is saved shall be baptized, but that is not what jesus said. jesus said that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved. there are only two verses in the bible that tell you how to get "into christ" - galatians 3:27 and romans 6:3. what do they tell you about baptism?

the church of christ

what is the church of christ?
in matthew 16:18, jesus promised to build a church. in acts 2:47, luke tells us that people were being added to that church. thus, we can conclude that jesus built his church sometime between his promise in matthew 16 and lukeâs statement in acts 2. indeed, a closer study of the events in acts 2 reveals that the lordâs church was established on that first day of pentecost following the lordâs resurrection when peter preached the first gospel sermon. that church is the church of christ. a common misconception about the church of christ is that âthe church of christâ is its name. it is not. the âchurch of christâ is its description. the church of christ is the church that belongs to christ, the church that was established by christ, the church that was built by christ, and the church that was bought by christ. it is not our church; it is his church, the lordâs church. and the lord's church is not a denomination.

                  god's plan of salvation
                

 













                              you must hear the gospel
                            


                              romans 10:17
                            





 




                              you must hear the gospel and then understand and recognize that you are lost without jesus christ no matter who you are and no matter what your background is. the bible tells us that âall have sinned, and come short of the glory of god.â (romans 3:23) before you can be saved, you must understand that you are lost and that the only way to be saved is by obedience to the gospel of jesus christ. (2 thessalonians 1:8) jesus said, âi am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father, but by me.â (john 14:6) âneither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.â (acts 4:12)  "so then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of god." (romans 10:17)
                            








                              you must believe
                            


                              hebrews 11:6
                            





 




                              you must believe and have faith in god because âwithout faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to god must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.â (hebrews 11:6) but neither belief alone nor faith alone is sufficient to save. (james 2:19; james 2:24; matthew 7:21)
                            








                              you must repent
                            


                              acts 3:19
                            





 




                              you must repent of your sins. (acts 3:19) but repentance alone is not enough. the so-called âsinnerâs prayerâ that you hear so much about today from denominational preachers does not appear anywhere in the bible. indeed, nowhere in the bible was anyone ever told to pray the âsinnerâs prayerâ to be saved. by contrast, there are numerous examples showing that prayer alone does not save. saul, for example, prayed following his meeting with jesus on the road to damascus (acts 9:11), but saul was still in his sins when ananias met him three days later (acts 22:16). cornelius prayed to god always, and yet there was something else he needed to do to be saved (acts 10:2, 6, 33, 48). if prayer alone did not save saul or cornelius, prayer alone will not save you. you must obey the gospel. (2 thess. 1:8)
                            








                              you must confess
                            


                              romans 10:9
                            





 




                              you must confess that jesus christ is the son of god. (romans 10:9-10) note that you do not need to make jesus âlord of your life.â why? because jesus is already lord of your life whether or not you have obeyed his gospel. indeed, we obey him, not to make him lord, but because he already is lord. (acts 2:36) also, no one in the bible was ever told to just âaccept jesus as your personal savior.â we must confess that jesus is the son of god, but, as with faith and repentance, confession alone does not save. (matthew 7:21)
                            








                              you must be baptized
                            


                              acts 2:38
                            





 




                              having believed, repented, and confessed that jesus is the son of god, you must be baptized for the remission of your sins. (acts 2:38) it is at this point (and not before) that your sins are forgiven. (acts 22:16) it is impossible to proclaim the gospel of jesus christ without teaching the absolute necessity of baptism for salvation. (acts 8:35-36; romans 6:3-4; 1 peter 3:21) anyone who responds to the question in acts 2:37 with an answer that contradicts acts 2:38 is not proclaiming the gospel of jesus christ!
                            








                              you must be faithful unto death
                            


                              revelation 2:10
                            





 




                              once you are saved, god adds you to his church and writes your name in the book of life. (acts 2:47; philippians 4:3) to continue in godâs grace, you must continue to serve god faithfully until death. unless they remain faithful, those who are in godâs grace will fall from grace, and those whose names are in the book of life will have their names blotted out of that book. (revelation 2:10; revelation 3:5; galatians 5:4)
