                years. all of the animals are professional animal actors. we 
                are a fully licensed, insured, and usda approved 
                animal talent agency that provides domestic animals for film and

                for handling animals for everything from commercial and industrial 
                advertising including corporations like walmart,
petco, and petsmart, to music 
                videos for headlining mainstream groups like megadeth 
                and mtv projects, to animal planet 
                programs, documentaries, and film production companies like new
