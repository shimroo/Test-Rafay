and accessible in rhode islandin communities across the country, non-profit, public access sailing programs are making learning to sail and recreational boating affordable and accessible to ordinary folks.several years ago, it struck a group of local sailors that the people of rhode island should have access to a community boating program. organized and implemented entirely by volunteers, this visionary plan was set into action. the community boating center (cbc) at providence’s india point park opened in june 1994 with a small fleet of boats, a few docks and a boat storage shed built largely with donated materials and volunteer labor.today, our new boathouse, 60 boat plus fleet, and dedicated membership, positions cbc as an integral component to the success and growth of providence’s waterfront revival.founded as a non-profit 501(c)3 charitable organization, cbc offers a variety of opportunities that allow the general public to experience the thrill of sailing and paddling in upper narragansett bay.charity golf outingswing for scholarshipscharity golf outing to benefit community boating centerledgemont country clubseekonk, massachusettsnew spring datemonday, may 12, 2025thank you for helping us keep sailing affordable and accessible for all in rhode island!register/donate today!much more than a race!renaissance regatta, our signature fundraiser, is your opportunity to take part in celebrating all that cbc accomplishes every year.much more than a race, this fundraiser fosters a lifetime of youth learning. thanks to our supporters, cbc nurtures a sense of community in which the diversity of the urban environment is respected and encouraged. we need your help!cbc is an accredited us sailing community sailing centerus sailing’s community sailing accreditation program identifies those programs that are offering the highest level of boating education and public access. organizations that are recognized enjoy increased visibility as some of the best facilities in the country. additionally, us sailing accredited community sailing centers are invited to participate fully in the governing process that molds, shapes and improves the quality and reach of us sailing programs.
