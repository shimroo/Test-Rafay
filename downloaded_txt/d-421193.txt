ed weber's 1934 ford 3-window













welcome to 34 ford streetrods!
it is with a heavy heart that i announce the passing of this sites founder, tom coleman on march 30, 2022. since the mid-90’s tom and i ran this site as a testament to tom’s favorite car. originally started as a graphic design project, this site has stood as a testament to tom and our friendship over these many years. tom will be greatly missed by his family and friends. to see read tom’s obituary, please click this link.
this site is a dedicated resource for all things about the 1934 model year of ford automobiles. at the end of world war two, young men returning home began looking for project cars that they could modify and customize on the cheap. these early pioneers in the art of “hotrodding” or “streetrodding” took advantage of the value and availability of these 1934 fords and began to create a culture where looks were everything and going fast was a necessity… to those early streetrodders, we salute you. this site is dedicated to you!
