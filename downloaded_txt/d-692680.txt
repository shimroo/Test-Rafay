ceud mìle fàilte a h-uile duine!
these pages contain links and information on all (or most) things scottish - everything from history to politics and back again.
the main focus of these pages are my essays and articles on scottish history. these articles cover a variety of periods and topics. of particular interest are the pages on the wars of independence which will particularly aid students studying this period. all courtesy of a degree in scottish historical studies from edinburgh university.
if you need a book on scottish history, a comprehensive reading list is included with links to various online retailers where they're available for purchase. book reviews will also appear periodically.
best wishes
