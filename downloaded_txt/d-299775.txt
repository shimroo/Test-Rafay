reg sears rjs builders ltd























the market is expected to achieve a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 4.91% from 2022 to 2026, with significant contributions from both the residential and non-residential sectors. this growth is influenced by the government's 2050 carbon net zero target and the implementation of the future homes standard by 2025, which encourages the adoption of low-carbon heating solutions such as underfloor heating systems compatible with heat pumps​
