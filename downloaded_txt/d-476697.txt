dance & gymnastics classes in dublin ohio
get to know us better! check out our instructors.







moving...in the best interest of your child!






toddlers / preschoolers
we provide exciting classes allowing your child to freely express themselves through movement using their gift of imagination. students explore movement through creative storytelling, music, and props. toddlers take classes alongside loved ones to explore movement as soon as they can walk.






ballet
this timeless classical art form is accessible for dancers of all ages. we provide methodical, age-appropriate classes for beginners through the pre-professional track.








gymnastics & acro dance
ddc&g runs a non-competitive, recreational program including tumbling and floor exercises. acrobatics (or acro) technique is a popular choice for students bridging the gap between skills in the gym and the dance studio!






hip hop, jazz, & break dance
from the dynamic rhythmic movements of jazz to the balance and strength of break dance, these artforms incorporate and promote freedom of expression and exciting choreography with disciplined skills.
