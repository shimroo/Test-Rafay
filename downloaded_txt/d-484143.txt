this website is dedicated to those who 
		survived hurricane wilma and if you view the images, you'll see what we 
		all have been through. 
 
dec. 2008:
we have been back to quintana roo dozens 
		of times since wilma, and it's more beautiful than before the storm - a 
		lot nicer. it's still one of the best vacation spots in the world, and 
		the weather always seems to be perfect. there are many new hotels, and 
		the green is just beautiful. you wouldn't recognize the hotel zone 
		today, so much has changed. if you're even remotely thinking about going 
		back to cancun, playa del carmen, or tulum, don't think too long. 
just do it!
