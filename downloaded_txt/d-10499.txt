bloomsburg


it's what you envision college should be. your onward and upward await.








about bloomsburg
on the northern bank of the susquehanna river in northeastern pennsylvania, you'll find bloomsburg — a campus built on a hill rising above the only town in pa. here, you have plenty of places to find yourself or simply experience things from a different perspective. onward to a lower campus conveniently designed for you to live steps away from dining options, learning spaces, and an open academic quad anchored by an "insta worthy" fountain. then upward ... you'll find a scenic upper campus beautifully laid out for you to exercise, compete, and invoke that husky spirit giving us a distinct home-field advantage.

living in bloomsburg


more than 3,500 students call campus home, living among seven residence halls, three apartment complexes, and a sweet suite-style complex — all within steps of dining options, available recreation, and picturesque views. an added perk and unique value to the husky experience are our learning communities, where students with similar majors, interests, and life goals participate in a variety of programs and field trips, take a cluster of  classes together, and navigate their first year of college under the guidance of upperclass mentors. no matter where you come from — the city or a small town — you’ll find your niche here ... and your crew, your “bloom people.”

campus dining


face it, you got to eat. and we’ll deliver — not literally — but being ranked by niche as the #10 best college food in pennsylvania gives us the cred to do just that. it all starts with our flagship all-you-care-to-eat dining facility, the scranton commons. on upper campus? we got you covered at monty’s, a cafe-style spot with a view popular with our student-athletes but a nice change of pace for all. no time to sit and chat? then it’s to the husky lounge for overstuffed wraps, fresh bagels, and made-from-scratch soups. and when you’re really on the go, there’s always qdoba, subway, chick-fil-a, bento sushi, starbucks, and dunkin donuts. yes, we have both — dunkin and starbucks!

student life


at bloomsburg, we’re working to improve our lives — and at the same time — lift others up. we take charge and get to work. we get involved and get things done. it’s in our nature as huskies. the opportunities are here for the taking: volunteer on and off campus or join a club or two. we have 225-plus to choose from! have a new one in mind? you can even start your own. impact the community through the big event with the community government association or help run the biggest relay for life event in the area with colleges against cancer.
