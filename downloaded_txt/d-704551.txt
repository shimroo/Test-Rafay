“santa fe motel & inn is a wonderful place to stay! it was such a great value for all of the amenities offered like free parking, comfortable and quiet rooms, and a delicious hot breakfast in a cozy outdoor patio by the fire every morning. the best part was its proximity to the plaza. the staff was also very friendly and the check in/out process was easy. overall, it's a great place to stay and i highly recommend it!”

“the staff is caring, attentive, and very customer oriented. i love that the motel is eco friendly with tesla and ev chargers complimentary to guests and the elkay purified water dispenser located in the lobby made it super easy for me to refill my stanley quencher. i will be a repeat guest.”

“the santa fe motel & inn is all about the details. i loved the glass "purified water" bottle and all the exercise and stretch equipment for personal use in our room. the kitchenettes are equipped with cuisinart pans, dishes, condiments, a toaster, single-serve coffee machine, and a great selection of organic teas. we felt the love and care that goes into this place and we can't wait to return.”
