from the ovarian cancer action network~cancer trust fund legislation introduced





cancer trust fund legislation introducedin 2008, cancer will claim the lives of more than 559,000 americans and will cost our nation $206 billion in lost productivity, human capital, and increased direct medical costs. of all the cancers, ovarian is the deadliest gynecologic cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women. this year more than 22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 15,000 will die from the disease.one of the last bills to be introduced before the congressional recess was the cancer trust fund bill, a piece of legislation that aims to fully fund cancer initiatives through the federal government. by raising the tax on cigarettes, congress and cancer advocacy groups hope to accelerate the war on cancer, declared in 1971. since then the relative five year survival rate for ovarian cancer has increased from 38 percent to 45 percent, indicating that ovarian cancer needs more research, early detection and treatment. these issues, and others, are addressed in the cancer trust fund bill.introduced by mr. israel (d-ny) and mr. higgins (d-ny), the bill aims to augment the annual appropriations to fight cancer. mr. israel, a long time supporter of the fight against ovarian cancer says the bill is an important step in the fight against cancer. “cancer researchers have made great strides over the years and we need to continue that progress,” said rep. steve israel. “i’ve introduced legislation to create a cancer trust fund that will ensure cancer research funding continues when times are tight. i hope this legislation will help get us closer to a cure.”monies from the trust fund will be available for research on early detection, treatment, prevention and survivorship issues. further, the trust fund will support the breast and cervical cancer early detection and treatment program and the colorectal cancer early detection and treatment program. other areas funded by the program include clinical trials, care for the underserved, and cancer workforce programs.specifically, cancers with survival rates below 50 percent are to receive special emphasis in funding in order to raise survival rates through the discovery of early detection tools, treatments and prevention. “this is a wonderful way to focus on the deadliest cancers, like ovarian. we are delighted to support this legislation,” said dr. karen orloff kaplan, sc.d., chief executive officer of the ovarian cancer national alliance.the bill will raise the federal tax on small cigars from $1.828 per thousand to $50.00 per thousand; on large cigars the tax will go from 20.719 percent of the sale price but not more than $48.75 per thousand to 52.988 percent of the price for which the cigar is sold but not more than $3.00 per cigar. the federal tax on small cigarettes will increase from $19.50 per thousand to $50.00 per thousand, and the tax on large cigarettes will increase from $40.95 per thousand to $105.00 per thousand. taxes will also be increased for cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco and roll your own cigarettes. these taxes are projected to raise $35 billion over 5 years.the house bill is h.r. 6791.

ovarian cancer survivors group donates $25,000 to sbumc





ovarian cancer survivors group donates $25,000 to sbumc for gynecologic cancer research initiativesgift coincides with national ovarian cancer awareness monthstony brook, n.y., september 2, 2008 – long island oceans (ovarian cancer education advocacy network & support), an organization made up of gynecologic cancer survivors, donated $25,000 to stony brook university medical center to support research on the early detection and treatment of ovarian cancer and other gynecologic cancers. sbumc cancer researchers have received continued support from l.i. oceans, including a grant for $25,000 in 2006. ovarian cancer is the most deadly form of gynecologic cancer. according to the american cancer society, ovarian cancer claims the lives of more than 22,000 each year, and 15,000 women are diagnosed with the disease annually. the white house has declared september national ovarian cancer awareness month, and the gynecologic cancer foundation calls september national gynecologic cancer awareness month. "the search for better and more accurate diagnostics for early detection of gynecologic cancers, particularly for ovarian cancer, is central to our research," says michael l. pearl, m.d., director, division of gynecologic oncology at sbumc. "the grant from long island oceans will help further several research initiatives," adds dr. pearl, emphasizing that because symptoms of ovarian cancer often do not occur until the disease is advanced, many women are not diagnosed early enough to help control or cure disease. the goal of l.i. oceans is to create awareness among women regarding the early warning signs and symptoms of gynecologic cancers. the network provides support, resources, and education for women diagnosed with gynecologic cancers, as well as support for the advancement of disease research. l.i. oceans is promoting "teal tuesday," september 23, as national ovarian cancer awareness day. the organization is appealing for people to wear teal in honor of the thousands of lives who have been touched by the disease. the division of gynecologic oncology at sbumc is within the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive medicine. the division provides comprehensive examinations, diagnostic services, and treatment for women with all forms of gynecologic cancer. research is a major component of the division. patient services are provided at sbumc, the stony brook university cancer center outpatient facility, and at long island gynecologic oncologists, p.c., with offices in smithtown and mineola. caption: stony brook university medical center received $25,000 from l.i. oceans (ovarian cancer education advocacy network & support) for gynecologic cancer research. pictured from left: eileen tobin, oceans member; denise reilly, administrator, ambulatory cancer services, sbumc; theodore gabig, m.d., interim director, stony brook university cancer center; khrissy lupinacci, an oceans founding member; michael l. pearl, m.d., director, division of gynecologic oncology, sbumc; chris reynolds, oceans member; and marylou stewart, oceans founding member and supervisor, medical photography, sbumc. credit: jeanne neville, stony brook university media services******************************************************************************greg filianomedia relations manager, school of medicinestony brook university medical centerlevel 5, suite 9, rm. 429stony brook, ny 11794-7538631-444-9343gfiliano@notes.cc.sunysb.eduwww.stonybrook.edu/news

ovarian cancer: the facts





knowing the facts could save your life!ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers in the united states, and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among u.s. women. according to the american cancer society, it is estimated that 22,430 women will be diagnosed with this cancer in the u.s. in 2007, and about 15,280 women will die from the disease.a woman’s lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1 in 67; it is an insidious disease that often strikes without warning and without cause. the symptoms of ovarian cancer are often vague and subtle, making it difficult to diagnose.currently there is no effective means of early detection for the disease. as a result, ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed in advanced stages and only 50% of women survive longer than five years. today, only 25% of cases are diagnosed in the early stages, i.e., before the cancer has spread beyond the ovary to the pelvic region. however, if ovarian cancer is detected and treated early, the five-year survival rate is greater than 90%.until we have an effective way to detect ovarian cancer, we urge all women to become educated about the disease so she can act independently to protect her health.signs & symptoms of ovarian cancer------listen to your body. do not ignore symptoms.• vague but persistent and unexplained gastrointestinal complaints such as gas, nausea,and indigestion• abdominal bloating, pelvic and/or abdominal pain, and/or feeling of fullness• unexplained change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)• unexplained weight gain or loss• frequency and/or urgency of urination• unusual fatigue-ongoing • shortness of breath• new and unexplained abnormal postmenopausal vaginal bleeding recurrent unexplained back painwomen with ovarian cancer report that symptoms are persistent and represent a change from normal for their bodies. the frequency and/or number of such symptoms are key factors in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. several studies show that even early stage ovarian cancer can produce these symptoms.women who have these symptoms almost daily for more than a few weeks should see their doctor, preferably a gynecologist. prompt medical evaluation may lead to detection at the earliest possible stage of the disease. early stage diagnosis is associated with an improved prognosis.several diagnostic tests exist that can be used to detect ovarian cancer. the three most common tools are: vaginal-rectal pelvic examtransvaginal ultrasoundca-125 blood testbecause of the margin of error associated with each of the tests, they are most effective when used in combination with each other.other diagnostic tools include: transvaginal color flow dopplerct (or cat) scanlower gi series or barium enema (occasionally)all females are at risk, all ages.risk factors• increasing age, with highest occurrence in women over 50• family or personal history of ovarian, breast, endometrial, or colon cancer(only 10% of cases are linked to family history, however)• uninterrupted ovulation (having no pregnancies; infertility, low parity)• presence of brca1 or brca 2 gene mutationsprevention & risk reduction• use of oral contraceptives for more than five years can reduce your risk by approximately 50%• multiple pregnancies, having first full-term pregnancy before the age of 25• breast feeding• hysterectomy/tubal ligation substantially reduces risk• removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes (oopherectomy) dramatically reduces, but does not completely eliminate, risk of developing ovarian cancer.what do i do if i am concerned about my risk of ovarian cancer or have symptoms that persist and are unusual for me?• speak to your gynecologist for more information and have an examination. be sure to discuss the possibility of ovarian cancer with your doctor.how is ovarian cancer diagnosed?• the pap test is used to detect cervical cancer, not ovarian cancer.• a vaginal-rectal pelvic examination (also called a bimanual exam) – this exam allows the ovaries to be examined from many sides. every woman should undergo a rectal and vaginal pelvic examination at her annual check up with her gynecologist.• transvaginal ultrasound - this test uses sound waves to create a picture of the ovaries, and can often reveal if there are masses or irregularities on the surface of the ovaries. it cannot determine if you have cancer but it can show characteristics that give different levels of suspicion.• ca125 blood test - this test measures the level of a substance in the blood that may increase when a cancerous tumor is present; this protein is produced by ovarian cancer cells and is elevated in more than 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancers and 50% of those with early-stage cancers. because ca125 misses half of early cancers and can be elevated by benign conditions, the national cancer institute (nci) does not endorse using it to screen women at ordinary risk or in the general population.• it is very important to note that none of these tests are definitive when used on their own. they are most effective when used in combination with each other. the only way to confirm the presence of ovarian cancer suspected by the above tests is through a surgical biopsy of the tumor tissue.if tests suggest the possibility of ovarian cancer, seek referral to a gynecologic oncologist:• a gynecologic oncologist is a professional who specializes in treating women with reproductive tract cancers.• gynecologic oncologists are initially trained as obstetrician/gynecologists and then undergo three-four years of specialized education in all of the effective forms of treatment for gynecologic cancers (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and experimental treatments) as well as the biology and pathology of gynecologic cancers.why is it so important to be treated by a gynecologic oncologist?the importance of being treated by a gynecologic oncologist cannot be stressed enough. according to numerous medical studies, there are significant survival advantages for those women who are treated, managed, and operated on by a gynecologic oncologist.• gynecologic oncologists are 5 times more likely to completely remove ovariantumors during surgery• 80% of ovarian cancer patients receive inadequate surgical debulking and stagingfrom non-gynecologic oncologist surgeons• survival rate and outcomes vastly improve with gynecologic oncologiststoday, most women are diagnosed when chance of survival for five years is about 25%. early detection can improve the survival rate to over 90%!the only cure for ovarian cancer is early detection.

running for charities





recently, arrow exterminating copresident jackie grabin and race director rosemary camilleri of the greater long island running club presented checks to two long island charities. the checks, totaling $3,000, came from the proceeds of the arrow exterminating company long island women’s run, which was sponsored by arrow exterminating company and staged by the greater long island running club (glirc) under the direction of ms. camilleri. representatives from both the long island oceans (the long island ovarian cancer education advocacy network & support group) and the patchogue-based thursday’s child, which provides housing assistance, financial help and other services to long island people living with hiv/aids, expressed their gratification for the generous donations.glirc, the largest and most active running club in both long island counties, and arrow exterminating, long island’s largest pest control organization and coincidentally, a business managed by women, joined efforts and utilized this women’s-only running event as a fundraiser for two very worthwhile charities.“we were thrilled to be able to partner with such a responsible and community-minded long island-based business as arrow exterminating, as they celebrate their 60th year of serving the people of long island,” observed glirc race director rosemary camilleri, who is also the director of personnel, sayville school district. “more to the point, we were pleased to be able to work with arrow exterminating to promote running and fitness for long island’s women at the same time as we were able to support two very important long island-based charities.”photo captions:(l to r) angel donnelly, esther bivona, and sabina steiner of long island oceans receive a donation from jackie grabin, copresident of arrow exterminating, and rosemary camilleri of the greater long island running club.

li oceans inc

a beacon of hope for those affected by ovarian cancer & gynecologic cancersabout us:li oceans is an acronym for long island ovarian cancer education advocacy network & support. our group is comprised of women living with ovarian & gynecological cancers, from the newly diagnosed to the long-term survivor.in 2004, several women personally affected by ovarian cancer met, exchanged ideas, shared stories, identified the need for change, merged ultimate values and priorities and then made a decision that would transform lives.they didn't know where they would find the time, the energy, nor the money to create an organization for women with ovarian & gynecologic cancers, but they forged ahead nevertheless, with hope as their guiding light. they knew that without their understanding, passion and strength that other women with ovarian cancer would continue to suffer in isolation.li oceans recognized the urgent need for awareness; advocacy and action-they aspired to be the voice for ovarian cancer and save the precious lives of our mothers, sisters, daughters, grandmothers, friends & neighbors!our goal is to create awareness among women the medical community and the greater population regarding early warning signs and symptoms that may be indicative of ovarian cancer, resulting in earlier detection.our purpose is to provide support, resources, networking, and education for those women diagnosed with ovarian and gynecologic cancers. we support the advancement of research for early detection and cure of ovarian cancer.our mission is to educate, advocates with the ultimate hope to eradicate this deadly disease!li oceans is a 501(c)(3) non-profit approved by the irs. your tax-deductible contributions allow us to continue our battle against ovarian cancer, to raise awareness in the community and to provide education and support to ovarian cancer victims and their families through a network of survivors.how can i help? we are always in need of volunteers!we need people just like you! please help get the word out!we need you! tell someone you love about ovarian cancer and the symptoms to watch. when you care, keeping quiet is not an option. until there’s a test, word of mouth is best.together we can save lives.volunteer your time and talents to get the word out.li oceans inc greatly appreciates the support from our friends who host fundraising events on the li oceans behalf.if you would like to host an event to benefit the li oceans here are a few ideas:wingo / bingo nightrubber duck racehouse party/ tea party or picnicwalking/running eventnight at the raceshiking or biking eventhealth and wellness day at your local workout clubgame night - trivia night- poker party-name that tunekaraoke yard sale- plant sale- bake salewine tasting -wine and cheese eveningfashion showmurder mystery-50’s,60’s,70’s dancehost a teal awareness daygolf tournament -tennis tournamentseptember is national ovarian cancer awareness month.







ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers

what you need to know:






ovarian cancer product guide


http://www.thegcf.org/pubs/product_guide.pdf




family history. if your mother, sister, or daughter gets ovarian cancer, your chances are doubled.



having had breast cancer.getting breast cancer while younger than 50 increases a woman's risk of ovarian cancer.



ovarian cancer risk factors

potential risk factors:

genetic predisposition- presence of brca1 or brca 2 gene mutations.

personal or family history of breast, ovarian or colon cancer.

increasing age; with highest occurrence in women over 50, however; females of all ages are at risk.

uninterrupted ovulation (having no pregnancies; infertility, low parity).

speak with your gynecologist have an annual recto vaginal pelvic exam.









what you should know.....knowing the facts could save your life.

what you need to know may save your life or the life of a loved one.

a pap test does not detect ovarian cancer
ovarian cancer can be treated if detected early.
ovarian cancer may be difficult to diagnose because symptoms are easily confused with other diseases, often mimicking less fatal illnesses. symptoms do exist and can be extremely vague, yet increase over time.



pathophysiology:

the cause of ovarian cancer is not known.

however, there is a connection between the number of ovulatory events and the risk of ovarian cancer appears to exist. ovulation suppression has been shown to decrease cancer incidence.

ovarian cancer typically spreads to the peritoneal surfaces and omentum.

only an estimated 10% of affected patients have a genetic predisposition. the patients at highest risk are women with site-specific inheritance. in these patients, ovarian cancer develops early, when they are aged 30-50 years.



about ovarian cancer

ovarian cancer occurs when cells undergo a transformation and begin to grow and multiply without normal controls. as the cells grow and multiply, they form masses called tumors. cancer is dangerous because it overwhelms healthy cells by taking their space and the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive and function.

ovarian cancer occurs when a tumor forms in one or both of a woman's ovaries. the ovaries are a pair of small organs that produce and release ova, or human eggs. the ovaries also produce important hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. they are located in the lower abdomen (pelvis), on either side of the womb (uterus). ova released by the ovaries travel through the fallopian tubes to the uterus, where they may or may not be fertilized by the male sperm.

cancerous tumors are malignant. this means they spread to other tissues and organs. not all tumors, however, are malignant.

in a process called metastasis malignant tumors may encroach on and invade neighboring organs or lymph nodes, or they may enter the bloodstream and spread to remote organs such as the liver or lungs. metastatic tumors are the most aggressive and serious of all tumors.

the type of cell that originated the abnormal growth determines the class of the ovarian tumors.

epithelial tumors: these tumors arise from a layer of cells that surrounds the outside of the ovary called the germinal epithelium. about 70-80% of all ovarian cancers are epithelial.

these are most common in women who have been through menopause (aged 45-70 years).

stromal tumors: stromal tumors develop from connective-tissue cells that help form the structure of the ovary and produce hormones. usually, only one ovary is involved. these account for 5-10% of ovarian cancers. these tumors typically occur in women aged 40-60 years. often, surgical removal of the tumor is the only treatment needed. if the tumor has spread, though, the woman needs chemotherapy.

germ cell tumors :tumors that arise from germ cells (cells that produce the egg) account for about 15% of all ovarian cancers. these tumors develop most often in young women (including teenaged girls). although 90% of women with this type of cancer are successfully treated, many become permanently infertile.

metastatic tumors: only 5% of ovarian cancers have spread from other sites. the most common sites from which they spread are the colon (52%), breast (17%), stomach (10%), and pancreas (5%).

within these main classes are many different subtypes of tumors.

noncancerous (benign) ovarian masses include abscesses or infections, fibroids, cysts, polycystic ovaries, endometriosis-related masses, ectopic pregnancies, and others.

of markedly enlarged ovarian masses (>4 cm) found in women who are still menstruating (have not been through menopause), about 20% are cancerous.

of markedly enlarged masses found in women who have been through menopause, about 45-50% are cancerous.

the incidence of ovarian cancer varies greatly. globally, scandinavia, israel, and north america have the highest rates.


developing countries and japan have the lowest rates.

at least 15,000 women die each year from ovarian cancer.

the 5-year survival rate is greater than 75% if diagnosis of the cancer occurs before it has spread to other organs. however, the 5-year survival rate drops to 20% when the tumor has spread to the upper abdomen.

in the united states about 1 in 56 women develops cancer of the ovary. more than 26,000 new cases are diagnosed each year

the risk of developing the disease increases with age, ocurring in women 50 years or older.
ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women in the united states, and the second most common gynecologic cancer.
ovarian cancer can develop at any age, all females are at risk.
more than half the cases are among women who are aged 65 years and older.
industrialized countries have the highest incidence of ovarian cancer.
having children or taking the birth control pill seems to decrease the risk.
due to poor early detection, the death rate for ovarian cancer is higher than for that of any other cancer among women
caucasian women, especially of ashkenazi jewish descent, are at somewhat higher risk
african-american and asian women are at a slightly lower risk.
75% of cases that, when diagnosed, are already in a late stage.
22,430 estimated new cases of ovarian cancer in the us for 2007
15,280 women expected to be killed by ovarian cancer this year (2007) in the us. according to the nci.

what is li oceans

li oceans is an acronym for long island ovarian cancer education advocacy network & support. our group is comprised of women living with ovarian & gynecological cancers, from the newly diagnosed to the long-term survivor.



about us

about us:

in 2004, several women personally affected by ovarian cancer met, exchanged ideas, shared stories, identified the need for change, merged ultimate values and priorities and then made a decision that would transform lives.

they didn't know where they would find the time, the energy, nor the money to create an organization for women with ovarian & gynecologic cancers, but they forged ahead nevertheless, with hope as their guiding light.

they knew that without their understanding, passion and strength that other women with ovarian cancer would continue to suffer in isolation.

detecting ovarian cancer

to date there is not a reliable test to detect ovarian cancer.

however, you can:

see your doctor and have an annual vaginal-rectal pelvic examination .

if you have symptoms, ask your doctor for a transvaginal ultrasound and a ca 125 blood test.  

if you suspect you have ovarian cancer, consult a
gynecologic oncologist.

to locate a gynecologic oncologist in your area
