welcome to thesociety for human ecology















ecology, politics, and justice:working towards the pluriverse june 18–21, 2025 | university of mons | mons, belgiumjoin a diverse international and interdisciplinary gathering. contribute to a wide range of formal and informal exchanges in a relaxed atmosphere. enjoy the café-lined streets of a charming university town.call for abstractspour lire ces informations en français, cliquez icithe program for she-xxvi is well under way. many thanks to everyone who responded to the initial call for preliminary program contributions. additional contributions are encouraged up to the final deadline of february 10, 2025.like previous she meetings, it is intended to bring together a diverse group of educators, researchers and practitioners who utilize, or are interested in, interdisciplinary and ecological approaches. we look forward to a diverse and exciting program with an excellent range of speakers, symposia, roundtables, and individual presentations. as the submission deadline approaches, it is important that the conference planning committee has all symposia materials, abstracts, presentation titles, and authors’ information in hand.note: if you have already responded to a previous she-xxvi announcement, you may ignore this and forthcoming general announcements. your information has been placed on the program committee’s ‘active file,’ and you will be contacted directly by mihnea tănăsescu, she-xxvi conference chair.













abstract submission (closed)abstract preparation for contributed papers should include: the full title of the paper and name(s), institutional affiliation(s) and email address(es) of the registered presenter(s). similar information should be submitted for poster presentations. those proposing organized sessions/symposia should likewise provide information for all presenters in their session, but at this point we only need an abstract for the symposium itself, not individual papers within it. abstracts may be submitted in french or english.to submit an abstract for an individual presentation or roundtable, click here.to submit an abstract for a thematic symposium / organized session (four presenters), click here.the deadline to submit is february 10, 2025. early submissions help the conference committee identify emerging themes and design the program. thus, we encourage early symposia / paper / poster submissions and "draft" abstracts as soon as is possible—keeping in mind revisions are always accepted up to the deadline.

            conference topics
          










she meetings rely heavily on the suggestions and contributions of participants. our aim is to make this event as broadly interdisciplinary as possible, bridging science, social science, and policy perspectives with literature, humanities, and creative arts. contributions from all areas of human ecology—theory, education, research, and practice—are welcomed. examples of recent she conference sub-themes include, but are not limited to:sustainability issuesteaching human ecologyenvironmental designconservation psychologyfood systems / food securityliterature and ecologywater-use policyhuman-animal interactionscollaborative planningurban ecologyclimate changeenvironmental artshistorical ecologyeco-spiritualityenvironmental healthtraditional ecological knowledgepolitical ecology








            forms of participation
          










see abstract submission guidelines above.thematic symposium: these organized sessions should fill a 1 and 1⁄2  hour block and involve up to 4 speakers. session organizers are invited to propose a theme or set of papers that expand on one of the conference themes noted above; other session topics are also welcome. the organizer is responsible for the coordination of participants. at this point, only provide session summary information and the names of your intended sessions speakers. abstracts for the individual speaker’s papers are not yet needed.individual paper presentation: contributed papers will be grouped on similar issues with time allotted for delivery and follow-up discussion, in a format similar to a symposium session (e.g., 4 papers per 1 1⁄2 hour time block). only a working title and the name and institution of presenters is needed now.roundtable discussion groups: these groups are arranged by the conference committee to encourage exchange of ideas among participants. usually, one or two discussion leaders are designated and 6 - 10 participants are assigned to a thematic roundtable. if you would like to be placed on a roundtable discussion group, please reply with your areas of expertise/interest.poster: space and time will be provided for poster style presentations. submissions for posters follow the same guidelines as a contributed paper, (e.g. author, title and abstract). but only the presenter’s name and tentative title are needed at this time.ignite (pechakucha style) presentations: time slots will be available for ignite presentations. these are rapid-fire, visually rich, powerpoint presentations, in which 20 slides are set to advance every 15 seconds for a presentation of exactly five minutes. ignite sessions will involve up to 10 presentations in an hour-and-a-half session and so feature about half an hour of audience discussion. these sessions are particularly suited to student project reporting but are also open to others. however, if you are also intending to give a full paper presentation you need to make that clear when you submit your proposal as there may not be room in the conference schedule for you to do both.
