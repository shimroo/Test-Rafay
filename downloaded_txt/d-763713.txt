watch videowelcome to a western vacation second to none
for over 90 years this 700 acre family guest ranch has provided folks from around the world with authentic western ranch vacations. nestled in its own private mountain valley in granby, colorado, drowsy water ranch promises the opportunity to disconnect from your daily hustle and bustle, and reconnect with family and friends under the backdrop of big mountains and starry skies. under the same ownership/management since 1977, the fosha’s have developed a world-renowned reputation for unpretentious quality. we warmly welcome you to experience the true spirit of the west at our colorado dude ranch all-inclusive vacation.
the ranch
cabins
our guest rooms easily accommodate singles, couples, small families and large families. one of our guests was caught saying, “our accommodations were so cozy, i almost hoped it would rain so that i could have an excuse to stay indoors.”
horses
at drowsy water guest ranch we have a very special relationship with our 100 or more horses. we’ve bred, raised and trained them to provide our dude ranch guests with the finest of riding opportunities in colorado.
meals
most meals are served family style in our dining room but outdoor meals are highlights. breakfast on a mountain top. open hearth barbecue. chuckwagon lunches. sometimes, right out of your saddlebag. each day is different.
staff
our guest ranch staff has been hand-picked for their friendliness, personality, talent and a sincere desire to please. they participate in all activities and create much of our entertainment.
kids program
fun for all ages! as one of the only dude ranches that accepts guest under 5, drowsy water is proud to offer an all inclusive experience for parents and kids alike. our staff is trained and certified to offer childcare while you hit the trail, or just take some time to relax at your cabin. additionally, our rangerider program, for kids 6 through 13, is built around an instruction based horseback riding program where they practice skills in our arena before setting out to the backcountry on their morning and afternoon trail rides.

ranch raves

“my husband and i traveled with our 4 kids in mid-july and were just so impressed with every aspect of the week. it’s clear the fosha family has used their years of experience to design a week that is just so enjoyable and interesting (the amount of returning guests was particularly impressive), thinking of all the details so you don’t have to.”
missouri mom
“third time visitors at drowsy water ranch and yet another amazing horseback holiday! everything from arrival to departure was absolutely perfect; great horses and amazing trail rides, superb food, evening activities etc etc. we got to meet a lot of nice people, both staff and guests, that illuminated our week even more. the drowsy water ranch holidays 2019 booked and we are already dreaming of them!”
eva j.
“my kids have never been so engaged in every moment of a vacation as they were with this one.”
indiana mom
“never…ever…disappoints.
“my family just finished our 4th trip to the ranch, and have already scheduled our 5th. the fosha family is as welcoming a host as you’ll find and we consider them our friends. still the only truly unplugged, regenerating, and relaxing vacation we have ever been on. don’t get me wrong, they keep you active, but you find yourself building new relationships (with horse and fellow guests) while seemingly forgetting about the real world at home!”
brian c.
“first time visit to dwr was over 30 years ago!!!
“the beauty of the ranch and the surrounding area is breathtaking. there’s a lovely creek that runs right through the ranch. and the accommodations and ranch buildings are all very well-maintained.
“and the horses!! they love and respect their horses, and all of their animals. thank you dwr!! we’ll be back!!”
san diego grandmother
“i was a little nervous about even getting on a horse, let alone planning each day around trail rides, but i wasted my time worrying. i loved the family activities, the scenery, the rafting trip, the food, the square dancing, and especially the daily trail rides on my horse. our whole family was in agreement; the kids asked to pleeease go back next year.”
road-tripper mom
“the fosha family is precious and makes you feel a part of the ranch and their family! my family did an all day ride and marissa was our wrangler. she is hilarious and kept us entertained but was super careful with our two kids…ian was also a very talented wrangler…thanks logan for entertaining the kids…ryan fosha explaining how to cow pen using his cowboy power point was pretty funny, too!…the staff was unbelievable from the wait staff to the housekeeping (hank ha!).”
kelly k.
“we’ve been vacationing at this ranch for a number of years now and we’ve never been disappointed…as matter of fact it gets better every year! the fosha family take great care of their guest…and horses. 🙂 i should point out that one of our wranglers this year (ian) was awesome! highly recommend this vacation spot…a true gem!”
j.c.
“none of us had much horseback riding experience but the wranglers were excellent at instructing us. our horses were all well suited to our personalities and ability level. the choice of half-day or full-day rides was perfect so that we could choose how long we wanted to be out riding. riding our horses to breakfast one morning was a trip highlight…it was a perfect trip for our family to create memories and the kids loved it.”
chicago mom
“spent a week at the “adults only” week in september. we had not ridden in years, with just “vacation only” experience.
“no need to be wary, intimidated, or worried we would be merely walking our horse in a straight line throughout the week. the wranglers teach you pretty quickly and by the end our stay, we were loping along with the best of them. after two days, are thighs were “welted” from our inexperience and the river raft trip was a fun reprieve for the day…
“so glad we selected drowsy water.”
