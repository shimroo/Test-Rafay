you have the devils eyes (isbn: 9781707930630)
a new book by producer/author christopher saint booth​ based on the booth brothers documentary films, the possessed and the exorcist file

i never knew for sure if i had brought something home with me or not. did i pick up a dark hitchhiker that night of the exorcist house investigation or was i just being para-noid? it was always in the back of my mind as i had heard many stories of spirit possessions. there are many forms, but dark beings or nea (negative energy attachments) are the worst. they are more dangerous than any haunted location as you yourself can become haunted. whether through satanic ritual, use of an ouija board or simply playing with the dark side, you need to protect yourself. in this book we interview children and investigate locations said to be possessed. what we found out will shock you. these true paranormal case files might just reveal if ‘you have the devil’s eyes’.

you have the devils eyes (isbn: 9781707930630)
a new book by producer/author christopher saint booth​ based on the booth brothers documentary films, the possessed and the exorcist file.

the possessed based on america's first documented possession in 1870. a chilling story of a 13-year-old girl from the small town of watseka, illinois. who became possessed by spirits of the insane dead.

the exorcist file. while filming a haunted asylum in st. louis, missouri, filmmakers uncover a diary of the infamous1949 exorcism involving a 13 year old boy possessed by the devil.  this is the true paranormal case file behind the movie and book the exorcist.
