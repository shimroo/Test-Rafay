statement in support of khaled sabsabi








the unsw school of art & design deeply regrets the decision taken by the board of creative australia to cancel the artistic team chosen for the 2026 venice biennale. we stand by our alumnus khaled sabsabi and note that the board has found his work to be reflective of “the diversity and plurality of australia’s rich culture, and will spark meaningful conversations with audiences around the world.” (creative australia’s ceo adrian collette). this remains the case regardless of the political considerations behind this decision.
in the aftermath of this decision, we think it is important to remind everyone that khaled is a community minded artist who has worked in detention centres, schools, prisons, refugee camps, hospitals and youth centres in australia and overseas and has produced many thousands of images in his 35 year career. this vast body of work has been eclipsed in recent media coverage by an obsessive focus on just one or two of these images.
we wish the board all the very best in managing the current political sensitivities now intruding on their decision making such that ‘risk management’ appears to be taking priority over the board’s stated values which include: ‘diversity: embracing difference’ and ‘leadership: advocate and empower’.
