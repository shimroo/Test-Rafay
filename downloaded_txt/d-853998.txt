testimonials







i was shocked and amazed at the same time. my hyperactive son stopped screaming and was lying on the sofa, sleeping. the things that john told me about his studies on brain activity and the influence of his meditation music are now a fascinating subject to me. it really works. my hyperactive son stopped screaming and was lying on the sofa, sleeping.


 
tracey nicholls - hyperactive children






after being on sleeping pills for eight years, i managed to free myself from them just by listening to your meditation music. i have a bipolar disorder, which some also call âsleep disorderâ, since it invariably affects the sleep of the patient. i was given your relaxing music as a present and at first was reluctant to believe that it would do me a lot of good, however it transpired that it was a most welcome, great surprise that your meditation music was so effective.

right from the outset, i wasn’t disappointed with john’s music and it started to work almost immediately. my anxiety symptoms including periods of short, rapid breathing began to return to normal. people should be aware that they can find simple, inexpensive solutions to their problems such as this meditation music.
