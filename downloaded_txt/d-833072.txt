the 2025 penguin schedule will be open for registration on or before january 15th what's in store for next season?  we are excited about seeing everyone on track next season, bringing you events at venues from loudon all the way to daytona.  we've been working hard in the off season to offer you even more tools to bring your riding to the next level with specially designed curriculum, riding development tools and exercises that will increase your confidence and drop your lap times.  we love this sport for many reasons, but especially for the fact that after 52 years of coaching we're still learning.  we're can't wait to see you out there and share in your motorcycle riding journey!!
