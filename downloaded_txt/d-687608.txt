by: pete kendall, june 13, 2008


you will 
                          find the last sociotimes entry at the top of the 
                          column on the right, and the rest by visiting the 
                          archive which is listed above.  thanks again for the 
                          news items and insights many of you have submitted over 
                          the years. 
to keep getting the latest socionomic updates:

2.  join 
                          the mailing list by clicking 
                          here. these occasional e-mails will help you stay 
                          up to speed on the major developments in socionomics.

i vote for continuing socio times.  i also have been greatly missing the articles that poke fun at these events.  i for one have greatly enjoyed and benefited from socionomics as well as ewff and ewt.  much thanks for your help.

i have been very pleased and informed by your sociotimes articles.  living out of the us i miss much of the "news" and i will really miss these timely discussions of the headlines. however i am glad some of them will be noted in the theorist.

the fact that people make deals (obligations) and are willing to walk away from them, and then say they are only hurting "their credit" is a sign of how far we have fallen.
