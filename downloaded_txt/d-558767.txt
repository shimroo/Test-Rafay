prodigy crowned most influential dance act

the prodigy have been crowned the most influential act of their genre in a new poll. 

the band, who have been blending rock with techno and drum and bass to create their unique sound for two decades, topped the survey by inspiring dance lovers with hits including firestarter and voodoo people. 

officials from the globalgathering festival - now in its tenth year - commissioned the research to find out which artist has shaped the dance genre the most. 

a spokesman said the prodigy, who have had more than 20 million worldwide record sales, had to beat off stiff competition from french electronic duo daft punk. 

globalgathering festival organiser james algate said: "dance music is constantly evolving but it's great to see the prodigy getting the recognition they so richly deserve." 

the band received 29 per cent of the vote from the poll, which questioned 2,000 festival and club goers. 

daft punk came in second place and faithless were in third place with 11 per cent. other acts in the top 10 include fatboy slim, the chemical brothers and carl cox. 

the electronic dance festival sees around 50,000 music lovers descend on stratford-upon-avon, warwickshire, each year. faithless and dizzee rascal are set to headline this year's event on july 30 and 31.
