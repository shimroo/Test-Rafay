tiah editor says we'd like to move you off the blog, if you're browsing the archives - and most people are - more than half of them are already on the new site. we need to be sure the new web site accomodates your archive browsing needs because we don't want to lose any readers. please supply any feedback or comments by email to the editor and please note the blogger site is shutting on december 1st.
