aluminum trailers since 1963

                    in 1963, alcoa aluminum sponsored a cbs television show called "the celebrity game show" and featured, in one of its ads, trailex aluminum boat trailers. back then, aluminum wasn't well known except for producing foil wrap.
                

                    over 50 years later, trailex makes many more products than just boat trailers. star extruded shapes, trailex's parent company, produces the raw extrusion for the trailers, letting us make fast changes, get product on time and maintain quality. all trailex products are made by hand, and proudly made in ohio.
