our company operates with great care and respect, without interfering with lifecycles of the creatures we observe. we strive to minimize our own environmental impact on the area we operate in, treading as lightly as possible and being proactive in supporting programs that will help the whales and wildlife we encounter.
“in the end we will conserve only what we love. we will love only what we understand. we will understand only what we are taught.”
baba dioum, senegalese environmentalist

whale watching in the san juan islands


adventure awaits you in the beautiful san juan islands, just 90 miles north of seattle. join western prince whale watching & wildlife tours on an intimate sized tour departing from friday harbor as we explore the protected waters north of seattle and discover the islands’ abundant wildlife and spectacular beauty. we are ideally located in the heart of the salish sea with premier access to an incredibly diverse ecosystem.
all tours are guided by highly experienced naturalists and captains, offering insightful information about the whales, wildlife and islands we encounter and explore! orcas (killer whales) are usually the main focus, and you can expect to see them on the vast majority of our tours from about march to october, and to a lesser degree the rest of the year. we also regularly encounter beautiful humpback whales (through november) and minke whales in the area.
our departure location in friday harbor (and fast boat) help ensure that our sightings are as high as, or higher than, any operator in the greater seattle area! and, don’t forget the other wonderful wildlife: porpoises, harbor seals, bald eagles, steller sea lions, and many interesting sea birds.


with over 30 years experience, we are the longest operating whale watch company in the san juan islands, and with that experience we make every one of our tours a unique adventure! we have never been the biggest, nor do we strive to be. as an owner operated company, we take pride in providing a quality tour with a personal touch.
our passionate crew is committed to providing the best whale watching experience in the area, making each tour an unforgettable adventure! customer satisfaction is our primary goal. in the rare occasion that we don’t see a whale (orca, humpback, minke, gray, etc.) on your tour we still provide the best tour possible and happily invite you to come back out with us again for free until we are able to share a whale encounter with you.
dedicated and responsible: as an active member of the pacific whale watch association, we’re dedicated to research, education and responsible wildlife and whale watching.
















whale watching in the san juan islands! our experienced, passionate team of captains and naturalists love to share their vast knowledge of whales, wildlife, and their beautiful pacific northwest home.
