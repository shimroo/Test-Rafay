news



research & development 
testfabrics, inc. exists to "satisfy a need".  that initial 'need’ in the mid 1930’s was to provide necessary and  consistent textile test materials to the chemists working in the  laboratories of the manufacturers and suppliers of the dyes and  auxiliary chemicals used in the wet processing of textiles. satisfying  this need with "research & development" continues to be the basis of our business function today and  allows us to service similar and related ‘needs’ for other clients  requiring special attention to be paid to their ‘textile needs’.
