we’re passing the mic to four members of wolfpack nation who have played an integral role in chancellor woodson’s nc state career. 🎙️ the chancellor is set to retire this year after a decade and a half of service to nc state. we’re wrapping up woodson’s time as the host of red chair chats with an extended episode — and this time, he’s answering the questions. “because i’ve announced my retirement, everybody that i see says, ‘what will you miss?’ and honestly, it’s the interactions with everybody that’s here,” chancellor woodson said. “this is a special place, and it’s a special place because people love it.”🎥🎧 find episode 12 of red chair chats on youtube, spotify or apple podcasts at the link in our bio.

what started as a dare between students has grown into nc state’s sweetest tradition. 🍩🏃‍♂️💨this weekend, thousands raced in the 21st annual @krispykremechallenge — a quest of guts, glory and glaze. runners dash two and a half miles from the belltower to krispy kreme, eat 12 doughnuts and then finish with another two-and-a-half mile run back to campus. all in one hour. since its inception, the nationally recognized race has raised more than $2 million for @uncchildrens. 👏
