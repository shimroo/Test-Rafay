customer service update 
yukon energy is currently experiencing billing delays and a higher-than-usual call volume. 

for billing-related questions, you can reach our customer service team at (867) 993-5565 or email us at billing@yec.yk.ca, and we'll get back to you within 2-3 business days. please leave a voicemail if we miss your call to help us assist you as quickly as possible. 

please note: do not call the emergency or power outage line for billing inquiries, as it clogs the line dedicated to emergencies. the team on that line does not have access to customer billing accounts and will not be able to assist you.

we appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.

aishihik generating station update - jan 17
one of the three generators at the aishihik generating station remains offline as we continue repairs. contractors are on-site and work is progressing. at this time, we expect the generator to be back online this spring, however this could change depending on weather and equipment delivery.



pictured: the removal of 108 old stator coils that will be replaced.
