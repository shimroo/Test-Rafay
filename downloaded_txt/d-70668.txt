								christmas market tours 2024 & 2025


christmas market tours and the world-famous christmas market river cruises will once again become available in 2024 and 2025. every year, eager travelers reserve space on europe christmas market tours to experience the yuletide season at its best. now you can on any of our 2024 and 2025 christmas market tours.
europe christmas market tours remain an incredibly affordable way to travel, mostly due to the off-peak nature of the season. christmas market tours and christmas market river cruises take you through popular central european destinations like austria, france, and germany.dating back to the 15th century, christmas markets in europe have provided locals and visitors with festive scenes, including christmas light shows, concerts, hot apple cider, mulled wine, and beautifully decorated trees that rival the giant spruce at rockefeller center! central europe hosts many traditional markets, with various ways to experience them, such as christmas market tours and christmas market river cruises.
the difference between christmas market tours and cruises
the main difference between a dedicated christmas market tour and a christmas market river cruise is that you only have to unpack once on a cruise. historically, rivers were the highways of europe, with major city centers situated right along the banks. for example, beautiful prague has hugged the vltava river for over ten centuries, with the river area now home to over 1 million residents. multi-city bus tours that feature prague also normally visit vienna and budapest. while the overland distance between these cities is around 200 miles, tours usually include stops in charming towns like bratislava to break up the longer drives. river cruises allow you to wake up to new destinations each day while enjoying views of castles and sites along the passing river banks. both tour and cruise options may also offer activities like biking along trails near the floating vessels.
what makes christmas market tours so special?

during the four sundays preceding christmas (advent), christkindlmarkts fill the streets of  many cities and villages bringing christmas to life.

getting to see and experience a christmas market in europe by itself is most definitely a bucket list item.

having the chance to purchase unusual holiday ornaments not easily found in the states is also a treat.

experiencing warm gluhwein while wandering through central europe christmas market during a cold winter's night is a highlight.

iceskating in rockefeller center is a wonderful experience; however, iceskating in the middle of a five hundred year old christmas market is entirely something else.

discovering hot chimney cakes, spatzle, and lebkuchen can transform your experience into something amazing!


but where should you begin when trying to figure out the best christmas markets in europe?
the best christmas  markets in europe
that's easy! the best christmas markets in europe are all of the above, because they're all wonderful! it all depends on if you prefer taking a christmas market tour or christmas market river cruise.

brenda was on the ball because she realized i had booked my departure incorrectly and was flying into the wrong airport for the tour. she called me at home and i was able to correct it with the airline at no additional cost to me. i was very thankful !

good service and sandi was very helpful. clients need all details as normally they are far away from your office and with the time difference of 10-12 hours it is the prompt reply with all details makes the difference between good and bad service.

we cannot begin to say what an excellent job that our travel agent, cheryl has always done for us, she consistently does an outstanding job. we are not seasoned travelers and she has always been very patient with us. when we inquire about anything her response is both rapid and fitting. if we were to able to travel more she would be our first choice to utilize due to her fine attitude and talent.
