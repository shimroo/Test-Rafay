lisa marie trotman
medical assistant
after graduation, i continued to work with the physician i was paired with during my internship. this opportunity provided me with much more knowledge so that it was not just an internship anymore. she became my mentor. i am now a senior patient care coordinator in the otolaryngology department at weill cornell medical college. i plan to continue my education within the university to advance my career. with the help and support of my family and the allen school, i have a lot to be thankful for. thank you.



natasha grant
nursing assistant
my future plan is to advance in the medical field to become a rn. i would like to give a big thank you to the allen school of health sciences (especially miss. gabriella) for helping me start my career journey. it wasn’t easy making sure assignments were done timely in addition to dealing with life challenges, but my hard work paid off.  continue to encourage students who may not be financially stable to start their career paths. the allen school has the best instructors and management team to help you on your path to success. i am proud to be an allen school of sciences graduate. i did it. you can too.  best instructors (miss townsend, mr. kundu, dr. almari, mrs. brooks, and miss bowlers)



vanita harnandan
medical assistant
when i first enrolled for the medical assistant program, i had a 3-month-old baby. the day after my enrollment, i found out i was expecting again. i was ready to drop the program without even giving it a try. my husband told me that being a mom didn’t mean i had to quit my studies. i am now a graduate. my message to incoming students is:  don’t give up without trying. you never know what you are capable of doing unless you try.
