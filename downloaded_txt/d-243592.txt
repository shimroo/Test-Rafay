commercial spaces – advertisements. a commercial space, such as an office building, healthcare center, or hotel, can host a shoot. a hotel's rooms, reception area, and gym can be different photography settings.


restaurants – food editorials. a restaurant is one of the top event settings, but it can also become a creative backdrop. it is also an ideal photography setting, mostly for food editorials. giggster has coffee cafes, rooftop bars, diners, and other choices. 


homes – engagement photos. a house has indoor and outdoor spaces for various photography projects; rent a location that accepts overnight stays for your engagement photos.


top features to look for in a photo studio 
producing beautiful images requires much work, from renting the right equipment to booking sessions in top photography studios. giggster can connect you with the best studio for rent in places like new york or atlanta; here is a list of the top features to help you identify a fitting photo studio space.
what photos can you produce in the studio? studio photography is flexible; you can take headshots, portraits, and fashion editorials. many have cyc walls and green screens, expanding the list of projects you can work on in a studio.
does the studio have photography equipment? unlike outdoor spaces, which mainly need natural light, professional photo studios have adjustable lights to supplement the natural light. it allows you to continue working and stay on schedule despite unpredictable weather.
does the photo studio rental package include a photographer? like equipment, a studio might have a photographer on staff and their services might be included in the rental price, or you might have to outsource the service.
pros and cons of photography sessions in photo studios 
a photography studio can enhance any photo session, but like any event space, it has merits and possible setbacks. here are some reasons why you should plan your future photo shoots in studios and how to solve different challenges tied to the spaces.
advantages 


there is nothing like unpredictable conditions in a studio; you can control the lighting and keep using the space even when it's raining or snowing outside.


a photo session in a studio only requires a photographer, a model, and a camera. the rest of the room should be dedicated to lighting your subject properly.


rent a studio to guarantee uniformity; once you set up your gear optimally, all the images will turn out the same. repeating a similar setup in another studio is easier than in an outdoor space.


disadvantages 


the biggest setback of pictures produced in a studio is that they lack natural elements. while you can introduce some of these features using a green screen, they are pretty different.


a studio has restricted space; even the larger studios can be tight after setting up lights, props, and other gear.


top studios are always booked solid; you should rent a studio as soon as possible and have room to move your schedule up or choose an off-peak day.


planning your photo shoot 
giggster can help you rent spaces in houston, new york, and beyond, including a studio for your creative project. once you've locked down a top space and the photography studio offers all your project needs, use these tips to plan a successful photo shoot.
rent the best studio – renting the right studio with the required equipment and support can shorten the session. giggster is your database for all types of photo studios, making finding a unique space or specialized photo shoot location easier.
prep the photography studio – much goes on in a studio before the first shot, including moving equipment and props to the best position. account for this when scheduling studio time, and have a to-do checklist to ensure everything is ready to go once the camera starts clicking. 
hire a professional photographer – professional photographers can advise about equipment selection and placement. they usually come with assistants and photography equipment.
use props – a studio might have multiple sets or fun props in one room. props add interest to the space and can also help highlight the main subject. 
saving money on a photo shoot 
photography studio rental is a cost-effective way to create content professionally with all the required equipment. giggster can connect you with cheap photo studios for rent, which is the first way to save money when planning a photo shoot. here are more strategies to help you organize a budget-friendly studio session.
do you need two photographers?
the fewer crew members you work with, the less you'll spend on the project. also, consider a studio with an on-staff photographer as part of the rental cost or as an add-on service. it will be more affordable and also save time.
rent a studio on an off-peak day. 
leasing when the studio rent is low is one way to reduce your budget; ask the property owner about off-peak prices to be sure. weekdays tend to be low-rate days; the same is true for winter months.
can you rent equipment? 
studios vary; they don't all provide photography equipment, or what they offer might not be what you need. renting what you need allows you to use the latest gear at an affordable price.

from film to ai-powered images: how the photography industry has changed over time
many early photography professionals would likely struggle to conceptualize a handheld camera in the hands of nearly every u.s. citizen, let alone the added capacity to create videos, time-lapses, and panoramas instantly with the click of a button.
today, most of us carry a highly advanced camera at all times, with the unprecedented ability to photograph, edit, and share swiftly. getting to this level of sophistication took many decades and followed some truly incredible innovations from engineers and photographers throughout the 20th century.
early on, the first step to capturing an image was using a camera obscura, which translates to "dark chamber" in latin. the tool could project images onto a surface but lacked the light-sensitive plate to retain that image, so artists would trace the final pictures onto surfaces.
when joseph nicéphore niépce paired this technology with a pewter plate coated with light-sensitive bitumen to capture a landscape, an enduring image was born in 1826. from there, more innovations in photography came in rapid succession, from daguerreotypes (which yielded detailed images) to calotypes (which decreased exposure time to mere seconds) to a wet collodion process (which was even faster and more detailed).
while many incremental steps were taken, the progress that got us to this point was largely spurred by kodak. its invention of the film camera, and subsequent innovations toward disposable cameras, brought photography out of the darkroom and into the home. in doing so, they created an entirely new mass market, introducing average americans to the pastime of preserving everyday moments and events, which they coined "kodak moments."
the consumer demand that followed led to a century of reinvention. giggster delved into five ways the photography industry has shifted over time using sources from across the internet, including the smithsonian magazine, the los angeles times, and the bbc.
from 35mm film to digital cameras; from mailing in disposable cameras for development to instant prints; from raw images to heavily edited ones, the photography industry has consistently and rapidly evolved over the past decades. with the advent of cellphone cameras, instantaneous digital photography and editing are more popular than ever, and as the world moves ever onward, more developments are already on the horizon.
innovation powers the industry
from the second half of the 19th century until today, cameras have become nearly unrecognizable due to transformative developments. toward the end of the 19th century, kodak began manufacturing roll-film cameras, trying out many frame sizes until 35mm became the industry standard.
around the same time, the ready fotografer pinhole camera was introduced as the first disposable camera. it used an accordion-like paper box, allowing light to form an image on a plate. disposable or returnable cameras gained a massive surge in popularity seven decades later during the 1970s when brands such as kodak, fuji, and technicolor raced against each other to create an ever-cheaper but high-quality model.
the first digital camera was developed in 1975 by kodak engineer steven sasson, with a resolution of 0.01 megapixels, and took 23 seconds to take a photo. digital cameras overtook disposables in popularity thanks to the development of the ccd light sensor that essentially replaced the film's job within the camera. today's phones boast 200-megapixel cameras to help put the advancement into perspective.
big photo brands rise—and fall
during the reign of disposable cameras in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, photography giants like kodak, polaroid, and fuji constantly tried to outdo each other in developing new and improved models. however, not all these brands have survived the transition to the 21st century's digital revolution.
in 2012, kodak—once a company synonymous with photography and in control of 70% of the u.s. film market—filed for bankruptcy. the company's downfall was its refusal to believe the growing trend toward digital photography should be taken seriously, neglecting to develop new options for consumers.
similarly, the polaroid company, which once controlled about 66% of the u.s. instant camera market in the 1970s, filed for bankruptcy in the 2000s after failing to evolve with the digital revolution. after years of ignoring the popularity of digital cameras like the ones produced by canon or nikon, polaroid finally found itself facing its demise and eventually shut down production by 2008.
photos became an integral part of mass media
the 1930s through the '50s saw a "golden age of photojournalism" in the united states, as the government commissioned photographs of the public programs it had created in response to the great depression. it set a precedent for documenting not just historical events, but also personal moments in the lives of famous and influential figures.
through the lens of government-commissioned photographers like dorothea lange, margaret bourke-white, and walker evans, the public saw indelible images of life in america, which the government then offered to newspapers and magazines across the country at no cost.
magazines like life, look, and fortune grew from this early age of photojournalism. their production demanded a steady supply of photos to entertain readers. besides america's first family, the public was eager to witness war, world events, and hollywood's glamor printed on their pages. televisions were not yet a fixture in every american's home. with radio as the de facto news and entertainment source, these magazines and newspapers offered the only available visual coverage.
photographers extensively captured the great depression throughout the 1930s, allowing readers in new york to see the hardships in the dust bowl with their own eyes. similarly, photographers provided a constant pipeline between the public and washington during the presidency of john f. kennedy in the 1960s. they regularly documented the lives of the president and first lady jackie kennedy—both in front of and behind white house doors.
corporations now dominate much of the industry
passport photos, stock photos, graduation photos, and nearly every other photography need are now mainly in the hands of large corporations. jcpenney, walmart, cvs, and other chains offer quick, efficient photo studio services. getty images has dominated the stock photo business for decades, currently sitting on an archive of over 350 million images.
while big corporations run many aspects of the photography world—sony, nikon, and canon, to name a few—their growth and future are fueled by the creativity and entrepreneurialism of individuals and small businesses, including wedding photography and school portraits. however, these photo giants are increasingly impeding creatives from making steady earnings, especially when taking hefty royalty fees for licensing out their work.
the digital revolution continues with ai use in photography
since the shift away from film in the late 20th century, innovators have quickly taken advantage of digital photography's possibilities. digital technology offers photography, editing, and sharing on larger scales and faster timelines than ever before. it also allows for almost unbelievable manipulation capabilities.
tools like luminar ai, pixlr, ribbet, and the giant adobe photoshop now even use artificial intelligence to help streamline the work of removing backgrounds, upscaling low-resolution images, and detecting faces. image companies are continually advancing the depths to which photographers can edit and enhance their work: photo editing software is projected to balloon to a $1.48 billion market by 2027.
today, the term "photo" spans definitions, from a raw, unprocessed image to a heavily manipulated and altered piece of art, leading to debates on whether both merit the title "photograph"—or another title entirely.                     share listing        facebook        twitter        whatsapp        sms        email            copy link                    giggster     photo studio                     ok    download the giggster app:                                                                 company about blog guides select careers   support list your space faq community guidelines resource center trust & safety   activities party photo shoot production event birthday party filming meeting private party music video view all   types photo studio home pool film studio club church dance studio recording studio warehouse view all   cities  los angeles new york atlanta chicago miami   london vancouver toronto las vegas view all    features  music outdoor rooftop conference room   loft party hall view all             ® giggster. made in los angeles, ca   terms privacy sitemap         north america uk                                                                                                                                                                     back           join giggster already have an account? log in        sign up with facebook     sign up with google     sign up with apple                     by signing up you agree to giggster’s terms of service and privacy policy.   sign up     giggster will send you auto-generated service and offer-related emails and text messages. you can opt out at any time from your account settings. please read giggster mobile terms for more information.     i don’t want to receive marketing sms from giggster.             welcome back don’t have an account? sign up    account with this email already exists to proceed with this account, please enter your password or log in with social account.       log in with facebook     log in with google     log in with apple                by logging in you agree to giggster’s terms of service and privacy policy.    log in with password   log in with code         enter password            remember me   forgot password?      log in        how would you like to receive the verification code?   please note that the code will only be sent via sms if you have a phone number in your profile and it is verified.     by email    by sms    both, email and sms       apply — next        check your email phone email or phone for a code   we’ve sent a 6-character code to  .   the phone number associated with .    and your phone.  the code expires shortly, so please enter it soon.     you have reached the limit  you’ve made too many login attempts. please wait one hour and try again or contact our support team via help chat or email at contact@giggster.com                            can’t find your code? check your spam folder! didn't receive an sms? send a code via email instead. can’t log in? please contact our support team.    resend in 0:59  resend   checking your code...          reset password enter the email address associated with your account, and we’ll email you a link to reset your password.  email address           send reset link       thank you!  we've sent an email to  with a secure link to reset your password. if you don't receive anything after several minutes contact us at hello@giggster.com. we're happy to help.   ok
