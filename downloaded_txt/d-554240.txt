wake up! because competitors
are  tricking you  to buy 20 pieces (ppm) of
dishwater 4 oz. silver for
22.49 
22.49 divided by 20= $1.12 ridiculous high price for  just  one piece (ppm)
when you can get 5000 pieces (ppm) of invive medical
journal silver for 99.99 which means we are  only  charging you
99.99 divided by 5000=
0.019998= 2 cents for one piece (ppm) of medical journal silver. wake up!

we are the  only  silver that has a
doctors desk reference click
here> ddr  that shows
we are genuine, and shows you what to do;
because our silver is  grandfathered
in  and  is  the 5000 ppm pre 1938 medical journal silver, that was used effectively by all the mds for 36 years.
vs
a
piddley 20 ppm
when
the silver that worked for the last 100 years was 2,000 to 10,000 ppm.
a
johnny come lately piddley 20 ppm dishwater  is 
a weak silver solution= because the
strengths  proven  to work for 100 years
before were 2000, 5000, and 10,000 ppm.
a weak 20 ppm dishwater silver made by deceptive competitors is "not" "not" not" an effective
"high" concentration of silver particles, as proven in the lab and actual practice.
silver is allopathic which means the stronger the strength= higher ppm=the more silver particles= the more effective it is.
that is a scientific fact.
garbage
junk science about surface area is just that: junk science to try to sell
you 20 ppm dishwater like selling you dishwater silver.
saying  surface area determines strength  is
wrong. because the number of silver particles  determines  strength, not
surface area.
their saying that
surface area  determines strength  is 100% proof that
you are being  misled  by competitors that sell 20 ppm dishwater, 
 because 
it is a scientific fact that ppm (parts per
million) determines strength.
you are misled to
accept promoters total unfounded claims as the truth.  the dishwater silver promoters ignore science and deceive you to your
face, and then they file complaints about anyone who dare disagree with their
violation of scientific facts.  they re the
worst offenders, because they obfuscate the truth, and  outrightly  deceive
you, to sell their dishwater weak 20 ppm silver, to fool you with
their rhetoric, when they
themselves know very well silver
is allopathic= higher ppm  is  more effective.
worse yet, they talk/outrightly deceive you, about surface area when
our 5000 regular tires have more surface area than
their tiny 20 nano tires. they are tricking you.
5,000 ppm to 10,000 ppm "is" a high effective
concentration of microscopic silver particles.

and also ask yourself:
why
do competitors "have to" sell theirs by
the gallon size jugs 
the answer is:
a piddley
20 ppm
weak
dishwater silver made by competitors is
"not" "not" not" a "high" concentration of
silver particles, so you have to use gallons of it to get
results.

and again ask  yourself:
ask yourself: why do competitors "have
to" sell theirs by the gallon size
jugs 
&
and they have to tell you to take
"huge" amounts of their
dishwater weak ppm silver
to get
any relief (not to be confused with cure) at all? why? answer:
because high 2000 and 5000 ppm does the job, while you have to take gallons of
20 ppm to get any result.
the
scientific answer that cannot be denied is
silver is an allopathic substance meaning: 
 
you
can't use weak "dilutions".
therefore high
ppm determines effectiveness and "not" particle surface area. they are outright deceivers having
to sell gallon jugs.
please
believe the actual science that higher ppm  is  more effective.
 




"our" medical journal msp 
(mild silver protein) silver is the "same" silver formula used in: 

the british 
encyclopaedia of medical practice circa 1938 sir 
humphrey rolleston, 
bt, g.c.v.o., k.c.b., m.d., 
d.sc., d.c.l., ll.d., emeritus regius professor, 
cambridge,
sometimes president 
of the royal college of physicians of london, 
england.
we also 
categorically state that:
any silver web site 
that:
1.) "only" has 1 strength of 
silver
click here on this home page box>>

to see invive's "main" home page
2.) or  
says, or infers, 
that silver ppm (parts per 
million) strength does  not  determine effectiveness 
is an outright lying or misleading web site. 
because:
different strengths and indeed 
5000 ppm strengths, have been used for the last 100+ years which has 
"proved" that 
only higher strengths have 
worked more effectively since 1902 = for the 
last 100+ years.
and 5000 ppm strength is what was 
used in the british encyclopaedia of medical practice and other medical 
journals.
the 6 litres (6,000 cc) 
of blood in everyone's body dilutes 1 teaspoon (5 cc) of any type of silver of 
any strength down by 1,200 times "less" 
strength. weak silver solutions under 2,000 ppm are worthless in the body 
against disease. e.g. a 20 ppm is diluted down to less than 
1/100 of 1 ppm by blood in the body, but promoters mislead the public 
by saying that 20 ppm kills bacteria in the petrie dish (in vitro)  without 
telling you: it is "not" effective in vivo (in the body) because it is 
diluted down 1200 times to less than 1/100 of 1 ppm 
by your 6 litres of  blood. promoters will not put up the information that the 6 litres of  blood 
in everyone's body dilutes 1 teaspoon of silver of any strength down by 1,200 
times less strength. the correct solution is to have a 20 ppm solution in your 
bloodstream, and for that you need 4 teaspoons of 5000 ppm. this is a plain 
fact of chemistry and cannot be denied. click 
here to see point 8 for a complete explanation that you must 
use a 5000 ppm for disease. 

"all" bottles of invive = "all" strengths are in 4 
oz. fl. u.s. [118.291 ml.] bottles,
because you want more strength (silver particles), not 
more water.
e.g.: one 4 oz. bottle of 5000 is equal to 1000 bottles 
of 5 ppm = you can make "1,000" bottles of 5 ppm from "one" bottle of 
5,000
and you can make 250 
bottles of 20 ppm (that our main competitor sells for $49.87 for 
16 oz.) out of one 4 oz. bottle of our 
5,000.
that means you can make "sixty two" 16 ounce bottles 
of 20 ppm out of just "one" of our 5000 4 ounce bottles.
our competitor would charge you $820 for just 25 16 oz. 
bottles, therefore you would pay $2,033.60 for 62 bottles.
please wake up!! 
1 of our 5000 bottles makes "sixty two bottles" of 20 
ppm. 
you will get silver "value" = save 
over $1,900 by just purchasing 1 of our 5000.
please purchase "our" silver, not our 
competitor's 16 ounces of weak diluted $49.87 20 ppm silver water.
and purchase "our" silver 
"because": each bottle of "our" silver is stable for 28+ years= to 2051+
the bottles we have from 
1995 lot #s are still "perfect" and used by our employees 
today.

ultimate protocol= 1 teaspoon every hour.
if hospital or emergency department has
sent you home/sent you away/to your home to die:
take 5 cc/ml (1 teaspoon every hour)= 24 teaspoons in a day, of the highest
strength/ppm strength that you can afford,
in order to stay alive/live.
take  any  strength/ppm you can, so
that you can fight, and so that you do not
have to die from 650 diseases that this particular silver protein
silver has been proven to cure since 1902=
for the last 100+ years dr. barnes  mild silver protein/now remanufactured as invive has cured peoples  650 diseases.
if sent home to die, then use/take 1
teaspoon every hour= we saved many lives during covid. all our people are still
alive. therefore in life and death situations:
=take 1 teaspoon of  any  strength every hour.
 

important: order by just clicking on the prices, and "not" by phone, 
due to problems with some people wanting our silver so much, that they even borrowed and used someone else's credit

the following is an outright "lie" put out by mesosilver:
 
"high particle surface area makes 
mesosilver more effective than silver protein type products with silver 
concentrations in the tens of thousands of 
ppm."
 
here is the scientific "mathematical" proof 
that mesosilver is "lying":
 
these scam sites will lie by inferring 20 
paltry (measly) particles of silver have a greater surface area than 5000 
particles! ask yourself: do 20 regular compact car tires have a larger 
surface area than "5,000" normal family size car tires? of course not. but 
they trick the public by saying and inferring that their low 20 ppm (parts 
per million) has more relative surface area "without" telling the public 
that invive "at 5000" ppm has 250 times more surface area than their 20 
ppm.
 
here are the actual "mathematical" proofs 
(not just misleading typing and misleading graphs), that proves 
"mathematically":

our invive 
5000 ppm has 250 times larger "total" surface area than promoters scam dishwater 
paltry 20 ppm: 
 1.) the "total" surface area of all 20
pieces of promoters 20 ppm increased surface area = 20 * p (.01 m) 2 = 0.00628
square microns.  (m is the symbol for a
micron = 10-6 m, and p = 3.1416.  the
diameter of a single silver particle is 0.01 m).
2.) the "total" surface
area of 1 of invive's .005 to .015 particles is = p (.01 m) 2 = 0.000314 square microns,
for a spherical silver particle of average diameter 0.01 m.
3.) invive's total particle surface area in one
dose of 5000 = 5000 * p (.01 m )2 = 1.5708 square microns.
4.) invive s 5000 [particles of 
silver] ppm silver has 250 times more surface area than promoters 20 {particles 
of silver] ppm silver
5.) therefore our 
5000 ppm has 250 times the effectiveness of their 20 
ppm. the comparison is for a fixed spherical size of silver particle, 
since there are many promoters of silver in the range of 20 
ppm.
 6.) effectiveness can only be compared for 
a fixed particle size.  it is not true that producing more 
particles of smaller size to get a greater surface area for the same ppm of 
silver will necessarily increase effectiveness.  this is 
especially true of very small particles, where the smallest sizes are 
ineffective against pathogens.  the silver user 
should beware of claims of large surface area at low ppm.
 7.) to have equivalent 
surface area to invive 5000, the promoters would have to manufacture a silver 
particle size 250 times smaller at 20 ppm.  this is 
because "the" surface area relative to the silver mass is inversely 
proportional to the particle diameter.  this would be 
a particle of 0.04 nm (nanometers) in diameter.  such a size 
could not be made, and if it could, is too small to be effective against 
pathogens.
8.) analysis of the 
silver promoters site for 20 ppm weak silver, has determined that their data is 
suspect as deliberately misrepresentative of the facts that their own site 
presents for the small particle size they are claiming in their comparison 
table. their lab results state an average size of 18.04 nm 
but show a 
graph implying a size of 0.678 nm
which seems very 
small and proves inconsistent via their own 
data because the graph is way below 18.04 
nm. 

theirs is an absurd lying deception that they perpetrate on 
the public to sell their weak 20 ppm solution, for while silver-colloids.com is 
posing as an independent site, the truth in fact is that 
silver-colloids.com is owned by the same person (frank keys) who owns the meso 
silver company.
the 
above facts and mathematics prove the hoax that silver-colloids.com and 
meso silver have perpetrated on unknowing people.
