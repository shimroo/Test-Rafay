maui nui botanical gardens (mnbg) is dedicated to the protection of maui nui’s rich native plants and cultural heritage.
through partnerships, we expand the reach of our activities to managed native habitats, schools, hālau, and other civic and not-for-profit groups. we also act as a resource to residents and visitors through interpretation of the plant collection and the hiring of local cultural practitioners who teach traditional hawaiian arts.
mnbg incorporates water conservation techniques like xeriscaping, and provides a place where residents can discover which native plants are best suited for their area.
