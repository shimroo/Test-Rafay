the origins of straightjackets: a historical perspective
straightjackets have been a part of human history for centuries, with the first recorded use dating back to ancient greece. these early devices were used as a form of restraint, often in conjunction with other forms of punishment or treatment. over time, the design and purpose of straightjackets evolved, but their core function remained the same: to restrict movement and impose control.
despite their widespread use throughout history, there is a common misconception that straightjackets are only used for punitive purposes. in reality, they have also been employed as a therapeutic tool, helping individuals with mental health conditions or developmental disabilities to cope with their symptoms.
