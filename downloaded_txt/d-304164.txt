he answered and said unto
        them, "he that soweth the good seed is the son of man; 
        the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels."
              matthew 13:37-39

did you know?


















        it's time to
              come out of confusion

              we are in the last generation.
              satan is going to be cast out of heaven along with the fallen angels to
              deceive the whole world.   it's
              time to come out of confusion and discover that there is more to
              god's word than you have been taught.
              read

        did you know that eve did not
              eat an apple?

eve was
              deceived by satan, and partook of his fruit, but she did not
              eat an apple.  she was wholly seduced by satan.  this
              encounter produced offspring which were fraternal twins: cain and abel. read

 did you know that cain
              is the offspring of his father, satan?

              cain became the first murderer when he slew his brother
              abel.  cain is not mentioned in adam's genealogy because he
              was not adam's son, he was of satan's seed. 
              that lineage still exists today fulfilling the negative part of
              god's plan.  learn about the sons of cain, or kenites.  read
              more


did you know that satan is coming
              disguised as jesus christ?

no
              one knows the time of christ's return, but the wise will know
              that satan comes first disguised as jesus christ.  read
              more










did
              you know we are in the season of the antichrist?

              you are living in the generation of the fig tree. the fig tree was
              planted when israel became a nation in 1948.   this
              generation shall not pass until all the things prophesied in god's
              word have come to pass. read
              more

        will you be
              waiting when the true christ returns?


              jesus will come in an hour we do not know, until then, we are to remain as
              chaste
              virgins  meaning spiritually undefiled by the antichrist. don't be
              deceived by the son
              of perdition.  read

              do you have a purpose and a destiny?
      
god's elect
              have a
              destiny. find out what it is. are you being
              called?  read
