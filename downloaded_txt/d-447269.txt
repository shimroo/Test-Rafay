accreditation

since 2008, the dekalb county sheriff's office has maintained simultaneous accreditation by the commission on accreditation for law enforcement agencies (calea), the national commission on correctional health care (ncchc), and the american correctional association (aca). the distinctive "triple crown" accreditation status is awarded by the national sheriffs’ association. it is held by only 41 of 3,083 sheriff’s offices nationwide.

“achieving these accreditations individually is a daunting task. acquiring all three at the same time is an extraordinary feat. in fact, the triple crown distinction is so rare, that since the establishment of the award in 1993, fewer than 50 sheriffs’ offices have qualified.” - national sheriffs’ association
