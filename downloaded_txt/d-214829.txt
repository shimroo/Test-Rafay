often referred to as the hostess city of the
            south, savannah is rich in architectural splendor, natural beauty
            and old-fashioned southern charm. since british general james
            oglethorpe landed on the historic bluff above the savannah river in
            1733 to found americas thirteenth colony, savannah has
            established itself as one of the nations most unique cities.
            originally conceived of as a buffer against the spanish in florida,
            georgia was an outpost of sorts. with the help of the native
            american leader tomochichi, general oglethorpe created a modern city
            in the heart of the georgia wilderness. general oglethorpe devised
            savannahs unique city plan, which features an ingenious system of
            squares, which are really miniature parks that serve as an
            organizing system for the historic district. houses, churches and
            business surround each square. savannah has 23 distinct squares
            across the historic district, each of which has its own charm, style
            and personality.
we will help you
           throughout your entire real estate transaction experience.

savannah definitely has diversity when 
it comes to places in which to live. settle here and you can have your choice of 
surrounding yourself with history, stepping back into small-town america, 
enjoying the security and luxury of a gated community or lazing the day away in 
a laid-back cottage at the beach. there's all that and more. 
savannah's neighborhoods and suburbs historic 
district-riverfront, squares, parks, tours, all squares. many residents 
of the 2.5-square-mile landmark historic district can claim the city's verdant 
squares as their front yards. although the north end of the district is 
commercial in character, numerous blocks of the area are solidly residential. 
historic homes in need of restoration are still available. newcomers will also 
find a good selection of restored homes, the result of 40 years of preservation 
efforts, and new construction in the form of townhouse condominiums crafted to 
blend into the historic atmosphere of the district. a new trend in downtown 
housing involves the conversion of space above retail establishments into 
apartments and lofts, a situation that's developed along with the city's recent 
revitalization of commercial buildings. victorian district
adjacent to the historic district, this first southward expansion of 
the city is attracting more and more folks interested in restoring two- and 
three-story frame houses in need of repair. the area becomes more popular in 
this regard as the number of restorable houses in the historic district 
declines. ardsley park savannah's first suburb, laid 
out in 1911, is a mixture of prestigious four- and five-bedroom mansions and 
quaint, craftsman-style bungalows situated on tree-lined streets. the ardsley 
park area -- located in midtown and loosely bounded by victory drive on the 
north, waters avenue on the east, 55th street on the south and bull street on 
the west -- has become one of the city's "hottest" neighborhoods favored by 
young professionals and families. gordonston this 
secluded neighborhood in eastside savannah is similar to ardsley park in 
character, but it's considerably smaller and hasn't been "discovered" to the 
extent that its "big brother" to the southwest has. 
southside-savannah mall,oglethorpe mall,business district 
shopping and recreation abound on the southside, a large area that's 
the site of both of savannah's malls, a multitude of smaller shopping centers 
and bacon park, whose 500 acres offer residents a variety of activities ranging 
from soccer to golf and from swimming to weight training. the southside is also 
residential in character, with neighborhoods featuring everything from 
ranch-style homes to patio homes and an abundance of apartment complexes and 
condominiums. two significant neighborhoods are: windsor forest
developed starting in the 1960s, windsor forest offers home buyers a 
wide spectrum of choices in terms of styles and prices. 
georgetown an area of mostly upscale homes, georgetown 
was one of the fastest-growing parts of the city in the 1990s, but it retains 
the feel of being out in the country. the 
islands-oatland,talahi,whitemarsh,wilmington & tybee beach home 
buyers in search of a less-historic but easy-going setting might consider the 
islands east and southeast of downtown savannah. one of these, tybee, is a 
barrier island fronting on the atlantic ocean. the others are separated from the 
mainland by rivers or tidal creeks, but all of the islands exude the 
"getting-away-from-it-all" feeling that comes when you cross a stretch of 
tranquil marshland on your way home from work or school. 
eastside islands-oatland,talahi,whitemarsh,wilmington 
& tybee beach directly east of savannah is where you'll find tybee 
and four inshore islands of varying size -- oatland, talahi, whitemarsh and 
wilmington. close by is the municipality of thunderbolt, a fishing village of a 
little more than 2,300 residents that typifies the small-town, family-oriented 
atmosphere of the area. wilmington 
island-marinas,riverfront,wilmington island club the largest of the 
several inshore islands east of savannah, this area is mainly residential in 
nature and is dotted with heavily forested neighborhoods, parks and recreational 
facilities. tybee island-savannah 
beach,ocean,backriver,lighthouse located 18 miles from savannah, this 
small seaside island is graced by a wide, 3-mile long beach that draws sun 
lovers and water-sports enthusiasts from throughout georgia and the rest of the 
southeast. while tybee is a resort replete with a full complement of 
restaurants, modern hotels and motels, luxurious condominiums and quaint rental 
cottages, it's also a residential area whose offerings range from historic homes 
on the officers' row of a one-time military post to classic beach-style abodes 
-- some beautifully restored. tybee, home to about 3,400 year-round residents, 
is an independent municipality providing its own city services. among focal 
points are the south-end pier and pavilion -- which is much-enjoyed by fishermen 
and folks strolling above the ocean and listening to live-band music; and the 
fort screven area on the island's north end, which is the site of the tybee 
lighthouse and an intriguing museum. southeastern islands
dutch island this community of spacious homes and 
manicured yards is about 20 minutes from downtown savannah. isle of 
hope one of savannah's most picturesque neighborhoods, isle of hope 
exudes the look of the old south. beautiful old cottages adorned with white 
picket fences line narrow streets and overlook the herb and skidaway rivers. 
bluff drive, which rambles along the skidaway under moss-strewn oaks, is one of 
the area's most alluring street. skidaway island-the landings 
the residential jewel of skidaway is the landings, a large gated 
community that's the site of upscale homes featuring a variety of styles -- 
southern lowcountry, colonial, federal and traditional ranch -- set on 
beautifully landscaped grounds. the landings is a retirees' paradise, with its 
two deep-water marinas, six private 18-hole golf courses, 34 tennis courts, 
fitness center and four clubhouses. west chatham 
county-pooler,godley station much of the savannah area's industry is 
concentrated in west chatham, and it's also the site of four municipalities and 
southbridge and savannah quarters -- two fast-growing golf communities. the 
towns of the area -- bloomingdale, garden city, pooler and port wentworth -- are 
well-established residential areas that serve as home to much of the workforce 
of the industries located there. these municipalities are known for their 
independence and volunteer spirit, and for a general absence of property taxes. 
government planners expect west chatham to experience a boom in residential 
growth in the next few years, with home building focused on pooler, the godley 
station area and the berwick area. bloomingdale this town 
of 2,665 is conveniently located near both the savannah/hilton head 
international airport and the city's port. residents enjoy a country lifestyle 
and a small-town ambience. garden city standing amid a 
variety of industrial developments, garden city is the county's second-largest 
municipality, with a population of more than 11,200. the number of residents 
grew greatly after an annexation that occurred in the summer of 1998. 
pooler-godley station,westbrook with more than 6,200 
residents, pooler is a fast-growing, family-oriented town with affordable homes 
and a wealth of recreational opportunities. port wentworth
this town of 3,276 -- home of the flag-waving "stand up for america day" 
celebration each may -- captures the essence of small-town usa. 
southbridge-golf community the homes at this planned 
community just off interstate highway 16 feature beautiful landscaping and 
architecture that's traditionally southern. the development covers 1,100 acres 
and offers residents the pleasures of a golf club and a tennis and swim club. 
bryan county-richmond hill,ft. stewart this 
county south and southwest of savannah offers a unique blend of piney woods and 
marshland. the fastest-developing part of bryan county -- and one of the most 
rapidly growing in the nation -- is near the coast. it's richmond hill, a 
bustling bedroom community that was once the winter quarters of famed 
industrialist henry ford. richmond hill-the ford plantation 
twenty miles south of savannah lies richmond hill. it is one of two 
incorporated cities in bryan county and has been one of the fastest-growing 
communities in the nation. richmond hill offers a number of new housing 
developments, schools and opportunities for recreation and shopping. its 
proximity to i-95 and i-16 makes it a popular choice for commuters. 
bryan county's first incorporated city, pembroke, has served as the 
county seat since 1935. it is a charming town offering peaceful county living 
and an upscale golf-course community. effingham 
county-rincon,springfield,guyton fast-developing effingham 
offers home buyers a choice of residential areas with different characters -- 
on-the-go rincon, quaint guyton, and springfield, the county seat. 
rincon beginning to resemble a bedroom community of the 
magnitude of richmond hill, is mushrooming as the savannah area gradually 
spreads west. however, all three municipalities retain their country-style 
atmosphere.
