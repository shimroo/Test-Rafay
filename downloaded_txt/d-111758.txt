                                are the hip & joint snacks okay to eat every day?                            



yes, they are. feed daily as a treat to support hip and joint health with natural sources of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. the glucosamine value per treat is 2.175 mg. the chondroitin value per treat is 0.725 mg. if you have a dog with particular issues, we do recommend that you seek your veterinarian’s advice before feeding anything new to your pet.






                                why do some of the products have caution statements on them about staining?                            



all of the crunchy products that have turmeric or paprika in the ingredients carry a caution statement. turmeric and paprika are all-natural spices which are bright in color – we use them to color our products naturally. however, when combined with the saliva in a dog’s mouth, it can sometimes create yellow staining.






                                which crunchy old mother hubbard dog treats are wheat-free?                            



our wheat-free option in the omh crunchy line are the grain free mini p-nuttier ‘n nanners, grain free mini pick of the patch and grain free mini all the fixins’.






                                what is the size difference between the mini, small, and large treats?                            



mini treats are about 1.33 inches (33.9 mm) long. small treats are about 2.25 inches (57.2mm) long. large treats are about 3.88 inches (98.5 mm) long.

                                are these products all-natural?                            



old mother hubbard soft & chewy treats contain a preservative (sorbic acid) to keep them moist and delicious. this preservative is not natural, but the rest of the ingredients in soft & chewy treats are wholesome and natural. however, old mother hubbard wholesome indulgences use natural preservatives: citric acid and vinegar. old mother hubbard wholesome indulgences are considered natural.






                                which soft recipes are wheat-free?                            



none of our soft recipes are currently wheat-free. we use wheat to create a firm but pliable texture.
