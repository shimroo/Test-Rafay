about the grotto

founded in 1952, the boston grotto is a chartered internal organization of the national speleological society (nss) to promote exploration, conservation, scientific study and social activities in and about caves.
we welcome everyone with an interest in caves and caving, including those who have never been in a cave before to advanced expedition cavers. to new cavers get their start, we organize beginner trips and can supply loaner equipment. 
the grotto meets the first wednesday of each month (except for major holidays).
