oldfields school’s mission is to embrace each girl’s authentic self, educate through collaboration, empower the individual voice, and inspire confidence and continual growth, leading to a life of purpose.






























































































































































































































































the oldfields advantage























equine science not just a class! this is a full concentration created for students interested in studying equine or veterinary science in college, or plan to go directly into the horse industry with micro-credentials. the program combines traditional academic classes with hands-on education in the barn and experiential learning.























pathways programdesigned to help students do a deep-dive into their personal interests and find their calling, the pathways program empowers students to be the best versions of themselves as they embark on successful ventures beyond oldfields with strength, humility and largeness of heart.























riding programan integral part of the oldfields experience since 1867, the riding program is dedicated to inspiring our riders to value the character of the horse and the integrity of the sport and benefit from the lessons discovered from our relationships with horses.























may programexploring the waters of the chesapeake, nailing drywall for habitat for humanity, studying photographic journalism, the may program has provided a life-changing opportunity for our students to explore an area that sparks their interest since its inception in 1971. 























advisoryour approach to advisory is the foundation for a successful oldfields experience. advisory groups are intentionally formed to give you the best possible experience with just the right amount of support. you’ll have weekly one-on-one time with your advisor. 























leadership we place value on developing strength in communication, character, and accountability. it may begin with making an announcement at morning meeting, and end with you as the all-school president!  when you leave oldfields, you are prepared to step into each leadership position with poise and confidence.



















 the oldfields advantage: empowering girls to become the next generation of courageous and compassionate leaders.



for over 150 years,  every aspect of oldfields—from the classroom, to the athletic fields, and especially student leadership—is designed for girls. at a time when so many outside influences define who a girl should be, oldfields provides a place free from that pressure and distraction—where girls can focus on who they are and what passions they wish to pursue. the result is young women who are filled with confidence, embrace leadership opportunities, and aspire to improve the world as they move on to college and beyond. 



what the research showsgraduates of all-girls schools have a definitive edge over their co-educated peers, including:6x more likely to consider majoring in math, science, and technology, compared to girls who attend co-ed schools.90% feel supported by their all-girl peers as compared with 75% at coed schools87% feel their opinions are respected compared to 58% at coed schools3/4 of girls’ school grads consider college a stepping stone to graduate school.93% of girls’ school grads are very or extremely satisfied with their school’s ability to provide individualized attention.research provided by art & science group, llc and the national coalition of girls' schools














the minute you walk in the door, you realize that everybody is looking out for your daughter’s best interest and she is their number one priority. i don’t know of any other place where my daughter is going to matter this much to this many people. they care for her like family, and it becomes a home away from home.
