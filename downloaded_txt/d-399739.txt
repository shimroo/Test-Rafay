what clients say




i think radiotech products are excellent. they show quality workmanship and you guys are an excellent company to deal with. we are very happy. you recently sold some radiotech reflective straps to my old fire company and they are just tickled to death with them. the radiotech reflective straps look really nice, and they are just as happy as we are.

-- james kron chief, georgetown township fire protection, indiana --


my radiotech products are holding up very well. i think the straps and cases are fantastic. i’ve had no problems with my things, and use my kit every third day when i’m on duty. i would surely recommend radiotech.

-- kevin vermillion firefighter, walton county f.d., georgia --


i love my radiotech stuff. the radio case helps to protect our radios, and the radio strap makes it available at all times. the stabilizer keeps me from bonking my patients in the head with these heavy radios. i’ve had no problems or complaints. great.

-- a firefighter/emt bloomington f.d., idaho --


i love my radiotech radio strap and i use it all the time. in fact, i use it every day when i am on duty. i usually wear the radio strap under my turn out coat to traffic accidents… i work for a big fire department in california, and although most guys don’t use radio straps out here, i love mine and i bet they would too.

-- george casario firefighter, orange county f.d., california --


the guys love them. they’re very durable. we haven’t had any issues with them falling apart at the seams or anything. i’ve had mine for 6 years and have had no issues. the hardware hasn’t broken or faded. there have been no issues with any of the cases coming apart or with the ‘d’ rings.

-- brian manware,  assistant chief clinton f.d., connecticut --


we’ve been using radiotech products for quite a while and are happy. …we use these radio straps everyday – we haven’t had a complaint or issue and would recommend radiotech to anyone!

-- chance kaczmarski paramedic, fitch-rona ems, wisconsin --


we just starting using your radiotech stuff, but it is working very well. …i would definitely recommend radiotech to anyone who asks.

-- bill stockley firefighter, buckeye f.d., arizona --


we have had nothing but good results with your product. the products were deployed and are out there in the field 24/7. i am going to photocopy your catalog of the reflective products and distribute them to our volunteer fire companies. i purchased at one of the shows the radiotech reflective strap and everyone asks me, ‘where did you get it?’ i always respond with, ‘radiotech.com’!

-- lt. garth hillier, fulton county sheriff’s office, new york --


the products that we have from radiotech have held up extremely well. we just switched over to kenwood radios, and we have your radio straps, radio cases, and anti-sway stabilizers. we have had absolutely no problems with anything. i use my radiotech stuff just about every day, so that’s 4 days a week that i am on duty. i’ve even shared your company information and recommended you to other people.

-- paul conley deputy chief, freeport fire rescue, maine --


your stuff takes a beating and keeps going strong! i’m still using some radiotech products 3-4 times a week that i purchased from you guys 10 years ago and they are holding up well. would i recommend radiotech? absolutely!

-- tom aurhammer, deputy chief, los pinos f.d. , colorado --


your products are perfect … i use them at work and at the volunteer fire house. the radiotech radio strap is a great product it holds up well to moisture and heat damage.
 

-- chief vanarsdale, fallstown f.d., maryland --


i purchased a radiotech radio case a few years ago and it is still running strong. i’m a very happy customer. i’ve had absolutely no problems with it at all and i use it every day that i am at work. when people ask me where i got my radio holster i tell them to go to the radiotech.com!
 

-- tim frank firefighter, seattle f.d. washington --

about usfounded in 1993 by a licensed motorola radio repairman and former new york city paramedic, today radiotech™ is the united states top supplier of fire service radio accessories. we began as a business offering motorola two-way radio sales and service. radio straps and cases were a part of our business, but in those early days, selection for these products was very limited. we knew that we needed to offer more than the ‘standard’ cases and straps, and that is where our business was truly born.
