ahoy mateys!
 

my site has been in drydock for some time— actually too long. now i am moving to wetdock, and beginning  the work to refurbish and rebuild. after over 20 years (yes, started in 1995!, very early in the internet age) the site in many ways still looked like 1995, just like the historic ships.  i will be modernizing and updating regularly, and bringing a modern look. all the old stories will be there, for all the old ships.  i will add new stories and pictures, and post any submissions. like sailing, i don’t know where i am going, or when we will get there. but the wind blows us along on the journey. 
sail windjammer www.sailwindjammer.com  now has rescued the sv mandalay, and operates her in the same wonderful way many of us remember  —
laid back, barefoot, t-shirts and swimsuits all week.   the new owners are doing a wonderful job! the ship is in better condition than i have ever seen her. captain sly is dedicated to giving you the best experience possible. do not hesitate!  go! we loved the trips so much, we schedule 2 trips a year, 4-6 weeks total! 
join the fun!

windjammer barefoot cruises is no more. i run across many people who are not aware of this. the end of wjbc was ugly, to be polite. folks were left on the dock, and hundreds of people lost lots of money on pre-paid trips and the lamer. many folks have bitter memories of the end. but many of us have nice memories of the times 
before that last year. i, for one, chose to remember the good times, and compartmentalize and seal the bad times. as it so happens, karen and i sailed what i think was the last full week of windjammer, sailing mandalay out of panama to the kuna yala with captain casey.  this was the first week of september, 2007.  as we disembarked at the end of the week at the dock at colon 2000, the captain and crew lined up on the dock and shook the hand  of each passenger as they left, with amazing grace playing  full blast in the background. they knew the end had come, and the crew was classy to the end.
