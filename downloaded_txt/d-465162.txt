welcome to the 
plantation estates website!









the plantation estates community association is located in marrero, la 
just minutes from downtown new orleans, which is the home of mardi gras, 
jazz fest, 
    saints football, 
    pelicans basketball, the french quarter,
    tpc golf 
and much more.

we are a non-profit organization dedicated to the residents of the plantation 
estates subdivision.  we will strive to keep the streets safe, preserve 
property values, and build a stronger community.  thanks for your continued support.
