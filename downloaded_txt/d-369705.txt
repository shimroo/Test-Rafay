 48th ohio veteran volunteer infantry


 
    


recruited from southwestern ohio
      in the fall of 1861, the regiment was organized at camp dennison
      in october. the following april, as part of general sherman's
      division, they found themselves at the very heart of the confederate
      surprise attack at shiloh, tn, only 30 days after having been
      issued their rifles. they participated in the siege of corinth,
      the capture of arkansas post, and the subsequent vicksburg campaign,
      seeing considerable action during the siege of that city. in
      april of 1864, while a part of gen. banks' red river expedition,
      the entire regiment was captured after intense fighting at the
      battle of sabine crossroads (mansfield, la) and imprisoned at
      camp ford, near tyler, texas. six months later they were paroled,
      and saw action again in 1865 as part of the attack on mobile.
      the 48th ovvi was mustered out in texas in may, 1866.
