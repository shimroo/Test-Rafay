welcome



i'm jenny birdsey and welcome to the home of jenny birdsey.com         and the natural progesterone advisory network (npan).
i have helped hundreds of women over a number of years to         understand the benefits of natural progesterone. this website in conjunction         with two books i have written, book 1 - natural progesterone - the world's         best kept secret and book 2 - natural progesterone - more secrets revealed,         will give you valuable information and support. 
book 1 has sold out in hard cover format so instead of re-printing this book i have chosen to make it available as a free download. i am committed to helping women and by making this book free it is my hope that you will benefit from the information it contains.
if you find book 1 helpful, you may wish to purchase book 2. this book is currently only available in hard copy.
whilst i sell my books, i do not sell creams or charge membership         and i am not involved in affilliate programs or sponsorship. my website         information is free and will be regularly updated. if you feel you would like to support this website, i am happy to accept donations, but there is no obligation. please email me for details as to how you can make a donation.
please note that i am in no way affiliated with the website         "natural-progesterone-advisory-network.com". 
look for the npan logo  as it assures you that you are receiving information endorsed by me!
