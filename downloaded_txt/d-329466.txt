this site is the archived material from the old testament lectionary site of the rev dr anna grant-henderson which i hope will still be helpful to people wanting to preach on the old testament.the lectionary 2013-2014 'year a'
lectionary for year c (2012-2013)
introduction to pentecost b is belowlooking forward to advent
introduction to advent, christmas, lent & easter 2012-2013 (rcl year âcâ)
most of the readings in the lectionary for advent and christmas use texts from the old testament which have been appropriated by the christian church as referring the birth of christ in some way.â  the major problem is for people to see them in their original context because they have become so much part of the christmas story.â  if it is possible to see them in their original context it presents a whole new wonder that the prophets hear the word of god for their own time and offer the hope that is in them. â the readings for lents come from across the old testament â with no particular book used.â  i would encourage readers to ensure they read much wider around the text which is given because the few verses in the lectionary are often part of w much bigger story. the readings are listed on the right hand side of this page and are not in lectionary order.â  it is a matter of finding the relevant text and clicking on it. the material has been archived from the web site of the rev dr anna grant-henderson, because i believe it is still useful for people preparing worship and haven't got the time to research old testament texts.â  the pages give some historical and literary background to the book: the context of the lectionary ot reading: some suggestions about its theology and message and finishes with a list of possible resources.
introduction to pentecost b
about half the readings in pentecost b comeâ from the books of samuel & kings.â  these are part of the great story called the deuteronomistic history, by many scholars.â  it shows how kings came to be set up in judah & israel and basically says it was not a good move by the people to demand a king.â  the story blames the kings and other leaders for the downfall of judah, loss of temple, city and the exile into babylon. the other readings come from writings with a couple from the major prophets. the readings are listed on the left hand side of this page and are not in lectionary order.â  it is a matter of finding the relevant text and clicking on it. the material has been archived from the web site of the rev dr anna grant-henderson, because i believe it is still useful for people preparing worship and haven't got the time to research old testament texts.â  the pages give some historical and literary background to the book: the context of the lectionary ot reading because so many of the readings are part of much larger stories and this is crucial to their understanding: some suggestions about its theology and message and finishes with a list of possible reources.
as material is bought accross from the original web site, it will stored under scripture index and people can look for a particualr text whether for worship or bible study.
