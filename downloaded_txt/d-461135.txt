											how do i make my lover even more sexy?
									 	

everyday sexy
some bathrobe styles are cut more like lingerie than granny's housecoat. sexy, yet practical, a short satin wrap or slit velvet robe is the type of gift your lover will wear frequently. wouldn't it be lovely to see your favorite person in such alluring garments everyday?

											what makes for a sexy robe?
									 	

silk and satin spell 'sexy'
satin and silk fabrics are synonymous with physical comfort or pleasure. for this reason, they are often aligned with sex appeal. when wrapping yourself in a bathrobe made of silk, be careful trotting around. you might be sending signals to those who see you. then again, this might be exactly what you hope to do!

											what's so great about satin and silk?
									 	

silk and satin - the basics
silk and satin are famous for their ultra smooth feel which makes them ideal for women's bath robes. these fabrics are excellent for warm climates and are extremely light weight. silk takes decorative prints well so you can find her a gorgeous silk robe that suits her taste. neither fabric can absorb much water and both tend to stick to skin when wet, so this is purely a luxury item.

											how do i answer the door with a new baby at home?
									 	

beating baby fatigue
when the newborn arrives at home, keep a bathrobe by the door. now, regardless of what you are wearing, or what has been spilled on you, you can toss on the robe and face the world when it comes knocking at your door.

											how do i get more rest with my newborn baby?
									 	

new baby at home
a way to cope with fatigue with a new baby is to remain in your sleepwear and bathrobe for the first week or so. it is important to reset whenever the baby rests, so dress to nap at a moments notice. place a soft lounge, bean bag, or papasan chair next to where baby naps and dream alongside your newborn.

											how do i announce that i'm pregnant?
									 	

telling your partner you're pregnant
if you are looking for the right words to tell your partner you are pregnant, try giving out clues. leave out decaf coffee. put up a no smoking sign. have a bottle on non-alcoholic beer. find other lifestyle icons that will change no that you're pregnant. paint a heart on your belly and write “i love my daddy”. cover up with a bathrobe and reveal the message when you're ready.
