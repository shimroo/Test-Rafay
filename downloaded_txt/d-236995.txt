how to connect



since 1997, computing services has provided personal web site hosting to faculty, staff, and student groups at the university of minnesota 
                         morris. these web sites are a valuable service, especially in support of faculty research or teaching, providing a place to share updates and information.
in cooperation with consultative committee, assc, and other campus groups, computing services consolidated all personal web pages to a single server at personal.morris.umn.edu. you do not need to change web addresses, and your web pages will remain available, even if visitors access your page using the old location. web pages at personal.morris.umn.edu may be accessed using any of the following names:

cda.morris.umn.edu
facultypages.morris.umn.edu
studentorgs.morris.umn.edu and students.morris.umn.edu
personal.morris.umn.edu
www.morris.umn.edu

personal web pages on www.morris.umn.edu will eventually move to the personal.morris.umn.edu server. computing services will work directly with these users. you do not need to do anything for this migration, other than coordinate a convenient time with us. computing services will do all web page migrations for you.
