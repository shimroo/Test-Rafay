our mission









setting standards
alte has established a set of common standards which cover all the stages of the language testing process. these standards can be applied to exams of any language, and ensure the quality of alte members' examinations.



sustaining diversity
alte supports the learning, teaching and assessment of a wide range of languages, and promotes the recognition of qualifications in these languages across europe.



maximising impact
alte helps maximise tests' positive impact by making the connections between policy, research and practice, between language learning, teaching and assessment, and between experts in different fields and parts of the world.

who we are alte doesn't create its own language tests, but recommends its members' tests that have alte's "q-mark": the mark of language test quality, which you should refer to if you are looking for a test that has alte recognition.discover alte's history, check our list of full members and associate members, our special interest groups, or learn more about the structure and administration of our association. 

q-mark & quality auditsalte audits member organisations' tests for evidence of quality in language test development and delivery. a successful audit results in a q-mark. find out more, as well as which tests have the q-mark in the alte framework.

resourcescheck our collection of resources to support language learning, teaching and assessment. we also run a services unit which provides courses and consultancy to members and non-members.
