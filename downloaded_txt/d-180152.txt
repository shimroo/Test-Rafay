mission


the friends of the orange county animal shelter (focas) was formed in 2004 to
help support and enhance the general operation of the orange county animal
shelter. focas may also address more general animal welfare issues which affect
north carolina animals and animal shelters. 

focas is independent of orange county government.  we welcome all suggestions and strategies
that can help improve the quality of life for our shelter animals and help them
find loving homes. donations are always welcome.
