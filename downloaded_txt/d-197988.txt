            "fast, efficient, responsive, effective and customer focused  not words normally heard anywhere anytime with software support but you guys can wear that badge! thanks from a very happy customer." 
             

            a. wiggan, british columbia, canada
            



      
            "i just got stattrak for baseball. best decision i've made in a 
            long time. your baseball software is the best software and easiest to use 
            on the market bar none. i downloaded at least 5 different free software 
            programs off the internet and they were too complicated to use and not worth the time to learn how to use. your 
            guarantee that it would be easier to use turned out to be an understatement.
            in less than thirty minutes, i had my team roster in and four games entered 
            with statistical results just a click away. i am telling all my friends 
            and fellow managers to buy your program. thanks again!"
            

            j. park, saddleback valley pony baseball, ca
            




            "i used stattrak for little league 5+ years ago and was very pleased with it - 
            it just wasn't fancy. when i got back into coaching this year, i upgraded 
            to the more complicated, fancier t?-stats. to make a long and painful 
            story (complicated, surly and snippy technical support staff, 
            difficult/counter-intuitive programming, etc.) short, i am back with your 
            product and delighted with the upgrades you have made. count me as a stattrak man."
            

            h. prizer, ga
            




            "thanks so much for the immediate attention to my problem: such a response 
            is a rare exception in the business world today."
            

            e. solomon, fl
            




            "i just wanted to thank you for the excellent customer service i've received. 
            in this era when a lot of customers are not treated fairly, your service is the 
            exception."
