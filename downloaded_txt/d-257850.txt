customers: 
july
2020: tim,
the piece is beautiful! we love it. you did a fantastic job on
restoring it. we are amazed at the sound quality it has for a piece
that is well over 100 years old. and loud as well! we have already
found a place for it and when anyone comes to our house they will
notice it immediately when they come in. i am very happy with the
purchase and your service to me the customer.  jb, ny.

january, 2018: i
purchased my
beloved victor iii talking machine from you a few years ago and i must
tell you that it continues to bring me as much joy as it did the first
day i unpacked and played it.
many thanks, natalie,
au.
april 2016:
well
i finally removed all those packing peanuts (yep, you gave me a
heads-up) and assembled my beautiful victor ii phonograph. the phono
was delivered in perfect condition... 
it
was immediately obvious
that you were meticulous in reconditioning this machine! the cabinet is
lovely, the spring, gears & all mechanism in the box are very
clean, grease free and looks great. the horn and its mount really stand
out.

everything
is exactly as
you had described on your web page.

a
few cranks and we were
blown away by its sound. a few records later and my wife and i were
dancing around the living room and imagining those that were doing the
same when they first bought this phonograph back in 1906.

this
is truly an heirloom
piece. i was further convinced of this when my 30 year old son took a
look at it and asked me to update my will to show that i have left it
to him...

thank
you very much. i
would recommend your company and your work to anyone. g.b. co

"we
love the
victrola!!!  it showed up on one of the coldest november days
in
minnesota.  my 2 girls danced around while i played the 78s
that
came with it.  now every time we get it going my 1 year old
runs
up to me with her arms up to dance with papa.  thank you so
much
for having such great products and customer
service."  --
