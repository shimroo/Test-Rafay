perth concert hall redevelopmenta new tempo for perth’s home of music and entertainment.
          

   




the perth concert hall (pch) is bordered by st georges terrace to the north, government house to the west, and terrace road to the south. its location places it centrally within the vibrant urban landscape of perth and is situated in the heart of perth's
    central business district, nestled along the scenic banks of the swan river.


project backgroundas part of the $1.7 billion perth city deal, $150.3 million has been allocated to the redevelopment of the perth concert hall (pch), comprising $134.3 million from the state government, $12 million from the australian government, and $4 million from the city of perth.the investment will restore the much-loved heritage building’s architectural integrity, preserve its renowned acoustics, distinctive features and enhance the surrounding courtyards. the improved facilities will allow for broader community engagement and equitable access.the redevelopment includes:preservation of the pch’s world-renowned acoustic featuresessential structural maintenance of the award-winning building architectureupdated seating, new rehearsal spaces and improved backstage facilitiesimproved venue accessibility, with remodelling of the auditorium entry, lifts, stairs, additional toilets and box office relocationrefurbishment of the foyer areas, upgraded signage and lightingnew food and beverage offeringstransformed northern and southern forecourtsnew spaces for small events, school educational visits and training.who is involvedthe management order for the building was previously with the city of perth, now it has returned to the state, under the care of the arts and culture trust. the pch project is  governed by an inter-agency steering committee with dlgsc as the chair. the steering committee has  representation from the following state government agencies: department of local government, sport and cultural industriesdepartment of financedepartment of premier and cabinetdepartment of treasuryarts and culture trust


engagement processin preparing for the redevelopment of the pch, collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders and surrounding organisations was undertaken to determine the objectives and achievable outcomes of the project. throughout the delivery of the project, the stakeholders will continue to be engaged, to ensure the combined vision of the pch is delivered. these include:west australian symphony orchestra (waso)wa venues and events (wave)arts and culture trust (act)government agenciesperth concert hall neighboursaboriginal eldersperth concert hall userscity of perth (cop)project informationto support the concept of the redevelopment project, key objectives were created to guide its development.objectivesimprove functional and operational performance spaces. enhance and activate the precinct and public space. improve accessibility to allow enjoyment of the facility by all users. provide a home for waso. restore heritage elements and preserve world-renowned acoustic features.the journey so farthe perth concert hall was originally designed by architects jeffrey howlett and don bailey and officially opened on 26 january 1973. it was australia’s first concert hall built after world war ii and boasts a grand auditorium seating 1,731. you can view  further information on the concert hall’s history here.as the cherished home of the west australian symphony orchestra (waso), pch is now set for a major transformation. the pch redevelopment project, led by the department of local government, sport and cultural industries (dlgsc) and the department of finance, is a major initiative to improve perth's cultural facilities. the wa symphony orchestra (waso), which relies on pch for its rehearsals and performances, is also involved in providing services to the west australian opera and ballet. efforts to secure a home for waso have been underway since 2000, with commitments from both the city of perth (cop) and the wa government. the redevelopment will resolve these longstanding conversations and provide a consolidated home for waso once redevelopment is complete.designs have been through various working groups and stakeholder meetings including office of the government architect and design panel reviews to ensure the best outcome is met.


detailed designthe redevelopment of this historic building will introduce a range of enhancements designed to elevate the venue as a premier destination for the performing arts. key features of the project include improved accessibility from street level as well as improved backstage facilities, which will support patrons, artists and production teams, ensuring seamless performances and a better overall experience for all. a complete replacement of seating will not only enhance comfort but also improve sightlines in the hall, making every concert an unforgettable occasion, while preserving the building’s world class acoustics.this exciting project will realise a long-standing commitment to provide waso with a home, co-locating the administrative and orchestral staff in the one location.visitors will benefit from expansion of the level two foyer towards the river which will be home to new bar areas, providing convenient refreshment options and fostering a lively social atmosphere before and after performances. the addition of landscaped event spaces will create inviting outdoor areas for gatherings and festivals, enriching the cultural fabric of the precinct.safety and compliance upgrades will be prioritised, with enhanced lighting and features designed to ensure a secure environment for all attendees, particularly families enjoying evening events. a new fully automated stage lift will streamline production logistics, making it easier to host a diverse array of performances.these improvements will activate the perth concert hall, reinforcing its role as a vibrant cultural hub in the heart of perth. as part of a broader initiative to enhance western australia’s arts infrastructure, this redevelopment marks a significant investment into the future of performing arts in perth.
