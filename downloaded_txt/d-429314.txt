the spirit of america tour










the spirit of america tour has passed the century mark!!!
the spirit of america tour has ended its eighth season. in 2009 we continued to bring major entertainers to america’s stateside military bases.
since 9/11 the spirit of america tour has brought 115 shows to america’s armed forces
it’s no wonder that when the entertainment community talk about supporting america’s military the first name that comes up is the spirit of america tour.  simply stated we are the premiere, professional sponsor of entertainment for america’s stateside military bases.  click “concerts” on the left to see our lineup.
our shows are always free to the military family
attendance at our shows is open not only to active duty members of the army, navy, air force, marines and coast guard, but also to the national guard and reserves and all of their families along with all civilians employed at the bases where we appear.  because of our wide military reception, attendance at our shows has always been phenomenal and standing room only.
the spirit of america tour is one of the ways that major entertainers can help boost and maintain the morale of america’s armed forces and their caring families. it shows the patriotism of the entertainment industry in a most positive way.

don’t forget our motto:
