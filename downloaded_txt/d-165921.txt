diversity and inclusion
the iaa initiative on diversity and inclusion is predicated on a very simple, yet profound principle: “every actuary has the potential to significantly contribute to our profession”. the iaa is committed to deliver on our mission, and live our values, by actively encouraging more meaningful participation by women, racial minorities, geographically diverse and younger actuaries. broadening participation in our process by including all who offer a wide range of lived experiences will meaningfully improve our ability to enhance the actuarial profession globally.
