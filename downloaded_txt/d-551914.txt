about the pianistwith over 30 recordings in his discography and more than 1 billion streams and counting, emile pandolfi ranks among america’s most popular piano artists. with the majority of his performance repertoire being lush, intricate arrangements of broadway and standards that form the canon of "the great american songbook," his influences are, in fact, more classical than pop. it is this subjective layering of classical style that pandolfi infuses onto the broad palette of selections—from his beloved chopin, to andrew lloyd webber, to "once upon a december," from anastasia—performed in his live concerts and recordings that resonates with audiences everywhere.
