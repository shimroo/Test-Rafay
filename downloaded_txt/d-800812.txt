steelecitysnapshots



a photoblog from hamilton ontario












5.26.2011










exhibit and sale of steelcitysnapshots kicks off today and thru to the end of june at our own staircase theatre.  check out the link below for details.  randy steele was robbed by fate.  cancer stole him from his family, his friends and his city.  while he was alive he spent every moment living.  randy endlessly improved himself and the world surrounding him.  when randy was well he was a famous news reporter revered by all for his down to earth style and investigative reporting.  the cancer attacked his lovely voice, his charming looks but not the essence that was randy.  when randy became too ill to work as a reporter, he turned to his camera and became a recorder.  he continued to do what he had always done, capturing hamilton in a down to earth and investigative way.  every one of his 12000 images gives us a fresh look on our city and world.  when randy walked our world he showed it to us through live hits on the tv.  so it is not surprising that after his death his timeless pictures are still giving us fresh insight into our city and ourselves.  hugh macleod, owner staircase theatre and cafe

i love this one,
that 1930's shade of green paint.  i think its inside the lister block but correct me if i'm wrong please.


















i've been trying to look  thru the 600 photos that randy posted so i did not duplicate any but since time seems to be what i have the least of, i'm just going to go ahead with images that i love.  if he had already chosen them, then they meant something to each of us and that's pretty cool.   very soon kincardine tourism will have a facebook page of randy's shots around the cottage, a very much loved place in lurgan beach and will also be using  them throughout their publications and sites.  i'm thinking of posting some of keltie's shots, she has a good eye.    framed prints can be purchased at the focus gallery, the regent health centre and the staircase theatre, all linked here.  unframed prints can be purchased at the staircase theatre.  both can be purchased through me by email.  cheers, its april 1st, warm weather cannot possibly be that far off!!

hamilton, ontario, canada
randy steele  september 13, 1961 - may 22, 2009.   it's hard to capture a life in a few sentences, especially one that was lived as large as randy's but here are a few highlights.  in 1995 randy started working at ch television and went on to become one of the viewer's favourite reporters covering issues at hamilton city hall and eventually producing his own segment "steele's town".  in 2001 randy was diagnosed with throat cancer.  from 2003-2009 the cancer returned unrelentingly but with just as much force he fought back.  in 2004, at the suggestion of a friend, randy took up photography--it was the moment he went from being in front of a camera to being  behind one.  randy took over 12,000 photos between 2004 and 2009.  his love for his family,  the cottage in lurgan beach, kincardine, and the city of hamilton are all captured with his passionate and artistic eye.   shannon, carly, keltie, randi and i are very proud of randy's photos and have chosen to share more of them with you.  enjoy!
