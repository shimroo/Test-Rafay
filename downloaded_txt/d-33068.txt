where science meets nature


















earth friendly

species specific fertilizers help to reduce over or under fertilization, which helps to reduce runoff of excess nutrients.









scientifically formulated

each and every formula we send to market is researched and developed by commercial growers and land grant universities through years of trial and error.












species specific

there are at least 17 elements known to be essential to plant health, but not every plant requires the same amount of these elements. when using species specific fertilizers, you are ensuring your plant has exactly the amount of nutrients it needs.









premium performance

commercial growers rely on the best quality of formulations to achieve maximum growth and yield from their plants. why shouldn’t you, too?
