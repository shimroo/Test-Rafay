      introduction - contents 

     the 
        school page was created so as 
        to provide information for students and parents at the lycée pasteur 
        on efl class progression and assignments, homework, activities, newspaper, 
        projects online, french programs and also for teachers working in the 
        french system. it also contains a page with exercises 
        and activities created by our teachers.

             as i had collected a great amount of data 
        for my own teaching, i decided to share it with all people interested 
        by opening a students' and 
        a teachers' page with links 
        and resources i found useful. 

 
             the 
        e-pals and online projects page gives addresses and suggestions for 
        students and teachers on how to contact correspondents and what to do 
        to plan and conduct a successful project. from there you can also go to 
        our own project 
        page to see examples of completed or ongoing activities.

             the english 
        speaking countries page contains information on the english language 
        and lots of links to all continents where english is spoken. the brazil 
        page contains a lesson plan, cultural quizzes, photographs of foz 
        de iguaçu, parati and parati mirim and links to more information 
        .. it was created in order to help our students to read/write in english 
        about their country as they often correspond with foreign e-pals. it can 
        also be used by teachers who have brazil on their program.i hope you find 
        this site useful and recommend it to your friends. 

             for 
        any suggestions or links, e-mail 
        me and don't forget to sign the guestbook.


     thank 
        you for your time and visit :-)
