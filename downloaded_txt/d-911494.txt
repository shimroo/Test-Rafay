happy customers

customer satisfaction is our ultimate goal. see what our customers are saying about us.












 the reason i went with you guys to develop our new website was due to difficulties dealing with our current website provider for ten years or so, and i wanted to deal with a more one to one company. michael has exceeded any expectations i had in regard to understanding what i wanted even when i didn’t always know myself. 


tony from the library supply company






 michael has been great to work with. all issues rapidly resolved. appreciate the help for our non-profit housing trust to get a revamped website. 


brendon from marlborough sustainable housing trust






 overall we are absolutely thrilled with the new site! you guys have done a superb job and were a pleasure to work with.  


boston from carfé






 we employed utopia recently to review, revise and update our website for a more modern look and functionality.  the quote was modest so we went ahead and we were not disappointed for a moment.  michael was professional, efficient and helpful with our many queries regarding options; he also helped keep the project on track for time.  we couldn’t be happier with the result so this project was a great success for us thanks to utopia! 


teresa from gascoigne wicks lawyers






 we are both super happy with the website! it looks fantastic. we have had plenty of great feedback from clients and friends. also, our team that work for us are very impressed. 
 thanks again for the help and service you gave us.
