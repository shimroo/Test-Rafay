about us





the international research foundation for rsd / crps is a not-for-profit organization (501c3) dedicated to education and research on reflex sympathetic dystrophy and complex regional pain syndrome. the primary mission of the foundation
                            is to establish an international research network which will help educate medical professionals and support research worldwide.
reflex sympathetic dystrophy, known as rsd, is a chronic neurological disease which affects millions of people around the world. this disease is also known as complex regional pain syndrome or crps.
the foundation was the first to publish a study demonstrating the optimal dosing of ketamine required to treat
                            crps.
