reproductive justice: abortion access




on june 24, 2022, the supreme court of the united states overturned the landmark case, roe v. wade. for the first time since roe was decided on january 22, 1973, abortion is no longer constitutionally protected in the united states. state governments now hold the power to determine where abortion care will be available, and states around the nation are working diligently to ban access to abortion in the wake of this decision. as we navigate a world without roe’s constitutional protections, advocates have taken to the polls and to the streets pushing for accessible abortion care and the right to reproductive care—and ywca continues to advocate at federal, state, and local levels to restore this essential right.
