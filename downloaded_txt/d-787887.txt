thank you arizona!

after 46 years of business, we have closed this iconic location. the tomaso's legacy will continue at all of our locations, the italian daughter, the sicilian butcher, the mexicano, and hash kitchen. in january 2024, the new tomaso's legacy, il masseto, will open off camelback road and 32nd street.we look forward to serving you all soon as we embark on the next chapter of continuing tomasoâ€™s legacy.
