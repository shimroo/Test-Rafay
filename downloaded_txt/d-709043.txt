bristol research initiative for the dynamic global environment (bridge)


our research is centred on understanding the past, present, and future earth system, with a focus on climate and biogeochemical modelling, and geochemistry.

climate and earth system modelling
through numerical modelling, we aim to understand past and present climates, and to use this understanding to better predict future climates.
biogeochemical and earth system modelling
we use numerical models to understand biogeochemical dynamics and feedbacks in the earth system over a large range of spatial and temporal scales and to elucidate their role in past, present and future climates.
geochemistry
we use a wide-range of deposits, including stalagmites from caves, but also bone, coral and sediments, to obtain high-resolution records of past temperature, sea levels, vegetation change, faunal evolution.
