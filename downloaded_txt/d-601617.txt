it’s always a vibe!



since 1996, the island reggae music of natural vibrations has colored the memories of our lives in hawai‘i, the pacific islands, and beyond. an entire generation of fans have joined the group on their seven full-length album musical journey, from backyard parties to playing alongside legends like gregory isaacs, ub40, and ziggy marley. natural vibrations’ current lineup includes both essential founding members and established homegrown musicians. chart-topping hits like “put a little love,” “balls rolling,” and “you and i” continue to be sung word for word and bring people together at performances no matter where they go.
