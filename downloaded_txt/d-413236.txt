the raaf school on penang island functioned as a pre-school, primary and secondary school for dependants of royal australian air force personnel deployed at butterworth from 1962 to 1988. 
read the school history page to learn more about raaf school and schooling prior to 1962.
raaf school closed in 1988, but the memories last forever! read the history, peruse student and staff biographies, attend reunions, see class photos, sign the guestbook and enjoy a trip down memory lane!
to find the main resource area for history and photos, go to 'photographs' from the photos menu item above.
"....our school book was the whole wide world
and raaf school but one page
we all remember gladly 
now we are come of age."
