                gallery 
                statement

azoth 
              gallery is a community and international forum for the exhibition 
              of the work of emerging and established artists. it is a virtual 
              gallery and a physical exhibition space in several intermittent 
              venues. its central focus is in the field of progressive and avant-garde 
              visual ideas, though it is not limited to abstract or modernist 
              art. 

azoth defined: < arabic 1477: al - or  
              az - : the, za'uq : mercury > in alchemy: "the 
              mercury" was the first principle of all the metals. in 
              the chemistry of the middle ages up to the 16th century, alchemy 
              was limited to the pursuit of the transmutation of metals, the search 
              for the alkahest (mercury is the universal solvent in which all 
              metals dissolve) and the panacea (the universal elixir of health, 
              longevity, and consciousness.) 

independent 
                curator johnes ruta, originally from stratford, ct, is a consultant 
                with several art galleries in connecticut and new york city. he 
                is an artist representative, collector, activist and theorist 
                of art, philosophy, and science history, and periodically sponsors 
                forums on these subjects. mr. ruta is a published author of surrealist 
                writings exploring the unconscious. he has been a business analyst, 
                computer programmer since 1978, and now a web designer. from 1973 
                to 1978, he was the managing editor & theatre critic of the 
                entertainer, a cultural newsmagazine in fairfield and new haven 
                counties. from 1988 to 2005, he was the art director of the york 
                square gallery in new haven, and from september 1, 2005 to august 
                31, 2015 of the gallery of the new haven free public library. 
                he is an associate curator for gallery rivaa on roosevelt island, 
                nyc, also for hagaman memorial east haven library, lyric hall 
                in westville, ct, and other venues. he lives in westville, and 
                is a representative for new haven on the cable tv advisory council, 
                also board vice president of the the 
                william meredith foundation for the late u.s. poet laureate, 
                and a trustee of the william 
                kent charitable foundation for the late sculptor. as an "art 
                theorist," he works to understand and support issues of creativity, 
                form, expression, and cultural transition. 




 




                vision statement 

~ 
                johnes ruta 


 the 
                goal of my research, and my public works as an independent curator 
                since 1988 and as an art theorist, is to develop a visual vocabulary 
                which reflects the positive criteria of creative originality & 
                culture, technical and aesthetic qualities, and the inherent depths 
                of forms and themes. 
since 2001, i have organized 
                and sponsored seven free forums in new haven, ct, each presenting 
                three-day weekend presentations of lecturers from all over the 
                us on art, philosophical, scientific, and architectural history, 
                and mythology through the ages. 
                for details, please see http://azothgallery.com/symposia.html
i have also attended historical 
                conferences in prague (1995 & 1997), 
                granada, spain & marrakesh (2007), and ortigia sicily (2014), 
                and many in new york city. 
 as an independent curator, 
                i do whatever i can, working with artists of all ages and talents, 
                to bring about greater cultural exchange, awareness, acceptance 
                and enthusiasm for the arts. my vision is to apply the experience 
                of my travels to art museums and galleries around the us and europe, 
                as well as my studies, to create an international center for the 
                arts in new haven. this center would offer programs in art history 
                and appreciation, and bring artists’ work from abroad to 
                the us, and would offer us artists the opportunity to see their 
                work exported to foreign venues and recognition. 
the historical parallels 
                between science and creative culture are a continuing evolution. 
                i support the non-linear expressions in contemporary art, but 
                remain fascinated by the recurrent themes found especially in 
                periods of technological or intellectual transition -- such as 
                the parallels of classical antiquity , the renaissance, the theory 
                of the baroque, and the romantic movement. advances in astronomy, 
                medicine, and transportation parallel with those in music, the 
                visual arts, and philosophy are investigated and charted. 
-- as a well-known arts 
                activist, i try to look into the distant future to see the eventualities 
                of present actions and the potential manifestations of the human 
                psyche; also looking into the past, through which a light-stream 
                of creative expressions has illuminated a path of human survival, 
                thought, and dignity : the forces of preservation, aesthetics, 
                and enlightenment -- against trends of decay and intolerance.
