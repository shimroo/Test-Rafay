						"…i would like to say that - allot of people get gifts at christmas and never forget them - the greatest gift i have ever received was that our paths crossed. you helped me notice and appreciate the passion i have for the art you have shown me! i shall never forget the magic and beauty that you create, teach and instill!"

"…each time i make an arrangement i think of my mentor phil rulloda… i pray that i will one day return to your school."

						"…thank you for your knowledge, your effort and hard work!

"floral boot camp" wasn't easy, it was a hard earned effort, and i am grateful! except from graduating from college, i count the experience with you all as cherished!

never doubt your worth, your sacrifice, and when i need a refresher and/or a kick in the pants. i know where you are!"
