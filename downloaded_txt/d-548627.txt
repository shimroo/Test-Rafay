what people say about us 



resident testimonials 














						been a braintree resident my entire life and never been without power for days. lost it for 20 minutes today. stay safe you guys are the best.					
keri a.braintree resident 











						thank you beld! extraordinary, above and beyond service as always. stay safe					
thomas f.braintree resident 











						we've been living in braintree for 35+ years and the longest we've been without power was with hurricane bob back in 1991 and it was only for a couple hours. most times we're back up and running after about an hour or less. this is not to say that it can't be longer but the point of my comment is that beld linemen work as fast as they can and it's much appreciated. i remember after hurricane gloria in 1985 when i lived in another town we were without power for about 2 weeks.					
noel g.braintree resident 











						another shout out to the people working at beld. getting the power back on in crazy weather conditions has got to be difficult.					
greg h.braintree resident 











						was sure feeling blessed to have full power all day yesterday home with the kids! 8 years in braintree and haven't lost power yet! one of the best parts about living in braintree. thanks for all your hard work!					
carolyn o.braintree resident 











						i have attended functions in which beld hosted.  i have not seen a more compassionate and helpful business who cares about braintree.  this is hard to believe a big business cares for it's customers.  it's no longer the customer is right as business have developed a  we don't respect your thoughts , but you will respect ours or you can go somewhere else or go without demonstrated by banks, craft stores, supermarkets and so on!!  but, not by beld.					
roberta t.braintree resident 











						be careful out there. u guys do a hell of a job keeping braintree power on. u guys are the best.					
joey r.braintree resident 











						thank you, beld. it's not only the power plants; it's the constant maintenance you do on the distribution network, that has made such a difference in these big storms! the big companies neglect all these things in favor of profits.					
marje s.braintree resident 











						i feel grateful to have such efficient electric company in the town.					
carlos v.braintree resident 











						always on duty.
always present and visible throughout the community.
always to the rescue.
best to have your own electric utility.
