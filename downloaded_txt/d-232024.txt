bird problems are simple
a solution thatâs as easy as 1, 2, 3



01
pre-bait site
establish feeding sites with grains or corn that match your avitrol product and build the birds trust in that feeding source.



02
go live
mix in the right amount of avitrol grains. affected birds will emit distress signals to scare the rest of the flock away.



03
follow-up
keep avitrol baiting trays on site with pre-bait and check back periodically for any signs of activity.

what people say about us
read some of the testimonials from our amazing clients






our company does alot of bird work in southern california. we decided that it made more sense to treat our bird problems exclusively with avitrol grains and havenât looked back since.

by jason p.pest control in ca










we had quite a problem with house sparrows in our machine sheds and barns for a number of years. after using avitrol for just one season, we havenât seen a single bird since.

by teresa c.farmer in oh










our private garages were constantly covered in pigeon droppings. we hired an avitrol applicator to come out and apply this season, and it looks like weâre bird free for the first time!
