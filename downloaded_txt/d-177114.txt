 our vision  the creation and administration of this web page will be for the exclusive purpose of historical education and genealogical research related to those individuals who were from the former carpathian territories and were of carpatho-rusyn heritage.  since the inception of our site in 1998 we have continued to expand into a valuable tool for carpatho-rusyn research. we could not have accomplished this without the support of our dedicated readers. at this time we would like to thank everyone who shared their essays, photographs, and historical documentation. please assist tcc to keep the memory of âour peopleâ alive by contributing to our site.   as always tcc will remain a free and independent web-site for anyone interested in researching their carpatho-rusyn ancestry. 
 
please note that the  carpathian connection is not associated with c-rs connection an affiliate  of the carpatho-rusyn society
