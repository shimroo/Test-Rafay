				lost a star due to unfriendly and rude host. however server, noah, more than made up for her attitude. great food, great location, great service. we dined here the day before hurricane helene and we are so sorry to hear how badly indian shores has been affected.read moreread less

				this place was amazing! we had great steak, chicken, pork, snapper, and mahi. joey provided excellent customer service too! he went the extra mile when walking us through the menu!read moreread less 












traybn8/11/2024


				nice ambiance. we sat by a window overlooking the inlet. our server, david, took good care of us. our meals were better than average but not what we were expecting considering their prices. true to their name our food seemed overly salted. it was worth the visit but there are other places i would recommend first.read moreread less 












bookthetriptracyp7/15/2024


				this was our third time since oct 2023, and we live in missouri!  we have enjoyed the service and food all three times.  our server for our first visit was bailey and our kids look for him every visit since.  michael was our server last week and he was great, too.  the grouper, red snapper, mahi and escargot, all delish!read moreread less
