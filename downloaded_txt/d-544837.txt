albertson soccer
the albertson soccer club has set a mission to provide children with a positive soccer experience, which incorporates the development of good skills, team participation and fun. by playing on an albertson team, it is hoped each child will develop self-confidence, appreciate team cooperation, and respect teammates, opposing players, coaches and referees. children should learn to value the ability to win and lose graciously. “growth through good sportsmanship” is the “life lesson” we hope to impart to our players - a lesson which can only be taught by the behavior of all participants, coaches, referees, parents and other spectators.












































professional coaching
our stable of coaches boasts an impressive array of experience, knowledge, and professionalism. our staff is not made of part-time parents. flavio ferri, our director of coaching, is a former pro player and li rough riders head coach. his staff are all coaching professionals with extensive experience and qualifications
