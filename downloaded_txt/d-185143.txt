	< pictures & write-up from this event >
  
team bbqbydan (rick & karen streiff, dan 
	& barbara cannon) head out to twentynine palms marine base to provide 
	support to the california bbq association (cbbqa) as well as many volunteers 
	in providing a bbq dinner to the marines and their dependents at the 
	twentynine palms marine base sports field.  we will all go out on 
	friday, arriving in the early afternoon to prep meats, setup smokers, and 
	cook the traditional award winning bbq faire that we all do so often.  
	all bbq groups and volunteers are  contributing (at no charge) their 
	time, efforts, equipment, and fuels. 
	friday evening late afternoon and evening will be dedicated to unwrapping, 
	trimming, and seasoning 350 full size briskets.  that would be 4,662 
	pounds.  yes, it takes a lot of brisket to feed 18,000 folks.  
	briskets will come off the cookers early saturday, go into warmers, then 
	quartered and buffalo chopped, then into foil pans, and into the final 
	warmers ready to serve for dinner.  chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs 
	will also be served.  this is the 5th year that team bbqbydan has had 
	the privilege of being a part of this great event.  
 
		
	del king is one of the originators, catalysts, and unbroken link that keeps 
	these events happening.  he keeps the military involved, all the 
	volunteers updated, events planned, and is ready on a moments notice to do 
	an event like this anywhere.
