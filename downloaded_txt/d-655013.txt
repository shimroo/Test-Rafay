research highlights


 

trying to solve a key black hole mystery: simulating magnetic flows around black holes
black holes have been fascinating subjects of study, not just because they are cosmic vacuum cleaners, but also as engines of immense power capable of extracting and redistributing energy on a staggering scale. these dark giants are…

quantum billiard balls: digging deeper into light-assisted atomic collisions 
when atoms collide, their exact structure—for example, the number of electrons they have or even the quantum spin of their nuclei—has a lot to say about how they bounce off each other. this is especially true for atoms cooled to near-…

diamonds are forever—but not in nanodevices
ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors—such as diamond—are promising for next-generation electronics due to a larger energy gap between the valence and conduction bands, allowing them to handle higher voltages, operate at higher frequencies,…

building a safer and more affordable nuclear clock
in the quest for ultra-precise timekeeping, scientists have turned to nuclear clocks. unlike optical atomic clocks—which rely on electronic transitions—nuclear clocks utilize the energy transitions in the atom’s nucleus, which are less…

no cavity, no party: free-space atoms give superradiant transition a pass
isolated atoms in free space radiate energy at their own individual pace. however, atoms in an optical cavity interact with the photons bouncing back and forth from the cavity mirrors, and by doing so, they coordinate their photon…

creating a global map of different physics laboratory classes 
physics lab courses are vital to science education, providing hands-on experience and technical skills that lectures can’t offer. yet, it’s challenging for those in physics education research (per) to compare course to course,…

a 3d ion magnet, the new experimental frontier for quantum information processing 
many quantum devices, from quantum sensors to quantum computers, use ions or charged atoms trapped with electric and magnetic fields as a hardware platform to process information. 
however, current trapped-ion systems face…

mapping noise to improve quantum measurements 
one of the biggest challenges in quantum technology and quantum sensing is “noise”–seemingly random environmental disturbances that can disrupt the delicate quantum states of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum information. looking…

the interference of many atoms, and a new approach to boson sampling
in daily life, when two objects are “indistinguishable,” it’s due to an imperfect state of knowledge. as a street magician scrambles the cups and balls, you could, in principle, keep track of which ball is which as they are passed…

hungry, hungry white dwarfs: solving the puzzle of stellar metal pollution
dead stars known as white dwarfs, have a mass like the sun while being similar in size to earth. they are common in our galaxy, as 97% of stars are white dwarfs. as stars reach the end of their lives, their cores collapse into the dense…

twisting and binding matter waves with photons in a cavity
precisely measuring the energy states of individual atoms has been a historical challenge for physicists due to atomic recoil. when an atom interacts with a photon, the atom “recoils” in the opposite direction, making it difficult to…

cold coulomb crystals, cosmic clues: unraveling the mysteries of space chemistry
while it may not look like it, the interstellar space between stars is far from empty. atoms, ions, molecules, and more reside in this ethereal environment known as the interstellar medium (ism). the ism has fascinated scientists for…

squeezing in the dark of a superradiant roller coaster
while atomic clocks are already the most precise timekeeping devices in the universe, physicists are working hard to improve their accuracy even further. one way is by leveraging spin-squeezed states in clock atoms. spin-squeezed states…
