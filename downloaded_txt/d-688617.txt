 had to have our rv and truck towed to campsite, what an ordeal but darlene has been such a huge blessing, from letting us get packages delivered to the office ( and she would actually bring them to us) and always gathering our trash!

 perfect campground to stay during the rally. . very clean, well kept, quiet, and super nice staff. we stayed for the entire 10 nights and already booked next year. very quiet at night. after a day of riding or hanging downtown or at a concert it’s great to have a clean quiet place to sleep. amazing views from the north section too!
