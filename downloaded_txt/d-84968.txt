what is staphylococcus?







what is staphylococcus?



staphylococcus is a group of bacteria that can cause a number of diseases as a result of infection of various tissues of the body. staphylococcus is more familiarly known as staph (pronounced "staff"). staph-related illness can range from mild and requiring no treatment to severe and potentially fatal.

the name staphylococcus comes from the greek staphyle, meaning a bunch of grapes, andkokkos, meaning berry, and that is what staph bacteria look like under the microscope, like a bunch of grapes or little round berries. (in technical terms, these are gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, usually unencapsulated cocci.)

staphylococcus





     todar's online textbook of bacteriology      staphylococcus © 2005 kenneth todar university of wisconsin-madison department of bacteriology staphylococcus aureus. electron micrograph from  visuals unlimited, with permission.  the staphylococci staphylococci are gram-positive spherical bacteria that occur in microscopic clusters resembling grapes. bacteriological culture of the nose and skin of normal humans invariably yields staphylococci. in 1884, rosenbach described the two pigmented colony types of staphylococci and proposed the appropriate nomenclature: staphylococcus aureus (yellow) and staphylococcus albus (white). the latter species is now named staphylococcus epidermidis. although more than 20 species of staphylococcus are described in bergey's manual (2001), only staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis are significant in their interactions with humans. s. aureus colonizes mainly the nasal passages, but it may be found regularly in most other anatomical locales. s epidermidis is an inhabitant of the skin.  taxonomically, the genus staphylococcus is in the bacterial family staphylococcaceae, which includes three lesser known genera, gamella, macrococcus and salinicoccus. the best-known of its nearby phylogenetic relatives are the members of the genus bacillus in the family bacillaceae, which is on the same level as the family staphylococcaceae. the listeriaceae are also a nearby family.

staph infections





  kidshealth > parents >   infections >   bacterial & viral infections >   staph infections  conditions known as staph infections  are those caused by the bacteria staphylococcus aureus. many healthy  people carry staph bacteria in their noses without getting sick. but when the skin is punctured or broken, staph bacteria can  enter the wound and cause infections, which can lead to other health  problems.     you can help prevent your child from  developing a staph infection by encouraging regular hand washing, keeping  your child's skin clean with a daily bath, and keeping areas that have been cut  clean or covered.     how do  staph infections spread?staph can spread through the air, on  contaminated surfaces, and from person to person. a child can carry staph  bacteria from one area of his or her body to another on dirty hands and under  dirty fingernails. staph can pass from person to person the same way. so hand  washing is the most important way to prevent staph infections from  developing.   you can also help prevent staph skin  infections by keeping your child's skin clean with a daily bath or shower. if  your child has a skin condition such as eczema  that makes frequent bathing difficult, it's a good idea to speak with your  child's doctor.   keep areas of the skin that have been  injured - cuts, scrapes, and rashes caused by allergic  reactions or poison ivy - clean and covered, and use any other treatments  that your doctor suggests.

methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)





'superbug' outbreaks occurring in children, otherwise healthy people   reviewed by michael smith, mdapril 20, 2004 -- a dangerous antibiotic-resistant infection once primarily confined to hospitals appears to be spreading in communities, affecting children and otherwise healthy people.  in years past, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was seen almost exclusively among very sick hospital patients. however, in recent years, an increasing number of reports of mrsa in the community have surfaced. and this week new research detailing alarming outbreaks of mrsa infection on opposite ends of the u.s. was presented in philadelphia at the annual meeting of the society from healthcare epidemiology of america.

zoonotic infections





  zoonotic infections           zoonoses are diseases transmitted through or from animals to humans. the largest percentage of pets is dogs (32%), followed by cats (27%). dogs: rabies is a well known infection transmitted from dogs. the less common ones are reviewed here. dog bites usually involve a mixture of organisms, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, corynebacterium, pasteurella, and anaerobic species. the family dog is a reservoir for group a streptococci, which have purportedly caused recurrent pharyngitis in families. staphylococcus aureus can be transmitted between humans and dogs and may therefore be a source for unexplained relapsing infections. parasites of dogs occasionally establish a "wormhold" in humans. a child who often visits a neighborhood park shared by local dogs may develop symptoms of ocular, visceral, or cutaneous larva migrans. prevention is vital in avoiding these parasites.  http://www.indegene.com
