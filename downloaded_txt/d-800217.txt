our organization
in september of 1979, eight rankin inlet residents created the “sappujjijit alcohol and drug educational counselling service”. later; in 1987, sappujjijit formally became associated with the canadian association of friendship centres, where additional funding was then recieved. as a result, their name became “sappujjijit friendship centre”. finally, in 1998, sappujjijit friendship centre was granted status as a registered charity. thus began the legacy of pulaarvik kablu friendship centre.
