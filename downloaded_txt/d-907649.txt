butterfly boutique:
                          statement of our purpose
butterfly boutique is  not an "association" of any kind.

we are a business and our products are  professional butterfly breeding manuals, online workshops, and 
                            consulting services.  we sponsor a free  educational mailing list that is open to butterfly 
                            farmers, butterfly exhibitors, hobbyists,  scientists and groups world-wide that love 
                            raising butterflies.  we also offer a  free group site for butterfly enthusiasts that is just for fun.  there are no dues, memberships or politics  involved in any of our activities.
                            we are simply about butterfly raising  education.
