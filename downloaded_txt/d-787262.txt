			sleep apnea
		
		 and snoring using simple, effective, and non-invasive solutions. thanks to our unique expertise, we can eliminate these chronic problems and provide long-lasting relief for decades to come.
		


always fatigued & sleepy

				do you end up feeling tired throughout the day no matter how much you
				sleep at night? if so, then you could be one of the millions of
				americans suffering from sleep apnea. luckily, we can provide easy, effective sleep apnea treatment in fort worth with a small, custom-made oral
				appliance worn only to bed,
				helping you start feeling great in the morning again.
			


excessive snoring

				if your snoring is so bad that you regularly hear complaints about it
				from those you share space with, it may be time for an intervention.
				snoring isnât just annoying â itâs also one of the most common symptoms
				of sleep apnea and can negatively affect your quality of life even if
				itâs not indicative of a more serious health problem.
			


headaches & migraines

				is your head constantly pounding, and you have no clue why? one of the
				most common and least known causes of chronic headaches and migraines is
				a strained or misaligned tmj, or jaw joint. a problem in this joint can
				easily create pain that radiates throughout the entire head, but by
				addressing it directly, we can treat the root cause.
			


head, neck & jaw pain

				does your jaw feel stiff, click and pop all of the time, or even become
				stuck while opening or closing? this could stem from a problem in your
				jaw joints. we can help identify the underlying cause of your
				pain, and using personalized tmj treatment in fort worth, make it go away and stay gone
				for good.

				tmj/tmd. dr. conditt is one of fewer than five dentists in the metroplex
				with certification in the method from las vegas institute for advanced
				dentistry to realign one's bite. his pricing compared very favorably to

frequently asked questions
chances are that you’ve heard of sleep apnea and tmj disorder, but you may not be entirely sure how they work or how they can be treated. naturally, our team can answer any sleep apnea or tmj questions you might have. but why wait to get answers when you can start learning more right now? below are some faqs that include questions that many patients tend to have when they’re suffering from sleep-disordered breathing or chronic jaw pain.

what happens if sleep apnea is left untreated?
some people are tempted to leave their sleep apnea untreated. however, this is never a good decision. having your sleep constantly interrupted by pauses in your breathing can significantly increase your risk for dangerous health issues such as strokes and heart disease. on top of that, sleep apnea often leaves you feeling excessively drowsy and can interfere with your ability to concentrate, which can lead to accidents at work and on the road.
simply put, the safest thing to do when you believe that you have sleep apnea is to seek a diagnosis as soon as you can. a sleep test can help confirm the nature of your sleep disorder and how severe it is; this information is critical in determining the best next steps for treatment.
is an oral appliance better than a cpap machine?
it depends on the situation. oral appliances tend to work best for mild to moderate cases of sleep apnea; if your disorder is particularly severe, you will most likely need to consider other forms of treatment. that being said, if you find your cpap machine to be too noisy or uncomfortable to the point where you stop using it altogether, then a comfortable, completely silent oral appliance is definitely worth considering.
what is the best tmj treatment?
at our office, we often recommend customized oral splints for treating a tmj disorder. the appliance will help your jaw find a better resting position so that the muscles, ligaments, and nerves around the temporomandibular joint have a chance to rest. it should be noted that we take a neuromuscular approach to tmj treatment, meaning we view the jaw, head, and neck as a single system; this makes it easier to identify and treat the real source of the problem. in certain situations, orthodontic corrections or restorative treatments may be required.
can i treat tmj disorder myself?
there are steps you can take at home that can help lessen the pain caused by your tmj disorder. for example, you can switch to a soft food diet in order to avoid overworking the muscles in your jaw. on top of that, stretching and massaging your jaw muscles can often help. and of course, applying an ice pack to the area can go a long way toward reducing your discomfort. of course, at-home remedies are no substitute for having your tmj disorder diagnosed and treated by a professional.
