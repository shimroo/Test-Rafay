mm news



mm phone hours are 9:00 am to 3:00 pm pacific time (monday-friday, excluding holidays) so we have time to answer emails, return phone calls, and process orders to get them out to you.

 















 
we handcraft our parts right here in california; we don’t import mm parts from overseas. demand can outpace supply, so order early and reserve what you need. fans agree: our famous design, engineering, and quality is worth the wait! we’ll get it to you asap, and thanks for your patience.

mm’s s197 test mule, v1.0
this extremely-yellow mustang was our first s197 r&d car. acquired by mm in december of 2004, we tested it at buttonwillow raceway before its first oil change. while we used it primarily to develop our s197 parts, we installed a unique suspension as a design study for display at the 2005 sema show. we replaced the 2005 in early 2014 with test mule v2.0, a 2014 model. this 2005 still visits us occasionally. its new owner is local, and uses it as his track-day car. he comes by when he needs new hawk brake pads for the track. photo by john thawley iii.
