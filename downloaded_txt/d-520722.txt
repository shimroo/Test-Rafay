a new change...
as of a few weeks ago my mom and brother moved in with us for a short while.  its been great now major problems.  this last friday my brother was granted full custody of my nephew.  thats great news for us all!! we now have him living in the home full time not just every other week like before.  now comes the hard part of deprograming the negative attitude and sassiness.  we will see how this goes over the next few weeks.  fingers crossed its not going to be that difficult.

                     we love wednesdays
at least mom and dad love wednesdays.  the kids not so much,  they are asked to head to bed earlier than normal so daddy and i can watch our shows, we watch the middle, modern family, and suburgatory.  great shows!       the last week has been so hectic.  the kids had there bowling birthday parties, they went great.   they ended up with a ton of gifts,  they love gift cards!  i have to say all the gifts were very nice and well thought out.   i was going to have aj fill out his thank you cards but when he came home he wasn't feeling well at all so i had him just get his homework done.      katie went school yesterday to find her friend irish was transferred into her class from next door.  i thought she would have been more excited about it.  eh, kids you never know how they will react to things.   i hope katie continues to do well in school and stays at the top of her class.

hello everyone!
im lauren and i'm new to this, so please don't judge me to harshly.  heres a little about me im 30 yrs old. i live in las vegas, nv.  im married to my wonderful husband tony for over 7 yrs now.  we have two beautiful children, aj 7 and katie 4.  they both just had there birthday party this last saturday.  i have recently realized how fast they are growing up and wished i started documenting more of the everyday stuff that has occurred sooner.  i guess its better late than never!

    so, i woke up the other day and realized my kids are getting older fast!  oh no!  when they were younger i wanted them to hurry up and get bigger so they would be easier.  hahaha, right.  that hasn't worked out.  they are great kids and truly give little to complain about.  i think you just always think 'well, if they could just hold a bottle themselves it would be easier.  or,  if they could just use the restroom by themselves it would be easier'.   so you realize they are old!  but with there new age comes new challenges.  thats why they say' it doesn't get easier just changes'.  
    it doesn't seem like a loaded statement when you have a infant wondering if your life will get lighter in the kid-work load, it just sounds like a lazy answer to the question " does it get easier?".   my mother in-law told me " you never tell a pregnant person or someone that wants kids how tough it is.  you always just tell them its wonderful and they are strictly bundles of joy.  its the mom code."  lol.  really?  that seem a little mean.
    but if people really know how much work it is no one would want kids.  its a 80/20 plan.  you wonder why you had kids 80 percent of the time and think this was such a great idea 20 percent.  when you look back though you see it as 80 percent of the time it was so wonderful ( which parenthood is wonderful don't get me wrong) and only 20 percent was hard.  i think its the body and minds way to stay sane.  it just blocks out all the hard work from the different stages of you child's growth, and all you mostly remember is the fun, cute and adorable stuff. 



   my kids are currently getting along and play together well.  thank god.  aj is in first grade and wavers in his like for school on the inside but claims to like it all the time.  he's a good student but lacks the confidence to show he knows his stuff all the time.  i need to figure away to help him stay confident to maintain a healthy grade average. 
   katie is very smart.. she has always learned with ease.  aj was always smart but unlike katie has the confidence issue.  katie is very sure of herself. she is a bit shy but even that doesn't inhibit her in school or her dance.  when she's in school and asked a question she will put her shyness away to answer it or demonstrate what it is she's asked.  now aj is very outgoing socially unlike katie.  he loves to preform, sing, and dance.   he's always the first to make friends.  he's our little salesman.  as for now aj is caring a c in reading.  it was just a a not even a month ago.  how does a grade drop that fast?  i would think you would have to try.  thats his goal for now to get his grade back up.  

i hope this new year has been good you and yours so far. 
i will be checking back in for updates and new family adventures.  see you all soon!
