one black goat
















the joke behind the one black goat site:
a english missionary gets sent into deepest darkest africa and goes to live with a tribe there. he spends years with the people, teaching them to read, write and the good christian ways of the white man. one thing he particularly stresses is the evils of sexual sin. thou must not commit adultery or fornication!!
one day, the wife of one of the tribe’s noblemen gives birth to a white child. the village is shocked and the chief is sent by his people to talk with the missionary. ‘you have taught us of the evils of sexual sin, yet here a black woman gives birth to a white child. you are the only white man that has ever set foot in our village. it doesn’t take a genius to work out what has been going on!’
the missionary replies: ‘no, no, my good man. you are mistaken. what you have here is a natural occurence – some things just can’t be explained. look to thy yonder field. see a field of white goats, and yet amongst them is one black one. nature does this on occasion.’the chief pauses for a moment then says, ‘tell you what, you don’t say anything about the black goat, i won’t say anything about the white child.’

the first mouse pounds a shot of scotch, slams the glass onto the bar, turns to the second mouse and says, âwhen i see a mousetrap, i lie on my back and set it off with my foot. when the bar comes down, i catch it in my teeth, bench press it twenty times to work up an appetite, and then make off with the cheese.â
the second mouse orders up two shots of sour mash, pounds them both, slams each glass into the bar, turns to the first mouse, and replies: âyeah, well when i see rat poison, i collect as much as i can, take it home, grind it up to a powder, and add it to my coffee each morning so i can get a good buzz going for the rest of the day.â
