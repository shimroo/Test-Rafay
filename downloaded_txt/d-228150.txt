our
storycoco’s salon and store was founded in 1985, when coco bitton and his wife, judi were given the opportunity to buy the original aventura mall hair sensations, where coco was already a successful master stylist.  since coco’s salon opened, there have been lots of joyful days, watching the families of our clients and staff grow and enjoy life together.  and sure, we have been through a few hurricanes (in life as well as real hurricanes – ask coco about hurricane andrew!) but wouldn’t trade it.
coco moved to the us in the eighties from israel and is a proud first-generation us immigrant.  he is a hands-on owner with an active role in the salon and you will see him in the store most days wearing one of the many hats all small business owners do.  although he doesn’t cut hair anymore – he keeps a very close pulse on everything happening in the industry and works hard to keep his staff informed and educated on the most current trends and styles.
he’s a proud dad, an avid soccer fan and likes to travel between the us and israel often to see family.
coco believes what makes their salon different from others is the unique blend of clients they have.  with an excellent blend of the local, loyal clients that have been coming for more than 30 years, to those visiting on an international vacation, there is never a dull moment in the salon.  friendships new and old are the foundation of what makes coco’s such a fun place to be.  we hope you come to experience some coco's pampering soon!
