welcome to

			the home of black forest shires & gypsy horses


     
thereâs an old saying, which goes âgypsy gold does not chink and glitter, it gleams in the sun, and neighs in the darkâ.  this proverb believed to be from the claddaugh gypsies of galway refers to the magical relationship between gypsies and their most treasured 
		possessions, their horses.
		


      we're glad 
		you've taken the time to visit our site.  we believe you will find 
		plenty of useful information here.  for the past decade, 
		gypsyhorses.com has been the industry's first choice for information on 
		the breed.   we will be adding to this site as 
		time permits, so be sure to check back often.

     black forest shires is owned by jeff bartko and 
		victoria hauser.  we have been 
		involved with the breed since it first appeared in the usa.  in the 
		year 2000, we established 'black forest shires and gypsy 
		horses', and proceeded to import over 1500 gypsy horses into 
		north america.  these horses firmly established the gypsy 
		horse as a recognized breed throughout the continent.  our home is 
		just outside harrisonville, missouri.

     although we no longer import horses, the legacy of our 
		work continues on.  the horses we imported and their progeny can be 
		seen from coast-to-coast in shows, fairs, and exhibitions.

     please see our "about us" page to learn more about who we are, and how our experience has shaped the gypsy horse industry in north america.
 


		 what is a gypsy horse?

 
    
		the gypsy horse is a hearty little draft type horse 
		which was developed and is still used by the gypsies of england 
		and ireland.

     they typically stand between 13 and 15.2 hands, and 
		have an unusually quiet and gentle disposition.  their exceptional 
		stamina allows them to go all day at a steady trot while pulling a 
		loaded living waggon with the whole gypsy family.  they 
		are sturdily built with solid bone and have a good deal of feathering 
		and hair.

     the gypsy horse comes in all colors, with the most 
		common being the "pinto" patterns, piebald and skewbald.

     although they have been bred for a particular type for 
		generations, they are originally descended from several draft horse 
		breeds, primarily the shire and clydesdale along with dales, fell,
		and 
		other native british pony breeds.



     if you are looking for a horse that is known for 
		soundness & sanity, that will be a faithful companion to your family, 
		and is incredibly versatile, the traditional gypsy horse may just be the 
		perfect horse for you.

     their compact size and sturdy build makes 
		them incredibly strong animals, capable of carrying and pulling a great 
		deal more weight than a light horse of similar height.  they have proved 
		to excel at every discipline imaginable in the equine world, from 
		competitive driving to dressage and western sports

     the traditions of the gypsies and the magical persona 
		of these family 
		oriented horses make them the perfect âhorse for all seasonsâ.
