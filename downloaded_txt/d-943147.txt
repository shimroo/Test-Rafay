“be strong in body, clean in mind, and lofty in ideals.” -james naismith, father of basketballdo i have what it takes to accomplish my goals?you have the determination and the desire, but do you have the right tools to succeed and do you understand how to use them? even the best training principles, when not understood or applied incorrectly can lead to anything from a season plagued with injury or to frustratingly few results. somewhere in between is a training sweet spot that few know how to find at a time in their running development that really matters. competitive running has a "shelf life," and many wonder "am i making the most of what i have right now?"  there was once a boy in kansas who questioned his ability:













he knew what it was to have big dreams. he wanted to be someone and running provided opportunities he could never have imagined. challenged and inspired by his coach bob timmons, he learned the risks and rewards of giving his all. 

the "master of the mile" set one of his six world records on june 23, 1967. the teenage olympian was jim ryun and the record he broke was thought to be unbeatable.
