a note from em




honeybuns is a bakery in dorset specialising in gorgeous gluten free, dairy free and vegan friendly cakes, flapjacks, brownies and more!




hi, i’m emma and welcome to our artisan bakery. i started delivering homemade cakes by bicycle in 1998. back then, it was tricky to find tasty artisan cakes let alone anything gluten free or vegan. honeybuns served as a little foodie haven for those seeking delicious gluten free treats. to this day our bakery remains entirely gluten free and customer delight is at the heart of everything we do.
our award winning cakes and gifts can now be delivered directly to your door.
we were recently filmed by the lovely youtubers kirsten and joerg: 2 germans in britain, featuring our wonky cottage and bakery. do have a watch.




thank you for visiting.
