secretary of the air force has overall responsibility for the ussf, under the guidance and direction of the secretary of defense. additionally, a four-star general known as the chief of space operations (cso) serves as the senior military member of the ussf and is a member of the joint chiefs of staff.  the ussf website states: “in the u.s. space force, we are challenged every day to find new heights. working within the space domain, our people launch rockets, keep satellites safe and operational, and develop technology to defend our way of life on earth through our interests in space. we protect the hopes and dreams of america and exploration, while preparing for the 22nd century. when humankind asks “what if”, the mission of space force is to be the answer.”       us space force
