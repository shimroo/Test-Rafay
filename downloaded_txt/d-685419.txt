recent client testimonials
hear what some of our clients have said about us.



“
really enjoyed this scenic and spacious home in a quiet neighborhood! it was super clean and had all the amenities we needed plus more! 


stacie b. 




“
the home and pool are beautiful! we stayed at many homes on hilton head, and this home is very clean and well kept.


dawn c. 




“
we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the beachwalk 211.  it was very clean and tidy when we arrived with all necessities that we would need to be comfortable for our short stay.  it was a perfect place for our 3 children to run around without us parents being scared that they would break something or get into something they shouldn't.  super nice place for a family stay!  we loved the fact that it was a keyless entry into our place.  going to hotels or cabins, i am always nervous of losing the key, so it was nice to have a code to enter each time.  


douglas d.




“
the property was beautiful.  it was perfect for our group and there was plenty of room for all of us.  we loved being so close to the beach as well. everything....beautiful well-equipped kitchen, comfortable furniture in the living room, the mattresses were very comfortable, the bathrooms were beautiful, having a washer & dryer in the unit was wonderful too, being close to the beach and the pool was very nice as well. we loved everything about this property. 


michelle r.




“
overall our stay was great.  your staff was very helpful with some minor problems with the unit.  the weather was great! the ambiance of hhi was very nice for reducing stress. will be back again for our 16th year.


stan w.




“
we loved that we were close to the beach and could walk it multiple times during the day without driving. we also really liked the key code for the door. no one had to carry a key, and each of us could access the property independently. great idea. made check in and check out a breeze!


janice r.




“
everything was find and always happy dealing with sunset. we recommended to many people during our stay how we were always satisfied and taken care by sunset.


david s.




“
overall, everything was excellent.  nice size, very clean, house at a nice location.  close enough to beach, convenient to bike path and sea pines center and harbortown.  screened in pool was wonderful.

the condo was immaculate and clean and would stay there again


anne f.




“
we really enjoyed our first ever visit to hhi. loved the quietness of palmetto dunes and barrington court. felt like we were far away from the hustle and bustle.  the free bikes were a nice bonus for us as we love being outdoors and exercising. 


christine c.




“
we were on our honeymoon!! what a beautiful place for our first week as husband & wife!  it was very cozy & we were happy to have all the utensils to cook & make smoothies.  the villa was just close enough to enjoy the beach & pool.  we stumbled across the marina across the street which was a lot of fun & very beautiful place visit. 


todd c.




“
