codorus creek beautification initiative
codorus creek runs through the city of york approximately 7.5 miles upstream of its confluence with the susquehanna river. the 279-square-mile watershed has been continuously occupied since colonial days. historic development of the downtown area included severe encroachment on the floodplain, with building right up to the creek banks.
as part of current efforts to revitalize the city, attention has turned to restoring access to the creek shoreline and enhancing its amenity value. as part of the beautification initiative, bh has provided survey, environmental analysis, master planning, public outreach, and schematic design services to identify improvements and program opportunities, focusing on reconnecting urban plazas and neighborhoods with the creek. services also included exploring alternatives for improvements and program opportunities, as well as determining where plaza(s) and connections can be made from neighborhoods.

i-40/i-240 interchange improvements
rapid growth on the east side of memphis has caused significant traffic congestion and safety issues at the i-40/i-240 interchange in shelby county, tn. with continued growth, the interchange is projected to handle more than 350,000 vehicles daily by 2035. bh had designed the initial (phase i) interchange improvements, and tdot contracted with bh to design the phase ii improvements. at $109 million, it was the largest single job bid by tdot at the time of project award.  the project extends from walnut grove to north of covington pike and east of white station road to sycamore view road in east memphis. it included the construction of a four-level interchange. the new flyover and ramps along with a widened roadway improved traffic flow on the interstates and the nearby roads feeding the interstate.
