welcome to the ceoates ranch!



ceoates ranch is a family run horse breeding operation in central california focused
    on producing quality paint (apha) foals with great conformation, disposition and
    versatility. we had our first foal in 1995.

the legal partners in ceoates ranch are christi (daughter) and jorene (mom) but we
    have lots of help from the rest of the family! visit the contact us page to learn
    more about us, send email, etc.

ceoates ranch does not stand any stallions. our mares have world class bloodlines.
    we select each stallion to improve on the mare. commonly the sires of foals born
    at ceoates ranch are world champions, or from world champion lines.  

we think youâll agree that the resulting foals are world class quality. visit the
    sale barn to see what we have for sale!

please visit our mares and foals in the horse barn, and see the various stallions
    weâve crossed on our mares  in recent years in the reference sires section.
