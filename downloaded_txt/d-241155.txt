the pioneers of organic winemaking



as america’s first organic winery, we’ve been pioneers of the organic wine standard since 1980. sip the difference!


















































purity



we only use organic grapes! we let our wines’ true nature shine by not adding any preservatives, colorants, or synthetic agents.



nature reserve



we are stewards to nearly 1,000 acres of wildlife corridors around and through our vineyards, preserving the native habitat, a home for bears, mountain lions, and pollinators. protecting our ecology encourages a healthy balance in our vineyards.

            no sulfites added
          










did you know that sulfites are added to wine made with organic grapes? since our origins, we have never added this synthetic preservative, and we never will. our wine is made to embody the purity of the grape itself. learn more








            regenerative
          










our holistic farming practices work to sequester carbon, build healthy soil, and reduce co2 emissions. learn more








            vegan
          










at frey vineyards we have made a commitment to formulate our organic wines without using any animal byproducts in the winemaking process.








            non gmo
          










we were preeminent stakeholders in making mendocino county the first jurisdiction in the u.s. to ban cultivation of genetically modified organisms. we champion the efforts to preserve heritage varieties of organic grapes. 






































































"celebrate fridays the frey way"

since the beginning, we’ve been trailblazers of true organic winemaking. in fact, we were the first certified organic winery here in the us, which means no sulfites added.— casey frey
