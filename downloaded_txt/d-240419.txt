books & badges program

the office of the fayette county sheriff’s books & badges program, established in 2015, helps promote language and literacy development among preschool and elementary-aged children in fayette county.
in response to the epidemic of children’s illiteracy, the office of the fayette county sheriff has partnered with the fayette county school system and lexington daycare centers and launched books & badges. books & badges brings fayette county deputy sheriffs into the classroom to read well-known children’s books with the class. after story time, the deputy sheriff gives each child their own book to take home to read with a parent, sibling, and/or grandparent. this opportunity to promote literacy development can inspire a child to make better choices – to choose learning and success in school and life, and to choose a brighter future.
impact literacy in our community: donate new or gently used books to our books & badges program!
to coordinate your donation, please contact scooter stein at 859-252-1771.
