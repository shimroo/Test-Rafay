kwik start ls 
can help. it’s an easy-to-use plant and soil nutrient solution that harnesses the power of humus – organic matter – in the soil to feed growing plants. it also unlocks phosphorus in the soil to stimulate plant growth and promote uniform crop set-up. its unique reacted carbon technologytm 
makes it more active, functional, and effective than similar products on the market.row, field, vegetable, and fruit crops, plus vineyards, can all benefit from kwik start ls. it’s an excellent tank-mix partner compatible with other pesticides and nutrients. it offers flexibility with the option for soil, fertigation, or foliar applications.

   product showcase soil health is more than just a buzzword. crops rely on a healthy soil microbiome to help fight disease, increase nutrient efficiencies, manage water infiltration, increase water holding capacity, produce higher quality fruits, and increase yield production. every time you seed your crop or till the soil, the soil microbiome (bacteria, archaea, and fungi), is negatively impacted and the soil becomes less fertile than before. we offer a range of soil health products to help boost the microbiome, including soil set, kwik start ls, and actagro liquid humus. check out our
specialty and
plant nutrients 
product pages for more.
