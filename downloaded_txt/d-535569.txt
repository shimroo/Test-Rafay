what our visitors say:




“this was the best experience ever. me and 2 friends went and did the vip experience which was absolutely worth it. we learned so much about the animals and the farm. after the experience we went to bambi land and had so much fun with the deer. definitely worth the trip!”





“amazing family activity! i was suprised that we were allowed to walk into a few of the exhibits and interacts with the animals and you can even buy a bucket of food and feed them. exhibits were also clean and you can tell the animals are well cared for and happy. cute gift shop, snack stand, and clean restrooms.”





“i recently visited the zoo and had an amazing experience, thanks to melinda, one of the wildlife/rehab managers. she was incredibly helpful and sweet, taking the time to educate us on the history of certain animals and the process of rehabbing them. her passion and knowledge truly enhanced our visit, making it both informative and enjoyable. i highly recommend visiting this zoo!”
