who we arenestled in the heart of pittsburgh's northside lies a hidden gem, the mexican war streets. here, a dedicated group of individuals has taken up the mantle of preserving the historic character of this beautiful neighborhood while fostering community engagement and support. we are the mexican war streets society (mwss), a non-profit organization founded in 1969 by community-minded individuals who share a passion for preservation and a commitment to our neighborhood.at the core of mwss is our board, composed of executive officers and chairs. the executive officers, provide the leadership needed to steer our organization toward its goals. our chairs oversee key aspects of our mission, such as preservation, greenspace, programs, and membership. each year, during our annual holiday party in december, we elect board members from within our community, ensuring that those who best understand the neighborhood's unique character guide its future.















what we domwss's mission is twofold: to preserve the historic character of the mexican war streets and to promote community involvement. our neighborhood is a federally- and partially city-designated historic district, a testament to its rich heritage and architectural significance. stretching from brighton road to federal street (east to west) and north avenue to jefferson street (south to north), the mexican war streets neighborhood is a living testament to pittsburgh's history.we take pride in our tradition of preserving the residential integrity of our streets and buildings. but more than that, we believe in fostering a sense of community. we hold four general membership meetings and special events throughout the year, such as the mexican war streets house & garden tour and the mexican war streets yard sale, serve as platforms for engagement, education, and celebration.in the words of one resident, "we may live in victorian houses, but we don’t live victorian lifestyles." the mexican war streets are not frozen in time; they are a vibrant, evolving part of pittsburgh's cultural tapestry.






































who we representmwss proudly represents the interests of those who call the mexican war streets home. as part of the greater central northside community, our work extends beyond preserving physical structures; we aim to maintain the spirit and vitality of our neighborhood. by advocating for our residents and working to preserve our historic district, we contribute to the larger fabric of pittsburgh's history.so, what do people love most about the mexican war streets? it varies—from the stunning victorian houses to the neighborhood's rich history and, perhaps most importantly, the warm and welcoming community. at mwss, we are dedicated to nurturing this unique blend of history, architecture, and community spirit that defines the mexican war streets.
