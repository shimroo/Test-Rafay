our story

building our home, one log at a time - 9/3/1988






“in 1987, we moved into the wilderness of the adirondack mountains to fulfill a life long dream of building our own log home. we spent 2 years designing and drawing plans, and another 2 years building our dream home from the ground up ourselves. once our new home was built, we set out to decorate it with lodge and cabin decor at an affordable price. after searching, we found there were no stores catering to our needs, so we decided to create one. the products we sell are the products we use ourselves to decorate. we hope the people who, like us, love everything about nature and the wilderness, will enjoy shopping at woodland things.”




- karen and keith lindstadt



cabin, lodge and log home decorating ideas















our plaques can be used for more than just addresses. the text on a fishing or canoeing plaque or a bear or moose address plaque can simply say "jason's room" or "i love fishing".















wildlife rugs don't have to go on floors. they give vibrant color and texture and help insulate a wall while making a personal statement. express your passion for fishing or your child's love of wildlife.















our stone trays can be used to display your favorite items. use them to display candles or as coasters for your drink ware.
