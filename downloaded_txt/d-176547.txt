patient testimonials

i took my 2 year old the er last week. to say they took such good care of him is an understatement. i know they aren’t technically a pediatric hospital (like childrens hospital), but let me tell you they were all amazing! even better than the time i had to take him to children’s hospital. even though the er was slammed packed that night they paid attention to what all was going on with him with such great detail and were so incredibly nice and comforting to him (and us as his parents). i definitely will be taking him back there if we ever need to go to the er again.shae garrison  my mom had outpatient surgery. the service was excellent. the nurses and staff were very friendly. theykept us informed and gave mom very good care. thanks to angela, morgan and leigh l. very professional and the best care. this is the best hospital. –lisa pointer  my 96 year old mother in law took a fall and ended up in the hospital. while there we found out she needed a stint and we ended up on the 3rd flood while recovering. all the staff on the 3rd floor were so good to her and to us. harley was extra nice and friendly and very patient. he acted like he had time for her and that makes a big difference. thank you to all the staff at riverview!teresa sanders
