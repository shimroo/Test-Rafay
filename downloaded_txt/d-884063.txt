welcome to mound golf course
"the miamisburg mound"
the mound golf course is one of the finest 9 hole golf facilities in ohio.  situated atop a bluff overlooking miamisburg and the miami valley, the course boasts small greens, lush fairways and friendly staff, and is adjacent to the indian mound state park which features one of the tallest conical mounds in north america.  designed by a scottish golf professional, alex “nipper” campbell in 1936, it opened for play in 1938.  the golf course boasts a quaint clubhouse and spectacular outdoor patio complete with covered area, and plenty of seating.  
golfers of all skill levels appreciate the playability, course conditions and the challenges that the mound golf course provides….and the eye-catching views are free.
