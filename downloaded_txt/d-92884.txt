charlotte p., florida
total saved: $10,000 / work-at-home scam
“i don’t know how to thank you, but if you were here i would give you a hug for saving me from getting ripped off. thank you so much.”


william l., new york
total saved: $3,000 / sweepstakes scam
a scammer posing as a sweepstakes company had convinced william he’d won a $450k prize and by the time he contacted us, william had already wired $1,500 to the scammer for “fees.” fraud.org staff helped william understand how the scam worked, and convinced him not to send more money, saving him another $3,000 in losses.


kristie d., new york
total saved: $2,500 / craigslist scam
trying to sell a piece of furniture on craigslist, kristie received a legitimate-looking cashier’s check for $2,800 to cover the purchase and shipping costs from a buyer named “david.” when david asked kristie to cash the check and wire part of it back to a “shipping company,” kristie became suspicious and contacted fraud.org. we intervened, explained how the scam worked, and saved her $2,500.
