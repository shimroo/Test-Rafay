analyze, model, and predict the state of the atmosphere
given the impacts of climate change, we provide students with in-depth knowledge of
                                    the atmosphere, to prepare them for careers in atmospheric science like fire weather,
                                    climate risk, and ai modeling. our advantage is our classroom sizes are small, and
                                    students get hands-on learning. students are often paid to do cutting-edge research
                                    on wildfire and climate science, weather, and forecasting. our department’s collaborations
                                    include nasa, nbc, cal fire, and national science laboratories. our professors ensure
                                    a diverse learning environment that significantly impacts our students’ careers.

median pay
the average salary for an atmospheric scientist in california is around $115,020 per year. wages typically
                                 start from $72,340 and go up to $199,450.

                                 than the avergae for all occupations.
examples of areas in which meteorologists work include private forecasting companies,
                                 national weather service, universities, energy companies, government labs and in media.

occupational outlook handbook



work environment
meteorologists work in a variety of settings; including offices, laboratories and
                                 universities. occasionally, they work in the field where they install, monitor and
                                 calibrate meterological instruments. some meteorologists work extended hours, particulary
                                 during weather emergencies.
many, if not most, meteorologists work with computer code of some sort to perform
                                 data analysis and interpretation.










career and internship opportunities in meteorology and climate science at sjsu
three growth areas across california: 
                              1) fire weather research. 
                              2) climate, energy, and risk.
                              3) modeling and artificial intelligence.
