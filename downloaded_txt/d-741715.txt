excerpts from issue 52/09 8 february 2025

ardbeg weathers the storm
jackie thomson writes:
islay never does weather by halves and storm &eacuteowyn certainly made its mark on ardbeg distillery.
the distillery took a battering, with the roof of the west maltings, the seawall and other parts of the site sustaining damage.
for the safety of our team and visitors, we have made the decision to temporarily close the distillery site while the necessary repairs take place.  
but hereâs the good news - we're already hard to work and we hope to welcome visitors back by 3 march.
we're also working on a pop-up experience in the village, at no 1 charlotte street, port ellen.
weâll keep you posted if anything else comes up - and cannot wait to see you soon.

nothing to see here
following the presentation in the ramsay hall on 21 january, by caledonian maritime assets ltd (cmal) concerning the upgrade works at port ellen pier, the ileach contacted argyll & bute council to enquire about the work due to be undertaken at port askaig.
since the two new vessels were announced, cmal have held several events to show the various options originally under consideration and have kept the press and public regularly updated as to the progress of the project at port ellen.
the council, on the other hand, has been conspicuous in its absence from providing similar details relating to islayâs northern port.
following our enquiry, the ileach was directed to council website information apparently last updated on 27 january. this stated, âthe council commissioned consultants to carry out a study to determine options for the existing marshalling areas and to produce a plan that would maximise the best use of the port footprint.
"following review of consultation feedback from communities and the level of facility we currently have, we can deliver a more cost-effective solution that remains within the parameters of the provision in the council's marine asset management plan (masp), without the larger scale disruption and additional cost that would have been required by that concept design."
aside from saying, "...we will deliver improved signage, lining, quayside traffic management and cctv for port askaig in time for the new larger ferry arriving", the ileach understands no details have been released as to the specific nature of this 'more cost-effective solution', no sign of any tangible improvements, and delivery of the mv isle of islay is but two to three months distant.
islay community council ferry committee has repeatedly pressed the council for information on the proposed upgrade, but at the time of going to press, was no better informed than the ileach.
while the island may not expect presentations of the level pursued by cmal, it would be more confidence inspiring to learn a few specifics and to witness activity at port askaig that might indicate readiness prior to the arrival of the first vessel.
particularly in the light of port ellen closing for two years while upgrade works are carried out.

sun roof

port charlotte's museum of islay life, while curating the islands past, has also taken account of the future, by installing solar panels on the roof and reducing the building's energy costs.   
just a  few days after being installed, the new panels were battered by storm éowyn - and survived.  
"if they can withstand that, they can withstand anything," said les wilson, chairperson of the museum's trustees.  
the new panels are the first of some major changes at the museum that will soon see more storage for its unique and growing collection, and lower its heating costs and carbon footprint.  
the panels were funded by grants from museums and galleries scotland, the scottish government's community and renewal energy scheme and the argyll & bute climate action network.
future work will see an expansion of the museum's mezzanine which will increase storage capacity.  
"we owe a great debt to our former manager, raymond lafferty, who worked tirelessly to raise funds and set these exciting new developments in motion," added les. "early in january, ray left to take up an exciting new role at scotland's national mining museum. we wish him well and look forward to his return later in the year to witness the fruition of all the hard work he put in.â

music review

journeys. brian molley quartet and the asin langa ensemble.
revered saxophonist, john coltrane, was at the forefront of many important directions in jazz in the 1950s and 1960s, but one interest that became an increasingly dominant focus for him in his later years, was the study of indian music, studies that continued until his untimely death in 1967.
not for the first time, contemporary saxophonist, brian molley, has arguably taken the eastern influence a stage further, recording his latest album 'journeys' in a custom-built desert studio in the heart of western rajasthan.
featuring pianist tom gibbs, double-bassist james lindsay and drummer stuart brown, for this recording, they are joined by india's asin langa ensemble, consisting of asin khan langa on voice and sarangi (indian fiddle), bhungar khan on khartal (a pair of wooden castanets with bells attached), dholak (two-headed drum) player, sadik khan, and latif khan on bhapang (hand-drum) and morchang (mouth harp).
the result is a highly eclectic mix of western jazz with indian sensibilities. which of the two deserves top billing is a matter for the musicians or the listener, but ultimately has no discernible conflicting effect on the music.
the opening track, 'cottonopolis' is taken from a 19th century nickname for manchester, featuring strong influences from the folk songs of northern india, with molley's take on music from the city's former indie scene.
where east meets west, musically and instrumentally, has been seamlessly engineered and the production values are superb. the opening section of 'kama' bears witness to that, with molley's saxophone soaring over a vocal and rhythmic background, never dominating, yet never being subsumed.
'journeys hand in hand' brings us closer to 'home', with stuart brown's drumming merging sensitively with bungar and sadik khans' percussive persistence. gibbs' playing on this track is most impressive, particularly set against lang's strong indian vocal.
james lindsay's solo introduction to 'two city tales' provides the launching point for the cleverly subtle arrival of the compositionâs rhythmic base, augmented beautifully by brown's subtle kit playing.
with a project such as this, there is always a danger that one genre of music will overshadow the other, or both will end up fighting in the middle for dominance. 'journeys' has managed to deftly sidestep both of the above, resulting in an album of which i'm sure john coltrane would be proud.
as the world changes, it is comforting to note that musicians from widely differing cultural and musical backgrounds can create harmony; in both senses of that word.
