testimonials 





 












						"the four-day winter mountaineering course exceeded my expectations. i booked just a week before, and emma, the office manager, was great with logistics and rental gear. we spent the first day rock climbing, the second ice climbing, and the last two backcountry camping, finishing with a successful winter ascent of crystal crag. snowshoeing across a frozen lake and climbing in wind and snow were unforgettable. our guides—paloma, dakota, and tyler—were amazing, offering excellent instruction and adapting the course for all skill levels. it was a fantastic experience, totally worth it. thanks, smc!"					


kaz, winter mountaineering skills course 






						"this is a top notch outfitter. for a week-long, mule-supported trip for 9 women that included summiting mt. whitney, our guides were excellent: knowledgeable, experienced, patient, kind, excellent cooks, skilled communicators and planners. as for sierra mountain center, they represented the trip accurately, gave detailed advice on what to bring and how to prepare for the trip, designed a comfortable itinerary that we all could complete, provided excellent tents. the mule support was executed seamlessly, as we always had our gear, transported carefully and delivered in fine form when we arrived at our next camp. i highly recommend this outfitter/guiding service."					


karen, mule supported mt. whitney 






						"what a fantastic trip put together for us by the sierra mountain center. from the start emma was fantastic and professional in the coordination efforts for our palisade traverse trip. my son and i had a 1:1 guide ratio and the guides, dave stimson and tyler logan, were exceptional. exceptional in their knowledge of the route, their efficiency with rope craft and their trailside manner - despite the exhausting climb we had such a fun time. we are already planning next year's outing with smc."					


jason, palisade traverse 






						"smc and it’s staff were completely responsible for making my jmt trip such a wonderful experience. very competent and helped me prepare for the journey from their wealth of experience and expertise! highly recommend this company to anyone looking for an adventure in the sierra!"					


ken, john muir trail 






						"hey all! i recently took aiare 2 with sp parker and i have to admit it was fantastic! he showed so much passion for his craft and “patience” with us. it truly showed in the 3 days we spent together that he cares about what he does. he is so knowledgeable about snow science and in particular eastern sierra snow that i highly recommend participating in his course if you’re a frequenter of this magical mountain range. can’t thank you enough and will most surely use the lessons learned in this course to be a more safe and conscious backcountry traveler."					


michael, aiare ii

larry gumina 











larry is a native of the new jersey shore. raised as an ocean lover, larry spent his early days surfing and being in the water as much as he could. through an active involvement in scouting, as well as an adventurous friend group, larry found a passion for the mountains. naturally, this passion had him trade his surfboard for a snowboard, and he went west! larry graduated from the university of colorado boulder with degrees in environmental studies as well as atmospheric and oceanic circulation. in colorado, he fell more in love with the mountains. after graduating, larry moved to alaska to explore the wilderness of the last frontier through backpack and canoe guiding. when covid struck and found larry abroad in central america, he came back to the states hoping to get back to alaska, but discovered the sierra along the way. and the high peaks and the fairer climate of california was as far as he made it. larry now resides here in bishop, where he spends his time exploring the mountains via roped climbing, splitboarding, and hiking. when not guiding, larry enjoys traveling and climbing the high, glaciated peaks of central and south america. larry’s favorite trip to lead in the sierra is the bishop to mammoth backpack as the variety of the terrain offers tremendous opportunities for natural and human history studies! larry holds a certification as a wilderness first responder, a leave no trace trainer, and a aiare level i.

anouk erni 











anouk grew up on the glaciers and peaks of switzerland where her family is from and currently resides. anouk has had an appreciation for the elevated outdoors from an early age. she has lived in europe, america’s east coast, and finally, she came to the west coast in her teens, and never left. even though she calls the eastern sierra her home, she began her guiding career in the pacific northwest, where she worked on glaciated peaks such as mt rainier and mt baker, and rock guided during the summers. however, having learned to rock climb in california and frequenting the eastern sierra during her years living in los angeles, she ultimately returned to california eight years ago and has been guiding here year round. in the summers, anouk guides rock and alpine trips, and during the winter seasons, she ski guides and teaches avalanche courses. she sees her guide work as a way to increase and infuse passion and knowledge into the outdoor community – her way of giving back after having been fortunate enough to receive solid mentorship during her initial years climbing in california. anouk is an amga certified rock guide, apprentice ski guide, and apprentice alpine guide, as well as an aiare avalanche course leader and aai course leader.

ian mceleney 











an enthusiasm for backpacking was ian’s gateway into the mountains and soon led to a love of climbing. after cutting his teeth on the rock and ice crags of new england he traveled all over the country making ascents of everything from short roadside rock climbs to big peaks in remote areas. over a decade ago he discovered that the eastern sierra hold a magical mix of amazing mountains and climbing, easy access, and good weather. now this place is home for him and his family.though he loves all kinds of climbing, big walls and winter routes hold a special place in ian’s heart. he rounds out the year with forays to alaska, red rocks, joshua tree, moab, the north cascades, and canada.

allan giernet 











allen giernet grew up in san diego and always had a thirst for the outdoors. whether in the mountains, the ocean, or the desert – he had to be outside. after several years running the youth snowboard competition team at mountain high, his longing to get into the peaks beyond the resorts took him into splitboarding. this in turn took him into the sierras, the rockies, the cascades, and more. in 2010, he began teaching rock climbing as an amga single pitch instructor in joshua tree and other so cal areas. in 2012, he founded so cal snow avalanche center, began teaching avalanche courses with the national ski patrol, and began to guide on splitboard.   he has traveled all over the west and beyond in search of great climbing and big snow covered mountains to find powder filled descents. but the magical eastern sierra will always hold a special place in his heart.   allen currently calls methow, washington home in the north cascades and still spends time in so cal. he ski guides and teaches avalanche courses in the eastern sierra, colorado, and the north cascades. that thirst for the outdoors remains unquenched and allen loves to share this enthusiasm with anyone and everyone out there. when not out in the mountains searching for the next descent, hiking, biking or paddling, he may be found running the methow store with his partner in the methow valley. serving up cold beer and great food next to the best put in on the methow river.

colin bogdan 











colin grew up hiking and camping via family vacations and the boy scouts across 15+ national parks. he still remembers the nervous exhilaration he had when his parents let him and his brothers do the exposed hike up angels landing in zion national park by themselves. when he joined the military after high school, he thought he would need to largely leave the outdoors behind. he was wrong. as part of his training, he got the opportunity to take part in two month-long nols courses mountaineering in alaska and instead discovered a passion for big adventure and challenge in the mountains. after eight years on active duty and multiple deployments as a marine infantry officer, colin transitioned to reserve status in 2022 to pursue a career in mountain guiding and moved to bishop after unintentionally falling head over heels for the eastern sierra during a weekend trip. he improved his skill sets as a client of fellow smc guides tyler logan and louie allen before earning professional certification from the amga and nols to begin working as a guide/instructor in 2023. he is proud to now be in the position to call them both colleagues and also help others achieve their goals or experience the outdoors in more meaningful ways. his first love is to climb in the alpine regardless of the medium (rock, snow, or ice), though be assured, he isn’t picky and believes strongly that any day spent outside, no matter the activity or difficulty, is better than a day spent indoors.
beyond the eastern sierra, he teaches three to four multi-week nols backpacking and rock climbing courses per year across various locations in alaska, wyoming, utah, and nevada. when not guiding/instructing anywhere, he works as the online sales manager for eastside sports in bishop, ca; actively serves on the inyo county search & rescue team which covers missions everywhere from death valley to mt whitney; and, conducts ~6 weeks of reserve duty with the marine corps each year.
