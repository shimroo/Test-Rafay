the oak house tavern
        thank you for your interest in oak house tavern.  due to the covid-19
        pandemic, we have ceased operators as a restuarant, bar, and lodging.
        we are looking to reorganize as a club where members may rent out the
        entire lodge grounds a week at a time.  please contact us at the email
        below if you are interested in membership.

the tavern  












eat
the tavern is your perfect setting for happy hour, dinner, or sunday brunch.   our dining room overlooks the fall river and with a commercial-style kitchen availble for your party's use.











drink
the dining room includes a bar configuration.  bring your own and stock it up when you arrive.











stay
seven rooms in the lodge are adjacent to the restaurant and can accommodate up to 14 overnight guests. the rooms are cozy with creature comforts including a keurig coffee maker, a small fridge, and updated bedding and linens. each room has a queen bed and a euro lounger, suitable for a couple, a couple with child, or two friends.
















preserving the legacy...
building on the metzger's pioneering vision for a simple, rustic lodge in this equisite setting on the upper fall river, we are embracing a few modern touches, a new variety of tastes to our food and beverage menus, and the highest level of service offered by your hosts melissa and quentin.
we are dedicated to preserving and conserving our special spot on the fall river.







preservation
the upper fall river has very limited access requiring self-powered or electric-powered river travel.  with a farm-to-table philosophy, we are featuring hat creek grown grass-fed beef and partnering with shasta land trust and cal trout to preserve this special place.









a modern touch
the new owners don't want to change much but we think you should be able to book with opentable and have an eco-friendly, modern experience.  still the best fly fishing in california, but there is much more to enjoy.

















 fun 










bags
try your luck at "bags" but don't dare call it "cornhole".  check out the blog for tournament date.









horse shoes
throw horse shoes just out back.  the world-record high score for an 11-point game has been attained on our grounds many times.
