helping animals or hoarding?
animal hoarders often masquerade as ârescuers,â describing their homes as âsheltersâ or ârefuges.â  but hoarding is not about legitimate animal sheltering or rescue.  it is a serious mental illness that jeopardizes the health and welfare of the animals and the people involved. 
 
the hoarding of animals research consortium (harc) is a group of  researchers who collaborated from 1997-2006 to define and better understand the  problem of animal hoarding and its impact on individuals and communities.â https://aldf.org/article/animal-hoarding-facts/
            who to contact for help to place your bird
consult with reputable organizations and associations for assistance before placing your bird(s).  in addition to working with reputable avian rescue and placement groups, bird club adoption programs, veterinary offices, and animal shelters can also be helpful in guiding you to a suitable new home for your bird(s). 
 
 find a local avian rescue organization online through www.petfinder.com or contact the global federation of animal sanctuaries for an accredited avian facility in your area www.sanctuaryfederation.org
 
 veterinary offices that treat birds often have clients who need to place their bird or who wish to adopt a bird.  some even adopt birds out.  find an avian veterinarian through the association of avian veterinarians (aav) www.aav.org
 contact your local animal shelter or humane society.  some do have birds for adoption or can refer you to avian placement resources in our area.
