 bring your center to life
an fec, or family entertainment center, is built for the entire family. they are intended to offer your customers a full entertainment experience. 
                                fecâs feature several different revenue generators in the same location. this means that your customers could walk in with the intention of bowling a game, and end up eating a pizza, bowling a couple of games, 
                                spending an hour in the arcade, hanging out in an interactive ball play area, and playing laser tag. these centers thrive on family events, birthday parties, and weekend open play. 
                                our cutting-edge fec models are proving their success through incredible profit trends and growing popularity. 
                                our experience in the fec market will prove to be invaluable if you are ready to think outside the box and build bowlingâs future..


























creating the ideal ballance
fecâs ideally balance their profit centers, meaning that no profit center dominates the others. 
                                when a customer walks in, they should see a variety of different revenue generators at which they could participate in. 
                                by giving the customer several options, fecâs cater to a wider range of people and ensure return trips to the center.












valuable additions
the fec incorporated some extremely valuable additions to the traditional model, ensuring that there is something for everyone. installing or separate 4 to 6 lanes to create a private party room. 
                                this encourages plenty of corporate and group rate revenue, while adding a sports bar with a full menu is a total separate profit center as well.
                                other big revenue generators are a billiards area, a full arcade with redemption-based games, and even a laser tag area.
