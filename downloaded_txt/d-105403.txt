spiritual life
at bishop diego, students of all faiths are invited to discover the spiritual, personal, and intellectual knowledge needed to navigate today's world. through the core values of respect, perseverance, and compassion, we form young men and women not just into excellent students but into people of character who are inspired to be the difference. 




student life
bishop offers a wide array of experiences that develop the whole human person and offer a unique student-centered approach. by partnering with parents and family members, we are able to provide students with a foundation of love and support that will enable them to grow into resilient young women and men, ready to take on the world. 









academics
bishop students thrive in an environment that offers exploration, discovery, and inspiration. the key to their success is that emphasis is placed not on memorization of content and checking off of standards, but on critical thinking skills. 




athletics
through bishop's three core values of respect, perseverance and compassion, we develop the entire individual, not simply the athlete. we strongly encourage multi-sport participation, vibrant cardinal spirit, and support a wide range of experiences and skill levels.
