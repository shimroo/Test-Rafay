visitor policies
we will only accommodate patients in the clinic. those accompanying patients must remain outside. exceptions include those accompanying elderly patients, caregivers, interpreters, parents/guardians of school-age children to age 16, or spouses attending for obstetrical exams at the conclusion of the exam.
for the safety of your children that are not requiring an exam, please arrange to leave them at home. children under 16 years of age cannot be left unattended in our waiting room. again, this for the well-being and safety of your children.

		- patients are required to bring a valid care card and current doctorâs requisition to all examinations. 
		- we can only provide the exam(s) as indicated on your requisition form.
		- incomplete requisitions from the physicianâs office may result in a delay in the exam while details are clarified with the physicianâs office.  
		- due to facility size constraints, we are unable to accommodate patients on stretchers/gurney.
		- our technologists are registered and are specially trained to perform your exam, but only radiologists are qualified to interpret your results. for this reason, our technologists cannot discuss what they see with you.
		- your results will be sent to your doctor.  if you wish to see your images, you have the option to purchase a cd of your images. please ask the receptionist about the fee and processing time for this service.
