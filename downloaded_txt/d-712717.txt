the collaborative process: defined 



ending your marriage with no litigation and a path forward 

















 







let’s collaborate 



the collaborative process helps you end your marriage with no litigation and a path forward. you can start by contacting any collaborative professional based on what you feel you need. if your immediate concerns involve finances, you might choose to contact a financial specialist. or, if you’re struggling with emotions, conflict, or parenting issues, you might choose to contact a family relations specialist. 















your collaborative dissolution involves four fundamental principles: 







 



no court 



both spouses and their attorneys commit that they will not take the dispute to court. this allows everyone to focus on problem solving and reaching agreements rather than litigation. 







 



client centered 



									each spouse’s personal, family, and financial goals and interests are highlighted and carefully considered as the spouses work toward a resolution on all issues.								







 



inter-disciplinary 



									in addition to collaboratively trained attorneys who provide legal guidance, spouses are also able to turn to family relations specialists and financial neutrals to address the family-related and financial issues.								







 



transparency 



									there is complete, open and transparent communication between attorneys, other professionals, and spouses. the spouses commit to sharing all relevant information and documentation.

the collaborative process: the why 



reasons why the collaborative process is the way forward 

























you shape the outcome 










 though you each have a lawyer, you and your spouse take responsibility for shaping the settlement as the key members of the team. 























you retain control 










 a divorce in the court system follows the court’s process. this includes court appearances and hearings. the collaborative process is driven by your family’s needs and schedules. when you reach an agreement, it can be finalized within a shorter time frame. you do not get bogged down for months while you wait for a court date. 























you gain support 










you benefit from the experience, support, and problem-solving skills of the professional team. you receive insight and support from professionals who assist in identifying your interests and your children’s needs. 




























you can focus on settlement 










removing the threat of “going to court” reduces anxiety and fear, which allows you to focus on finding positive solutions. 
























you negotiate a better settlement 










every family is unique and every family deserves a unique solution to the issues raised by their circumstances. the collaborative process is designed to help you reach agreements uniquely tailored to your family’s needs. 
























you lay the groundwork for a better future 










there is no pain-free way to end a marriage, but by reducing stress, working in a climate of cooperation, and treating each other with respect, you and your spouse are creating an environment in which you and your children can thrive.

the collaborative process: the road map 



what will the path forward look like 

















 







contact a member of the cacp 



both spouses in the collaborative process need to engage an attorney. a cacp member can learn more about your situation and answer your specific questions. 











 







signing the participation agreement 



…formally begins the collaborative process. you can find a copy of the collaborative participation agreement here. this is a legal document outlining the agreed-upon commitments all parties will follow. a cacp member can answer any questions you may have about the content of the participation agreement. 











 







information gathering 



…is an important first step of the collaborative process. the professionals work with you to gather and organize all of the information and documentation you will need, including documentation about income, assets, debts, and any child-related issues. the collaborative process requires full transparency and a complete disclosure of all relevant information. 











 







team meetings 



…are held with you, your spouse, and the other professionals. at these team meetings, we review your goals and interests, then work to create options for resolution of all financial and child-related issues. team meetings are the cornerstone of the collaborative process where you, your spouse, and your collaborative professionals work toward a final agreement at the same table. 











 







agreements 



…are then formalized into legal documents to be submitted to your local court. since you took an active role in shaping your agreement, there are no surprises and no questions left unanswered.

it is no secret that one of the main stressors in ending a marriage is related to finances. in the collaborative process, you and your spouse can use a financial specialist. a financial specialist works to educate you and your spouse about the financial implications of ending your marriage. a financial specialist is a neutral participant and does not advocate for your or your spouse. many times, the financial specialist works with you and your spouse to gather all necessary financial information and documentation. because the free flow of information is crucial to the collaborative process, you and your spouse will work with the financial specialist to ensure that complete and accurate financial information has been provided. with this financial information, the financial specialist can then work with you and your spouse to create a spreadsheet of the marital assets and debts. it is not unusual that one spouse may be less familiar with the marital finances. the financial specialist can work with you and your spouse to explain the financial picture, including income, assets, and debts. as part of the collaborative process, the financial specialist will work with you and your spouse to discuss options that work to meet your and your spouse’s financial goals. the might include working with you or your spouse to create a budget and compare that budget to your cash flow. or, this might include plans to save for children’s college educations or to save for retirement. the financial specialist’s goal is to provide financial expertise while you and your spouse are making decisions about your financial futures. these topics might include:analyzing and understanding your and your spouse’s incomeunderstanding how taxes impact your financial pictureassisting with the division of retirement accountsperforming calculations related to spousal and child supportdeveloping property division scenarios
