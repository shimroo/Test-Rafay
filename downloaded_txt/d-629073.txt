	 i've been watching too many scary movies!!!
	 
    


well it seems that i must be watching too many scary movies lately...or that my brain is malfunctioning maybe. last night i dreamed that bob and i were on our way to disneyland and got in a fight. he drove me into the worst ghetto part of l.a. and told me to get out of his car. so, i did, and he drove off. i wasn't too worried because i have family in pasadena and i had my cell phone so i figured they could pick me up. but of course my cell went wacko and was all scrambled up so i could not see the numbers in my contact list, nor could i dial anyone. there were a bunch of low-lifes all around me and i suddenly became scared. luckily bob (the real bob, not the dream meany one) woke me out of my nightmare by asking me if i was getting up to get ready for work. of course i was mad at him upon waking because i thought he did me wrong by leaving me in a gang zone. i've no idea why i would ever have a dream like that about him. he has treated me better than any boyfriend ever. i did have a boyfriend that dropped me off and left, but luckily he dropped me off at my house and took off. anyway, that dream was weirdness. i think the obscene phone calls i received yesterday traumatized me. bob says i am a "crazy magnet." now what does that tell me about him? teehee. on a better note, i lost two pounds! although i pigged out a couple times, i mostly stuck to salads, soups, yogurt, etc. i might just be able to keep that new year's resolution to shed some extra pounds! and so far i've kept the one about reading the bible daily. and maybe i should make updating my blog a resolution! i think i took too many vitamins today...i seem overly zealous to take on the world! go me!

	 i majorly lag!!!!
	 
    


ok, so i have been majorly lagging on getting this thing up and running on a consistent basis. but never fear! motivation is near! or getting near...maybe...ummm....yeah. i have been back and forth to my honey bob's house while my son has been away with his grandparents. now that my little darling is back, i should be home and writing more consistently. went to disneyland and universal studios with my boyfriend and son the weekend and some days before christmas. of course when we got there, there was only one bed! so luckily we were able to get upgraded to a suite with three rooms! the suite was awesome, complete with a room with bunk beds, and another room with a day bed and tv. my love spoiled me with a tinkerbell (my idol) sweatshirt cuz i was cooooollllllldddddd. and when i got wet at universal he bought me happy bunny pajama bottoms and a t-shirt that says "cute, but psycho," (he knows me so well! teehee). and of course, yes, i did wear my pj's throughout the whole place! oh, and the pj bottoms have the happy bunny with a pair of red lips on his butt looking at the world and thinking, "kiss my...,"  ...well you get the picture, i'm sure! so anyway, i had an awesome christmas and got everything i wanted! woohooo!!! here are some highlights of my presents: 1. top gift: a gold and diamond promise ring from my baby!2. nightmare before christmas dvd (loved how disneyland did up the haunted house like that)3. gold cross necklace from my mom and a birthstone bracelet and necklace from my son4. bath set from my 2nd mom5. neck massager, victoria's secret secrets, bible verse calendar from my honey6. outfits and more jewelry! needless to say i am verrrrrrrrrrrrry spoiled! what else has been going on with me, you ask? well i got some lovely obscene phone calls today...about 20 of em! sometimes i wonder what it is that motivates some guys to be such pigs. oh well...yet another mystery to be solved! on another note, i keep feeling like i am being called to some sort of ministry. i'm sure my pastor rues the day he met me because i have flaked out so many times on finding and sticking with a specific duty. i know i am pushing my own will over the lord's and hopefully i will find the strenght to obey. with all that has happened in sri lanka, i feel so compelled to do something. my life is so easy compared with what those people are going through. luckily, it appears that my church is going to sister up with a church over there and we can do something to help. well enough of my novel. i shall return! (threat or promise? noone knows for sure!)

welcome to my blog. why "purrfectly pink" you ask? basically because i love my cat and pink is my favorite color. in fact i have a pink purse with a black cat on it (pinkie's palace) that is shaped like a tank top. fun! i'm just slightly quirky and perhaps even a bit mental (my boyfriend has been known to call me bi-polar). the jury is still out on that one, though. as my profile indicates, my life closely borders that of the soap, days of our lives. no joke! well maybe minus the possessions and alternate universes, etc. stay tuned in though, my life is quite a fast ride!
