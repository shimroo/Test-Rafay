hi sue! first, i want to thank you for making our wedding day perfect!  we had fun and couldn’t have asked for anything more!  second, my boquet was amazing – just exactly like the picture i sent and just exactly what i wanted!  third, you had mentioned you could send us the wording from our ceremony.  what do i need to do to get this??
