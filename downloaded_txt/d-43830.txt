past education programs

niddk carries forward the content and outreach and promotion activities developed under these programs to meet ongoing need.
national diabetes education program (ndep) (1997-2019)
working with local and national partners, ndep sought to improve the treatment and outcomes for people with diabetes, promote early diagnosis, and prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. many of ndep's messages are now available via diabetes health topics and in resources for health professionals.
national kidney disease education program (nkdep) (2000-2019)
promoted evidence-based interventions to improve understanding, detection, and management of kidney disease, including identification of patients at greatest risk for progression to kidney failure.
