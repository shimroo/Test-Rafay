				double-blinded medicine: when doctor and patient are both in 
				the dark


				quality research requires a "double-blind" study that compares 
				"untreated" individuals against "treated" individuals, to test 
				the effectiveness of a treatment, but sometimes those who are 
				doing the study can be so blinded that they may actually miss 
				the obvious. such is the case when studies for foot conditions 
				do not even consider the changes done to the feet by shoes. 
				really? someone would do that?
