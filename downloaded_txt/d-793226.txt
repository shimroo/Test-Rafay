    who are the pits?


"the pits" is the nickname for the rare pit and plant council--a group of nice but slightly eccentric people from new york city dedicated to growing seeds and tubers of edible plants found in local and ethnic markets.
we have newsletter subscribers in all 50 us states, in every canadian province, and a few in europe and australia. we have officers in new york, boston and seattle.

membership is limited to 25, because we hold our meetings in each other's apartments. but our subscribers to our
bimonthly newsletter, the pits, number over 500.
most people buy the tree to eat the fruit. we buy the fruit to grow the tree.
