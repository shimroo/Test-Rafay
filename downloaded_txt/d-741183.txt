   about california round house
 who we are

    over 50 years  from 1969 to present our history in brief:

we specialize in round house building as vital designs licensing dba california yurts inc.dba, goulburn yurtworks, synergic designs internationa, yurt designs, new zealand roundhouse, australian round houses, oregon yurts, california yurts japan ltd, baja yurtworks and california roundhouses.the approach we take with each client is unique to our clients. our goal is to inspire and create affordable and sustainable vital design custom homes. we take into consideration your site along with your budget to fit your desires and needs. we encourage participation to develop in collaboration with our team made up of fellow designers, draftsmen, engineers, and installation contractors. we are an associate contractor group who we have worked with for decades.this process is unique as we do not sell kits or plans. we require, unlike architects and other kits home dealers, for you to use us exclusively from the site evaluation though the design and budgeting, site development, manufacturing, delivery and installation process. we often have our clients pull the permits as owners, take on the property development and finish (if they so desire) under our directives. we retain the rights to build our projects to their initial structure and often through to completion.
we also offer phasing. this involves growing your home over time as you can afford to meet the challenges to build more space as you earn and expand. this often includes designing your home to handle retirement after the kids are gone, to include a live-in, assisted living space, and/or b&b for added income, adding stand alone adu spaces for rental income, space for your kids as adults returning and grandparents  who will all be living together on your property. this can be built into the vital design home.we have experience with living trusts and estate planning with regards to our vital designs. we draw on our vast experience completing projects over 50 years. building on 5 continents with 100’s of families. many who over generations return for additions, re-roofs, maintenance, and referrals to their friends for new jobs.building more homes, studios, rentals, schools, retreats, religious centers, villages and commercial developments.we welcome you to become apart of our growing family and round house dwellers.-david raitt, owner and licensor of vital designs.for more details and history of accomplishment visit the

“people are very much affected by these structures, whether they are modern americans or an indigenous person on the steppes of central asia. there’s the primordial and spiritual and community appeal of living in a round structure, with its connection to our ancient roots. there’s also the quality of the space itself. with its embracing walls and its open-at-the-top architecture, it is both a protective and soothing space and a symbol of the metaphysical quality of being open and receptive to what life has to bring you. the yurt has a very positive impact on the people who come into contact with it” annie raitt



   
from the ancient wisdom of the mongolian culture to the americas.
 be a part of the transformation from “ger” to the modern day permanent yurt.
