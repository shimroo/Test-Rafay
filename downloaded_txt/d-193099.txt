paintball scenario

the arena is rugged terrain. woods, brush, downed trees, trails, hills, bunkers, and man made obstacles are the lay of the land. winning on this field will require teamwork and cooperation if your squad of "splat tagâ¢ warriors" is to achieve its objective, capturing the enemy base.
today, you've given yourself a secondary objective. eliminating... no. annihilating your opponents.
advancing cautiously, you use the brush for camouflage. there, twenty or thirty yards off, you spot movement.
a rogue adversary cuts across an opening between the trees and disappears behind a bunker. you're both equipped with a face mask and a paintball marker. you can fire pellets at just under 280 feet per second, but so can he; you decide to wait him out.
"where is he?", you think to yourself. "what's he waiting for?" suddenly, you realize that your position has been compromised. the enemy now has the advantage. you hear air release from his weapon.
you respond by pumping a dozen paintballs in his direction. the pellet "splats", leaving a bright yellow mark on his left shoulder.
"i'm hit", he yells. you've just eliminated your opponent from the round. you look down at the splatter of green on the ground a few feet in front of you with the knowledge that this foe will return in the next game, several minutes later, to even the score. will you be ready for him?
