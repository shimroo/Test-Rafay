opinion outpost – this is probably the meanest response i have ever gotten to a request for help - 







the survey site "opinion
outpost" https://www.opinionoutpost.com/ came across my desk the other
day. it was recommended to me by a friend. i tried to sign up for an account,
but i accidentally put in the current year instead of my birth year. their
signup website is absolutely terrible, and did not allow any corrections to be
made. it just came back with "you must be at least 18 years old to
participate." then it permanently locked me out from signing up. i went to
their help desk and sent a request for help. i received back (4 days later,
after 3 more emails trying to explain what happened,) the absolute meanest,
most evil response i have ever received from any company. i am posting their
response here to see if anyone else has had problems with this terrible
business, or a similar one. their response to my request for help was:



"thank you for your email.



unfortunately, the accuracy and
attentiveness of your account activity has been flagged, and upon review of
your account, we have been forced to suspend your account.



as a member of our program you may
only have one account, provide accurate profile information and survey
responses. you must also be thoughtful and attentive in responding to our
surveys. when we have concerns about any of these program rules we are
obligated to take steps to investigate and unfortunately suspend accounts.



we do not take account suspension
lightly and do so only when account issues have been identified. at this time
your account has been indefinitely suspended and you will no longer be able to
participate in surveys or claim rewards from our website.



thank you for your understanding."



-----------------------



there have been quite a number of complaints about this bad company on other sites:











this survey company is unfair


march 8, 2020 by wendy from united states

i’ve completed multiple surveys and had several payouts, but they keep freezing my account. i’ve had to email their support desk and they won’t give me a straight answer as to why my account is frozen. they conveniently die this when i’m waiting for my payout to clear as well. i find this survey company to be very shady in their practices. i wouldn’t recommend to anyone. they also have you answer multiple questions within a survey and turn around and tell you that you don’t qualify.



stay away







august 19th, 2019




just joined. spent around 30 min doing survey .when i got to the end it said sorry you have to use another devicthis was for only fiveteen points.i would

 say it's not worth it but since i didn't get any thing for thirty minutes i cant even say that!








if you like doing surveys without getting paid, this site is for you!







november 27th, 2018




they don't pay out the money for the surveys. as soon as you click to redeem, your account will be frozen.....due to "data concerns". stay far away!!!!! get this company

 closed down if possible. easiest way is to not do their surveys and they won't be in business.don't waste your time with them.




not legit!!! they are a scam!!!!!1







march 21st, 2016




i reached my 100 points and redeemed them for my $10 payout and i have yet to receive payment. in addition they did not refund my 100 points. i wouldn't

 recommend this site to anyone. then all they do is send a standard response when you reach out to them via email. total waste of my time.

support h. r. 5893 - right to take photographs





you may not have realized this, but our first amendment rights have been taken away yet again! for some time there have been restrictions placed on taking photographs in national parks and at national monuments and government facilities. just recently we have had several instances locally of photographers being reprimanded and being forced to delete their images for taking photographs of a local nuclear facility from almost 5 miles away! finally a bill has been introduced to stop this! please support h. r. 5893 and save our first amendment rights!

posted by some close-minded loser on my ripoff report complaint and my
response:


no more free rides


author: coast - ()


submitted: thursday, july 17, 2014


it’s a lousy bank because after 25 years they are no longer offering you a
free checking account. well, aren’t you special? if you are unable to maintain
at least $1500 in your 25-year-old business account then maybe you are not a
profitable customer. it’s time to pay for the service.


you do not have a valid complaint.



my response -->



sir, i beg to differ with you, but do appreciate your response. you however
are close minded. i am an artist and writer and bring in less than $10,000 per
year in these activities. i do it more for enjoyment than for profit, but do
sell some of my work. as such, i require a business license, sales tax license
and a business account. it is not my intention to become rich at this, just to
be able to sell my works to interested parties. even the monthly fee would
extract too large of a percentage of my profits to make it worthwhile, and i certainly
would not want to lock up $1,500 with the bank to avoid a couple of hundred
dollars in fees. as for the validity of my business, there are tens of
thousands of people in my same situation with a combined net worth greater than
the net worth of walmart (per entrepreneur magazine, 2012, can't remember the month.)
there are artists, crafts people, musicians, summer carnival vendors, part time
caterers and the list just goes on. best to think before you post such a rash
response. my greatest complaint is that these huge businesses, banks included,
are always jack-booting the little fellow who is struggling to survive and make
a few bucks. they say we are a nuisance to them. i say, why not charge the huge
companies that eat up all their server space and take endless hours to support
and cut the little guy a break!

boycott pnc





thank you so much pnc! after 25 years of service you they have advised me that they have killed their free business checking and are now charging an unreasonable fee and demanding a huge deposit to maintain checking without this fee!!! i am heading down to their lousy bank saturday and cancelling all my accounts and switching them to my local bank, first keystone, who still cares about its customers!  i encourage anyone else affected to do the same - let the bank know by the loss of our dollars how much we hate them! share this with all your friends and spread the word across the world if you think this is unreasonable!
