harsh has cold descended on the nation’s midsection as a polar vortex grips the rockies and northern plains. the bitter cold comes on the heels of weekend storms that pummeled the eastern u.s. with floods, killing at least 13 people. the national weather service is warning of life-threatening cold as wind chills drop to minus 60 fahrenheit in parts of north dakota. weather forces in the arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the north pole into the u.s. and europe. extreme cold warnings have been issued for an 11-state swath of the u.s. stretching from the canada border to oklahoma and central texas.

the trump administration has begun firing several hundred federal aviation administration employees, upending staff on a busy air travel weekend and just weeks after a fatal midair collision near washington. probationary workers were targeted in late-night emails friday notifying them they had been fired. that's according to david spero, president of the professional aviation safety specialists union. one air traffic controller told the associated press the fired workers include personnel hired for faa radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance. a transportation department official tells the ap that no air traffic controllers were affected by the cuts, and that the agency has “retained employees who perform critical safety functions.”

a federal judge says she will quickly rule on a request to block elon musk's department of government efficiency from accessing sensitive data and firing employees at several federal agencies. u.s. district judge tanya chutkan held a monday hearing, despite it being a federal holiday, on a temporary restraining order sought by attorneys general from 14 states. the federal judge says she would issue a ruling within 24 hours. chutkan has said she does not believe states have shown the concrete evidence of upcoming harm needed to merit court intervention at this stage. but she also says some of what she is hearing is troubling.

            elon musk's doge seeks access to taxpayer data at irs: ap sources

elon musk’s department of government efficiency is seeking access to troves of sensitive taxpayer data at the irs. that's according to two people familiar with the inner workings of the plan who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. if successful, musk and his group would have access to millions of tightly controlled files that include taxpayer information, bank records and other sensitive records. the people who spoke to the associated press and requested anonymity said doge is specifically seeking access to an irs system, that enables employees “to have instantaneous visual access to certain taxpayer accounts.” advocates fear that the potential unlawful release of taxpayer records could be used to maliciously target americans.
