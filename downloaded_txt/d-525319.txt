anodizing anodizing is a form of controlled surface oxidation that is typically performed on aluminum. it produces a hard-wearing surface that is often dyed for a distinctive metallic sheen. light metals coloring can anodize to meet various specifications, such as mil-a-8625, mil-std-171,
ams-2471, and
ams-2468.

manganese phosphating phosphate coatings on steel can enhance corrosion resistance and lubricity. they also provide a foundation for subsequent coatings or painting. corrosion-resistance and lubricity characteristics resulting from phosphating depend on the crystalline surface structure. at lmc, we can control this structure to provide the appearance and performance you need.
