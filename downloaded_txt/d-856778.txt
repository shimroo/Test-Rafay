the river runs backward enviro show





 [ listen to our ad-free podcast anytime  here ] greetings earthlings. it's time to return to the river, our beloved connecticut river still being subjected to all sorts of abuse by firstlight corporados, even to the point of running her backwards while pumping out all the contents (live or otherwise) at the northfield pump storage facility or, as we often call it here, the shad-o-matic fish blender. karl meyer returns to the show to talk about that and the firstlight 401 water quality certification application process hearing on wednesday february 19 at the cohn family dining commons, greenfield community college, one college drive, greenfield, ma at 6pm with a standout at 5pm we hope you'll join. as always, we will also bring you along to meet this week's fool-on-the-hill and those whose brains were small, as well as checkout the latest b.s. from his malignancy the mad king and his minions and, of course, a reminder that "it's the climate crisis, stupid!" and more but first it's time for.....revenge of the critters! do not step on a giant python.there's a backstory to week's fool-on-the-hill: "as the head of the [fake] department of government efficiency elon musk is 
exploring major cuts to the department of education and.. to shut 
down usaid.. his team has also 
been granted access to the treasury department’s payments system. but 
unlike much of the country, some senate republicans couldn’t be 
bothered...one major source of distress among experts is that musk is 
rejecting appropriations laws passed by congress -- in other words, 
taking authority over funding. sen. thom tillis (r-n.c.) said these 
actions are indeed unconstitutional, but he is not concerned, saying: 
“nobody should bellyache about that. that runs afoul of the constitution
 in the strictest sense,” tillis said. but “it’s not uncommon for 
presidents to flex a little bit on where they can spend and where they 
can stop spending.”  how can they "drain the swamp" if they "flood the zone"??speaking of which, his malignancy and his freak show maga minions, they better run for the life jackets 'cuz the "swamp" is near full.  that being the case, how about we take a deep dive into it! not enough time? try this short audio from timothy snyder, author of "on tyranny". who needs public education  or ethics when you have full-blown fascism? we are in deep shit folks, but hey this is the enviro show, let's just stick to what his malignancy is doing to the planet, ok? of course, he'd love to control the weather but let's see what the mad king is actually doing, like gutting the epa and halting ev charging stations and cutting noaa grants ( on again/off again) dealing with climate and putting more than 160 epa workers who tackle pollution in overburdened communities on leave or telling more than 1,000 they could be fired ‘immediately’.  also, [freezing] "federal grants for everything from battery factories to 
electric school buses and issued executive orders that have halted 
federal approvals for wind and solar projects." wait, did we forget "drill, baby drill"? yes, there's more but this linkfest is getting out of hand. but wait, there's more! a full-scale authoritarian takeover': vance and musk take aim at federal judges? finally, like father/like son: "a video from a [donald t, jr.] ...hunting trip reportedly shows him posing with the lifeless body of the rare ruddy shelduck bird, in violation of italian and eu laws that criminally prohibit its killing. yet trump jr., an avid trophy hunter, treated its death as nothing more than a spectacle".  spectacle indeed. this is what you get when a b level psycho game show host and convicted felon scams his way into high places. enough.ready for our doublespeak of the week? "reporting on the rally, newsweek noted
 that "trump has pushed back on the narrative that the popular [social security] benefits 
will be slashed, saying when asked if there are limits on what musk can 
examine, 'social security will not be touched, it will only be 
strengthened.'"  we hope that's not doublespeak but......once again it's time to remind everyone "it's the climate crisis, stupid!" it seems like some leader types didn't get the memo: "nearly
 200 nations faced a monday deadline to file what the united nations’ 
climate chief calls 'among the most important policy documents 
governments will produce this century' — their plans on how they will 
cut emissions of heat-trapping gasses. most will not make the deadline. the un says that is ok as long as they are working on them."  😏  the ny times reports: "the first full draft of the assessment, on the state of america’s land, water and wildlife, was weeks from completion....but
 [the] president ended the effort, started under the biden 
administration, by executive order. so, on jan. 30, the project’s 
director, an environmental scientist named phil levin, sent an email 
telling members of his team that their work had been discontinued. but it wasn’t the only email he sent that day. 'this
 work is too important to die,' dr. levin wrote in a separate email to 
the reports’ authors, this one from his personal account. “the country 
needs what we are producing.”  thankfully, some push back.  some more good news, "major victory:
 procter & gamble has cut ties with a palm oil supplier responsible 
for illegal land grabbing, deforestation, and human rights abuses....for years, p&g has manufactured consumer goods using palm oil sourced from astra agro lestari (aal) – an indonesian company infamous for covering up its rampant land grabbing, environmental destruction, and human rights abuses." friends of the earth goes on to report, "this is a massive blow to aal’s business model that will force them to reconsider their destructive actions – and it’s the direct result of our forest defense team and support from members like you."   on to "their brains were small and they died" where the fossil fools have a distinct advantage: "the
 senate confirmed chris wright to lead the u.s. department of energy on 
monday, putting the former oil executive in a key position to help shape
[the] president's energy policies. mr.
 wright [is] the founder and chief executive of liberty energy, a fracking 
firm..at his confirmation hearing,
 mr. wright said his top priority was to “unleash” domestic energy 
production, including liquefied natural gas and nuclear power... mr. wright said he would “work tirelessly” to support mr. trump’s “bold” energy agenda."  another dinosaur advocating for extinction! our critter of the week finds bunnies back from the brink in mexico: "if we're being honest, the omiltemi cottontail rabbit (sylvilagus insonus)
 is not much to look at. it's a fairly conventional bunny: long ears, 
strong hind legs, short tail, a little chubby. except that this 
particular rabbit had not been seen by scientists for more than 120 
years – until now.
 a five-year-long expedition led by josé alberto almazán-catalán... turned up conclusive camera-trap evidence that 
the elusive lagomorphs are still hiding out in the conifer forests of 
mexico's sierra madre del sur mountains."  our enviro show echo chamber replays much of what our guest, karl meyer will be talking about,  firstlight 401 water quality certification application process hearing on wednesday february 19 at the cohn family dining commons, greenfield community college, one college drive, greenfield, ma at 6pm with a special standout at 5pm. we'll be there. you? and this, some of the best writing out there about the present moral panic comes from jessica wildfire. finally this: "as congress moves to “fast track” large-scale budget proposals, they are
 looking to take food assistance and health care from millions via cuts 
to snap and medicaid in order to fund trump’s tax cuts for the rich as 
well as his mass deportation program."  stand up/fight back!let's close with an apt enviro show quote of the week: "right now, the current administration is operating in outright defiance 
of our federal courts and declaring them powerless. by all marks, we’ve 
entered the early stages of full-blown fascism. and if there’s one thing
 we know about fascism, it’s that wars on the vulnerable keep them fired
 up. you’re already seeing so many pundits and opinion columnists 
scratching their heads, wondering how we got here. when you look at the 
history of this country, there’s not much of a difference between 
17th-century puritanical america and fascism. we didn’t “get” anywhere. we were always like this." - jessica wildfireafter our talk with karl it's on to the bus stop billboard:weekly on tuesdays & thursdays. the ma state house stand out is back in a new incarnation! this historic climate action lasted for 14 months and engaged hundreds of volunteers from across the climate movement. volunteers are needed!the new version, lovingly referred to as stand out two, happens at the massachusetts state house between 10 am and 2 pm on tuesdays and thursdays.

public lands in wrong hands enviro show





[ hear entire show on our podcast here ]  greetings earthlings. has it occurred to you lately that the present managers of our public lands are not protecting or preserving them? longtime listeners to this show know we have. zack porter, executive director of standing trees returns to the show to explain why and offer solutions. as always, we will also introduce you to this week's fool-on-the-hill and those whose brains were small as well as the latest outrages from his malignancy the mad king and more but first it's time for......revenge of the critters! surfer's  deja vu.this week's fool-on-the hill is rep. andy ogles (r-tenn.) who proposed an amendment to the u.s. constitution
 that would allow his malignancy to serve a third term in the white 
house so that the country “can sustain the bold leadership our nation so
 desperately needs.” bold?  seems like reckless fascism from here, andy, you old fool. speaking of, it's time to hold our collective nose and dive into the swamp as his malignancy and assorted maga swamp dwellers pour in the sewage. first go here and register your outrage, ok? as one of his first acts as president, his malignancy signed an executive 
order pulling the united states out from the paris climate agreement. of course, he did that last time around but this time "after declaring a national energy emergency on his first day in office, [the certifiably psycho] president said that coal could be a fuel source for new electric generating plants." the mad king as old king coal? nah! a "merry old soul" wouldn't pull the rug out from under victims of the worst climate related firestorm in la history by eliminating fema. getting back to energy, sunrise notes: "a recent report
 revealed that fossil fuel interests poured nearly $450 million into the
 2024 election cycle in support of [his malignancy] additionally, [his]
cabinet picks have deep ties to the fossil fuel industry. doug burgum and lee zeldin have both received hundreds of thousands of contributions from the oil and gas industry while fracking ceo chris wright donated $450,000 to [his] campaign." and from the malicious to the ridiculous the mad king actually signed an executive order
 to rename the gulf of mexico to the “gulf of america”. swamp queen marjorie 
taylor greene is drafting legislation to rename it in all federal 
documents. then his malignancy was flooding the swamp with an illegal funding freeze last week but, thankfully the pushback was so intense that the mad king balked and started back stepping. it was a welcomed defeat. pushback in the courts also:  22 state attorneys general sued trump over birthright order or aclu suing fast-track deportation policy or quakers suing to stop ice out of worship services. stay tuned. guess who helped planes fall out of the sky lately? we can't move on here without giving you this link to bill mckibben's recent think piece on maga madness and give you an action link to let congress know what you think.our doublespeak of the week is, appropriately, the fix our forests bill pushed out of the u.s. house and now in the senate. earth justice noted this from a recent protest letter: "this legislation purports to be about sound forest management and fire, but it could actually make fires worse, and is really about stifling citizen voices, removing science from land management decisions, and legislating a large-scale rollback of the endangered species act and national environmental policy act on millions of acres of federal lands. its sweeping provisions remove scientific review and accountability to benefit the short-term interests of extractive industries." in other words it's doublespeak bullshit. pull out of the world’s main climate pact, bring back coal, log tongass old-growth, "drill baby, drill", trash public lands, end climate funding, wtf, "it's the climate crisis, stupid!" do you think the far-right climate deniers at prager u got the memo? "prageru, 
the prominent right-wing advocacy group that promotes climate change 
denialism, was forced to evacuate its west coast headquarters by the los angeles wildfires, which experts and scientists have said were exacerbated by climate change, the daily beast revealed." 😏 and this from the real world: "the climate backtracker, a project of columbia
                                                  law school’s sabin
                                                  center for climate
                                                  change law, is keeping
                                                  tabs on all the things
                                                  the new u.s.
                                                  administration is
                                                  doing to “scale back
                                                  or wholly eliminate
                                                  federal climate
                                                  mitigation and
                                                  adaptation measures.” things like this perhaps? "as climate change supercharges disease, trump pulls us from world health organization". getting back to the la firestorms and all the other climate related disasters on earth some people are finally starting to realize "there's no place that's safe."  that said, inside climate news reports: "the new head of the u.s. department of transportation issued sweeping 
memos this week, directing the department to “identify and eliminate” nearly all initiatives relating to climate change, racial equity, gender identity, dei or environmental justice implemented during the biden administration. " more maga sewage to flood the zone!  here's a climate issue disguised as a disability access issue.  during the pandemic, ma state and local government allowed for hybrid 
meetings which included both remote and in-person public participation. unfortunately the current rules allow - but do not require -
 municipalities to offer hybrid or remote access to meetings. some 
municipalities are reverting back to pre-pandemic practice of in-person 
meetings only. 
the current rules are set to expire on march 31, 2025 which is just two months away. in-person only meetings often require driving long distances and enlarging our carbon footprints. enshrining a guarantee to hybrid participation options is very popular. sign this petition today to tell the ma legislature to support permanent hybrid access!  our critter of the week this time is the winter wren. "once lumped with a 
group of similar-looking wrens, the winter wren was part of a 
three-species split in 2010 based on updated genetic evidence. the other
 two species created from that split were the pacific wren of western 
north america and the eurasian wren, the only wren species found in the 
eastern hemisphere" according to the american bird conservancy and yet the carolina wren is listed on abc's same page? go figure. "one
 of the smallest wrens in north america, the inconspicuous winter wren 
is easy to mistake for a mouse as it creeps about its favored forest and
 riparian habitats. patient observers will eventually catch sight of a 
tiny brown ball of a bird with barred flanks, a pale “eyebrow,” and a 
stubby, erect tail. this wren always seems to be in motion, flicking its
 wings and bouncing up down even while standing still. its short, 
rounded wings make it a weak flyer, and it prefers to scamper about on 
foot."  of course the wren is always in motion out there in the cold, it so small it has to keep from freezing to death! we think you might agree that elon musk qualifies for "their brains were small and they died" segment. his recent nazi salute during his malignancy's inauguration nonsense obviously replays mid-20th century fascism. elon is a dinosaur in so many ways, for instance his wish to gut social security, medicaid & medicare.  as it turns out, many billionaires are stuck with the curse of ‘affluenza’. they should probably seek help or, better yet, go the way of the dinosaurs. in the enviro show echo chamber we are replaying fairness & accuracy in reporting's take on the mainstream media's coverage of maga. needless to say "you might want to look to a media outlet not owned by a toadying oligarch." we've always had issues with the new york times, the washington post, the big three networks and the like with their both-sides status quo news coverage but since the recent election those so-called legacy media operations have decided to normalize the rise of fascism here in the u.s.a.  that is very disturbing and does not bode well for our nation.  you may have noticed we don't normalize here on the enviro show. and this from our friends at the center for biological diversity: "
the country should also do more to protect marine mammals off its own coasts. tell noaa fisheries to promote whale-safe fishing gear." also, how about protecting those humans who have the least amount of protection? go here.   ok, how about our quote of the week?what an extraordinary gift trees are and how many things we can learn 
from them, if only we know how to watch, to see, to give them the love 
and attention that we give to friends!                - susanna tamaroafter our interview with zack it's on to the bus stop billboard:weekly on tuesdays & thursdays. the ma state house stand out is back in a new incarnation! this historic climate action lasted for 14 months and engaged hundreds of volunteers from across the climate movement. volunteers are needed!the new version, lovingly referred to as stand out two, happens at the massachusetts state house between 10 am and 2 pm on tuesdays and thursdays.
