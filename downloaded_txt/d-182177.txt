what is drala mountain center?
nestled high in the colorado rockies, drala mountain center (dmc) provides the perfect retreat setting for studying yoga, meditation and contemplative arts. dmc combines natural beauty, unspoiled wilderness, blue skies and crisp mountain air with the comforts of a modern retreat campus. our accommodations range from fine lodge rooms with private baths to shared same-gender dormitories and economically-priced seasonal tents on wooded hillsides. meals, with vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options, are included in lodging.
this is a place where many wisdom traditions are hosted, and we welcome all people inspired to explore the nature of self and society. join us and enjoy our beautiful location and warm hospitality.
