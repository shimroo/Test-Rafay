ong’s hat: the incunabula papers

“you have been searching for us without knowing it, following oblique references in crudely xeroxed marginal ‘samisdat” publications, crackpot mystical pamphlets, mail order courses in “kaos magick”- a paper trail and a coded series of rumors spread at street level through circles involved in the illicit distribution of certain controlled substances and the propagation of certain acts of insurrection against the planetary work  machine and the consensus reality – or perhaps through various obscure mimeographed technical papers on the edges of “chaos science” – through pirate computer networks – or even through pure synchronicity and the pursuit of dreams.”
this is the digital historical archive for the website, incunabula.org. it is maintained by joseph matheny. archives of the many iterations of this website may be found as far back as 2000 at  archive.org and previous to 2000 as far back as 1996 under the old imedea.com site.
various independent archives have been built over the years but my favorite was always deoxy’s incunabula research center.
this archive is dedicated to the memory of my dearly departed friends: the members of the formless ocean group (*) – nina graboi, elizabeth gips, paddy long, betsy herbert, ralph abraham, and robert anton wilson.
also, to my “non-fog” departed friends: mickey hollenberg, dave, dw cooper, dr. hyatt (alan), humdog, and diane diprima.
