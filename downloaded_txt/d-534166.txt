home 

welcome to my company’s website! i hope that you easily find the information that you are looking for, but if not, please contact me at the shop.  i do have some help in the shop from one or two highly skilled  part-time staff members and we can all answer your questions!
the northwoods canoe company is located in atkinson, maine, where i have been developing hand-crafted wooden canoes for almost 48 years. my shop specializes in new wooden canoes, restoration services, and building materials. all of my new canoes and restorations are custom built. over the years, my shop has developed a world-wide reputation for the highest quality and dependable work.
please review the site for more information concerning the canoes, the shop’s history, our blog and the “canoecam“, which gives a snapshot of what’s going on in the shop every 20 seconds!
news update – a new supply of old town diamond headed bolts is now available!
thank you for visiting.—

about us ›      the blog ›
visit the shop on the internet:
-the “canoecam” shows what’s going on in the shop every 20 second and also shows the shop activities for the last six days. view the link below.
-view the live streaming of the activity going on today in the building room.  note-sometimes we may be in the milling room or the finishing room.
-watch an 8min, stop action, video of building a wooden canoe in six days! it’s not of great quality but fun to watch!
