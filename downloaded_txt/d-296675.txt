writing, aikido, art, mythology, and more

welcome to my world
i'm a writer, artist, aikido instructor, and historian of ideas. this is my personal website, with texts, pictures and videos. see the main categories on the top menu, or read about them below.
      
	i've been on the web since may 1995, when there was not much to be found on it, but everyone had the tingling sensation of something spectacular. we were not wrong.
      
	for any author or artist, this instant connection to the world is a blessing i wouldn't have dreamed of before 1995. let's hope it stays this way forever. it's true democracy at work, for the first time in history.

the root of the problem: power begets power
the biggest problem with power is that it can easily be used to gain more power. thats when things really go awry...

i photographed a tree outside my window for a year. here's a video of the result.  you find more videos on my youtube art channel.
discussion with the ai of chatgpt
who is the protagonist in hamlet? i tested the ai of chatgpt with a discussion about shakespeares play hamlet. the reluctance of the ai to accept my arguments revealed that it might be all too human, with both our strengths and our weaknesses.
aikido
the peaceful martial art aikido can be described as philosophy in motion. i started to practice it in 1972, when i was 18, and i've been going on ever since. the aikido section of my website contains many texts, photos and instructive videos. click the header to get there.
mythology
i've studied the history of ideas with great pleasure for a number of years, focusing on the patterns of thought in creation myths. it has resultet in a few books, and there is more to come. you can find some of my texts on mythology by clicking the header.
aristotle
myths are stories, so i could not investigate their patterns without the guidance of aristotle in his poetics, where he explains how drama works. it's hard to leave aristotle, once you've gotten familiar with him, so i've dwelt some more on him and his work. read my texts about his life, his cosmology, and his poetics.
my oil paintings
i started painting when i was in my teens, but then writing got in the way. still, now and then through the years i have returned to painting, also recently. it is too delightful to give up. click the image to have a look at my oil paintings.
speculations
suddenly a subject intrigues me, and i need to write about it. that's my reflex as a writer, as well as my way of contemplating a topic. here are some texts where i speculate on different topics. click the header to read those essays.
reviews
my opinion about films, tv-shows, musical performances and more — what they mean and how their plots work.
aikibatto
to help my aikido students learn how to work with ken, the sword, and jo, the staff, i developed a system of exercises that i call aikibatto. it became a book, too, but much of it can also be found here.

some of my books:
archetypes of mythology

jungian theories on myth and religion examined
carl g. jung developed his own form of analytical psychology, based on the ideas of the archetypes and the collective unconscious. he also found those concepts exhibited in myth and religion. jung got a number of followers, some quite illustrious, such as joseph campbell and recently jordan b. peterson. this book presents and critically examines the theories of the jungians, as expressed in their own texts. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).
psychoanalysis of mythology

freudian theories on myth and religion examined
sigmund freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, and several of his followers used their psychological theories to explain the origin and functions of myths and religion. this book describes and critically examines their ideas as they presented them in their own texts. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).
ever young

supernatural fiction
caroline witnesses the agonizing death of her twin brother, when they are no more than 15 years old. horrified, she feels that nobody should ever have to die. then she discovers a hidden visitor in her home, who has the ability to live forever without aging at all. and this ability can be transmitted. but she finds that there are grisly downsides to such longevity. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).
tao te ching

the taoism of lao tzu explained
i've been a fan of the old chinese classic tao te ching since i was about 20, and wrote a swedish version of it that was published in 1991 (with several later editions). after years of hesitation i made an english version, published in 2011. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).
fake lao tzu quotes

erroneous tao te ching citations examined
lao tzu was the first taoist, legendary writer of tao te ching. there are lots of quotes of him in books and on the web, but far too many of them are fake. in this book i go through 90 of the quotes that are spread the most, discussing how to reveal that they are not authentic and searching their real origins. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).

sunday brunch with the world maker

supernatural fiction
treating himself to the luxurious sunday brunch of the waldorf astoria in new york, the author is joined by a young stranger. at first, their conversation is all about the author, his experiences and thoughts on life. but as the brunch progresses it becomes evident that the stranger has a lot to say, too. the conversation slips into the mysterious, soon to burst beyond the realm of the possible. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).
cosmos of the ancients

the greek philosophers on myth and cosmology
as part of my work on creation myths, i studied what the philosophers of ancient greece thought about the mythology of their time and the origin of the cosmos. it became a book, but most of it can also be found on this website. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).
life energy encyclopedia

life force concepts around the world
in japanese and chinese martial arts, the idea of a life energy called ki (also spelled chi or qi) is instrumental. similar life force ideas can be found in many cultures all through history, such as prana, pneuma, ruach, and many more. as part of my research in the history of ideas, i made an inventory of all kinds of such concepts and wrote this little encyclopedia about it. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).

tarot unfolded

imaginative reading of the divination cards
the tarot is a deck of cards that has for centuries been used in divination. i wrote this book about its imagery, history and principles. reading the tarot cards is essentially done by processing their symbolic pictures in our imagination. click the image to see the book at amazon (paid link).
