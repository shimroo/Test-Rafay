everyone who is tasked with announcing graduate names is worried of mispronouncing the names of their esteemed graduates. it has happened to all of us as we look down on the student's name card and cannot decipher the correct pronunciation. the larger the school, the more likely this will happen. let's try to eliminate some of the guesswork. how about we have the graduate call a phone number and be prompted to enter their student id and then record their first and last name which will allow the announcer to wear a bluetooth earpiece and hear the proper pronunciation of the graduate's name ahead of reading their name aloud.
