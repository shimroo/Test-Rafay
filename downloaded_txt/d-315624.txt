 the image features the text "future, found." in bold, dark blue letters on a white background. the word "future" is written in a lighter, thinner font, while "found." is in a thicker, more prominent font. geometric shapes in shades of blue and grey decorate the corners and right side of the image, adding a modern and dynamic design. small grey dots are arranged in a grid-like pattern, and diagonal lines add visual interest to the overall layout.
