resolution
the resolving power of a microscope is the most important feature of the optical system. 
refractive index (index of refraction)
the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in the imaging medium of a microscope. 
introduction to polarized light
discussion of birefringence, brewster's angle, and various forms of polarized light. 
introduction to phase contrast microscopy
a mechanism to translate variations in phase into corresponding changes in amplitude.

spatial resolution in digital imaging
spatial resolution refers to the number of pixels utilized in construction of the image.




stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (storm) imaging
review the basic steps involved in acquiring a storm super-resolution image.




numerical aperture and image resolution
explore how objective numerical aperture size influences airy disk properties.




eyepiece reticle calibration
explores calibration of various eyepiece reticles using a stage micrometer and demonstrates how the reticle can then be employed to determine linear specimen dimensions.
