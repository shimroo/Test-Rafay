a message from our president, amanda myerswelcome everyone!my name is amanda myers, and i am thrilled to serve as the president of hillel at miami university. i am a sophomore studying speech pathology & audiology and disability studies. since serving as the engagement intern during my freshman year, i have found an incredible community of people at hillel who made me feel at home, and i will strive to make others feel the same this year. as we welcome incoming and returning students, families, and community members, i am excited to support hillel's mission of creating a vibrant jewish community where students can connect, learn, and grow.i believe in taking pride in your jewish identity, preserving traditions while enjoying new ones, and everything in between. i look forward to working with student leaders, staff members, stakeholders, and our broader community to make hillel a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. l'shalom,amanda myers
