who is pps?

the providence preservation society (pps) was established in 1956 to respond to the proposed demolition of a number of 18th- and early 19th-century houses on college hill. unlike many historic preservation organizations which were formed to preserve a particular building, pps has always been an advocate for neighborhood revitalization. from that small neighborhood group, pps has grown into a multifaceted citywide preservation and planning organization with a role to play in addressing a range of 21st-century challenges.
our mission is to support and advocate for historic preservation, thoughtful design, and people-centered planning.
