	 the jackal has landed
    


there are aspects of this blog i no longer enjoy.  for a while i've considered calling it quits, but on the other hand, there are parts that i do enjoy.  sometimes i feel like this space is more of a clearing house.  i feel like i created certain expectations and an obligation to write about certain things, in a particular way.  it's not what i want to do on my blog anymore.  i understand that these are self-imposed constraints, but i'm having a tough time shaking them.so i started a new blog here, a fresh start.  if you're a reader of this blog, i hope you'll read and appreciate the new one.  if you don't care for it, that's ok, don't read it.   just don't tell me that you wish i'd go back to doing this one.  i'm sort of exhausted by it.the archive of cackling jackal will remain up indefinitely.  if you're interested in topics i've written about in the past, like publishing, you can still reference it all here.  there's a handy search box in the top left corner.if you're interested in no tell updates and news, please bookmark or add the no tells blog to your rss feed.  i won't be posting that information on my new personal blog.i also maintain the no tell twitter page where i post poetry-related links and the occasional pithy comment.  you can bookmark or add that to your twitter feed.thanks for the good times. more good times here.

just received my contributor copy of from the fishouse: an anthology of poems that sing, rhyme, resound, syncopate, alliterate, and just plain sound great edited by camille t. dungy, matt o'donnell, & jeffrey thomson.  if you're a teacher, there's an index in the back that attributes at least three "poetic strategies" to each poem.  my poem's strategies are address; question/statement; repetition.  which are also the strategies of my life.
