charles addams drawn and quartered






that magic moment just before dropping the boiling oil on the christmas carollers; that rich, rare occasion when, by the dark of night, the pumpkin in the patch carves itself into a jack-o-lantern; that mystical way in which the skier defies reason (and physics) by rounding both sides of the tree – this is what goes on in the universe that is charles addams’ mind. charles addams: drawn and quartered delves into the life and art of the famed, internationally renowned new yorker magazine cartoonist who first offered scenes of unsettlingly macabre humor to a conservative mid-20th century america and then went on to create one of the most enduring television/movie/theatrical franchises in modern memory – the addams family – all of which was the direct result of addams’ unique way of seeing the sinister within the ordinary.
