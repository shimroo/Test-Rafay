american made 



made in the usa, is a quality that sets us apart. 
















 





built to last 



      elec-tra-mates won’t chip, rust, or corrode, even under the harshest saltwater conditions. however, in keeping with our goal to continue increasing the quality of our products, when ge developed a new higher tech plastic material which is impervious to the effects of sun, gas, oil, grease and chemicals, the use of ge lexan® was discontinued and this new space age material is now used.
