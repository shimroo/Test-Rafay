				my love is like agazelle or a young stag: behold! he stands 
		behind our wall,gazing in 
				at the windows,showing himself through the lattice.

				and he made for the altara grating, a networkunder its ledge 
				to itsmiddle. and he cast fourrings for the four endsof the grate of brass, to beplaces for the staves.
