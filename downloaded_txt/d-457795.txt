jesus christ is my
god and the savior of the world!

    
  for god loved the world so much that he gave his only
son that whoever believed in him should not perish but have eternal
life.  john 3:16   

  
 this is what the lord says: "cursed is the one who trusts in
man, who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away
from the lord. he will be like a bush in the wastelands; he will not
see prosperity when it comes. he will dwell in the parched places of
the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. "but blessed is the man
who trusts in the lord, whose confidence is in him. he will be like a
tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. it
does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green.   (jeremiah 17:5-8) read the bible in a year  
  if you don't have an "antivirus"
 program, please get one. "you'll be glad you did!"it's the best
 thing to have on the internet; 2nd only to  
 jesus
 christ.   all these people (old testament believers) were
 still living by faith when they died. they did not receive the things
 promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. and
 they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. people
 who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their
 own. if they had been thinking of the country they had left, they
 would have had opportunity to return. instead, they were longing for
 a better country—a heavenly one. therefore god is not ashamed to
 be called their god, for he has prepared a city for them. (hebrews 11:13-16) read the bible in a year
  


christ
eternal
in the beginning the word already existed. he was
with god, and he was god. he was in the beginning with god. he created
everything there is. nothing exists that he didn't make. 

john
1:1-3 (nlt) 

jesus christ is the word of god described in these verses. when the
"beginning" took place, he already was. someone has correctly stated,
"there never was a time when he was not." if we could travel back into
the history of the universe to the first moment we call time, jesus
would be there. while it is beyond our comprehension, jesus has always
been, as has the father and god's holy spirit.

            
                        
    adding to these magnificent truths is the fact that jesus, the eternal
god, created the universe in which we exist. if you were to go outside
and look around your neighborhood, or focus your eye through the lens
of the most powerful telescope, everything that you see in all of
creation was made by jesus christ.

the next time we say the name, "jesus," let us do so with these truths
in mind. he is greater than we have ever imagined him to be.

prayer thought: lord jesus, may my worship of the word be
representative of who you truly are. 
proclaiming the savior
furthermore, we have seen with our own eyes and now
testify that the father sent his son to be the savior of the world.
all who proclaim that jesus is the son of god have god living in them,
and they live in god.  
1 john 4:14-15

            i am a preacher,  but most of
            all, i proclaim that jesus is the savior with various
            applications of that truth in our everyday lives. if you
            believe in god and his son, you are a preacher also. whether you have
            been ordained or not, hired by a church or not, or ever
            been recognized as a preacher or not, is beside the point.
            all who have god living in them are called to proclaim the
            savior to the world. it is a holy calling, and a demanding
            one. it will pull you out of your comfort zone, challenge
            your commitment, and help to develop you into the person
            god has created you to be.

            john spoke as an eyewitness to jesus' saving power. we
            speak as heart-witnesses; ones who have not seen jesus
            with our eyes, but have experienced him through personal
            transformation. i speak, and you speak, as a
            representative of christ on earth. the message that we
            bring is simple, yet profound; that god the father sent
            god the son into the world to save those who are lost to
            bring them into relationship with him. as you tell the
            story, and i tell the story, some will listen and receive
            the grace that god has sent us into the world to
            proclaim.

prayer thought: father, what a privilege to be a spokesperson for you.

those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking
their heads and saying...."come down from the cross, if you are the
son of god!" in the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the
law, and the elders mocked him. "he saved others," they said, "but he
can't save himself! he's the king of israel! let him come down now
from the cross, and we will believe in him". (matt. 27:39-42) 

jesus would not come down from the cross to
save man or himself, because he chose a better way for them to believe
in him. he would rise up from the grave so they could believe
and be saved  unto everlasting life.

jesus said in john 14:1;

do not let your hearts be troubled. trust in god; trust also in
me.....

you see, at just the right time, when we were still
powerless, christ died for the ungodly. very rarely will anyone die
for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare
to die. but god demonstrated his own love for us in this: while we
were still sinners, christ died for us.  (romans 5:6-8)

this is salvation, the free gift that christ's
death gives us, and it is unachievable but it is very receiveable.
there is nothing we can do to earn it. all we can do is accept god's
free gift through faith that god loved us enough to do
this for us (john 3:16).


the apostle paul says to the ephesians; "it
is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of
god—not by works, so that no one can boast. for we are god's
workmanship, created in christ jesus
to do good works, which god prepared in advance for us to do."

since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved
from god's wrath through him! for if, when we were god's enemies, we
were reconciled to him through the death of his son, how much more,
having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! not only
is this so, but we also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ,
through whom we have now received reconciliation. (romans 5:9-12)

jesus said in john 14:6;

i am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the father
except through me. he also said in john 16:33,

"in this world you will have trouble. but take heart! i have overcome
the world."

again in john 10:10, he said; "the thief
cometh not, but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: i am come that
you might have life, and that you might have it more abundantly." i
believe that jesus has come into our lives and gives us discernment
about how to live; physically, spiritually, and even financially.


we are to do everything that we can to live a healthy
life, because 
1 corinthians
6:19

says; "do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit,
who is in you, whom you have received from god? you are not your own;
you were bought at a price. therefore honor god with your
body."

jesus christ came to offer us a free
choice between life and death. i created this web page to reveal the
truth about jesus christ, my god, and to show that because jesus
christ cared for me, i can, now, care for people. in john 15:12, jesus said; "my command
is this: love each other as i have loved
you."

god loves us, and in james 4:7-10, james
says "submit yourselves, then, to god. resist the devil, and he will
flee from you. come near to god and he will come near to you.
wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you
double-minded. grieve, mourn and wail. change your laughter to
mourning and your joy to gloom. humble yourselves before the lord, and
he will lift you up." i believe god's love is eternal and his promises
apply to every generation.


i believe a christian can claim the same promises god gave joshua and
the israelites in joshua 1:5-9

 if we do as james instructs us. god promised his chosen people that,
 "no one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your
 life. as i was with moses, so i will be with you; i will never leave
 you nor forsake you. be strong and courageous, because you will lead
 these people to inherit the land i swore to their forefathers to give
 them.
be strong and very courageous. be careful to obey
 all the law my servant moses gave you; do not turn from it to the
 right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go. do
 not let this book of the law depart from your mouth; meditate on it
 day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in
 it. then you will be prosperous and successful. have i not commanded
 you? be strong and courageous. do not be terrified; do not be
 discouraged, for the lord your god will be with you wherever you
 go."
 
 and again, moses told the israelites in
 deuteronomy 28:1-14
that god promised that if they will completely follow all the commands
of the lord their god as he told them, they will be blessed wherever
they are, and everything they own and everything they touch will be
blessed. he "will" establish them as his holy people, as he promised,
and they will not be the borrower but the lender, the head and not the
tail, the top and never the bottom, but they will be a blessing if
they pay attention to the commands of the lord their god and
"carefully follow them" (my paraphrase).

someone once said; "we are where we are today as a
result of the choices we made yesterday. where we will be tomorrow,
will be a result of the choices we make today."   in his  daily devotions, rev. barry l. davis said, "the choice
that we make today will have perpetual ramifications for the life to
come. praise god for giving us the gift of choice." 

speaking of choices, lieutenant gen. kenneth a.
minihan, usaf, director, nsa, nsa newsletter, june 1997 said that "the
public has a duty to watch its government closely and keep it on the
right track," and i think we need to make a pro-active choice to make
sure that we know and understand the things that are happening in our
nation. george orwell said; "in a time of universal deceit, telling
the truth becames a revolutionary act." it is time for us to know the
truth. please visit the site below while we still have the "right" to
do so;

jesus christ's resurrection is either the supreme
fact in history or a gigantic hoax. if christ's resurrection is true,
we ignore its implications to our "own" destruction. don't wait
too long to make the right choice in what jesus offers.

in deuteronomy 30:19, joshua
told israel that god said to "choose life and
live," so therefore christ is life, so 
choose christ and live 
which is the right
choice, and if you need help in making the right choice, just click here and you can
say jesus is lord of my life. again, "don't wait too long to make the
right choice in what jesus offers." you must realize the consequences
of the wrong dicision. 



the apostle paul says in his letter to
the philippians, that "you should continue to work out your salvation
with fear and trembling", and to do that, you can click  here for a
schedule to read the whole bible for yourself in a year. although this document  
can be downloaded is not in order, reading the bible from cover 
to cover or from genesis 1:1 through revelation 22:21 will be the greatest thing you
will ever do. i have done it many times and the new testament can not be understood 
completely unless you have read the old testament first, because jesus, paul and all 
the apostles quote from the old testament and a lot of times they are 
referring to something in the old testament that explains and defines what 
they are talking about. may god bless you in everything you do for him and
our lord and savior, jesus christ. make jesus lord of your life today
and receive a passion to share jesus.

therefore, since we
have been justified through faith, we have peace with god through our
lord jesus christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into
this grace in which we now stand. and we rejoice in the hope of the
glory of god. not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings,
because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance,
character; and character, hope. and hope does not disappoint us,
because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy
spirit, whom he has given us.(romans 5:1-5)
