our future
building together for a strong and thriving community
the azle area chamber of commerce’s once-in-our-lifetime project is the new construction of an office building at 256 w main street, right across from central park. with nearly 400 chamber members, this capital campaign depends on the support of our members and the community.


sponsors will be permanently recognized on the wall of honor, with opportunities beginning at $2,500. the walkway will feature engraved bricks for sponsors, as well as large ($500) and regular-sized ($300) bricks available for purchase. you’re invited to take part in this lasting project, brick by brick!
