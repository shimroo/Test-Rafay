faq



why are checkups important?

a little bit of prevention can go a long way when it comes to taking care of your oral health. regular dental check-ups aren’t just for making sure your teeth are clean; they are important in identifying problems before they become major issues. when you schedule a regular appointment with your dentist, you are being proactive with your overall health.



what are the benefits of regular checkups?


regular dental appointments can catch early signs of tooth decay, and ultimately, prevent gum disease.
getting on a good cleaning schedule can help you look and feel better because tartar build-up cannot be removed by brushing alone.
great dental care contributes to better overall health thanks to prevention and early detection.
as an added bonus, regular cleanings help minimize bad breath.




what does a good dental schedule look like?

most dentists recommend professional cleanings and a good overall check-up every six months. every other visit should include x-rays to determine if there are any issues going on that are not yet visible.



what should i do between regular dental visits?

taking care of your teeth every day goes a long way to having a more enjoyable dental check-up. once you leave your dental appointment, plaque will begin to form on your teeth again. this can be managed by brushing your teeth regularly and if you can, brush after each meal. flossing daily with a mouthwash rinse will help to control bacteria, keeping your breath fresh and supporting your overall health.
