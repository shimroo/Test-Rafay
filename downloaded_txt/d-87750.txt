lgbt community
and campaigning

for over 45 years lgbt humanists has promoted humanism as a rational, naturalistic worldview that trusts the scientific method as the most reliable route to truth and encourages a moral and ethical life based on logic, reason and compassion. we campaign for equality and diversity, particularly relating to sexual orientation and identity – both in the uk and internationally. we’re a volunteer-led section of humanists uk and entirely funded by supporter donations.
we were first founded in 1979 in response to the gay news blasphemy trial, and we’ve blazed a trail arguing for lgbt liberation by challenging religious homophobia and standing up to religious opposition to lgbt rights. from equalising the age of consent, and campaigning for same-sex marriage and more recent campaigns to ban the horrific practice of ‘conversion therapy’, our members have always been on the right side of history.
we also organise community-based events around the uk for lgbt humanists and friends to meet, get to know each other, and share ideas. we are proud to take part in pride events and marches across the uk each year, and to vocally celebrate international day against homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia – which we helped to bring to the uk in 2005.
 
what we do
lgbt humanists promotes humanism and lgbt equality, working to combat prejudice and discrimination against humanists and lgbt people. in furtherance of these aims it:

holds regular open, public meetings across england, wales, and northern ireland with speakers and discussions
maintains a website, promoting their work worldwide and linking to other relevant online resources and organisations.
carries out other occasional media work including radio, press and tv to promote its aims.
makes submissions to government committees and responds to government consultative documents concerning lgbt rights.
supports demonstrations and other groups that advance these aims.
provides stalls and information at public events for lesbian/gay and humanists.
publicises the work of a public figures involved in lgbt and/or humanism rights through residential weekend conferences and an annual lunch (both events are open to the public – though the weekend incorporates the agm where only members are entitled to vote.).

lgbt humanist ceremonies
humanists have always supported lgbt rights and all of humanists uk’s community services are fully lgbt-inclusive.
if you’re looking to get married, humanist ceremonies is fully lgbt-inclusive and always has been: humanist celebrants were performing same-sex wedding and commitment ceremonies for many decades before they were legally recognised.
we also offer people who have transitioned the option of having a humanist naming ceremony to announce their new name to the world and mark this moment in their personal journey with supportive friends and family.
humanist funerals are extremely popular too, because they are focused on the story of the person who has died, the family and connections they made for themselves across their life. they provide an opportunity both to celebrate and heal. sometimes even religious families will choose to have a humanist funeral for their lgb or trans loved one because they know the ceremony will be fully respectful and sensitive to the person who has died.
