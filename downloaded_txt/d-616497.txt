our missioncitizens for juvenile justice's mission is advocating for statewide systemic reform that achieves equitable youth justice.citizens for juvenile justice (cfjj) was founded in 1994 as the only independent, non-profit, statewide organization working exclusively to reform and reimagine the juvenile justice and other youth serving systems in massachusetts. we advocate, convene through community engagement, conduct research, and educate the public on important juvenile and youth justice issues.

 












our valueswhen we say “citizens” for juvenile justice, our leadership and staff use that term to convey our shared commitment to community, humanity and justice as we advocate to improve outcomes for youth in massachusetts. our vision extends beyond legal definitions, embracing all individuals as essential and valued members of our commonwealth.we recognize the richness that comes from our differences and embrace diversity. we engage in advocacy with the recognition that all of us in massachusetts share a common humanity and are of equal worth. our model of change is rooted in collective action, engaging communities with a spirit of cultural humility and connecting with individuals across the commonwealth to affirm and honor their identities and cultures while calling out and challenging harmful and negative stereotypes. we are inclusionary not exclusionary. we stand with young people regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, disability or immigration status. we firmly believe that every youth in the commonwealth deserves to be treated in a fair, equitable and developmentally appropriate manner by all of the systems established to support them.we remain steadfast in these values and stand in solidarity with, and fight for, youth and families from all backgrounds who face unjust, inequitable or harmful treatment. with unwavering commitment, we will uplift and empower every young person that we can, ensuring that they have the knowledge, skills and opportunities that they need to thrive and contribute to a vibrant and healthy commonwealth, today and for generations to come.leon smith, esq.executive directortake action
