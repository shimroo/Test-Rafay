about


                    with a career spanning over two decades, puddle of mudd has
                    cemented themselves as a prominent force in the world of
                    rock music. formed in 1991, multi-platinum-selling rock
                    band, puddle of mudd has sold over seven million albums
                    worldwide and has had a string of chart-topping hits,
                    including "blurry," "she hates me," "psycho," "famous,"
                    "drift and die," and "control."
                  



                    puddle of mudd's lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, wes
                    scantlin, has been the driving force behind the band's
                    success since the band's inception. with his distinctive
                    vocals and songwriting style, scantlin has helped to define
                    the band's sound and create some of the most memorable rock
                    hits of the past two decades.
                  



                    shortly after being discovered and signed by limp bizkit's
                    fred durst, puddle of mudd released their major-label debut
                    album, come clean, on august 28, 2001.
                    come clean spawned the singles "blurry," "control,"
                    "drift & die" and "she hates me." these hits propelled
                    puddle of mudd to reach the number 5 slot on the
                    billboard hot 100 chart. this success led to the band
                    venturing out on a full-scale european and american tour,
                    hitting the road with linkin park, stone temple pilots, and
                    staind. come clean reached triple platinum status in
                    january of 2003.
                  



                    puddle of mudd's subsequent albums,
                    life on display (2003), famous (2007), and
                    vol. 4: songs in the key of love and hate
                    (2009), solidified their place in the rock pantheon. the
                    band also released an album of cover songs, entitled
                    re:(disc)overed, in 2011.
                  



                    puddle of mudd's 2019 album release,
                    welcome to galvania, was produced by cameron webb
                    (alkaline trio, disturbed, motorhead). "uh oh", the first
                    single off of welcome to galvania, reached the number
                    9 position on the billboard
                    mainstream rock chart.
                  



                    puddle of mudd continues to evolve and inspire fans with
                    their music, with the release of their seventh studio album,
                    ubiquitous. the album was released on september 8th,
                    2023 via pavement entertainment.
                  



                    with wes scantlin at the helm, ubiquitous promises to
                    showcase the signature hard-hitting sound that puddle of
                    mudd is known for, as well as a fresh take on their unique
                    style.
                  



                    puddle of mudd's music has been a constant presence in the
                    rock scene for over two decades, and the band's latest album
                    release is a testament to their longevity and continued
                    relevance in the music world. puddle of mudd is ready to
                    rock the airwaves once again!
