arts & crafts show history


the show was started in 1965 by robert eischen, who was inspired by the european sidewalk shows and outdoor art fiestas of mexico city. originally called the domingo art show, a small group of approximately 12 artists gathered on sundays in de la guerra plaza and displayed their art, free to residents to browse and watch the artists create their work.
the group soon outgrew de la guerra plaza, and with sponsorship by the city’s parks and recreation department, changed their name to the sabado and domingo art show, and moved to cabrillo boulevard. in 1971 the show invited local craftspeople to join, and in 1972 the name was changed to the santa barbara arts and crafts show. today, there are approximately 150 members, and the show continues to attract thousands of visitors to our community and provide an inexpensive and creative outlet for our local artisans.
the show is the only continuous, non-juried arts festival of original drawings, paintings, graphics, sculpture, crafts, and photography in the world. whatever the size, subject, media, or price, all works are original art, created by the artists you meet!
the show's beautiful beachfront location at chase palm park provides an informal atmosphere that encourages visitors to the show to talk with members about their art or craft - and in some cases even see them in action! the show is unique in that each artist lives in santa barbara county and personally produces every piece for sale. the santa barbara arts and crafts show is still the perfect place for visitors and the local community to shop for that unique santa barbara gift.
