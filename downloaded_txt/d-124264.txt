what idiot made this decision?





apparently the long awaited "sex and the city" movie had its world premiere today in london.  that's right, i said london, as in england/uk/great britain.  a movie based on a six year long series about four women who live and breathe the big apple should clearly have its world premiere in london.  the studio executive who made this decision is a complete and total moron.

frustrations with comcast





great article from the washington post today.  totally describes how i'm sure many of us in this area feel about comcast.  in may i was close to acting like the subject of the article, but i resisted the urge.  just because i hate comcast, doesn't mean i like verizon either.  i really have nothing good to say about either of them.

annoying phone calls





recently i seem to be getting a lot of phone calls from random people that i don't know.  some calls actually show up on the caller id with a person's name and some show up as "unknown." they never leave a message.  i usually don't answer the phone if i don't know who it is, but i am always curious as to who they might be.  i have learned that you can google phone numbers, but that doesn't always show something.  today while googling a phone number i found a pretty cool website called 800notes: directory of unknown callers.  you can search for phone numbers and see if other people have commented about it, as well as make comments yourself.  check it out!
