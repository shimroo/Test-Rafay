                nashville based, but world famous musician billy davis. billy
                and his brother chip have been on hundreds of popular recordings

    this is the
                album "i'm me". recorded at tony godsey's tgr
                studio in napoleon ohio. i owe the world to tony for taking
                on this project. the 6 albums below were all recorded by me in
                the back bedroom on a fostex digital recorder. i used to write a
                song and record all the parts and finish it before i moved on to
                a new song. this is my first experience at knocking out 15 songs
                at the same time. god bless tony for all the remixes.
