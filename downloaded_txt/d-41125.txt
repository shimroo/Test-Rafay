  since 2002, baliblog is perhaps the world's 1st daily updated travel blog. until 2010 baliblog published daily posts on what is going on and how to best enjoy and experience the bali culture. 
  today, 1000s articles are archived and updated to help you explore and understand bali from multiple perspectives. 
  with the pandemic still affecting global travel in 2020/21 - bali, which built a large part of it's economy on tourism, has suffered. we expect bali and global travel to start to return over the next few years. 
  in the meantime, we do know many travellers that have gone in 2020 and are planning in 2021 - there is a lot of availability and perhaps, for the adventurous traveller this is the best time to visit in the past 50 years.
