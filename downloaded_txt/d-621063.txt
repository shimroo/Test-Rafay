hai. super sick of work. it's nth but deadlines.$#@$%$^&%&^&*%^@#!@#!@$^alright, i shd just stop grumbling.ltr am going for my kickboxing lesson. but the lessons are getting boring to me. every week, are the same moves. why cant they just do different moves every week?!sickening.im super bored. with nothing to do almost everyday. this week, will be bringing some work home to do. and humster is coming up to my office to help me carry stuff and all.ahhhh!i wish i could just leave this place. how i wish.____________________i guess all my colleagues are stressed up from work. it's our peak period! and i guess it will be the worst for me, as my other colleague went on maternity leave and that leaves me with my own work and her work!alright, am going to approve some transactions and then go for my lesson! cya!

today din realli have a good time of my life. in fact, i guess they dun have a good time as well. was damn pissed off.even if they're late, they shd just go through the trouble to give me a msg or wad. when i sms them, telling them tt i might be late. they didnt even tell me that they might be late as well. and when i was rushing off from my office, leaving behind my work, thinking tt im late, they are like, still havent rch yet. neh mind.they let me waited a fucking 45mins! yes i timed! so what?! and they fucking didnt apologise!and i just walked ard like an idiot. wasting my time when i can be in the office, working and clearing my work. cb!but anyway, i saw zhang yao dong and huang hui today (while waiting)! filming! at clarke quay river there. zhang yao dong is really so handsome!!!im gonna start reading my book which i borrowed from my colleague. it is titled "7 habits of effective people". quite a thick book but let's see... how long i need to finish that up.____________________i guess there will always be a scar b/w us. i guess i will have to let go of this frenship. anyway, not tt they care also. i also wont care that much. even if im not angry anymore, but so wad?! the scar will always be there and our relationship definitely wont be the same anymore. why go through such a painful process when giving up is the simplest and easy way out?all i know is, treasure my frenz who are worth treasuring. the rest, *shrugs*and im planning a small gathering! it always feel good to have such gathering!
