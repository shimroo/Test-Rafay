a cg&s memoirwhat makes a company? it’s more like who makes a company….over the years i have had staff come and go for many different reasons. although they all have taught me something new, contributed value to the company to help it grow and define cool green & shady into who ‘we’ are today.at any point in time we typically have a new team member that has jumped right in during a very busy time, team members who have been with me for years, and now have become more like family… supporting me and understanding me through all the ups & downs that come with this crazy, wonderful business. some of the team have left and then returned. young, new team members that i’m watching grow at the speed of light. some are actual family who helped me paint the walls of the first location over 20 years ago.our team seems to be always changing slightly from year to year. however, whoever is a part of this team is here to create beautiful flowers. putting our heart and soul into every design. treating every event like it’s for the king, where failure isn’t an option. even through the sometimes intense pressure we are typically grinning from ear to ear, singing the current song on the radio, or maybe even teasing one and other, while diligently working away.i’m amber richman, cool green & shady is my home. i opened it with my husband back in 2002, who would now rather raise our kids at home while i run this beast… i mean ‘business’.the cg&s team is my family.together we have made flowers for tv shows (global morning, marilyn denis, rich bride – poor bride, exchanging vows), been featured in wedding magazines (martha stewart weddings, wedluxe, weddingbells, elegant weddings) and home decor magazines (house & home, style at home).our cherished approach at cool green & shady is to listen to our clients. for every one of our events & retail orders, from first contact until execution on the day of, our true mission is to bring our clients vision to life. wholehearted detail and care is put into every arrangement that is designed, as if it is being delivered to one of our own family or friends.we look forward to meeting you and helping you add flowers to your life.xoxo, amberfollow us on instagram
