a 
              kindness g-d grants humans is that they slowly forget tragedy, and 
              grief softens over time. 
                  the tragedy of 9-11 must not be forgotten though, due to its 
                  magnitude, the continuing threat, and to honor the fallen. 
                  accordingly, accordingly, we are placing this message link here, lest we forget.

                  here is the message 
                  from torahtots regarding the attack on the u.s.a. on 
                  tuesday, september 11th, 2001.
