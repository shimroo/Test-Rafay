 about 
            this website 
 
what's 
            new





this 
              site contains drawings and paintings of birds and mammals by contemporary 
              wildlife artist martin ridley. the artwork could be described as 
              figurative. many works are in the style of traditional realism while 
              others are more contemporary. oil paintings predominate but some 
              watercolours 
              and sketches 
              are also included.

              there are frequent updates of new wildlife 
              paintings. i can share my latest drawings and paintings by recording 
              them using my digital camera. please come back every 2 - 4 weeks, 
              i'm sure there will be some fresh artwork for you.

              jill and i are now well settled in after we completed renovations 
              of our cottage in 2006. the house was  modernised and extended 
              to provide an improved studio work area. we have 
              been living in comrie near crieff, perthshire since 2003. our address 
              details are posted on the contact 
              page


              based in scotland many of my paintings portray scottish 
              animal species or are landscapes depicting the stunning scottish 
              scenery. i do however still go on fieldtrips to locations around 
              the rest of the united kingdom and have been working on a range of major paintings depicting north american wildlife. gray wolf and american elk paintings
