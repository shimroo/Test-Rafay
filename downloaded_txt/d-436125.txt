"bringing all seabees together to share in the pride of their service" 
hot topics    
attention all nsva and nsvaa members. the nsva will never solicit monetary donations in the form of gift cards, money orders or cash. unscrupulous individuals are continually using our members names and closely duplicated email addresses to persuade you into believing a fellow officer or member is requesting assistance (donations) in an emergency or dire situation. these are hoaxes designed to separate you from your money. do not donate or purchase gift cards, money orders or send cash to any of these scammers.
attention all seabees
