looking for a special gift for someone on their birthday? how about a watch from the year of their birth?
in recent years we have seen a big rise for the demand of watches to celebrate the year of birth of family members. not only is it a special present that can be gifted and worn on a birthday but it can also make a very sound investment opportunity. watches can be dated in several ways, with one way being the date of purchase, and another being manufacturer’s serial numbering. please call us for advice.

came in with my girlfriend on tuesday, excellent service.
asked if they had any jaeger-lecoultre watches and was shown two beautiful timepieces while my girlfriend was served by the young lady at the jewellery cabinet. would definitely recommend this business, friendly, relaxed and knowledgeable staff with great charm. 10/10

where do i start with the experience i had on the wednesday just passed.
lets start with giles who greeted me and gave such a generous amount of his time showing me some amazing watches... but it wasn't just with showing the watches, it was also the passion and the huge knowledge that was addressed with it. very impressed with the stock on display and now i have lust for a franck muller as it was the first time viewing one.
the shop is very impressive with the very motorcycle used in the james bond film 'quantum of solace' ridden by daniel himself.
huge thank you again for all your time giles, and i will return for sure.
