testimonials



        

"this was my first year working with fraternal composite. customer service was friendly and helpful when i had questions that needed to be answered. the checklist that was emailed out was extremely helpful when planning the composite date. i have had a great time working with fraternal composite this year! prices are awesome compared to what my chapter has done in the past. i am excited to see what the end product will look like!"

"i got a super quick turn around time. normally i would have expected everyone to be kicking and screaming that things are on a shotgun schedule, but instead, everyone from chery mulloy to scheduling, to the production team was all really enthusiastic about getting us our composite for our special event. i hope that every company could have the spirit and drive of y'all!"
- san francisco state university



        

"you guys have been doing phenomenal work in the three years i've been in my fraternity. the photographer has always been a great guy to us and i've had the privilege to get to know him better especially this year. keep up the great work, i honestly have no complaints all year. there's a definite reason we keep using your services year after year. good job!"

"fraternal composites for years has provided our chapter the highest quality experience we as a fraternity could ask for. from initial contact to the photography session and payment, fraternal composites have made this process very easy and one we as chapter leadership appreciate. there are no other competitors that offer the great service this company does. thank you! go cougs."

"the whole process of arranging, organizing, and taking pictures for the composite has been made so easy by mike and his team. from beginning to end, the fcs team has been extremely helpful in helping my organization get a composite. i feel the utmost confidence in fcs after this experience and look forward to working together again!"

"the customer service was wonderful and flexible. we had events that kept us rescheduling our picture day. the customer service and photographer were flexible enough to work around our hectic schedule to get our picture day done. the photographer was extremely professional and was easy to get along with. we would like to thank him for his time and for being very helpful with my guys and even our dog! i would highly suggest other fraternities to fraternal composite."
