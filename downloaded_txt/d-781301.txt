    take-out
  



be a hero tonight and bring home some of our award-winning, belly-satisfying food for dinner!  simply call (661-327-1378) and we’ll have it ready for you to grab and go.  don’t wait in line - there is a third register designed to get you in and out.  check out our family values menu designed to make ordering a bunch of high-quality food even easier!
















    banquet hall
  



we are proud to have the most celebrated banquet hall in bakersfield!  tired of soul-less, white-box, cocktail-napkin events?  coconut joe’s beach club is the antidote for the boring reception!  find out why we host so many retirement parties, high school reunions, and employee appreciation celebrations.  book early, though!  dates are limited!
















    catering
  



with our simple, budget-friendly catering menu and our experienced catering staff, you and your guests will experience a savory, memorable feast at your next event.  corporate catering, wedding catering, and social event catering (we call them beach parties), are our specialties and make us the caterer of choice for many bakersfield residents.

 














    delivery
  



we offer delivery on our catering meals (for 20 or more) for a modest $25 charge.  over 50 people, we deliver for free!  also, we deliver through a variety of delivery companies.  check with your delivery option of choice.

 














    gift shop
  



choose from a whole bunch of merchandise options.  we carry all of the coconut joe’s brands including “coconut college,” “bakersfield beach,” “live the coconut life” and “be kind.  always.”  grab a sticker, a mug, a beer glass, a collectible poster, a hoodie or a t-shirt the next time you are in!
