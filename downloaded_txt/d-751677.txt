who we are

our community includes day students in kindergarten through grade nine and boarding students in grades seven through nine. while fay has grown and evolved since its founding in 1866, our central purpose has remained constant: we provide our students with the foundation for a meaningful life. fay's broad and challenging program empowers students to discover their talents, develop their intellectual abilities, establish essential academic skills and knowledge, and define their moral character - all essential to living a life of meaning and making a positive difference in the world. the fay community is built on five core values: academic excellence, honorable conduct, dedicated service, earnest effort, and wellness of mind, body, and spirit. our school motto, poteris modo velis (“you can if you will”) highlights our emphasis on determination, effort, and resilience.
