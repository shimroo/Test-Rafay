about state cancer profiles

          state cancer profiles is an interactive map engine produced in
          collaboration between the national cancer institute and centers for
          disease control and prevention. it was developed with the idea to
          provide a geographic profile of cancer burden in the united states and
          reveal geographic patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, risk
          factors for cancer, and cancer screening, across different population
          subgroups. the target audiences are health planners, policy makers,
          and cancer information providers who need quick and easy access to
          cancer related data and maps to inform and prioritize investments in
          cancer control.
