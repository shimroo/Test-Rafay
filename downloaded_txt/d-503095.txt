very strict grading


prices are very competitive




old fashioned personalized
service guaranteed

courteous and fair dealing always. 
i look at each and every coin i buy. 
i handle all orders myself. fast is the word: most
orders are out the same day. 
one of the lowest return percentages for raw coins in
the industry. strict grading is the answer. 
you can call me anytime when i am in town. i will go
through my boxes for available coins and new purchase and describe each
coin if you like. 
i handle only collector coins, sharp strikes, nice
eye appeal. 
i do not sell coins for investment. coins will go up
and down in value over a period of time.
