welcome to albany aikido.























we are honored and excited to formally announce the new chief instructor of albany aikido, kevin grace sensei, 5th dan, shidoin. grace sensei has over 30 years of experience practicing and teaching aikido, and he is a direct student of our dojo’s founder, irvin faust shihan. please join us in congratulating him and welcoming him into this new role.













albany aikido is a traditional, usaf-affiliated aikido dojo. aikido is a martial art that promotes the harmony of mind, body, and spirit. it is characterized by graceful, flowing, circular movements that lead an opponent’s energy into a controlled throw or pin to defuse a hostile situation. since it is based on redirection, not strength, it is suitable for all people of any age and body type. anyone at any fitness level can benefit from this wonderful martial art.
