    want to do it yourself? let us provide the design


my time as a designer is valuable. so is yours. we have a solution for those folks on the go who don't have the time or patience to put up with a fat, old decking contractor with muddy boots tracking through their place who refuses to leave until they get your money. i will design your deck (porch, gazebo, sunroom) from my computer with your help, price it out, and even email you a contract proposal for your consideration. i will take into account your budget along with info on what you most enjoy doing on a deck or patio: cookinghot tubbingsunbathingpartyingromantic dinners
once all of the information is recorded, i will draw up some ideas to fit your budget, house, terrain, and lifestyle. the deck design will go back and forth between us until we get it perfectly right to meet your expectations.

  gazebos & pavilions

the wood we use in our gazebos is pressure treated and is #1 premium, which contains fewer knots. the wood may be painted or stained. personally, we love the beauty and warm appeal that real wood offers. if you agree, then wood is the right choice for you. on the other hand, there is something to be said for low-maintenance vinyl. it is contemporary and has such a silky smooth finish. these structures are super easy to keep clean, and they are designed to withstand both snow loads and strong winds.

    the best of both worlds, screen porches


when you long for some cool shade or a summer shower threatens to ruin your deck fun, how nice to move the festivities into your new screen porch. play cards, eat, drink, laugh, and play in your sunken spa, all protected from the elements (or even to find more privacy).

    we have
thousands of satisfied customers


because we’ve been in business for so long we have thousands who can vouch for our attention to detail and amazing end product. here’s just a few below.



     


i just had to write a note to tell you how much we love our front porch! after we finished the deck, we had a new walkway laid and then we landscaped it ourselves! it was a ton of work but it was so worth it! everyone in the neighborhood loves it and even the county appraiser thought it was original to the house. your plan is such a wonderful addition to our home! it is exactly what we wanted. 
kitti boesel
   


today i took two sets of the drawings, notes to drawings, and bill of materials to our county permitting office. there were some questions on connections during the plan review in which your details, bill of materials, and notes furnished enough information for them to pass on the permitting with but one exception. at the conclusion of the plan review, they commented, “who did these drawings? this is about the best set of drawings on a gazebo that we have ever seen.” thanks again and please let me hear from you.

with your help we made a decision to go with a new driveway, which is beautiful, more professional and thick. we want to thank you for an honest company one can trust and for not holding us to the original contract for the mma. so many companies are out to get us elderly people and we are thankful your company was looking out for the best answer for us and not to get our money. we will and have recommended you to our friends & neighbors.
