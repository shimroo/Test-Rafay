study abroad is our catalyst








 


















































study abroad film festival

launched in 2014, the study abroad film festival asks students to capture the spirit of study abroad. from poignant music videos to compelling documentaries to humorous reenactments, our students stop short of nothing to creatively depict their experiences from abroad.



              watch the films
      









 


















































student identity & diversity

we strive along a continuum of deepening and expanding diversity, equity, inclusion and antiracism at ies abroad. our work fosters an inclusive environment for both students learning and living abroad as well as staff and faculty in the organization.



              see what we're doing
      









 


















































passports & visas

traveling to another country means you need a passport, and it also means you might need something called a visa (or a residence permit!). it's important to do your research early and thoroughly. along the way, we have a group of savvy visa specialists ready to assist.  



              read the requirements

$7 million in scholarships & aid


 we firmly believe that financial limitations should not prevent a qualified student from studying abroad. this is why we commit millions of dollars to our study abroad scholarships and aid.
