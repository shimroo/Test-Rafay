welcome to mandelbrot





in its 26th year, the mandelbrot competition stands as an invaluable intellectual asset for both students and educators deeply invested in the mathematical sciences. this competition is not merely an academic exercise but a rigorous platform that fosters critical problem-solving skills—a cornerstone in the realm of advanced stem education. for students competing for prestigious scholarships and eyeing admissions into top-tier universities, participation in such contests can be a significant feather in their academic cap.
the competition is bifurcated into two distinct formats to cater to a wide spectrum of mathematical prowess. the first, the mandelbrot competition proper, is structured around a short-answer format and unfolds in five rounds across the academic year. while it is accessible to those with a foundational understanding of mathematics, it is calibrated to challenge even the most prodigiously talented students. the second, known as the mandelbrot team play, accentuates the importance of articulate mathematical exposition and synergistic teamwork. although this segment is currently on hiatus, it has traditionally been conducted in three rounds during the winter, serving as an ideal preparatory ground for elite competitions like the usamo.
for a comprehensive understanding of the competition's structure and objectives, we recommend visiting the introduction page on the official website. the information page provides a detailed schedule for the year, and the faq page is designed to address any queries you may have. additionally, the resources page is replete with sample tests and other preparatory materials to aid in your child's quest for mathematical mastery.
given the high stakes of college admissions and scholarship opportunities in the stem fields, the mandelbrot competition offers a unique and challenging avenue for your exceptionally gifted child to further hone their skills and stand out in a highly competitive academic landscape.
the mandelbrot competition is a meticulously designed, multi-round contest that unfolds over the academic year, offering a stimulating challenge for students deeply engaged in advanced mathematics. each of the five rounds features a set of seven questions, carefully tiered in difficulty and scored at one, two, or three points. these questions delve into a rich tapestry of mathematical topics beyond calculus, including but not limited to algebra, geometry, probability, number theory, and classical inequalities.
with a limit of 40 minutes per round, the competition is both a sprint and a marathon, designed to test your speed and endurance in problem-solving. the grading is conducted by your school's designated coordinator, who then uploads the scores onto the competition's website. thanks to a state-of-the-art database, you can access real-time, accurate standings just days after each round, allowing you to gauge your performance and strategize for future contests. 
the mandelbrot competition is flexible in its reach, offering two distinct levels of participation: a national level aimed at seasoned math enthusiasts and a regional level designed for those who are still honing their problem-solving skills. it's worth noting that the questions in both levels overlap to some extent and are administered concurrently, meaning students must choose one level to participate in. schools, however, have the liberty to enroll in both levels, with newcomers to the mandelbrot competition initially joining at the regional level. 
to make an informed decision on the level that best suits your mathematical aptitude, or to get a taste of the competition, you can explore sample tests available online. 
for parents and students committed to excelling in advanced math programs, the mandelbrot competition offers an unparalleled opportunity to showcase your skills, refine your techniques, and gain a competitive edge in the academic arena.
greater testing concepts aims to offer a stimulating and inclusive mathematical experience for students at the competition level. our two contests are conducted across five geographic regions in the u.s. and abroad. we are deeply grateful to hear positive unsolicited comments from mandelbrot contestants and coordinators.
