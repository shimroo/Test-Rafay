the reviews are in...


we stay there every year at sunfest
the staff are very pleasant and more than willing to help you with any thing you need. i go with 5 other girls, the suite was clean and had plenty of room for all of us. the beds very comfortable we wouldn't stay anywhere else. breakers is very convenient to shops, game pier,and right next to the dough roller restaurant for good pizza. 


a great stay at the breakers hotel
the ladies at the reception desk were extremely friendly and welcomed us to the breakers our suite on the 5th floor overlooking the ocean was beautiful. . they even provided a chair for the tub since i am handicapped. i have never had this in any other hotel where we have stayed. we will definitely stay at the breakers again and have already told friends about out wonderful stay there this month. 


an excellent stay at the breakers
the internet pictures tell the story. a very nice, neat, bright and very clean hotel. the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. the receptionist's were there to make your stay just like home. you could'nt have asked for nicer people, they made you feel very welcome.
