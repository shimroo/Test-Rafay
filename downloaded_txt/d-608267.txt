just patrick...







patrick just loves his grammas pool.  the kid has no fear of anything. i just love the look of sheer joy on his face in this picture. 
      i do not like it when they go to georgia, it is too far away, and i am always afraid that her mom will talk them into moving out there.  that would kill me.  patrick is the only grandchild i will ever have, and i want to be with him as much as i can be right now.  i know the time will come when they will move, but hopefully not as far as that.  all the rest of mistie's kids are in portland, oregon, so i would think that is where she will want to go.

easter at tim and mistie's







 owen and patrick discovering what the easter bunny had brought for them.  they had just finished dying eggs.


 and now daddy/poppy is hiding them so the boys can find them.


 patrick isnt too keen on this.  last year the eggs were plastic and had chocolate in them.


 this year they were just boiled eggs!






 owen really does love to dress up in costumes.  maybe he is going to be an actor?



 sitting in the sand box that has no sand in it yet.  it is really cute, the benches fold over the top to keep the stray cats from using it!  clever yes?











a parade of one entry.  but at least they were brought down where mimi (me) was sitting.  now i could get some cool pics of the boys all decked out for easter.

tim cooked a ham, and we had a light brunch.  ham, rolls and potato salad!  i really liked this.  family time, and i did not have to cook!  cool!

now i am off today to their house again, so mistie can have some alone time in the hot bath.  i told her to have some candles, a bottle of bailey's and some fresh coffee then head to the tub for as long as she wanted.  should be fun!

double trouble!  patrick is 3 and still not talking, he is very smart, just no language at all.  :(  owen who is patricks nephew (yep that is correct) is 4 and jabbers like a jay bird.  owen is staying with his nana and poppy for awhile until his mom can get her life back on track.  he just worms his way right into yur heart and wiggles around until there is room for him in there too.  it is so hard to believe he was so tiny when he was born.  patrick gets along very well with him, and they both are very well behaved around me.  i think they are driving momma/nana nuts though. 




 tim had a rare day off, so we went up to see him and patrick and misite on christmas day.  it was a really good visit, and patrick gave me a big smooch!  i love being a grammy!



 i planted this camellia bush 22 years ago when i bought the house.  i left it alone and it just would not grow.  it would stay green and looked very healthy, but no buds or blooms for all that time.  this year, i looked out the window and voila!  tons of blooms on the camellia bush!  i danced a jig in the back yard, and i am sure the neighbors think i am a bit off.  i do not care,  my camelia bloomed!!!!


addie is almost 1 year old now.  she will be on march 15, and this year has flown by!  she was just a cute fuzzy little puppy when i brought her home.  now she is a full grown australian sheppard, with long hair and tons of energy!  

one of my very first blogger friends commented on the last post, and it just about blew me away!  i have not heard from here in years, and thought the worst had happened, but it hadnt!  hopefully she will stay in touch.  i am not sure she wants everyone to know, so i will keep her secret until she says i can blab.  i was just about ready to hop in the car and drive out to see her.  just knock on her door and yell surprise!

merry christmas...







patrick is three years old, hasn't the time flown by?  he is a smart little devil, he can work his mom's kindle, and play the games, he has a leap pad that he can work, and lord love a duck, they bought him a playskool digital camera that takes 22 mp jpegs!  and he knows how to work it!  unreal!  kids now-a-days are born into a much different world than i was.  i think i was born in the best of times.  we still had the family values and simple lives, as i was born just after wwii.  1946.  and just as i was becoming an adult, the techno-age was born.  so i was able to get in on the learning curve for that also!  but i will never be as computer-literate as patrick will be, as he will have had the great fortune of growing up with it.  


i went up to tim's house in lynden, wa for their christmas day.  and it was wonderful!  i got to watch as they opened his presents,  and see what kids now want for christmas.  his parents both believe in toys that allow the child to use his imagination.  so he got wooden building blocks, and a wooden train set with interlocking tracks, and bridges.  it was really amazing, watching him open the pkgs and know immediately what to do.  there was dad reading the instructions, and patrick  who just turned three, picking up the pieces and going for it,.  he knew what he wanted, and when daddy tried to build it one way, patrick took it away and showed him how he wanted it. 

tim cooked a christmas brunch, ham and deviled eggs and rolls, and it was wonderful!  i have not spent christmas away from my home before, and it was great!  no stress on my part, and just family! 

we got home just as the sun was setting, and the clouds were parting to show the sun hit the water.  they bridge was lined with people all waiting for the magic moment when the sky would turn a vivid orange, then red, then purple, then light the entire underside of the clouds.  almost like it was planned! 

today i am cleaning the house (again), and getting ready for tomorrow.  trying to get this family all in one place at the same time is like trying to herd cats!  someone is always having to work.  so my dinner which is usually on christmas day, will be on the saturday after the holiday.  (tomorrow)  most of them will be able to make it.  sherry's new husband charlie, works at boeing, and they are on a hard push to get their 787's out the door and to the line.  so he will be working.  tim works at a shipyard, and they have three barges all lined up to sandblast and paint, and then they will have a uscg cutter waiting in the wings for it's turn, so they are all working overtime, and trying to get it all done on time.  donna, would be working but her husband just had a pace maker put in, so she took off to be with him, so she and bill will both be here, so when tim gets off work, he will be down, sherry will come without charlie, and we will all be together for prime rib! 

i can't believe this two days in a row i actually posted!  let's see how long this lasts!  i am not promising anything!  but i will try.  i miss you all.  maybe i can still get some of you back!  anji and brent you two seem to have stuck with me.  thank you!  now if i can just find leslie and carl again!

merry christmas!

a little catching up. and merry christmas













 
          this is a sunrise over saratoga passage and mt. baker, so christmas eve...ohmigosh!!!  look!!!  it is santa!  i had better get to sleep.




 this is miss addy.  she is a huge dog now even though she is only 9 months old.  she is stuborn as heck, and very hard to potty train.  


she is an absolute love though, and hopefully soon i will be able to handle her better.  my daughter wants me to give her to them.  not!!  she is mine!  i knew from the time i picked her up and she licked my neck that we were bonded!

i have had a very rough year.  my spine is pinching on nerves and i can barely walk.  i have been to several dr.s and finally found one who is willing to shoot me with a steroid of some kind, right into the sciatic nerve.  if that does not work, then it is surgery, where they will cut away part of the bone that is pinching it.   i am almost completely chair bound.  i have had to give up just about everything that brings me joy.  january 7, 2015, i will have the procedure and we will see what happens then.  hopefully i can get out and walk off this depression, and the extra pounds that have found their way onto my frame!

i hope you all have had a fruitfull and happy year.  and i wish you and yours a very merry christmas and a happy new year!  hope to see you in 2015!

garbage gut!





  no matter how well you think you have your area cleaned up and baby proofed, either puppies or babies will find something that they should not be finding, and of course dont let you know about it until it is half eaten.  i went out on the deck to find 1/2 of a spiral litebulb laying on the deck.  pieces that i could find were not enough to put it all back together, so i have to assume she ingested the rest.  i have watched her closely for three days and several poops and she does not seem to be in any discomfort, nor is there any blood in her stool, so maybe, just maybe she did not eat it and she is safe.  i sure would not want to lose her to a piece of broken glass in her intestines.  sheesh!  lord only knows where she found it!  and along side of my bed there are lots of pieces of trash all piled and chewed upon, so obviously she is able to get loose and collect things.  loose socks, shoes, underwear, toilet paper rolls, kleenex, you name it, it was beside my bed.  i had forgotten how inquisitive puppies can be.

meet miss adelaide!  otherwise known as addie!  she is 9 weeks old, and just full of pep and vinegar!

she keeps her big sister sadie on her toes, and sadie is not too thrilled with having a baby to take care of.







she sleeps all curled up between my pillow and the wall, and chews on my hair clip all night long.  the cats are not too sure what to think of her, but they are starting to come around.  slowly but surely!



i have been wanting a puppy for several years now, and this was right where i was at just the right time, so i went in and got her.  



i am going to try blogging on a more permanent basis but bare with me as i may back slide!

baby steps!
