marial arts themed games
08/27/19 at 14:29:48


marial arts themed games. martial arts are awe-inspiring disciplines that keep featuring in movies as various game genres, including video games, virtual reality games and even slots. to try a couple of martial arts-themed slots, we suggest visiting

gyokko-ryu happobiken, bo and ken
 
                          i heard previously that next year will also be the third year of juppo sessho, short weapons (last year), middle range weapons (this year) and long range weapons (next year). like a trilogy, however things might change.

website problems
11/17/04 at 23:37:05


it seems there was some problems with the website, yesterday i found out that the disc quota exceeded, so i deleted old logfiles and checked everything and it looked ok... now i logged in again and noticed there was only 7 members, crap!  
                           
                          i recounted the members and rebuild the member data base and now we have 1783 members, which should be correct. sorry for the confusion, and hope everything works like before!
