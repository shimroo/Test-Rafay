 justice in  every borough






















our work
the legal aid society is built upon one simple but powerful belief: that no new yorker should be denied the right to equal justice.





                                representing new yorkers                                




legal aid ensures every new yorker has  access to justice through comprehensive legal representation in courts throughout the five boroughs. we provide free legal representation  to low-income new yorkers on issues including criminal trials, parole revocation and appeals,  juvenile justice and child protection cases, and  civil issues such as housing and immigration.

we partner with local organizations, coalitions and directly impacted communities to empower new yorkers with resources and information. our free helplines, “know your rights” trainings, and other educational materials help new yorkers stand up to predatory employers and landlords, fight deportation, apply for government benefits, clear criminal records, and more.
