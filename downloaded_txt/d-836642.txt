what people are saying about us

 

“i wonder in this upscale bowling  alley from time to time with with friends who love the game as much as anyone could. i'm more interested in the social scene so i like to meander my way to bar stools. the bartender with the same name as my sister (julie) is usually really busy with a line forming longer then shorter as the place is really busy. she manages to multi-task very well and accommodate my needs as i'm somewhat of a sweet drink specialist. i appreciate this bowling alley and everything they bring to the table as i'm sure they feel the same way about me. roll em straight west seattle!!!”-josh n*****



“my husband and i have been in bowling leagues for the last five years and we love west seattle bowl. great food, friendly staff, and fun getting to know the other bowlers. i've also had a handful of events including: client appreciation, susan g komen fundraising, and several birthdays. i really enjoy the music videos & fun atmosphere. favorite dishes are quesadilla, chicken strips and sweet potato fries, and the rotating monthly specials/fresh sheet.”-jennifer s*****



“so we're spoiled because we live pretty much right next door to this bowling alley. but with covid, this is the first time we've really been able to visit in the 6 months we've been here. but it was worth the wait! you have to wear a mask the entire time, every other lane is closed, and they clean their bowling balls and shoes right in front of you before they give them to you. we definitely felt safe the whole time! the staff was also very kind. it was $34 to bowl for 2 of us for an hour, including shoes. we also paid a $10 reservation fee online to make sure a lane was available when we got there, so we only paid $24 there. the screens are pretty up to date and overall we're really happy they're are local place! will happily go again in the near future.”-alexis c*****
