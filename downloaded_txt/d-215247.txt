theatre royal posters 

				j.w.b. murphy, a long-time manager of the theatre royal in hobart, collected an impressive range of material documenting events held at the theatre. many of these posters have been digitized and can be viewed through our catalogue. one interesting feature of the posters is the diversity of events they advertise. for instance, one poster highlights a boxing match between montie andrews of new south wales and reg midwood of tasmania. the fight lasted fourteen rounds, with reg midwood emerging victorious after delivering a “splendid exhibition.”
