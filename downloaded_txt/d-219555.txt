              china, defectors, north korea, north korean refugees, united nations


dear mr. president:
we call on the chinese government to stop the forced repatriation of north korean defectors
on october 9th, the chinese government forcibly repatriated approximately 600 north korean defectors who had been arrested and detained during the coronavirus period.
north korea had refused to accept defectors repatriated from china due to coronavirus prevention measures, but after declaring victory over the coronavirus, it reopened the border between north korea and china.

in a video address to the asian leaders’ summit in seoul, south korea, on july 13, president zelensky charged that since the invasion, russian forces have “forcibly transferred some 2 million ukrainians, including hundreds of thousands of children, and tens of thousands of ukrainians are being held in select russian camps.” he said that “those deported have been deprived of communication, had their identity papers taken away, are being intimidated, and are being taken to the russian frontier, making it difficult for them to return to their homeland,” and made a strong appeal to the world for help for their own people.

two of these north korean refugees that had been imprisoned in the vladivostok foreigner detention center were released recently and arrived in moscow two days ago. they had already applied for refugee status, but the russian court had refused to recognize their refugee status, and thus they had been imprisoned in the foreigner detention center for two years.

south korean government invalidates aid worker’s passport

              north korean refugees



south korean president, moon jae-in, has a reputation as a human rights lawyer. he seems, however, to be allowing repatriation of north korean defectors fleeing from serious human rights violations in north korea without giving them any protection or adequate consideration.
ngo activists and christian missionaries who work to protect north korean defectors who have fled to china are working in china without fear of being monitored, arrested, detained, and deported from china. however, the south korean government has taken measures to revoke or to refuse renewal of the activists’ passports, claiming that they are undermining national credibility. as a result, the south korean government is putting pressure on human rights activists, and is selling out to the chinese government. we at lfnkr dare not fail to point out the non-humanitarian, inhumane acts of the south korean government.
the following is our summary of an article in chosun ilbo on feb. 1, 2022.
south korean government invalidates passport of businessman imprisoned in china for helping north korean defectors, claiming “damage of national prestige.”
on feb. 1, it was confirmed that the south korean government invalidated the passport of a south korean businessman, “mr. a,” and restricted its re-issuance, saying that he “damaged national prestige and committed illegal smuggling acts.” mr. a was arrested by chinese security authorities for helping north korean defectors in china and served time in prison.
