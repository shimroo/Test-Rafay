the low power programmable leader







            our products
        

            lattice low power fpgas and easy-to-use software tools enable designers to innovate and reduce development time for their industrial, automotive, communications, computing, and consumer applications.
        









lattice avant-x family of mid-range fpgas delivers up to 637k system logic cells of density and up to 25g serdes within the smallest package footprint in its class.












lattice propel is a complete set of graphical and command-line tools to create, analyze, compile, and debug both the hardware and software design of an fpga-based processor system.












avant™-e evaluation board can expand the usability of the avant-e fpga with fmc hpc, pmod, and raspberry pi connectors for rapid prototyping and testing of your design.
