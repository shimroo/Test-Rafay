coronavirus (covid-19)

            due to the coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak worldwide, the global demand for some personal protective equipment (ppe) is exceeding current supply availability.
        

            in addition, the manufacturing of the ppe and many other wound care/infection prevention products have been impacted by the global response to the coronavirus. while you may see product availability reduction in the near-term, please be assured that we at mcguff medical are continuing to work diligently to ensure an uninterrupted supply of products and alternative products to you.
        
            additionally, in order to ensure healthcare providers have access to the ppes they need, the mcguff company is temporarily limiting ppes to healthcare providers.
        
            as always, please feel free to reach out to our mcguff customer service team with any questions that you may have.
