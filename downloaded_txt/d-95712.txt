      new (2020-06-24): search
     

      we added a (google powered) search at the top so that you can search our site. every
  language section has its own search. please understand that as this depends on how
  good google is at indexing our site, new articles and pages are not in the index
  yet. in such case, a separate search in the tables of
      
       available articles
      
      and
      
       available triangles
      
      can help (that later table is also available
  in a
      
       trilingual (de/en/fr)
      
      and a
      
       quadrolingual (de/en/fr/it)
      
      version).
     
     .
     
      the triangle
     

      the parts of the hegelian system itself can be accessed both from the
      
       system
      
      menu on the top as well as via the
      
       triangle
      
      on the upper part of each page:
  clicking on one of the outer triangles brings you to a level deeper into the hegelian
  system, while clicking on the text in the middle triangle brings you one back one level
  to the top (see also our
      

        info
       
       page
      
      ). right to (or,
  depending on how wide your screen is, below) each triangle you will find links to
  articles and hegel texts concerning the specific topic of the page (the topic is
  written in the middle of the triangle as well as below the triangle).
     

      the hegel picture
     

      some of the triangles have an illustration, above for example you see a
      
       picture
  of hegel
      
      . unlike the other pictures you will encounter, you can click on this hegel
  picture as a shortcut to visit the section of hegel.net dedicated to hegel himself.

 the currently used birthday picture (hegel has his 250th birthday this year)
 was drawn by graphic artist
      
       dietwald doblies
      
      ,
 who is also responsible for the graphic design of our
      
       posters
      
      .
 the original painting, from which the graphic is derived, was
      
       painted by jakob schlesinger is exhibited in the "alte nationalgallerie",
  berlin
      
      . it is the most well known picture of hegel and therefore illustrates hegel
  here. this picture was painted 1831, hegel's last year, when hegel suffered from
  severe stomach pains (as a result of which he probably died). it was not appreciated
  by hegel's family according to a private letter from hegel's wife to rosenkranz.

  a nicer hegel portrait is sketched by hegel's friend
  wilhelm hensel in heidelberg (under which hegel wrote “who knows me, will
  recognise me here”) illustrates our
      
       hegel page
      
      (more
  hegel portraits can be found in
      
       our hegel gallery
      
      ).
     

      works
     

      phenomenology of spirit/mind
     

      the famous
      
       "phenomenology of spirit/mind"
      
      (1807) is hegel's
  earliest major work and so gives us the picture of the hegelian philosophy in the
  making - at the stage before the scaffolding has been removed from the building. for
  this reason the book is at once the most brilliant and the most difficult of hegel's
  works.
     

      system (from the encyclopedia)
     

      hegel's philosophical system as such, as it is described in his "encyclopedia of
  philosophical science" (1817/1827/1830) and further expanded especially in his many
  lectures (and is illustrated in our hegel triangles with
      
       more then 2000 topics
      
      in as structured way),
  is divided into three parts (that correspond to the three volumes of his
  encyclopedia):
     



        logic
       
       : neither a formal logic, nor linguistic, nor a
    psychology or neurology, this area discusses the categories of thinking, so it
    explores what we do when we think when we thereby try to find out the truth, so in
    this area we think about thinking. as this also includes to reflect what is
    scientific in what we do when we do science, you could also call it the science of
    science. the order of the logic, like any other parts of the system, is in itself
    ordered logically, starting with the most basic/abstract items, presuming nothing
    (except the will to think and to find the truth). this part of hegel's system is
    subject of an own book, his "science of logic" (vol.1 1812, vol. 2 1813, vol. 3 1816,
     with the revised 1st volume published in 1831), also called the "great logic",
    in contrast to the smaller first volume of the encyclopedia, nicknamed the "short logic".
      


        nature
       
       : this area is about the philosophy of nature,
    dicussing the terms, concepts, axioms and methods we use when we practice science of
    nature. while hegel had a good overview of the science of nature of his time, this
    area is the one that needs most work in order to include the findings of modern
    science. still, especially the first part (
       
        "mechanics"
       
       ) and the
    last part (
       
        "life"
       
       ) are still found worth to investigate by
    modern hegelians. like in other parts of the system, where we have expanded the
    hegelian system to include new areas/discoveries, we have marked them in brackets
    "[]" (e.g. in the areas
       
        classification
    single-cell organisms
       
       ,
       
        classification plant kingdom
       
       ,
       
        classification animal kingdom
       
       ,
       
        chemical substances
       
       , and
       
        sun/light
       
       )
      


        [human] spirit/mind
       
       (in german "geist"): this area of
      philosophy deals with the subject that in modern universities is called
      "humanities", "society" and/or "culture" (in ancient philosophical systems, this
      part is called "ethics"). it enters into greatly expanded detail concerning the
      mind, as follows:
       


          the subjective spirit
         
         (mind) - deals with human mind as
        such, especially the individual (subjective) mind, so it deals among others with
         
          anthropology
         
         and
         
          psychology
         



          the objective spirit
         
         (mind) - deals with the human
        spirit transforming/shaping nature/the "objective" world according to its
        concepts/goals/ideas, thereby expressing itself. it is subject of an own book of
        hegel, "the philosophy of right" (1821). among others it deals with
         
          law/jurisprudence
         
         ("abstract right"),
         
          morality
         
         and
         
          ethical life
         
         (german
        "sittlichkeit"), which in itself consists of the subjects of
         
          familiy
         
         ,
         
          society
         
         and
         
          political philosophy
         
         (including
         
          world
        history
         
         ),
        


          the absolute spirit
         
         (mind) - deals with those areas
        where we reflect our thoughts and actions, especially our reasons, values and
        goals behind them. such basic values and concepts govern our lives at the most
        basic level and by reflecting them, we can come to a greater level of
        understanding and freedom. (the absolute spirit is "absolute" in so far that it
        not limited in this area by anything else other than itself and its own stage of
        development). this area explores
         
          fine arts
         
         ,
         
          religion
         
         and
         
          philosophy itself, as the science
        of science
         
         (the later including therefor also the complete hegelian system,
        insofar having a circular structure, as you will discover yourself when you
        continue to click the uppermost triangle).
