ohio reported its first probable human case of bird flu (h5n1) this week in a farm worker exposed to deceased poultry. since early 2024, 68 u.s. cases have been confirmed in 11 states, with one death in louisiana. most cases stem from agricultural or wildlife exposure. ohio has seen bird flu in dairy herds and poultry since 2022, but no human-to-human transmission has been reported.for more info, check our our health alert to doctor offices: delawarehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hpai-health-alert-2025.pdf
