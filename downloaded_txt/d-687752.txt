1          withdrawals used to pay for illinois qualified expenses are free from federal and illinois state income tax. illinois qualified expenses include tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment or attendance; certain room and board expenses incurred by students who are enrolled at least half-time; the purchase of computer or peripheral equipment, computer software, or internet access and related services, if used primarily by the beneficiary during any of the years the beneficiary is enrolled at an eligible educational institution; certain expenses for special needs services needed by a special needs beneficiary; certain apprenticeship program expenses; and, repayment of up to $10,000 of qualified education loans for the beneficiary or a sibling of the beneficiary.
 
illinois qualified expenses do not include expenses for tuition in connection with the beneficiary’s enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school; and rollovers to a non-illinois 529 plan. the amount of any deduction previously taken for illinois income tax purposes is subject to recapture in the event an account owner takes a nonqualified withdrawal or an illinois nonqualified withdrawal from an account. back


2          an individual who files an individual illinois state income tax return will be able to deduct up to $10,000 per tax year (up to $20,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint illinois state income tax return) for their total, combined contributions to the bright directions advisor-guided 529 college savings program, bright start direct-sold college savings program, and college illinois during that tax year. the $10,000 (individual) and $20,000 (joint) limit on deductions will apply to total contributions made without regard to whether the contributions are made to a single account or more than one account. the amount of any deduction previously taken for illinois income tax purposes is added back to illinois taxable income in the event an account owner takes a nonqualified withdrawal from an account or if such assets are rolled over to a non-illinois 529 plan. if illinois tax rates have increased since the original contribution, the additional tax liability may exceed the tax savings from the deduction.                      back
