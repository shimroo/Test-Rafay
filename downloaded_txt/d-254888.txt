serving the residents of lorain county since 1957



the lorain county metropolitan park district was created in 1957 by the lorain county probate court, under the authority of ohio's innovative, time-proven park district law of 1917. beginning with the donation of mill hollow in 1958 by dorothy bacon demuth, and the gifts of the burrell family, otto schoepfle, john caley, the city of lorain, buddy miller, eric nord and others, the park district has steadily grown to over 9,000 acres.
