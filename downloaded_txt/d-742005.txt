welcome to mph cycles
8th january, 2025 – our building has sold and we are relocating to hempstead – for the time being we are not accepting any motorcycles for service.
texas’ premier moto guzzi and bmw independent service center, specializing in the service, care and repair of your moto guzzi or bmw motorcycle.
moto guzzi motorcycles are not only our specialty, but our passion. mph owner mike haven has been riding and servicing the moto guzzi brand since the 1980’s. for decades, mph cycles has serviced the finest european motorcycles, providing hard-to-find expertise in moto guzzi and bmw maintenance, care and repair.
   
 
mph cycles was texas’ #1 moto guzzi dealer from 2000 until 2016 and is known nationally and internationally as ” the repair facility to go to in houston ” for european motorcycles.  we are dedicated to providing motorcycle enthusiasts the opportunity to receive the best service and repair of your moto guzzi or bmw from experienced and knowledgeable craftsmen, mike haven and davey parsons.  mph cycles is confident that the service your bike gets is second to none, so why settle for inexperienced or uncaring service centers?
