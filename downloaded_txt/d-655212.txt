concordance: software for concordancing and text analysis















 


software for text analysis gives you better insight into electronic texts. 












concordance, text analysis and concordancing software, was launched on 1 january 1999 and became unavailable for 
download or purchase on 1 january 2016 because of compatibility issues after then-recent updates to windows.  i shall not be able to offer a revised version in the future. 
support for concordance is ending
26 years after it was published and 9 years after it ceased to be on sale, concordance is nearing the end of its support period.
registered users (that is, those who purchased from me a licence to use concordance when they were on sale) may continue to use concordance indefinitely, but should note that all support, including replacements for lost registrations or a lost installer, will not be available after a date that will be no later than 1 january 2026 and may be sooner.   therefore registered users should ensure they have their own copies of their registration and the installer safely stored on a reliable backup medium, especially if they plan to move to a new computer in the future.
registered users of the software may get in touch if necessary. this is a new email address as of january 2023. 
if you did not purchase a licence to use concordance when it was on sale, please don't use your valuable time asking me whether you can now obtain the software, as the answer is no.
i thank all registered users for their kind and courteous support over the 17 years concordance was in widespread use in more than 70 countries.
