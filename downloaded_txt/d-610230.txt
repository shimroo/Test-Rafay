        we've been family owned and operated since 1982, and doing business as why realty since 1997.
        

 advantages of homeownership.
        owning your own home can be a first-rate investment, especially when buying real estate in florida. 
        


 costs of owning a home.
        your dream can come true with realistic goals, careful planning, and a clear understanding of the costs.
        

 determining your price range.
        how much home can you afford? there are more factors than just comparing your paychecks to your expenses.
        

 prequalifying for a home mortgage.
        the first step in the home search is home financing. getting pre-qualified for a mortgage is important.
        

 more home for your money.
        there are creative ways to make your money work for you, and a little research can go a long way.
        

 deciding what you really want.
        there are some simple things to consider before you browse the mls and start calling realtors. 
        

 finding who finds your home.
        working with one real estate agent is better than stringing along several who question whether you are serious.
        

 what to look for when looking.
        not all homes are created equal. there are ways to assess the quality of a home in the same way appraisers look at homes.
        

 shopping for a home loan.
        with so many lenders advertising mortgage rates in florida, how do you know which ones are good, and which ones are teasers?
        

 comparing loan terms.
        so how do you know which mortgage offer is the one for you? hint: take a look at more than just the interest rate.
        

 applying for a home loan.
        you have the information the bank wants, but do you know how to present it to them in a way that will get you approved?
        

 mortgage loan processing.
        what is happening behind the scenes after you submit your application? a lot. here's an inside look from the lender's perspective.
        

 if your application is rejected.
        getting turned down is not the end of the world, and it doesn't mean you have to give up looking.
        

 negotiating the price.
        how do you negotiate the price when you find the house? hint: it's really about more than the price.
        

 contingencies in the offer.
        you've made an offer. now it feels like a tug-of-war. how do you know if you're getting a good deal or bad?
        

 preparing for the closing.
        what comes next? who does it? how do you know it's being done in time? prevent surprises at closing.
        

 as closing day approaches.
        in the weeks before the home closing there will be the title search, the survey and the inspection.
        

 the day of closing.
        what you can expect at the closing? here's an explanation of the various documents and the closing costs.
