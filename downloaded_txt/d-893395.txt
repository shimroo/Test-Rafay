the willett house â from computer components, a restaurant is born! from their local roots, love of the new york steak house genre, and ample financial resources sprung a novel idea. instead of bringing their customers into new york city, they would bring new york city to port chester, ny. and so, in 1989, an area largely occupied by a plumbing supply house began a makeover into the first of the westchester steak houses. opened in april 1990, the willet house was for many years the only westchester steak house.
serving a wide variety of foods from prime steak to seafood, and making their own in-house desserts, why travel to new york city?
today, there are many westchester steak houses, but there is only one âwillett house.â live a little today; explore the past; ponder the future.
come and enjoy!
open daily at noon until 10:00 pm
10:30 pm saturdays;
