welcome to our 
"web shop," the
home of  fine european antiques, 
decorative porcelain and accessories,
fine old china, and so much more!!   we 
are strictly internet based, and you'll see 
that we've sold many, many items over the years.  for research purposes, we 
started leaving those items posted and marked as sold 
with the selling prices posted in a faded gray tone 
that is still readable.  while we always welcome purchases, i have become 
obsessed and do enjoy the many viewers who have shared their family stories and 
sent me pictures of their beautiful pieces and their marks which i post 
accordingly in my tables of fine porcelain marks
