well, things certainly have changed since this page was last updated! 
as we try to make sense of it all, reeling from all the shows being (sensibly) cancelled for this season, we are still able to make and ship some of our items, but tragically many of the crypt favourites are in storage many states away from where we are sheltering in place, so we ask that you contact us directly to place an order until things get back to some kind of normal. 



if you have seen 
                        
                        
                        us at a show and cannot find a specific item that might not yet be 
                        
                        
                      featured here on our site, please e-mail us at gardengothic@gmail.com
and we will be happy to accommodate you if at all possible. 

 
all 
                    
                    
                    our beasties are handmade from the finest quality concrete or rapidset hydrolic cement, and finished with 
                    
                    
                    our secret staining method, handed down through generations of gargoyle 
                    
                    
                    makers and perfected over many years.
