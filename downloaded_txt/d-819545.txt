come as you are.
leave better than you could ever imagine.
 
skyland camp & retreats is a beautiful mountain getaway that is steeped in history, love, and a whole lot of fun.
skyland began as a mountain hotel in the late 1800s, served as a privately-owned overnight camp for girls for more than 100 years, and is now serving girls, women, families (and humanity!) in new and beautiful ways.
the skyland property, with its tree-lined paths, babbling brooks, and cabins with screened-in sleeping porches, is the perfect location for you to experience one of our mini-camps, host a family reunion, or participate in one of our equine programs.
