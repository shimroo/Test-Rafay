““i met steve dorff when he was working with snuff garrett on every which way but loose. he was wildy talented and well-versed in every genre imaginable. naturally, i wanted to work with him again, and we did, on any which way you can, bronco billy, pink cadillac, and honytonk man. steve wrote some very clever original songs for those films and is a true master of his craft.””
