more stuff i'm sick of...

jews/arabs/hezbollah...jews get blamed for every problem that george bush doesn't get blamed for. people have been kicking the jews for a long time. most of it goes back to the killing of a false diety named hay-zeus or something... or the fact that they own all the money in the world... talk about a bunch of bullshit! the arab league is hellbent on killing off the jews and the jews are finally starting to fight back... go israel! fuck these arab pricks! they are using oil in their jihad against us every day... let them choke on their oil! which brings me to my next point...oil companies/gas prices/conservationists...bp oil has announced that they will stop production due to the fact that they have not taken care of their pipelines for 14 years. this amounts to the crime of risking a catastrophe and they should be hung by the neck until dead for their crimes... oh yeah, oil prices will now rise... hurricane? raise the oil prices... war in the middle east? raise the oil prices... heat wave? raise the oil prices... some guy got caught fucking a prostitute? raise the oil prices...!!! i'm sick of it!!! kill every polar bear, starting drilling in alaska, knock down the rocky mountains, pump out the trillion barrels waiting there, and start building nuclear plants... it's time we stop being slaves to these dicks...illegal immigrants...one word illegal!!! you break into my house? you're getting shot where you stand... break into my country? death by lead poisoning...the media...fake photos, using dead kids as props, slanting stories to achieve your political desires, false headlines to make people think it's reality... talk about a bunch of lying bastards! the only ones who are more full of shit are priests... and people believe those scumbags too!!body counts...100 dead, 1000 dead, 2000 dead... who gives a rat's ass? it's a war, people die... i don't think enough are dying, these countries are pussyfooting around to try to look civil while murdering... remember, war is destruction... proceed with carpetbombing!!! oh no! people will hate us! bullshit, we leveled hiroshima and nagasaki... we are on fairly good terms with japan... and yes, it's terrible when our boys die in the middle east, but remember the number of deaths in our past... civil war, wwi, wwii, korea, vietnam... drop in the bucketpeople in jail...i'm tired of jailbirds having more rights than law abiding citizens. put them in a room with a bed and a toilet, feed them, and put them to work... road crews, cleaning crews, and picking the crops... they are a drag on our resources, make them pay for their crimes... we have enough license plates, fix the potholes!!!!realtors...i have alot of money i want to spend on some acreage. do you think any realtor is willing to actually do anything to earn their commission? me and my wife have our real estate licenses but do not practice... it's amazing how many people out there must not need to make money...wannabe's...wannabe tough guys, pornstars, divas, and so many other classifications... hey, you think you're tough? come here fake rap tough guy, i've studied the art of pain, i'll make you cry like a bitch... gang bangers who think marksmanship is just "spray and pray" ...try hitting a kill zone under extreme pressure, repeatedly...girls wondering why they are pregnant at 12... look at your daughters myspace page! yeah, that's your sweet little angel showing her cookies... she's fucking and sucking and you have no clue about it... wake up parents, your daughters are acting like pigs trying to fit in....or you have the ones who think that they are entitled to everything their parents worked for even before they die... your daughters think they are paris hilton... if they ever bake you a cake, check around the house for an empty rat poison box...idiots...hey, i have a camera and an internet connection! watch while i snort tabasco sauce, or beat up a homeless guy, skin a cat or staple my balls to my leg... if someone ever shot me with a paintball gun while i slept, you'd see me on the evening news for murder. parents, do not buy your kids video cameras, nothing good came come of it!lowlifes...ah, life is good... i own a home, have a nice car, live by the rules... shit! someone just slashed my tires! some douchebag is blasting his stereo at 4 in the morning! some asshole is tailgating me with his high beams on! can't we come up with more reasons for justifiable homicide?lawyers, faggots and c*nts... yeah, i said it, but not how you're thinking... these are people who use the tactic of "reporting" you to a higher authority to get you in trouble needlessly... sorry, you're fired because you suck at your job...you're being sued!!! boohoo! mr human resource manager, he yelled at me! you're out of a job!!! he won't rent to me because i look like an idiot call the aclu!!!i'm basically sick of everyone trying to impose their will on me, a law abiding, country loving, legal citizen of the united states... the real world war iii is on it's way, but i think it may start right in our own back yards... ...just don't believe the news when they report it

been awhile...but now i'm back

i'm gonna ease into this by hitting a couple of random topics... nothing in depth, just some "off the top of my head" thoughts...1. israel... everyone's screaming about israel bombing hezbollah... i think it's time israel started kicking some ass. no one else is really helping to protect them from all the people who wanna fuck with them... leave the jews alone!2. americans in other countries... if you are american and you decide to travel to countries like iran, afghanistan, or any of the other countries that have a strong distaste for us, do not be suprised when you are killed! idiot americans are now trying to get out of beiruit... oh, please america, help us! fuck off!... this goes double for the contractors who are in these other countries making mucho dinero! you gambled on making money, the only problem is you gamble with your life... don't cry when it's time to pay up...3. princess di ...i don't really care if they show her picture while she died... they show kennedy, why should i be more sensitive to her?4. reality shows ...i must be a loser... i actually watched a reality show about car salesmen, and liked it! i guess it's like the saying goes "everyone has a story"... it reminds me of the show where they would pick a person at random and tell you about thier life... everyone is interesting, it just depends on how it's presented5. realtors ...me and my wife passed our real estate tests, my uncle and aunt are brokers and i've come to this conclusion... i hate realtors! most of them know nothing! they don't know any details about the property they are selling, they don't really know the law, and they never really listen to what you want in a property.the only thing i hate more is, people who can't pronounce realtor... it's real-tor or re-al-tor not re-la-tor... learn english6. hazleton pa ...me and my wife left hazleton because of the growing crime rate. recenlty mayor lou barletta proposed a law that makes illegal immigrants extremely unwanted... businesses will have licensed to operate revoked, landlords will be fined and illegals will be deported... cue the lawsuit machines...thank you lou! sometimes the barletta name takes a beating in this area, but i think this is a great step to making the name great once again! hazleton pagelocal news about the lawwhew! that's a good way to get back into the swing of things!let me know what you think, you weak hearted pricks! lol

hmm.. that's just weird

legendary performer liza minnelli has declared she is through with sex and just wants to find a partner who is kind and has some integrity. minnelli split from fourth husband, producer david gest in 2003 and their divorce is still pending, so the singer insists she won't be racing back down the aisle anytime soon. she explains, "look at my track record - i have good taste in friends and lousy taste in husbands." the 60-year-old, who has survived addiction problems and two hip replacements, is cautious when it comes to her love life she admits she's "seeing a couple of people" but insists, "i'm sick of sex! i don't give a rat's a**! i care about integrity and kindness."...damn, too bad! ...most guys in north america wanted a piece of that!tehran, iran -- three strong earthquakes and their aftershocks reduced entire villages to rubble in western iran early friday, killing at least 50 people and injuring hundreds, state media reported.if you ask me, it sounds like they are being punished by allah for their sins... it's kinda nice to be able to use their own bullshit rhetoric on them every once in a while...

american idol... yeah, i watch it...

whenever i mention that i watch american idol i get the strangest looks...i mean, why is that so odd? i'm a musician, i sing, college music theory, i've worked with an impressive number of high level stars in the music business... why wouldn't i watch?yeah, i know the first few shows are just there to show off the fools who show up at the auditions... the people who are just there to goof off... the ones with limited mental ability, the strippers that think they can sing, and the really scary ones, the ones that think they are god's gift to music and really suck!this last group is possibly the most aggravating... i can actually sing a bit and have made money doing it and i wouldn't even dream that i could pass the audition. these jackasses walk in like they are the next whitney, mariah or elvis and sound like screaming babies or drunken karaoke losers... then, when they get denied, they curse, whine and scream like only the untalented can seem to do...this year there are some good singers... paris is fantastic! i think she should win it all... however, then you have a guy who's about 16... nerdy looking as hell, and doesn't even have a good voice... how did this guy get thru this far?i also enjoy watching the song choices. some people have no clue when it come to songs that will work... unknown and going nowhere might work for oscar nominees, but these people need all the help they can get......and then my fav of the year, elliot yamin... a guy who sings ok but looks like he just came off the farm... and it all comes down to the teeth... please, if you are going on national tv, get your teeth fixed!!! it's a small investment in your future... one of my newer fav movies is "brother, where art thou" ...it's about a couple of hayseeds who sing and have a wild adventure... i can't help but see the resemblance in these two gents... maybe i'm wrong, what do you think?

pricks of the week...

are people so self absorbed with thier own agendas that they can't even get thru a funeral without trying to bash someone politically?today's memorial service for civil rights activist coretta scott king -- billed as a "celebration" of her life -- turned suddenly political as one former president took a swipe at the current president, who was also lashed by an outspoken black pastor!the outspoken rev. joseph lowery, co-founder of southern christian leadership conference, ripped into president bush during his short speech. "she extended martin's message against poverty, racism and war. she deplored the terror inflicted by our smart bombs on missions way afar. we know now that there were no weapons of mass destruction over there" lowery said. "but coretta knew, and we know," lowery continued, "that there are weapons of misdirection right down here," he said, nodding his head toward the row of presidents past and present. "for war, billions more, but no more for the poor!" the crowd again cheered wildly.what a dick! no freakin' decorum whatsoever... this shows what a lowlife scumbag this fuck is... and he gets away with it hiding behind race and religion...former president jimmy carter later swung at bush as well, not once but twice. as he talked about the kings, he said: "it was difficult for them then personally with the civil liberties of both husband and wife violated as they became the target of secret government wiretaps." later, carter said hurricane katrina showed that all are not yet equal in america. some black leaders have blamed bush for the poor federal response, and rapper kayne west said that bush "hates" black people.former president carter, you are an asshole... your ridiculous ramblings show the failing of your mental processes. don't you realize the black community hates you too? you rich, white, peanut eating douchebag...i don't really know what mrs king did in her life except being mlk's wife, but a funeral should be the last place that politics should be brought up...
