												every time we call to get a quote for boat transport they get back to us within the day and are always willing to work with us on our time frame. we know when they are hauling our boats we don’t have to worry about anything. they are the best trucking company we have worked with and they make it very easy to do business with them. 
- maria jones
											



















												through our process of acquiring our boat, we dealt with a lot of different folks: brokers, surveyors, lawyers, mechanics, etc. chuck and william of c & j top the list when it comes to professionalism and thoughtfulness. on time, patient, careful and friendly. they understand a new owner’s anxiety and take the worry right out of the process. 
- dave & michelle
											



















												just wanted others to know what a great experience we had with the transport of our sailboat. everyone was pleasant and answered all our questions. chuck was on-time and a joy to work with.. he stayed in contact throughout the trip with regular updates. our boat was transported from atlanta, ga to pensacola, fl and nothing inside even shifted.
