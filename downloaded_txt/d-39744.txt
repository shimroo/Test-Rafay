hi, hi guys.i had a friends' cut, if you see this by chance. it required you to comment, but not because i wanted to be sucked up to and loved on. i really don't care how much you comment on my entries, i promise! i just would like to know that you're still using your journal and are still reading my entries. i just wanted to see who was still using their journals since i was on way overload.if you missed that entry and would like to be added back, please let me know. :)
