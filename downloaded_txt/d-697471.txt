"the spark that lit the flame"
~join us again in 2026~


























latest news 






the 2024 event came to an amazing close may 24th, 2024 in va beach, with all the remaining 11 teams finishing within minutes of each other! please see our facebook page for recorded videos of not only all of the finishes for each leg, but the awards banquet (in its entirety!) held saturday, may 25th, 2024.
we already miss everyone involved, including our online community!!!!!! but don't fret - we've already begun planning the 2026 event.....stay tuned....

if it wasn't for that liquid-courage-fuelled bar bet between the worrell brothers, the race would not be in existence. and although the first organized race wasn't until 1976, it was that fateful trip between mike and chris worrell in october of 1974 that really lit a fire in michael worrell to make this race a world-wide sensation.
