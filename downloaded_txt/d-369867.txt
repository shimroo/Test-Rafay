noosa wedding hair and makeup
hi i'm debb from beauty on the move! i've been in the wedding and beauty industry  for over 20 years, i am based in noosa but do travel to were you need me to come to you to help with all the preparations for your big day.
i find it's more relaxing and fun to be at your home or resort so you can spend the time upto the ceremony with family and friends or just chilling in the privacy of your space! 
i am both a hair dresser and makeup artist,  when i am not at at wedding i am working in a salon in noosa which gives me a great balance of reality and fantasy!
i offer a complementary noosa bridal hair trial for every bride with a booking because firstly it is great to meet you before the big day so we know each other also we can have a play and find the best look and style for you that works and your happy and confident with. this makes it a fun relaxing time with noooo stress on the wedding day.  
i feel very blessed to be in this industry! i love my job dealing with beautiful girls and their wonderful families and friends.  i have met some wonderful friends in my travels and look forward to meeting many many more!
