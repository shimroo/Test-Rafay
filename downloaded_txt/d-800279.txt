abandon all hype ye who enter here.


i've retired from the shareware business.
these days i spend my programming time collaborating with other like-minded geeks
on the following open source projects:








golly
is an application for exploring conway's game of life
and many other types of cellular automata.






ready 
is a program for exploring reaction-diffusion systems.
it also supports different types of cellular automata not possible with golly.






ag 
is a fast and friendly anagram generator.
(this is a brand new implementation of my old anagrams application.)






glu 
is a gui for lua scripts.  the screenshots below illustrate some of
the scripts that are included with glu.
