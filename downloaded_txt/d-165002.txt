“my visits with dr. coskey are always great. he really listens to my questions and current problem. a lot of physicians are not as interested, but seem to be more interested in typing and not discussing. dr. coskey is very easy to talk to and i trust him very much. i feel very fortunate to be his patient. i also appreciate the staff, they are very efficient & courteous.”



“i have the highest praise for dr. chimenti! she has been my cardiologist for over 13 years. highly professional, knowledgeable, and caring, she listens carefully to concerns, and questions, definitely a 100 stars doc!”






















“dr drinnan is the best ophthalmologist there is! i have been a patient a long time & now trusting him to do my cataract surgery!”






















“dr. chow is very medically knowledgeable and speaks in a relatable language. he’s kind, and professional, and gains the perspective of his patient. he is truly committed to helping his patients physically as well as emotionally.”
