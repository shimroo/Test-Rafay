cditc probationary training for new hires











filling the empty position of an investigator can be difficult.  a compelling resume and positive references are not always a true indicator of a canditates ability to perform.  therefore, it is common practice for employers to use "probationary periods" when hiring new employees.  the probationary period is used as a time to assess whether the new hire is a good fit for the position. typically, probationary periods range from 3 months to 6 months.  during this time the new hire should be assigned a mentor and enrolled in training to introduce them to agency policy, procedures, and the professional demands of the position.  new hires require time to adapt to the new position. it is also a time for the agency to determine if the new hire has the necessary mindset and skills required to be successful. tips for successful use of probationary policies  clearly communicate what is expected during the probationary period. assign a mentor to advise the new hire on policies and procedures.provide reviews, as well as constructive criticism and counseling.enroll the new hire in discipline specific training to educate and evaluate their ability to perform in the position. all training and evaluations provided during the probationary period should be fully documented.  testing by a third party training source provides an objective assessment. what is required to be a successful criminal defense investigator? a professional criminal defense investigator is best measured by their intellectual acuity.  they are first and foremost a problem solver retained to deliver solutions. investigation demands a line by line, page by page analysis. missing or misunderstanding one line or even one word can have a significant impact on the outcome of a case.  it is important to secure the best evidence. mistakes matter!cditc training, assignments, and test questions have been drafted in a manner that demands participants study the questions presented carefully in order to fully understand the objective of the questions. the concept recognizes that the investigator is not an expert who possesses all the answers. however, the investigator should strive to be an expert in forming and understanding the questions necessary to uncover and secure an answer. the training, evaluation and testing process is designed to function as an investigation.  the tests are open-book and the direct source of the answers can be found within the text book. careful study is required to seek the correct answer. it may require more than the identification of one word or one line. verification may require interpretation of an entire paragraph to gain a complete understanding of the idea or concept being communicated.  training participants are instructed to approach the test in the same manner they would an assignment.  analysis of the requests, objectives and case materials demands a line by line analysis and comparative study. failing to understand, misinterpretation, or just missing a single line or word can derail an otherwise successful investigation. one mistake leads to another. also, consider the interview of a witness as an example. is it the responsibility of the witness to provide the answers or is it the responsibility of the interviewer to ask the right questions to recover the answers? one should always clarify and verify. the correct interpretation of information demands painstaking attention to detail.  the investigator must be able to process information and facts for comparative study and analysis at the highest level. the investigator must see what others fail to see. the cditc training, evaluation, and testing process is designed to sharpen the intellectual acuity required to succeed as a professional investigator.  training participants are delivered training consistent with the demands of an investigative position. cditc remote training is not a one dimensional online course. the training engages the participants on multiple levels including research, practical assignments, and online testing.  the progress of participants is closely monitored, evaluated and graded by an instructor.  the process requires individual engagement consistent with the demands of managing a caseload.   unlike onsite training, participants are unable to merely attend without active engagement in the training and pursuit of the objectives. the training clearly identifies staff members who possess the investigative knowledge, talent, critical thinking skills as well as the initiative required to succeed as a professional criminal defense investigator.  of course, it also identifies deficits and areas in need of improvement. the training serves as cost effective academy level learning opportunity for new hires but also sharpens existing skill sets for experienced staff members.call 1-800-465-5233 to discuss how the cditc distance learning program can be a benefit to your organization.
