                washington dc, the capital of the united states of america, 
                is a fascinating city for any visitor. the stunning parks, long 
                tree lined boulevards, marble monuments and numerous museums provide 
                an idyllic setting to learn about the hisory of the "greatest 
                nation of the modern world".



originally 
                designed and built as the new home for the federal government, 
                many of washington dc's districts have been formed around the 
                inner workings of the nation and many of the key buildings in 
                the city, such as the supreme court, the white house, the fbi 
                building and even the pentagon, may be visited for free.


                the city's wealth of american history and culture is overwhelming 
                and a brief stroll around the national mall, with its many 
                monuments and memorials, is an excellent start to exploring the american 
                heritage found in washington dc.
