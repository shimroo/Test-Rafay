lauren formby
15 job openings

"lauren is great. she works really hard and has helped us find some very high quality candidates. she doesn't just find candidates to fill a role, but keeps looking to find the right candidates to fill a role. and the applicants enjoy working with her as well, so it's been perfect on both sides. if you're in need of hard to find engineers, she can find them."
braden r, svp, product development




jenn parrella
17 job openings

"i have a brief story to tell you. in february i saw a posting for a job in worcester from cybercoders. i applied. at the time i didn't know that cybercoders was anything more that a "job board", i didn't know cybercoders had people. 

i got a response from jenn parrella about my application and she gave me the details about the job. i matched up very well with what the company wanted so she submitted me and in about a week i was sitting in their offices with the guy who would be my boss!

then covid came. jenn let me know that they liked me and would probably want a 2nd interview but everything was on hold. for the next three months we kept in touch on a bi-weekly basis. how was i doing? how was my job search doing.how was she doing? how was the company doing? i have never encountered a recruiter who had her level of care for me, her customer. during this time i was not working, as my company had let me go as part of covid and that care meant a lot."
edward c, contract manager
