water heater maintenance,
    
    smelly hot water solutions,
    
    troubleshooting and 
    anodes



the corro-protec powered anode is the ultimate solution to rotten-egg odor in water heaters. there are three variants:
sku23 for tanks of 40-89 gallons, $161
sku24 for tanks of 90-120 gallons, $171





 here you see solid and flexible hex-head anodes and solid and flexible combo, or outlet anodes. those are the four varients; they come in two metals. magnesium is preferred for longevity where there is no odor issue. aluminum/zinc is best for odor where no water softener is being used.

this site comprises 250 pages of information on water heater maintenance, safety and troubleshooting, and it's been around for more than 20 years. key sections comprise:

smelly hot water -- we know as much or more as anybody in north america about this problem. we know what works in which situations and what doesn't work at all
anodes -- some are sacrificial anodes, some are powered anodes, some are for maintenance, some are for odor. all are important. we also sell products to expel water heater sediment, and larry weingarten's water heater workbook
news about water heaters -- mostly recalls of products
fun stuff -- how can anything about water heaters be fun? you'll see.....

there is a lot of free information here, but we also offer economical consultations that can save you time, money and grief. our focus is solving problems, not merchandising. it might be something you buy, but it also might be something you do

 water heaters 101

this used to be called water heater basics and that's how we often think of it. it's a giant section, so we won't describe it all right here, but key topics include:

 water heater sediment or scale
sacrificial anodes
 powered anodes
 safety
 tankless heaters
what kills water heaters
choosing a water heater

water heater maintenance
now an offshoot of wh 101, these topics are: 

know-how, a step-by-step guide to prefitting/retrofitting a water heater 
preventive maintenance tasks, which includes additional chores to make it easy service a heater
 tools, telling you just which ones you need

water heaters in apartments
if you can save money maintaining one water heater, think how much you save maintaining a thousand! or commercial tanks that cost thousands of dollars. includes pages on:

optimal setup of commercial and residential tanks
inspections
optimal setup of recirc pumps. if those are plumbed improperly, they'll airlock and burn out.
how to service a commercial water heater

troubleshooting
this section has a variety of resources. one requires explanation. for 19 years, we ran a problem-solving forum called  the tank. eventually people stopped posting there, so we removed it, but at the end, there were 5,000 topics and 20,000 posts. tanklets takes the most important of these and continues in static html pages with a subject index. look there first for answers to problems.

not enough hot water -- a common complaint with several causes
quick -- quick tips, fixes and caveats
lingo -- our glossary of water heater terms
smelly hot water -- we know its several causes and fixes
consulting -- read anything on the site for free, but if you need to ask, you need this
peroxide fix --  a cheap but temporary solution to smelly hot water

we are a business, so we sell  solid and flexible magnesium sacrificial water heater anodes for replacement when your factory anode is consumed so that you don't find yourself with a leaking water heater. also, we are one of the very few who sell curved dip tubes for sediment (also known as scale) control; sediment buildup contributes to water heater failure and electric element failure, and sometimes contributes to odor issues.
and we have solid and flexible aluminum/zinc anodes and powered anodes (impressed-current) to use in smelly water heaters. and other stuff, too, such as sediment flush kits and larry weingarten's water heater workbook.

random musings
everybody has opinions. a few are able to get theirs published. i got tired of having mine bounce around inside my head. read if you dare. not about water heaters, anyway.
what our customers say about us
after i ordered and paid, randy contacted me to suggest lowering the payment because 
    i had ordered the same item 2x and didn't need 2 manuals, then he refunded 
    me extra money. who does that? while installing the parts, i contacted 
    him a couple more times with questions, he was always helpful and responsive. 
    in short, it's great to do business with someone who simply cares about 
    quality and customer service. -- elizabeth, yelm, wa 


 i ended up using one of the sizing tools you recommended. it suggested around 50 gallons. i was able to find a 30 gallon that would fit so i went with two of them. it was actually smaller than the electric options i looked at so everything worked out well.
    
  the $30 for your consultation is far and away the best $30 i have ever spent. in no time, you had me comfortable with the direction to take and you suggested options that my plumbers never thought of after two visits and many days of âresearch.â 
after two plumber visits, their only advice was that they were unable to find a water heater that would fit the space, told me not to waste time maintaining my water heater in the future because water heaters only last ten or so years anyway and they have now stopped returning my calls. this is after they came out on a second visit with a water heater that wouldnât fit the space. after that visit, their plan was to come out with a 22â diameter water heater which would be about 26â with the controls, even though the space is only 22â deep. they were going to âsqueeze it in somehow.â
    
    it is so refreshing to get advice from someone that provides the truth. it makes me realize how rare this is these days. 
  thanks for the superb advice and for taking the time to create such a great site. -- doug, lake bluff, il
