                                       can not say enough good things about mt. kim. we've been there for almost 2 years, and the masters provide the perfect balance of discipline and encouragement. it's clear that the masters really care about the kids. an absolute hidden gem!

                                       your instructors in vienna are exceptional with kids. your commitment to real tae kwondo do versus "streetfighting" is clear. and if that doesn't impress people, how about the fact that my 5 year old girly girl gave up her dance class for your classes without a second thought. can't wait to send my 2 year old girl here. thank you!

                                       we just had our son's 3rd birthday party at mountain kim and it was totally awesome! the kids loved it and the kids were engrossed and into learning! everyone wanted to have their kid's party there. thank you so much!

                                       i really shopped around for a dojang that would allow me to take classes late after my work day. i didn't realize i would be treated to a learning experience with such a rich environment of diverse people of all ages and walks of life. there is an emphasis on positivity and self-confidence and even though i can learn at my own pace, i am also pleasantly challenged to work harder and do better. it's a nice change to view exercise as a treat rather than a chore!

                                       if you are looking for a martial arts place in charlottesville this is the place to go. masters and instructors are absolutely amazing. our daughter is starting knee high ninja classes and her progress on self-confidence, self-reliance, and self-discipline is amazing. the sense of community and family at mt kim charlottesville is really empowering for children and adults alike.

                                       master an is one of the best masters i have ever met. he will teach professional taekwondo, judo and hapkido techniques that you can trust. you guys are lucky.

                                       master an is the best master!!! you get the best workout as well as fun in his superb taekwondo classes! for kids, he exemplifies discipline and endurance. for adults, he makes sure they get the intense exercise they can ever get at a martial arts studio.

                                       my 5 year old daughter absolutely loves going to mt. kim after school. master kim is very patient with the children, teaches them respect & works with them. the after-school tutor reads with them as well! i definitely recommend mt. kim!

                                       having spent just shy of 22 years in the usmc, i know what it means to be part of a real team or what it feels like to part of something recognizably good and special. so outside of the top-notch instruction, that is what drew me in. the reception i received when i first started was awesome and the great sense of team i’ve seen and continue to feel as i progress through training/instruction has me still going today. the atmosphere of the instruction is fun but conducive to learning proper techniques. all the instructors are firm, fair, creative, talented, and effective. i’m currently participating in the hapkido program but i have the opportunity to observe, from time to time, all ages participating in judo and taekwondo programs which are fun, exciting, and challenging with an emphasis on proper technique.

                                       my experience at mountain kim martial arts was awesome! i have been doing martial arts since 1990 and because of my job, i have been forced to find new places to train as i move to my next location. when i found mountain kim martial arts i knew right away that i found a great place and i was never disappointed thereafter. so what was so great you ask? the training is great, that goes without saying! but it was even more than the training. at mountain kim martial arts i also felt like part of their family because of the family atmosphere and the honest and friendly people who operate and train there. it’s almost been two years since i was able to train there and to this day i can still remember why i enjoyed training there so much!

                                       my experience at mountain kim has been life-changing. when i first started i hoped to be able to get in shape and learn some self-defense techniques. what i discovered after 2 years is that not only did i lose weight, get in shape, and learn self-defense – but i reached mental challenges that i never thought i would. i’m 46 years old and i’m able to do stuff i could only watch others do a few short years ago. now i’m not watching, i’m doing. that is life changing.

                                       i recently had my son’s 5th birthday party at mountain kim martial arts. everything was so interactive, even the parents were interested in what was going on! the children were very excited to participate. they learned martial arts moves, did obstacles, and even broke boards. the party allowed plenty of time for food and cake. that day was a lot of fun. i definitely would plan a party there again!

                                       my daughter has had a couple of birthday parties at mountain kim. it is a fun, active party that both boys and girls enjoy. they play games, learn some taekwondo, break boards (! yes really) and you can even cut the cake with a sword! it is a great experience for all

                                       we had a great time at mountain kim! they kept the kids busy with games and obstacle courses and were so friendly! the kids had lots of fun! and my son got to cut the cake with a sword, which he thought was awesome! i would recommend mountain kim 100%!
