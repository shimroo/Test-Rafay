the white bison vision
 
 
 
 


mission
white bison is a native american-operated 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to creating and sustaining a grassroots wellbriety movement – providing culturally-based healing to the next seven generations of indigenous people.
 
 

the wellbriety movement
to be sober and well. that’s what white bison wants for our community, that’s why we’re a proud facilitator of the wellbriety movement. we must find sobriety and recover from the harmful effects of drugs and alcohol.
 
 

to go beyond
the “well” in wellbriety is the inspiration to go on beyond sobriety and recovery, committing to a life of wellness and healing everyday. many use white bison’s healing resource products, attend its learning circles, & volunteer their services to help themselves and others achieve wellness.
 
 

a resource to the community
white bison offers sobriety, recovery, addictions prevention, and wellness/wellbriety learning resources to the native american/alaska native community nationwide. our resources are also available to non-native people.
 
 
 
 







 

the sacred hoop of 100 eagle feathers

 
the sacred hoop of the wellbriety movement was born from a vision in 1994, not long after miracle, the first white buffalo calf, was born on august 20 in janesville, wisconsin. in that vision, an indian man saw a willow sapling lose its leaves and form itself into a circle. one by one, eagle feathers began to arrive from each of the four directions to attach themselves to the willow hoop. he saw in his vision that each of the quadrants of the hoop was painted a different color: yellow in the east, red in the south, black in the west, and white in the north. the feathers stopped coming when 100 were hanging from the circle. each feather represented a native american community.
 
 
 


mission of the sacred hoop: healing individuals, families, communities and nations
a hoop just like in his vision was built in a sweat lodge over a weekend in may of 1995. on the first day of summer of that year, a multicultural elders gathering was held in janesville, wisconsin to provide prayers for the hoop and align its purpose to the coming healing time. the elders placed the four gifts of healing, hope, unity and the power to forgive the unforgivable into the hoop, entrusting it to don coyhis, mohican nation, and the white bison organization for the work to come. the sacred hoop took part in many different healing activities and ceremonies between 1995 and the first full-fledged sacred hoop journey in the spring of 1999.
since the sacred hoop was blessed, it has traveled over 200,000 miles to indigenous communities across the united states. individual communities can request a visit by the sacred hoop by contacting the white bison office. on occasion, the sacred hoop will be taken on a tour. since 1999, there have been a number of sacred hoop journeys. when the sacred hoop comes to a community, the people gather for ceremonies and talks about living a sober and healthy life that is balanced emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually. many communities have decided to begin a process of learning and planning that includes the building a vision of wellness. this is accomplished through the community development process offered by white bison. some communities have made the commitment to become one of the 100 drum communities.
 
 
 
 


white bison’s philosophy
 
 
 
 


• a set of principles, laws & values governs mother earth• leadership exists to serve the people first• leadership existence ensures truth is given to the people• changes are the result of implementing natural laws• all native people believe in a supreme being • elders and teachings are a guiding force to direct ourselves, families and communities• there is a natural order running the universe• that our traditional ways were knowledgeable about the natural order• when the community leads, the leaders will follow• alcohol and drugs are destroying us; we want to recover • change comes from within the individual, the family and the community • within each person, family and community is the innate knowledge for well being• the solution resides within each community• interconnectedness – it takes everyone to heal a community• healing will take place through the application of cultural and spiritual knowledge• alcohol, drugs and domestic violence are all symptoms, not the cause. to “heal a community” it must deal with the cause• the circle and the four directions are the teachersin the four laws of change• change is from within• for development to occur, it must be preceded by a vision• a great learning must take place• you must create a healing forest• our culture is prevention
