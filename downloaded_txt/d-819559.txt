wa'a moana
wa'a moanawhen i learned that i would be taking my grandson to see "wa'a moana," my excitement matched his anticipation. however, my enthusiasm stemmed from a different reason. the film featured a fijia outrigger canoe, a type of sailing vessel that i had been commissioned to construct a scale model of. i successfully completed this model in september 2021. it’s interesting to note that the ship showcased in "moana" closely resembles the fijian kamakau. this particular type of outrigger canoe is widely regarded as one of the most exceptional designs ever created. i feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to produce a scale model of such an impressive vessel.

guam chamorro outrigger canoe, also called the flying proa
showing the leeward side of a chamorro (guam) canoe model was built in 2016.magellan's chronicler, pigafetta, who witnessed these vessels in 1521 at either guam or rota, described them as 'gondolas of fusine but narrower', highlighting their unique design and historical significance.now centuries later, as it is also happening across polynesia, there is much enthusiasm to revive the ancient sailing craft across the marianas, as one can see by watching the various videos on youtube, for example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0o21etjox0the name' flying proa' given to these vessels is a testament to the thrill of their speed, as they swiftly crossed the horizon at a distance, according to the account of captain george anson, who circumnavigated the globe aboard the famous flagship centurion.















chamorro flying proa
i had in mind, initially to paint the hull of the model red and black , this in accordance to chronicles about those vessels, but needed to respect the wishes of its collector and consequently embellished the hull only slightly with a red design.









































cook islands voyaging canoe
delving into the past, this model is a reconstruction of the enigmatic cook islands double hull canoes from the island of mangaia. scant literature exists about these canoes, making this journey of discovery all the more exclusive. we know that the islanders ingeniously repurposed the same hull used for their outriggers to construct the double hull. intriguingly, the double hull canoes of the cook archipelago shared numerous features with those from hawaii, the marquesan islands, and new zealand. this model is a faithful representation based on the hull displayed at the new zealand museum te papa tongarewa.

this single hull fiji canoe is of the camakau type primarily used as a voyaging canoe on the melanesian islands of bau, rewa and tailevu. like his bigger brother the drua, the construction of the camakau is awe-inspiring and it required me to visit the vessel a few time in orderto really understand how some elements were fitted together .

hokule'a, a contemporary voyaging canoe.
volumes have been written about the voyages of hokule'a. tv documentaries have been shown worldwide testifying to the seaworthiness of this remarkable double-hull canoe. songs have been composed to praise its beauty and relevance in the hearts of the hawaiian people.hokule'a, a pioneer in its own right, was conceived in 1974 following a visionary proposal by the polynesian voyaging society. the proposal aimed to construct a replica of an ancient polynesian voyaging canoe and embark on a round-trip voyage between hawaii and tahiti. the voyage's purpose was to delve into the depths of polynesian non-instrument navigation. since its inaugural, and remarkably successful voyage in 1976, hokule'a and its crew of skilled navigators and sailors have traversed the pacific ocean on numerous occasions, leaving a trail of awe and wonder in their wake. the design of hokule'a is based on pictorial reconstructions by the late herbert kawainui kane, who was an authority on polynesian voyaging canoes. his book "voyagers" contains beautiful images illustrating voyaging canoes. those illustrations have inspired some of the model canoes in this section. this album is primarily dedicated to the double-hull voyaging canoe hokule'a.each scale model of hokule'a is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship and artistic prowess of the creator. these custom-made works of art are lovingly crafted with local woods in hawaii. available in sizes ranging from 12 to 36 inches, or 30.5 cm to 91.5 cm, these models are a visual delight. more pictures can be explored at flickr.com, offering a closer look at the intricate details that make each model a true masterpiece.the model's size influences the level of detailing, a major factor affecting the price. in other words, the cost of a 36-inch model is not the one of a 12-inch model multiplied by 3 !

authentic hawaiian voyaging canoe
the simplified scale model of a hawaiian voyaging canoe has been crafted in the workshops of francis pimmel who is indisputably the most famous canoe scale modeler of the state of hawaii, whether that is building a true model of the famous hokule'a voyaging canoe or any other polynesian or oceanic canoe.carved out of koa wood, the model is long by 11 ins, wide by 3.5 ins and is sold as shown, in an open-end acrylic showcase.the model itself rests on a solid wooden base which can be removed from the showcase if needed.the dimensions for the showcase are as follows: l: 11,5 ins w: 4 ins, h: 11 inshandmade using traditional native wood species makes this model hawaiian in spirit but also by origin.home and garden tv (hgtv) featured francis pimmel and his work on their nationwide show "modern masters" on november 4, 2001.canoe models by francis pimmel do grace the lobby of the four seasons hotel resort, manele bay, lana'i, the floors of the kahala hotel resort formerly mandarin, honolulu, the gallery of the polynesian cultural center, la'ie, the pacifica shop at the bishop museum, honolulu, the lobby of the bank of hawaii, main branch, honolulu, and many other places, collections and institutions outside of the island of oahu, hawaii.




































lapita voyaging  canoe tama moana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5f4pqatcgy i have always been fascinated by the pacific cultures and the multitude of different type of canoes associated with them, in particular those carved within the polynesian triangle, micronesia and melanesia. so my interest, as a canoe modeler, does not simply rest in re-creating ancient types of hawaiian canoes or reproduce the hokule'a, but also to make models of some of the most amazing vessels that were constructed long ago within oceania but have all but disappeared from its islands. more over, and this is always a particular and exciting challenge, i love to reproduce those larger voyaging canoes that have recently been built in the south pacific. what ever the type of canoe i decide to reproduce; it is a task that requires in depth research and my lasting gratitude goes towards the late herb kane without whom we would not be able to know the beautiful shape of some oceanic canoes. i also like to refer to the works of hadden & hornell and the beautifully illustrated volumes of jean neyret. the internet has replaced books and it is while reading online about the lapita culture, which is at the root of polynesian culture and famous for its pottery style, that i became interested in the lapita voyage project whose principals were klaus hympendahl, a german author and photographer, explorer, sailor and ship architect of catamarans james wharram, and hanneke boon who is wharram's design partner. the objective of the lapita voyage project was to build two double hull canoes and sail them from the philippines to the island of anuta, a route of 4,000 miles believed to be the one used by the lapita culture during their eastward expansion. the name of the two canoes would be "child of the sea" or tama moana. they would be based on the construction style of hawaiian voyaging canoes and incorporate design principles from the islands of anuta and tikopia. their size would be 37 feet in total length with a beam overall of 14 feet. the length of the above model is 38 inches (96.5 cm) and was completed in march 2011. the model is sold.click here to see photos of this canoe during phases of it's construction.further reading regarding the lapita canoe:https://www.lapitavoyage.org/concept_canoes.htmlruction.

solomon islands canoe
"the beauty of the solomon island canoes has excited the admiration of all voyagers, navigators and explorers from the time the islands were first visited by white men" wrote the british naturalist sir charles morris woodford.distinctive among the hundreds of different oceanian canoes is the crescent-shaped, plank built, tomako canoe with its slender lines and fascinating upwardly-projecting bow and stern decorated with shells and feathers. this was the black painted war canoe of the solomon island head hunters.

hawaiian voyaging canoes
hawaiian voyaging canoesthis album illustrates hawaiian voyaging canoe models built over the years by francis pimmel. however, it does not include the hokule'a , the most famous voyaging canoe, for which francis created a separate album in this gallery.ancient hawaiian voyaging canoes consisted of two identical hulls connected by arched cross booms. the curved booms raised the decking well over water, eliminating wave resistance and affording drier and more comfortable positions for passengers and freight.a narrow wooden platform (deck) called the "pola"was laid on top of the arched cross booms, making it better suited for long-distance voyages. sometimes a small straw hut was built on the deck for added protection. double-hull voyaging canoes were rigged with a uniquely hawaiian form of oceanic spirit sail called a "crab claw." the sail material for the hawaiian crab claw was often matting made of finely plaited lauhala leaves, also called pandanus. the mats were overlapped horizontally and sewn up in reverse positions, thus giving the visual impression of matting of two different colors.the historical significance of the hawaiian voyaging canoes is further underscored by the renowned french naval architect admiral paris and the englishman john webber's 1778 sketches of 'sandwich islands' canoes. these sketches accurately depict the rigging and unique design of the hawaiian-type sail, a testament to the enduring legacy of these canoes in maritime history. in the account of cook's third voyages, the size of the largest hawaiian voyaging canoe, as measured, is given as 70 feet long, 12 feet broad, and 3.5 feet deep. it is truly awe-inspiring to learn that an old wrecked voyaging canoe on the coast of hawaii was a staggering 108 feet long. these canoes were not just large, but also incredibly robust, capable of carrying up to 140 men. such feats of maritime engineering are a testament to the skill and resourcefulness of the ancient hawaiians.

, while in our time, hawaiian navigators traveled across the pacific ocean on the double-hulled canoe hokule'a,legend has it that their ancestors sailed from the marquesas islands to hawaii in similar canoes. this 36-inch long model, inspired by the artwork of herb kawainui kane, is rigged with two sails and features prow and stern pieces typical of the marquesas islands.sold
























































samoan pao pao outrigger canoe
the pao pao dugout canoe was the ordinary craft used for fishing along the shores. another type of samoan dugout fishing canoe was the soatau. the difference between the pao pao and soatau was that the former had washstrakes, end deckings, and were rigged for sailing, whereas the soatau seldom had washstrakes and also had shorter decking, or manu in hawaiian.a third type of samoan canoe was the elegant va'a alo (commonly called the bonito canoe), which was plank-built. this type of canoe, of which francis made several models, is considered the most graceful of all polynesian canoes. the samoan canoe builders had a very inventive spirit, which led to innovation in the execution of their trade. for example, the samoans formed the bow of their canoe to resemble the open mouth of a shark, which became known as a cutwater. this design divided the water as the canoe moved forward and allowed the canoe to move at higher speeds.





















fijian drua - museum of suva
"the fijian double canoe (wangga ndrua) was the largest and finest sea-going vessel ever designed and built by natives of oceania before contact with europeans."druas were large, up to 100 feet (30 m) long, and could carry over 200 people. despite being called canoes, they were not dugouts but plank-built ships. today, fiji druas are still a symbol of fiji, and fiji's telephone booths are decorated with the characteristic mast-tops of druas. fourty man were required for the handling of this fine vessel.the model shown here is a scaled-down version of the ratu finau war canoe in the fiji museum of suva.  you can view a photo stream showing the gradual construction of this exceptional and difficult-to-build model on flickr.comcommissioned at the end of 2012, this 17 3/4" long model was shipped to its taiwanese collector in march 2013. since that date, francis built only 1 additional very large scaled-down version of the fiji drua, which can be admired at the polynesia cultural center, lai'e, oahu, hawaii.




















fiji drua
this 36 inch long model was built in 2016 and his on display at the polynesian cultural center, lai'e, hawaii.






samoan voyaging canoe
in 2011, francis pimmel was inspired by the visit of the pacific voyagers, a fleet of seven ocean-going canoes representing various islands of the south pacific, during their visit to hawaii. this fleet was supported by "the okeanos foundation for the sea." this inspired pimmel to create a model reminiscent of the double-hulled voyaging canoes, using the elegant lines of the va'a alo samoan canoes. the model is 40 inches long, 29 inches high, and 11 inches wide. its twin hulls are planked in the same manner as the ancient samoan carpenters did hundreds of years ago, with the various flanges of the hull clearly visible. the canoes of samoan and solomon islanders were built by planking, starting with a keel. in this model, the red bottom part of the hull represents the keel, which is also visible inside the hull. the samoan carpenters were unique among oceanic canoe builders in starting the bow with a "cutwater," similar to most contemporary boats. the model features a cutwater on the forward section of the hull. after extensive research online and in museums worldwide, francis pimmel concluded that he may be the only contemporary scale modeler to replicate the beauty of these canoes with all their elegant lines, streamlined bows, and beautifully decorated tops. today, this exquisite model is on display at the four seasons hotel resort, manale bay, lanai, hawaii, alongside a scale model of hokule’a, highlighting the rich maritime heritage of the pacific islands.































hawaiian fishing canoe
let's explore the historical significance of these fishing canoe models from hawaii. these models not only display the diverse shapes and sizes of canoes used in hawaii until the early 20th century, but also provide insight into the construction techniques of that era.one key feature that distinguishes hawaiian canoes from those of other polynesian islands is the use of koa wood for canoe hulls. koa acacia is a type of wood native to the hawaiian islands.for the outriggers (known as iako in hawaiian), hau wood was used, wiliwili wood for the outrigger float, or ama in hawaiian. additionally, the lashing of various parts on a hawaiian single-hull or double-hulled canoe differs from the techniques used on other polynesian islands such as tahiti or samoa.

hawaiian racing canoe
this 32-inch-long model is one of five canoes commissioned by the kahala resort and hotel, oahu, some years ago. racing canoes with sail are generally very colorful, and i wanted to imitate that feature in the model. in particular, i tried to use wood species with striking colors that coordinate well. i am aware that this type of canoe is called a sailing canoe in hawaii, and i would like to distinguish between the double-hulled canoe with a sail of old times and the contemporary double-outrigger with sail used for racing.orders for the same color model are subject to the availability of wood species.





































peleleu war canoe
this type of double-hulled canoe, with its impressive dimensions of about 70 feet in length, holds a significant place in history. legend has it that over 120 vessels of this type were built by king kamehameha i around 1796 for his conquest of kaua'i. it serves as a testament to the advanced maritime technology of the polynesians. most remarkable was the european-style rigging, namely the schooner rig, a clear indication of the polynesians' adaptability and innovation. some of these canoes were even equipped with swivel cannons, which king kamehameha received from the english in return for the sought-after sandalwood. this model, a scaled-down version from the original drawings, measures 4 feet in length and 8 1/2 inches in width, serving as a tangible reminder of this historical achievement.










peleleu war canoe
together with the model canoe, i was tasked with building a table that would complement the characteristics of the model. the table top was adorned with inlaid filets and koa-shaped triangles of different colors.koa-shaped triangles of different colors.










the cannon, long by 4 inches was fully milled in bronze.











marquesas sailing canoe
herb kawainui kane's illustration of "the story of laka" inspired the creation of a particular type of canoe depicted in his work "voyagers." the legend recounts the tale of laka, who constructs a canoe to journey to a remote island in order to avenge his murdered father and enslaved mother. accompanied by seven companions, laka's canoe is assaulted by demons and a giant squid. however, laka and his men successfully defeat the attackers and rescue his mother. this story, along with variations of it, is narrated across the pacific, and the canoe serves as a representation of the canoes from the marquesas islands.





























































samoan  soatau canoe with sail
the hulls of samoan canoes are known for their remarkable elegance and ideal hydrodynamical shape. they are extremely profiled, with the prow resembling a shark's head and the stern ending like an elegant tail. samoans were skilled carpenters and are credited with developing the plank-built canoe method using hidden lashings. additionally, samoans adorned their canoes with sculptures and shells.





















hawaiian outriggers
over the past 30 years, francis has been crafting scaled-down hawaiian outriggers, ranging from 20 inches (50.8 cm) to 6 feet (1.82 m) in size. these models are based on existing sea-going racing canoes or ones found in museums, such as the a'a', a large and heavy canoe displayed at the bishop museum in honolulu.some of francis's canoe models are readily available right here in the shop, or art galleries across the islands, while others have been commissioned works. they are crafted in various types and sizes, with some built in the traditional hawaiian way using koa wood for the hull. others may bear a more contemporary look with tamarind wood for the hull, or may have inlay work on the canoe's top bow and stern (known as "manu" in hawaiian). over the years, francis has built scale models of the opelu fishing canoe, the dowsett, the malia, the famous ka-mo'i, and the slender a'a canoe.

catamaran
the catamaran vessels of today are the direct descendants of the highly evolved polynesian sailing canoes. double-hulled canoes had two essential qualities: good buoyancy and stability, and these two qualities led to the development of the modern catamaran. early attempts at building catamarans started in 1662 when sir william petty built his "double bottom" to race in dublin. he beat all comers and established the speed potential of catamarans in the western hemisphere. most early steamboats were catamarans with the paddle wheel protected between the hulls. the connecting structure between the hulls was used for navigation and since became known as "the bridge". western perception of the catamaran has been shaped by yachting rather than commerce.in the world of yachting, catamarans have earned a unique reputation as 'multi-hulls'. they stand out as the most sea kindly vessels on all points of sail, offering a level of safety and comfort that is unparalleled in the cruising boat category.looking at a modern catamaran, we can see the evolution from its ancient polynesian voyaging canoe roots. the cross-beams that once joined the two hulls, on which the deck rested, have been replaced by a bridge or platform. this structure, cutting directly into the starboard and port hull topsides, now serves as the central hub of the vessel. on top of the bridge, we find the cockpit, where the catamaran is steered, the saloon for socializing, the skipper's area for charting maps and using navigational instruments, and the crew's shelter. francis built the model of this "cat" around 25 years ago. she was 36 inches long . there were no other building specification or line drawings available of the real size cat as those available in commercial maritime magazines. francis had to calculate all the dimensions  of the many parts of the boat based on the 4 basic dimensions giving in the commercial and those where the length overall of loa, the length of the waterline or lwl, the beam and the draft.the model is now gracing the interior of a villa in beverly hill.
