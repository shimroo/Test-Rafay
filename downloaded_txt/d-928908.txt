help send books to impoverished children in meru, kenya





last june, i completed my 40th month as chair of the board of directors of the oklahoma women's coalition --- and stepped off the board. we hired a full time executive director, kristin davis, in february so owc is in great hands. i decided i was suffering from "founder's syndrome"  and decided to get out of kristin way! 

which let me return to my other passion -- mission service in central kenya. 





eight years ago a
remarkable member of my church, florence mubichi, completed a masters
in nursing and returned home to kenya. before leaving she said, "come and see how god is working among my
people.”  so in 2005, i was part of an 18-member mission team that renovated a
children's ward at maua methodist hospital near florence's home.
while there, i asked church leaders, "if i brought a mission team
to meru, what would you most want us to do?" eager to promote a
culture of reading, they asked for a community library.



through the united
methodist church's volunteers in mission office, i led a mission team to kenya
in 2006 and two more in 2007. the teams and other friends of the mubichi family built
the library; sent over  20,000 children's books and
textbooks; purchased furnishings for the library; cataloged 5,000+ books,
and provided support staff to the board of
the miriam kanana mubichi foundation (mkmf) which was founded by the mubichis in 2003 after the tragic
death of their middle daughter (see http://mkmf.org/). 



now i am working to ship 120 boxes to mkmf. the boxes contain children's books
donated by oklahoma students (for impoverished primary schools) and nursing textbooks
donated by ou's college of nursing (for the nursing school
at maua methodist hospital). some boxes contain florence mubichi's personal
belongings (she died march 22, 2010 from ovarian cancer while working on a phd
and teaching at ou -- see http://ow.ly/ept2p and http://ow.ly/eptf0 html).



a couple boxes hold
teaching materials dale and sandi troup will need once they reach
kenya october 23. you can read why they sold everything and moved with
their 13 year old son to kenya to volunteer with mkmf at http://thetroups.net/sandi/2012/04/kenya-longstory/. you can hear about all the things they will be doing in kenya at http://thetroups.net/sandi/2012/04/mkmf/.



the boxes moved from my garage (see image) to a shipping firm to be weighed,
measured and palletized. we anticipate the total shipping expenses to be $4,800.
i have raised $1,400 so far. 



i invite you to join in this wonderful mission effort. you can donate $10 or more through the seeds of grace foundation
website (http://www.seedsofgracesite.com/).this 501(c)3 nonprofit was formed in the usa to support mkmf's
work. or you can mail a check to seeds of grace, po box
9534, naperville, il 60564. 



whether this appeals to
you or not, thank you very much for
considering my request.  you can
follow mkmf on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/pages/miriam-kanana-mubichi-foundation/49684509342, read the troups' blogs at http://www.thetroups.net/, and follow my
twitter account, http://twitter.com/merumission, about meru and mkmf. 


if you have questions, ideas, suggestions about this effort, leave a comment or email me at merumission@gemail.com.

congratulations to dr. donna h. branson who was inducted into the oklahoma higher education hall of fame at the 2011 induction ceremony october 11 at the oklahoma athletic hall of fame museum in oklahoma city. here is the oklahoma higher education heritage society's write up on dr. branson:donna branson has left a matchless record in the area of material design and construction of body protection clothing. in 1972, she earned a ph.d. in family ecology, emphasizing functional apparel design, from michigan state university.  she had already served as instructor at the university of rhode island and at michigan state university for several years before she was hired as associate professor in the department of clothing, textiles, and merchandising in the college of human environmental sciences at osu in 1983. she became professor in four years and in 1992 was chosen head of her department.  under her leadership, for nearly seven years (1998 to 2005), almost all faculty obtained external funding for their research projects, and she was instrumental in setting up the christine salmon endowed visiting professorships. as well, donna branson has produced an inspiring record as a researcher.she has co-authored 32 journal articles, 23 pamphlets and professional reports, refereed 86 presentations, and juried seven design exhibits or competitions.  over the years, she has obtained 28 grants and now owns one manufacturing license and has four pending patents.  much of this scholarly output has been related to designing body armor that protects against bomb attacks but still allows for mobility and temperature control.  her work has been instrumental in protecting united states soldiers in the middle east. for her work, she has been given the mortar board outstanding osu teacher award, the marguerite scruggs award for meritorious research, the national textile center scientific excellence adviser, oklahoma state university regents professor, and in 2006, the homeland security award. professor branson retired from osu in 2006 but continues to serve as the director of the institute of protective apparel research and technology in stillwater. for this marvelous record of research and service to state and nation, the ohehs proudly inducts donna h. branson into the oklahoma higher education hall of fame.
