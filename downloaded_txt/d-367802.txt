the infinite space games are "roguelites" (with graphics, sound and music) that are played to completion in 20-45 minutes (depending on the game). each of them generates a different interstellar region to explore every time a new session begins. stars, planets, black holes, nebula mass, alien patrols, items, lifeforms and other encounters are randomized for each new voyage.


note that strange adventures was released in 2002 followed by weird worlds in 2005 and, with the help of the community, sea of stars in 2015.
