two new books from steve
steve earle writing 'the book i swore i'd never write'
�it�s the book i swore i would never write � i�m writing a memoir," he said in a to-be-published article. "i made a deal for two books, a memoir and a novel. they made me an offer i couldn�t understand [laughs]."

he continued, �it�s not an autobiography, it�s a literary memoir, a little more abstract. it�s not like, �i was born a poor black child...� and it doesn�t try and encompass every minute of my life � i think it�s about something besides me. it�s really about heroes and mentors good and bad, so obviously the first part is about [renowned songwriter and earle�s mentor] townes [van zandt], before i started making records � the record-making aspect is in other books about me i understand, i�ve never read any of them.

justin townes earle new cd	
justin has a new cd in march called nothing's going to change the way you feel about me now. 
	
	this is justin's fourth release and follows his critically acclaimed 2010 album, harlem river blues, which debuted #47 on the billboard top 200 chart and led to a song of the year award at the 2011 americana music awards.

produced by earle alongside longtime collaborator skylar wilson, the 10-track album was recorded completely live with no overdubs over a 4-day period at an old converted church recording studio in asheville, nc. of the new record, earle comments, i think that it s the job of the artist to be in transition and constantly learn more. the new record is completely different than my last one, harlem river blues. this time i've gone in a memphis-soul direction.

and that's true enough. while harlem river was a love letter to his new hometown of nyc, this new album is a gorgeous, sometimes lush sometimes sparse, paeaon to a city that's given so much to the world musically. the sweat, the horns, the soul..... 

to purchase the new cd: nothing's going to change the way you feel about me now
