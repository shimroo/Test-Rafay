                    we’re so glad you’re here.                

the division of student affairs is critically engaged in supporting the holistic engagement and personal growth of all students who attend duke. the division collaborates with student leaders, faculty, families, community members and many others in the delivery of key services. 
our programs and services are designed to support holistic wellbeing, foster an inclusive and dynamic community, and complement duke's commitment to academic excellence. 
















 





                    welcome from the vp                

the division of student affairs supports over 16,000 duke undergraduate, graduate and professional students and engages tens of thousands of visitors, families, and members of the duke community every year. our team includes more than 800 dining staff, 200 housekeepers, 100 clinicians and care providers, and scores of student development specialists, event coordinators, residential coordinators, career advisers and operations experts.  we partner with student leaders and faculty on the durham and beaufort campuses throughout the calendar year.  
our primary job is to ensure duke students have the resources and support they need to arrive at their classes and laboratories ready to engage in critical thinking and learning each day. we also help blue devils gain skills and insight about themselves and the world - and we take great pride in helping future leaders tackle obstacles, flourish, and make the most of their duke experience.  through a wide range of programs and offices– from undergraduate new student and family programs to career advising, from venue management and the box office to quadex, student leader advising, and student-programs and initiatives in our identity and cultural centers, we love being a part of our students’ individual journeys and fostering excellence across duke.  
we’re glad you’re here!
yours,
mary pat mcmahon
vice provost and vice president of student affairs
