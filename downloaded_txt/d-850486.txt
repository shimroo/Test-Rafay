introduction

welcome to bookie's focke-wulf 190 and ta 152 page. this page is the result of a number of years of research into the aircraft featured, kurt tank's focke-wulf 190 / ta 152. this aircraft was one of the outstanding fighters and fighter-bombers of world war ii, and it served in large numbers with the luftwaffe, and also in a handful of smaller nation's air forces. it performed almost every role possible for a single-engined aircraft, and proved to be successful as a fighter, fighter-bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, trainer and night-fighter. its primary role was as a fighter, and in this role it excelled, dominating the european skies for more than a year after its introduction into service in august 1941. continual development resulted in new variants, eventually seeing a radical change in shape with a new inline engine fitted to the fw 190 d (dora), and in the final months of the war, the ta 152 (designated ta to honour designer kurt tank). by the end of the war more than 20,000 had been produced, and the fw 190 had become one of the world's great warplanes. this page is a tribute to the aircraft and its pilots.
unfortunately i no longer have time to update this website, due to other research and writing commitments. i'll keep all the old pages up here, but please bear in mind that they are the result of research i did more than ten years ago. i've learnt a lot since then, and have obtained hundreds of thousands of pages of wartime documents since the articles on this site were written.

in september 2010 morten jessen and i launched our own little aviation history publishing company, air war publications. the company's first book, the focke-wulf fw 190 in the battle for sicily, was launched at the same time. we are now hard at work on several other book titles, and also dozens of electronic articles. the most advanced book projects are:

- the henschel 123
- air war courland, june 1944 - may 1945
- the focke-wulf 190 defending southern italy, 3 september 1943 - 21 january 1944
the focke-wulf 190 features prominently in the air war courland book, because it served with jagdgeschwader 54, and various ground-attack units based in the region (most notably the iii. gruppe of schlachtgeschwader 3).
