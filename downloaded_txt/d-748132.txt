the incredible herb
wild oregano has been used for centuries in the mediterranean to help people maintain good health.wild oil of oregano is a potent anti-inflammatory.













 




quality
hedd wyn essentials was first to market with a wildcrafted mediterranean oil of oregano to have 100% certified organic ingredients. although this cost us a lot more, we kept competitive pricing. more than anything we can say, this demonstrates the strength of our commitments to making the best product possible. there are only two ingredients and those are certified organic wildcrafted mediterranean origanum vulgare (oregano) essential oil and certified organic, cold pressed, extra virgin, freshly made olive oil.
















 



a note to our customers and new arrivals:
in order to come into compliance and remain in business we have had to remove a lot of facts on what conditions may be treated with oregano oil and all the beneficial properties of the oil and its components. centuries of empirical evidence, information extracted from hundreds of research papers from top universities worldwide, laboratories and prestigious publications has all been dismissed as irrelevant and unallowable. if you are wondering if oregano oil can help your health challenge, we recommend using an unbiased search engine such as   https://www.qwant.com/,  https://brave.com/search/ or https://duckduckgo.com/ just name your health challenge and the words “oregano oil” many web pages will give references. dr. cass ingram’s book, the cure is in the cupboard, available at your local library or bookstore, contains a wealth of information. good hunting!

what our customers say about oregano oil














 




i’ve been using your oil of oregano for years. i am a firm believer especially after it cured me in one day from a severe urine infection. i have also been using it over the years on my 7yr old standard poodle. two years ago while in florida he developed a bad case of diarrhea with mucous and blood spotting. apparently there had been some intestinal dog virus going around at the time. i gave him 3 drops of oil of your oregano in a gel cap 2x a day for 5 days along with a rice and beef diet. in one week he was cured. i was thrilled especially since people i knew had spent hundreds of dollars on vet visits and slow results.
