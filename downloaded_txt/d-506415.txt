the florida archaeological council (fac) and the department of anthropology at the university of florida invites you to the 77th annual meeting of the florida anthropological society in gainesville, may 9-11, 2025, at the hilton hotel and conference center just across from the university of florida.this event marks 23 years since fac published the “thinking about significance” volume. this publication was monumental at the time and has been a reference to many in the years since. but our understanding of what archaeological significance is has shifted dramatically during the last two decades as our understanding of the archaeological record has grown and as the dialogue surrounding archaeology has expanded to include a larger, more diverse stakeholder group. papers on all topics are welcomed, but it is hoped there will be a focus on “significance”, including the interpretation of site and artifact significance in relation to historic preservation, significance in interpretation and presentation, how different “groups” view significance, and how our understanding and evaluation of significance has changed as the perspectives of indigenous and other underrepresented stakeholders are integrated into archaeological discussions.cost is $65 for members and $75 for non-members. the student rate is $30.
















our keynote speaker will be dr. charles cobb, a james e. lockwood, jr., professor of historical archaeology at the florida museum of natural history in gainesville.twenty-first century perspectives on sixteenth-century entradas in la floridaalthough archaeologists have long been keenly interested in the routes of the first spanish explorers in greater la florida, by the close of the 20th century this kind of research had somewhat languished. the slowdown was due in part to the fact that most indigenous sites related to the expeditions had been discovered through the discovery of european objects in mortuary contexts, and archaeologists now attempt to avoid disturbing indigenous ancestral remains. in the past decade there has been a renaissance of activity on potential entrada sites, spurred in large part by the introduction of systematic metal detecting of the habitation areas of 16th century indigenous settlements. this presentation will summarize how the colonial encounters research consortium (cerca), a group of archaeologists working across multiple states, is implementing these methods and shedding new light on interactions between native american and european peoples.

special notethe fac board reviewed and approved a response to the achp program comment on accessible, climate resilient, connected communities. while fac supports these types of programs and finding ways to streamline the process, we want to ensure the continued protection of cultural resources, thus the board felt that the current achp program comment is not well thought out. several key issues are that it appears to  unilaterally and perhaps inappropriately (particularly based on a recent scotus decision (chevron) eliminate the requirement for shpo, thpo, and public consultation under section 106 for a variety of activities currently subject to full review according the process outlined in 36 cfr 800. also from an archaeological standpoint there is a significant oversight in that it largely ignores the potential for some of the activities to adversely affect potentially eligible/unrecorded archaeological sites. it also appears to establish a process by which a potentially unqualified individual (soi standards or any other standards for historic preservation professionals) to make unilateral decisions about effects to properties older than 45 years that have not been evaluated for nrhp eligibility without consulting any additional parties, affiliated, affected, or otherwise. it also appears to unintentionally establish a pathway by which successive changes to a building can be exempt from review without consideration of, or consultation about, the cumulative effects of a restoration, for example.  please find the fac response here. additional responses can be found at response to achp proposed program comment on accessible, climate-resilient, & connected communities - ncshpo
