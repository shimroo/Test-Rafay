new home



this blog thing has been pretty much abandoned for the last 3 years or so. for some unknown reason i really don't see myself getting back to this one, but anyone wanting to read my occasional ramblings can do so here. :)

american accent



what american accent do you have? (best version so far)neutralyou're not northern, southern, or western, you're just plain -american-.  your national identity is more important than your local identity, because you don't really have a local identity.  you might be from the region in that map, which is defined by this kind of accent, but you could easily not be.  or maybe you just moved around a lot growing up.click here to take this quizquizzes and personality testsi guess this is to be expected given the fact that my english pronunciation has been learned mostly from films and tv.

october 2007



 so i managed to post a daily photo to flickr. it's a silly thing really, but i got some small satisfaction from doing it. :)the secret was seinfeld's motivation tool: "don't break the chain!". it does work: there were a couple of days when i really didn't feel like posting to flickr. i reasoned that no one would notice that i was posting daily and that i'd missed a day. but i didn't want to break my chain. i could post 10 photos the next day, but the chain would be interrupted and i didn't want to see that. now, if i can only make this work for exercising, dieting, and a bunch of other things that i really should be doing on a daily basis. in theory, it should work, no? i've started with a small thing, now i just need to take it one step beyond... (heh, easier said than done!) ;-)

geek girls are sexy



or so they say. i certainly didn't feel that much sexy lying on the floor under the desk, with dust on my hair (wonder what did it come from...), pulling cables from two computers and trying to read the wiring guide using a small lamp. to boot, i broke two just polished nails. a clear reminder of why i *never* grow long nails (though it was nice for a while; it does help to feel feminine and sexy) :-)anyway, the "new" (new as in 4 months since i brought it from the store) computer is finally set up and running. i still need to install a gazillion of programs, but at least it is in working conditions now.
