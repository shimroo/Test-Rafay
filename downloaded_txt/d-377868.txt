christopher columbus: when did the hero become a villain?
 in 1892, columbus was an american hero. president benjamin harrison proclaimed, âfriday, october 21, 1892, the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of america by columbus, as a general holiday for the people of the united states.â (the 21st reflected the change from the julian to the gregorian calendar in 1582.) columbus was honored over 100 years earlier, though, in 1775 when one of the first war ships of the newly formed continental navy was named after him. in moving away from great britain, the revolutionary war was a turning point for a young nation; and after gaining independence and seeking a unifying bond for the united states of america, columbus emerged as a representative â an adventurer â in leaving the old and discovering something new. as poems about columbus circulated throughout the states, columbus and columbia were associated with liberty, and in 1791, the district of columbia was founded as the new nationâs seat of federal government.read more
