welcome to
acs dance centre 









 













acs, formerly anthony clifford dance studios, romford, changes lives; promoting physical and mental health and wellbeing through dance for local residents in havering, essex and across london. with group classes and private lessons available in multiple genres of dance, ballet, tap, modern, ballroom, latin american, disco freestyle street, salsa, argentine tango, sequence and line dancing, there is truly something for everyone at acs whether you are a keen inexperienced dancer or budding professional, teacher or competitor or performer.
we encourage those who have previously lacked access to dance to give it a try with classes for the socially isolated such as recently retired people or the mobility challenged and some scholarships and subsidised classes available.
the passion and talent of our experienced dance teachers and artists shines through and we help our students both young and old grow in skill, confidence, health and happiness.
acs children grow and flourish creatively away from the stresses of the cyber age and school exam pressures, our adult dancers learn new skills, find friendships and help keep back the passing years by keeping both body and mind active, promoting health and happiness.  coupled with this our professional students qualify with a world renowned dance organisation, the istd, and have fulfilling careers as teachers and performers across the uk and around the world.
dancing lessons are all held in our state of the art studio complex in albert road on the borders of romford and hornchurch. the studios are conveniently located on many bus routes and within easy walking distance of romford station on the new crossrail  elizabeth line, we also have our own car park.
so whether you have been inspired yourself by “strictly come dancing” and want to try your luck at chachacha or waltz, want to learn a special dance for your wedding or holiday or aspire to give your toddler or older child a life-long gift and love for dance, we would love to help and can’t wait to hear from you soon!

testimonials 








"i  have really enjoyed my time spent training at acs! i found all the teachers and staff to be really encouraging and friendly and feel i have learnt so much to help improve my teaching skills and knowledge. diana was so helpful in all aspects of studying for the teaching qualifications and has made the process of completing all the units very smooth. the dde classes with helen have been really inspiring. she is incredibly knowledgeable and i always enjoy the classes with her. it's been so lovely working with a great pianist on a weekly basis too. i would highly recommend acs for anyone wishing to further their teacher training and study for istd teaching qualifications."

“your school is an inspiration”



 

clare fenton















hi di and mark, just wanted to say what an absolutely fantastic show it was yesterday. we thoroughly enjoyed it and agree that it was the best one yet!! 
thank you for everything and i am so pleased that i found your school for the girls, they love dancing, love all the teachers, have made life long friends and love making you proud of them. acs truly feels like a family. i know that it takes a tremendous amount of work to put the show on but it was so worth it!! i would say rest but i know you've still got lots to do but i just wanted to say thank you from me.

onwards and upwards now how are you going to top that one!! here's to 2019!!!

lots of love tara xxxx
