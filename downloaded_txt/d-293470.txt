overheard





1
“i had the best teachers i could ask for who are caring, supportive and encouraging, i was able to more easily step out of my comfort zone, and i have grown as a person.”sohan chunduru, class of 2022




2
“i believe in the power of sharing our stories with each other and encouraging our students to do the same. it is through community and collaboration that we learn and grow. i believe that together we are better.”miranda conway, middle school educator




3
“as students navigate academics, social dynamics, and personal development, it’s expected that they will make mistakes along the way. our focus at ljcds is teaching students how to respond to and grow from missteps. we aim to instill the importance of taking ownership of their actions and learning from their experiences.”kristy johnson, head of middle school




4
“there is no better time than freshman year to “do everything.” if you have any hobbies or budding interests, dive deeper and explore them. don’t let your fear stop you from trying new activities because it will be a worthwhile experience at the end of the day.”cici he, class of 2023




5
“ljcds has had a profound effect on my life. it showed me that i can be a student, an athlete and an artist; and it showed me inside the classroom that i can accomplish these things that i didn't know were possible. ” henry timmermann, class of 2022
