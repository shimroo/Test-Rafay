the family tree of rock & roll posterautographs by greg allman, bb king, jeff beck,......










the graphical display genealogy of rock bands contains 100's of bands and 1000's of musicians.  created before the days of google i spent ten years on and off reading books, going to record stores and scrubbing info off albums, etc to create the poster.  almost 30 years later it has been celebrated by musicians such as greg allman, bb king, arlo guthrie, roger mcguinn, kansas, and many more.  i understand that a copy hangs in abby road studios and berklee music school in boston. order a 3 poster set today - it makes a great gift!
