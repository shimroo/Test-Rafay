welcome to cellos2go
cellos2go is a shop for cellists, run by cellists, in columbia, south carolina.

 
our clientele includes students young and old, professionals, and recreational players of all levels.   while every cellist uses the same types of items whether practicing or performing, there are reasons to select with specific needs in mind.  a student carrying their cello to lessons once a week in the family car has different concerns than a cellist who travels daily on all modes of transportation.  whether you need a specialty rosin or rockstop, a height-adjustable chair, a superior stand light, or help wading through many brands of cello strings, you will be happy to know that a cellist who understands your issues is helping you.




we do speak parent and novice, so don’t worry if you’re not exactly sure what you need! our job is to address questions you don’t even know how to ask.

place your order or request for information via phone or email. in the meantime, browse the site to see what we have!
cellos2go is run by ellen gunst, in collaboration with luthier damir horvat.  we proudly offer his hand-made cellos and tailpieces.
