fish, play & relax






since the 1930’s, people have been coming to wildwood beach resort on man lake for a quiet and relaxing getaway. we invite you to do the same!
just a stones throw from the lake, our 7 cabins nestled under the pines are spaced apart for privacy and offer gorgeous views from the lakeside decks. as a small resort on a private lake (no public access), the resort and lake is never crowded, and offers the perfect setting for a relaxing vacation. man lake is often referred to by our guests as a hidden gem because of it’s excellent fishing and recreation opportunities. as part of the woman lake chain of lakes, there is boat access to both baby and mckeown lakes as well.
even though we’re deep in the woods, you’ll be far from “roughing it”. our cozy cabins have all been recently updated, including new furniture, and are complete with air conditioning, comfy beds with bedding provided, a dining area, living room, bathroom, and full kitchen including dishes, pots and pans, utensils, coffee maker, toaster, and microwave.
book your stay for an unforgettable and rejuvenating northwoods getaway!
