rehoboth-by-the sea is a family-owned land leasing company founded in 1925. in the early years, there were very few homes in dewey beach.  to attract newcomers, the company offered non-renewable land leases in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s.  today, most of the original leases have been replaced with new 60-year land leases. as rehoboth-by-the-sea prepares to celebrate its 100th anniversary with leases extending into the 2080’s, the company is proud of its relationship with the town and the north end of dewey beach.
