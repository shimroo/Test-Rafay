the vast majority of all the plants we sell are propagated and grown on site by our dedicated team. these plants are cared for from our garden, to yours. the nursery, first begun by beth in the 1960’s, now offers over 2,000 varieties of plants, grouped into conditions, making it easier to find the plants that will suit your garden.

														“over the years i have purchased many many plants from the nursery, whilst visiting the gardens and through mail order. i want to say how satisfied i have always been with the plants purchased, my garden is heavily stocked with beth chatto specimens. i go back to late 80s early 90s!! the plants are always top quality and grow on healthily when planted. cannot recommend you highly enough. mail order plants are top dog and come beautifully packaged, so keep doing what you do as you are doing it so well and pleasing a lot of people. in conclusion beth has always been up there with my list of favourite gardeners and plantswomen.”
