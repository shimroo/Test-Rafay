the end of a blog





i started this blog on jan. 2, 2004, dragged just as i was into most technology/internet things by mr. chair, curious yet not really sure what i wanted to do with a blog or exactly why i should have one. but i do remember distinctly my impetus at least on that first day was to "publish" my own personal list of the top albums of 2003, capped unsurprisingly by calexico's excellent feast of wire. my initial subtitle for the blog - a pleasantly subversive chronicle of music, politics, humor, sports and beer - reflected some broader topics of conversation, but outside of a few anti-war and anti-bush rants in 2004 some epicly pointless posts about burritos and some go wildcats! posts, i rarely wrote about anything but music.

it's hard think about the blog without thinking back to its early days, 2004 and 2005, and how vastly different my life was at the time. and while that's a ball of wax i'd rather not start unraveling now - or ever - it's worth saying that in writing that post about the best albums of 2003, i reflected that i probably missed a great deal of awesome music that year because i wasn't a professional music critic. not that i was explicitly voicing an aspiration along those lines at the time, but it's a status i've been at for a few years. and i still miss out on a great deal of awesome music every year.

i'm closing down this blog now because it's as good a time as any, i suppose. the truth is it's had far more fallow years than ones of bounty. i don't see any reason to pull it down, but it doesn't seem right to let catfish vegas presents... wither on the vine without any sort of a eulogy. 

the only really active stretch on this blog ran through about the first half of 2008 and then again as i began earning my living as a freelance writer in 2009. and in a lot of ways, this blog got me to where i am now as music writer. but in doing so, it's long since served its purpose. for years it's been evident that i can't manage to keep up writing on two different tracks.

along the way, as i got more and more into music, music writing and the fantastic work i discovered on other blogs, i always kinda wished that catfish vegas presents... would become more prominent, not in a chasing-the-next-big-thing sort of way, but more like the connecting-with-readers way of the blogs i read and enjoyed the most, like the excellent captain's dead, fuel friends and aquarium drunkard, and arizona's two best, so much silence and ick music, each one a unique and indispensable voice to me.

but while i found some fans and some great connections to not only other music bloggers, but artists and publicists, what i found most was a writing voice that enabled me to break out of what i had been doing as a daily newspaper reporter and begin writing about music for pay, something that's been a bit of a bumpy ride as far as finances go, but something i've worked harder and harder at along the way and an area in which i've been able to not only improve dramatically, but expand as a portfolio. 

but let me reflect a bit more for the time being on the blog. aside from writing and working on my own craft, i really enjoyed thinking of myself even a little bit as a voice that might reach people, people who'd look for what i say, check out the music i recommended, toss some favorites back. i liked being part of this online community of enthusiastic music lovers sharing what they love the best. that happens to some degree with what i do now, but it's not the same. 

i also appreciated the direct connection with artists, many of whom were and are making outstanding music outside the confines of any pre-established industry structure. no one else exemplifies than factor - and especially it's lasting impact on me - than sum, an mc and incredible songwriter who arrived in my world via an unsolicited email, saying that that at first glance, my blog seemed to deal mainly in folk and blues but that i was clearly a lover of good music in general and would i mind checking out his tunes? these days i doubt i'd even open that email, but damn if sum hasn't been a favorite of mine for years now. absolutely go check out his dragon, vol. 1 album, which he's offering as a free download here. 

once i started writing for the tucson weekly, i kept up the blog 
because i liked the notion of being able to offer up new discoveries and
 share excitement about bands without having to be so formal as to write
 a full-fledged review. as i grew away from it, i held out some hope 
that i'd continue blogging in some way. perhaps i will one day, perhaps 
on my own site or perhaps even here.

on that tip, go immediately and check out the restorations and resonars, two of the best bands i've discovered not just lately, but in years. Â  

that surge in music blogs was a fascinating phenomenon, and one i'm glad to say i was a small part of. but the heyday is certainly long gone. many of the best ones have become entities of their own that far surpass being just blogs. quality and dedication truly won out. on the other end, democratizing the world of music writing and criticism undoubtedly devalued a good bit of it. and, like mine, most of those thousands of music blogs have simply faded away. i view my efforts as sort of a trip through the minor leagues, earning some experience and stats along the way that i was able to use to jump up a level. if i don't think in those terms, then i'm left with little than an endless stream of emails from music publicists and hopeful artists, no matter how long catfish vegas presents... sits silent. 

i still check out the ones that i liked best. but while a blog is an enthusiastic thing to begin, it's an exhausting thing to keep up with. who's out there in the wilderness listening? does it matter? i never really found my own answer to those two questions and i feel much more comfortable writing for something i know will see some eyes, either in print or online.

along the way, my own aspirations as a writer have changed drastically. that's a lesson in itself. i know that hard work, dedication and continual improvement efforts are worth far more than talent in this world, just as they are in music. i write every day. i write about music, about other things. i write for myself, knowing that those efforts can add up to something better, just as my blogging did.

so while i'm ending catfish vegas presents... at this point, find me at ericswedlund.com. it's not always completely up to date, but i repost my published work there. and perhaps some blogging one day. or fictional projects. or whatever. 

i started this blog off with a best-of and it's only fitting that my final posts today include another best of. and a mix. and this blogeulogy, another shout in the wilderness.

my favorite albums of 2012





here are, to my ears and in no particular order, the best and the next best of 2012:

chuck prophet, temple beautiful (yep roc)


a love song to san francisco delivered on a hot plate of raucous rock 'n' roll, temple beautiful
 is instantly catchy. from the churning chords of opener "play that song
 again" (which i did, again and again) to the celebratory "willie mays 
is up at bat," prophet makes san francisco come to life in all its 
enduring, freaky glory.

kelly hogan, i like to keep myself in pain (anti-)


kelly hogan enlisted a who's who of songwriters to pen tunes for her 
first solo album in 11 years. the title song (from robyn hitchcock) and 
"ways of this world" (from the late vic chesnutt) are particularly well 
suited for hogan's gorgeous voice, which amid all the excellent words 
and music (including booker t. jones on organ) still rises above.

the helio sequence, negotiations (sub pop)


the portland, ore., duo put together a new practice space/studio alongside this album, working for four years on negotiations,
 which balances the band's sense of shimmering cool with an entrenched 
sense of isolation. it's a night record, full of reflection, doubts, 
comforts and haunts.

japandroids, celebration rock (polyvinyl)


appropriately beginning with the sound of fireworks exploding, this 
head-rush of an album fits its title to a t. celebrating big guitars, 
pounding drums and hooks galore, japandroids made their mark on rock 'n'
 roll this year with simple perfection.

the walkmen, heaven (fat possum)


without entirely abandoning the urgency of the band's early albums, the walkmen stretch out and slow down a bit on heaven, their most irresistibly melodic batch of songs yet.

jaill, traps (sub pop)


in a taut 34 minutes, jaill delivers an album packed with jangly 
guitars, big garage riffs and psychedelic tangents. it's the sound of a 
scrappy band making good on 10 years of hard work.

metric, synthetica (metric)


metric's best-yet record, synthetica is a sci-fi concept 
albumâexploring disorientation, disillusionment and the defiant search 
for authenticityâpackaged as a muscular and thrilling dance-rock record.

jens lekman, i know what love isn't (secretly canadian)


swedish songwriter lekman returns after five years with a lush, 
wistful album that explores a painful breakup through his inimitable 
songwriting voice, which combines tenderness, wit and honest 
self-awareness.

dr. dog, be the void (anti-)
be the void finds dr. dog thriving with a joyful, live 
spontaneity that bounds from song to song without ever losing the band's
 magnetic catchiness. it's an eclectic, adventurous, ramshackle album 
that swings between abstraction and dialed-in melodies.

divine fits, a thing called divine fits (merge)


shockingly more than the sum of its weighty parts, this collaboration
 between dan boeckner (handsome furs, wolf parade) and britt daniel 
(spoon) treads adventurously beyond "supergroup" expectations to deliver
 11 fantastic, compelling songs.



honorable mention: bob dylan, tempest; shearwater, animal joy; alabama shakes, boys and girls; giant giant sand, tucson; sharon van etten, tramp; nada surf, the stars are indifferent to astronomy; plants and animals, the end of that; calexico, algiers; field report, field report; kathleen edwards, voyageur; bruce springsteen, wrecking ball; jay farrar, anders parker, yim yames and will johnson, new multitudes; heartless bastards, arrow.

20,000 songs





it's been a little over four years since i got the sweet new macbook and began converting all of my music into mp3 and m4a files, and my itunes library just passed 20,000 songs played.the official 20,000th song was "wreck on the highway" by roy acuff (from the essential roy acuff, 1936-1949 album). i played that song after hearing megafaun's cover version, which is the b-side to the kaufman's ballad single. i'd interviewed megafaun for a feature in the tucson weekly. i posted about my itunes odometer (as it were) turning over 10,000 songs a few years ago. the 10,000th song was passion pit's "smile upon me," which sounds nothing like roy acuff. at that time, i had 95 songs with itunes playcounts of more than 20. now, that figure is at 1,725. my most listened to song over the past four years? old crow medicine show's "wagon wheel," by a lot: 154 plays. next up is helio sequence "halleluja," at 104 plays... and 189 songs top 50 plays.roy acuff - wreck on the highway(and i still don't really know whether to keep this blog active or let it float into the past...)

the ultimate together thing





ben folds headlines a concert for the fund for civility, respect and understandingben  folds cleared his schedule, dropped all other projects and dedicated  this month to focusing on writing songs for what will be the first ben  folds five record in 13 years.then the call came from ron  barber's fund for civility, respect and understanding, requesting a  benefit performance. without hesitating, folds put the long-awaited  reunion album on hold for a bit."i'm writing a record, and i want  to be completely present for it. but this is special," folds says.  "when something that horrible happens, anybody with any soul certainly  wants to see something positive out of it. you can't twist it into a  positive thing, but you certainly can dig in and find out how you can  help other people with it."barber, the district director for u.s.  rep. gabrielle giffords, was shot twice on jan. 8, 2011, and continues  to recover. his first go at a benefit concert for the fund he dreamed up  while still in a hospital bed brought jackson browne, alice cooper,  david crosby, graham nash and a host of other performers to the tucson  convention center in march."when we put together the fund, we  deliberately included music and other performance arts as part of our  mission," says barber, a regular concertgoer and avid music fan. "it's  fair to say that music and other kinds of entertainment really do bring  people together. for us, my family and the fund, it's an essential part  of what we're about."barber chose foldsâafter a suggestion from  browne's managerâas an artist who appeals to a different generation.  barber envisions the civility concerts as an ongoing series of smaller  performances, perhaps two or three a year. he'd like to spotlight  several singer-songwriters next."there's abundant evidence that music has a healing power and a unifying power," barber says.folds is of the same mind."anthropologists,  scientists, priestsâthe whole lot of them would agree. it is the  ultimate together thing," he says. "there's a harmony about the whole  thing that does seem to be very disarming. i don't really know why, but  it seems to be a basic human function. people seem to, for whatever  reason, generally forget differences. there's a ritual about it. time  can kind of stand stillâand it's a real responsibility for a musician,  especially right now when politics are so extremely mindlessly volatile.  music disarms that."known for his physical brand of piano rock  and frequently humorous lyrics, folds carved out a niche quite unusual  in the alternative-rock world with the self-titled debut album, ben folds five, in 1995.the  piano "was a help and a hindrance, too. i see other bands that have  taken the piano since we opened that door at that moment. they  understand how to do it and drive it home, and i'm not sure we ever got  the memo on that one, but we did it the way we knew how," folds says.  "it was just natural, because that's what i did as a kid. but (piano)  was so far out of style by the time i was of age that i just took it as  good luck."after three well-regarded albums, ben folds five broke  up, and folds himself went on to release three full-length solo albums  and several eps.but the next dozen years also saw him perform,  record and produce in a wide variety of collaborative projects, joining  with joe jackson, william shatner, "weird al" yankovic, amanda palmer,  sara bareilles, novelist nick hornby, college a cappella groups and  symphony orchestras across the united states and australia."it's  certainly entertaining, and it must be teaching me something. i like to  see the way people work," folds says. "it's always affirming, because  even the masters don't know much; they don't know how they do it  exactly. so often, their process can appear as if it's fucking hackery,  just like they're swinging in the dark. what separates the mice from the  men is that some of the hacks can put it together and find a voice and  come through that process."collaboration and longevity have given  folds a close view of the music industry's rapid changes. an artist  comfortable going against the grain, folds appreciates a more-direct  connection with his audience that technology affords."the balance  has changed as far as what is expected of an artist, commercially and  remaining creative in the middle of all of that," he says. "there was  the distraction for about 30 years that musicians could well become  millionaires, and many did in a time period that's really just a blip on  the map. it's not going to happen again for a while. now the  distraction is the fact that we can't become millionaires, and i think a  healthy thing is coming of it."musicians are now coming up  understanding and believing they will not likely get rich doing what  they do, so it becomes more about what they can offer. that's always  been the musician on the street busking, and the musicians in the  churches. you should get back enough to live, and that's what musicians  are heading toward now."folds, 45, spent much of the last year combing through his own archives to compile the career-spanning the best imitation of myself: a retrospective.  the project grew to three distinct formats aimed to please die-hard  fans and newbies alike: an 18-song single disc release; a three-disc  version with 43 additional live songs, rarities and outtakes; and a  vault-clearing 56-track digital collection of rarities."it was a  shitload of tapes. it was kind of weird to hear hours and hours, days  and weeks of shit you don't remember doingâand i wasn't even on drugs. i  just did so much," folds says. "it's also interesting to hear my  development as a person versus my development as an artist. i could hear  the person speaking between the songs on the tape, and i'd think he's a  child, and then i'd hear the songs and hear somebody who knew a lot  more than the person who was speaking."now folds is going back to  the band that first broke him big, with darren jessee on drums and  robert sledge on bass. the trio recorded three new songs for the best imitation of myself and will start new recording sessions late this month.published jan. 12, 2012 in the tucson weekly.

live - shawn harris and full release, big meridox, whsk, mr. head's, jan. 7





live,  big meridox is the "beast" he calls himself in rhyme, tense and  confrontational as he roams the crowd and delivers lines with urgency  and, at times, an edgy growl. joined by dj bonus on turntables and a  macbook, meridox performed 12 songs, produced by gunky knuckles.sweating  and swaggering like a boxer, meridox gives a physical performance,  stalking around the crowd to get in people's faces. on a performance and  video shoot for his new "whiskey breath" single, meridox hopped onto  tables to bring the crowd in closer around him, holding court as he  un-spooled lines above their heads.meridox doesn't shy away from  bravado in his lyrics, but his songs take any number of surprising  turns. he spits references from the limitless well of a trivia aceâa  cultural mash-up of subject matter that he stitches together on the fly.poetic  but harsh, big ox raps smart, but not sensitive: "too evil to go emo,"  he raps on "brutus." knowledge is his game, but the perspective tends to  come from the hobbes school of "nasty, brutish and short."open  barely a year, mr. head's, the art bar adjacent to a glass-blowing  studio/shop, has become perhaps tucson's top spot for hip hop, with an  ever-changing spray-painted mural covering one wall of the spacious  patio.the tammies reigning hip-hop champion shaun harris and his  band, full release, closed the show. the four-piece bandâbass, drums,  guitar and tromboneâcombined with dj bonus on a blend of soul, funk and  spacey psychedelic rock. a fluid performer, harris rhymes fast and  furious when called for, and he can sing the hooks too.harris can  write songs loaded with geek humorâone is about ewoksâbut he's best on  the honest, personal stuff. rapping about the shitty economy, his  diabetes struggle and his little brother being sentenced to 25 years in  prison, harris is full of the same sort of honest desperation that  brought hip hop into its own as an art form.opening was the duo  whsk, with heady, stream-of-consciousness rhymes, some offbeat  flourishesâone backing track was made by beat-boxing into a  didgeridooâand a finish-each-others-sentences freestyle.published jan. 12, 2012 in the tucson weekly.<a href="http://bigmeridox.bandcamp.com/track/whiskey-breath">whiskey breath by big meridox &amp; gunky knuckles</a>

top albums of 2011





1. tom waits, bad as me (anti-)if you agreeâin any wayâthat "hell broke luce" in 2011, then bad as me is the record to turn to for some wisdom and advice amid the chaos. dark, preposterous, incensed and confrontational, bad as me  encapsulates a year that saw misery boil over into anger. the message  waits delivers, through stomps and shouts: this year's optimism is found  in revolt.2. the war on drugs, slave ambient (secretly canadian)adam granduciel takes some cues from dylan and springsteen, but slave ambient  is on an entirely different sonic plane. on a dense bed of layered  loops, ambient tones and swirling textures are striking and forceful  rock songs, a sort of classic rock from some alternate universe.3. wye oak, civilian (merge)psychedelic  folk might be an accurate label, but it falls far short of capturing  what's so successful about wye oak's dynamic sound. "civilian" is my top  song of the year, a gathering stormâtense, beautiful and  otherworldlyâthat then explodes with chaotic energy.4. bon iver, bon iver (jagjaguwar)justin vernon buried his quiet, somber muse and set out to chase a multihued adventurous one on bon iver.  it's a provocative shift, but the album's complexity feeds off an  exploratory urgency that pushes the songs into a bigger world, with rich  instrumentation and an impressive depth and fluidity.5. richard buckner, our blood (merge)an esoteric and challenging songwriter, buckner is second to none. our blood  is an album of resuscitated and patched sounds, of peripheral  intrusions, of expelled breath. its songs are full of strange and  seemingly disconnected details, short on explanatory meat, but  marvelously evocative.6. roadside graves, we can take care of ourselves (autumn tone)using s.e. hinton's the outsiders  as a cornerstone, the roadside graves explore the struggles of  outsiders everywhere, with a sprawling sort of americana that expertly  keys in on the songs' emotional shifts.7. paul simon, so beautiful or so what (hear)on his best album since graceland,  paul simon is both meditative and fearless, writing songs with restless  curiosity to probe spirituality, mortality and the endless, mysterious  power of love.8. akron/family, akron/family ii: the cosmic birth and journey of shinju tnt (dead oceans)an  album written on a japanese volcano and recorded in an abandoned  detroit train station, this is a musical collage of ideas and sounds,  pushing the experimental boundaries of folk music.9. murs, love and rockets vol. 1: the transformation (bluroc)one  of hip-hop's most distinctly talented lyricists, murs teams with  producer ski beatz on an album of odes to love and marriage,  international travelogues and vivid narratives.10. crooked fingers, breaks in the armor (merge)sparse  in sound and blunt in lyrics, eric bachmann's latest is an album about  vulnerability and perseverance, songs that speak to intensely personal  struggles.honorable mention: as one of the organizers/producers of the luz de vida  compilation, it's hardly fair for me to include it in the list. but  it's a stunning collection of songs that meant more to me this year than  any other music.wilco, the whole love; mr. gnome, madness in miniature; amos lee, mission bell; fleet foxes, helplessness blues; the low anthem, smart flesh; gillian welch, the harrow and the harvest; the roots, undun; iron and wine, kiss each other clean; smith westerns, dye it blonde; generationals, actor-caster; st. vincent, strange mercy; kurt vile, smoke ring for my halo.published jan. 5, 2012 in the tucson weekly.

review: noel gallagher - noel gallagher's high flying birds





as  the more-thoughtful oasis brother, noel gallagher's best moments tended  to turn up on hit singles as well as around the band's fringes, like  b-sides and the noel-sung mtv unplugged. boastful and arrogant,  oasis was gunning for the highest peaks, and that often involved a  certain sound and swagger that didn't incorporate the best of noel's  skills.neither, exactly, does this first solo album.while noel gallagher's high flying birds  stacks up well against the albums from oasis' declining years, it's  weighted with a different set of expectations. yet stripped of any  competition for the album's creative direction, noel's songwriting is  too often flat and simplisticâ"if i had the time, i'd stop the world and  make you mine, and every day would stay the same with you," he sings on  "if i had a gun."the album's best songsâlike "aka ... broken  arrow" and "stop the clocks"âbring back the sound of that brit-pop  grandeur. the songs are well-crafted and include some refreshing  instrumental flourishesâhorn breaks on "dream on" and "the death of you  and me," more keyboards and strings, and even some subtle but effective  banjo and pedal steel.the post-oasis solo albums reveal just how well-balanced the gallagher brothers' strengths were. and it's no surprise that what noel gallagher's high flying birds really needs is a little of liam's bombastic energy.published dec. 29, 2011 in the tucson weekly.

review: the roots - undun





the roots' undun  is a character study and album-length epitaph of the fictional redford  stephens, whose short inner-city life of crime and consequence yields a  meditation on fate, mortality and karmic justice.the band's first  concept album arrives with vivid narrative details, moody instrumentals  and a documentary-style detachment. stephens' tragic arc (1974-1999) is  presented through the character's own thoughts, a self-aware mix of  bravado and doubt. when the score inevitably gets settled, it's the  man's own fingerprints that are all over his undoing."it's the  flight of my fall and it's right on the wall," raps black thought on "i  remember," a song that captures the moment in stephens' story when rise  turns to fall. elsewhere, the lyrics are shot through with imagery of  war and allusions that range from the bible to greek mythology, from  hammurabi to f.d.r. to the sudanese genocide.it's an edgy and  somber album, and at first pass, the strengths are the songs that really  pop ("kool on," "the otherside"). but close listening reveals more  subtle moments when undun's cohesiveness and continuity shine.undun  closes with a four-song instrumental suite that goes from somber  strings and piano to nightmarish clang and clatter, a sort of chaotic  anxiety that draws the listener to a place that even black thought's  bleakest lyrics can't quite reach.to call the roots incomparable at this point is surely redundant, but more than anything the band has recorded before, undun is an album that couldn't possibly come from anyone else.published dec. 22, 2011 in the tucson weekly.

murs plays club congress tonight





murs concludes the hip hop and love tour with a hometown performanceinstead of a shout-out to his neighborhood or hometown, murs opens his new record with an intergalactic greeting."i  use my rocket fuel to travel through the infinite / and this is what i  brought to you," raps murs on "epic salutations," a rapid-fire and  wildly imaginative lyrical journey into outer space.it's a song that introduces the themes of love and rockets, vol. 1: the transformationâtravel,  love, inspiration and storytelling that touches on both humor and  tragedyâwhile also serving as a statement of career vindication for a  rapper whose path has been marked by a long, yet wholly independent,  ascendancy."i rarely replicate," murs raps on "epic salutations," and it's way more than just a passing statement."i  feel it's my duty," he explains. "i've always been a unique person, but  i also feel that out of respect for the people who came before me. a  lot of rap is still doing what they were doing in the 1990s. when n.w.a.  did it, it was new and revolutionary, but to come behind and do the  same thing is disrespect to the people who blazed the trail before me."born  in los angeles, the relentlessly creative murs has lived in oakland,  tucson, los angeles andâfor the past two yearsâtucson again, where the  now-married 33-year-old appreciates the pace, weather, creative energy  and grounded attitude of the people."when i first came to tucson  in 1997, we performed at (club) congress, and i met my best friend. i  never thought there would be people into hip hop in tucson. for some  reason, when you're in a big city, you can think that's all there is,"  he says. "the more i travel, the more i see people in missoula, mont.,  are into the same stuff and just as hip as people in new york city.  every town has its unique energy, but as far as the mentality, kids are  up on stuff just the same. and people genuinely all want to enjoy  themselves."bringing his music to cities and towns off the beaten  path has been a hallmark of murs' career, and something he's stuck with  on the current hip hop and love tour, which makes its last of 50 stops  in tucson."the way i was brought into the game with independent  hip hop was always to make sure we hit the smaller markets, the  secondary markets, but also the tertiary markets," he says. "it's always  been fun, and the kids there love me. chicago is dope, but the kids in  omaha love me, too."the hip hop and love tour mixes rapping and djs with a live band."i  bring it all in. as i grew up, i got more involved in live music and  became a fan of jack white or vampire weekend, and i wanted that element  in my show," murs says. "we're going full at it. i love playing with a  band, because they bring so much energy."the tourâwith tabi  bonney, ski beatz and the senseis, mckenzie eddy, da$h and sean  o'connellâis a bluroc records showcase that celebrates murs' return to  the independent world after 2008's murs for president album on warner bros."i  felt like i got to expand and spread my wings a little bit," he says  about being on a major label. "it's like getting to make a movie where  you can blow up whatever you want. it was a great experience, but i saw  how it affects the creative process. there are so many checks and  balances when there's so much money at stake."murs joined with  bluroc for the tour, a partnership that quickly expanded into the new  albumâand working with producer ski beatz, whose long list of  collaborations includes songs with jay-z and mos def."when i'm  working with a different guy on every record, it puts me in a position  where i have something to prove, and it brings the best performance out  of me," murs says. "i was looking forward to it, because he's worked  with so many different people and styles. i knew we'd get something to  make it work."murs says he usually writes songs by approaching  the beat first, rather than beginning the recording process with a lot  of lyrics in hand. that responsive style gives the songs an  improvisational freshness, and whatever the sounds conjure in his mind  is what the song is about."i've always been honest, with an open  door into my music," he says. "i wanted to talk about different things,  because i am traveling and exploring and want to incorporate different  things into my work."love and rockets features odes to  love and marriage ("i found my love in the 520"), the flourishing era of  west coast hip hop he loved growing up, international travelogues and  the independent spirit in hip hop that he sees as stronger than ever.  "67 cutlass" is a what-if inspired by too many run-ins with police, and  "animal style" is the tale of two gay high school kids fighting  discrimination. a more-accepting society would prevent the story's  tragic end."i have friends and family who are leading  quote-unquote alternative lifestyles, and i can't ask them to come out,  but i can be an advocate for gay people, gay teens, and give them  someone to talk to," murs says. "i just hope i'm doing my part to create  a more-understanding environment in hip hop. marriage rights or  whatever, we can argue, but people have the right to exist and love who  they want to love without being persecuted."it's yet another  atypical rap from murs, who's worked for 15 years to make his name by  following his own path. after his early days of hustling tapes in  oakland, murs earned accolades through prolific collaborations as a  member of the living legends crew, with slug (of atmosphere) and north  carolina producer 9th wonder.after racing around the country on the hip hop and love tour, murs plans to get back to his love and rockets  concept, with two more volumes planned. years of hard work and  underground success have brought him artistic freedom as well as fans,  and murs says he appreciates that technology has made it easier than  ever to reach out."music is in a good place now. the artists are  finally in control of their own destiny. that's exciting to me, because  that's what i've been preaching for years."published nov. 24, 2011 in the tucson weekly.

review: dum dum girls - only in dreams





the  first thing to notice about dum dum girls is the attitudeâthat  audacious, flirtatious cool, with their don't-follow-the-rules  posturing. debut album i will be was a musical exploration of that attitude, marking dum dum girls as a fresh and intriguing buzz band.only in dreams  takes that attitude and runs with itâin a few different directions. the  band still brings a refreshing punk rawness and hazy reverb to melodic  retro-pop, but there's a bit more exploration this time out.added  to the batch of influences found on the debutâchiefly the shangri-las  and the ramonesâare mazzy star and the pretenders, shoring up what were  some weaker areas of the band's sound.with its blend of bubblegum  pop and waves of guitar reverb, "bedroom eyes" sounds like it could  soundtrack a john hughes movieâbittersweet music for when words won't  quite capture it."just a creep" has tones of surf rock, while  "heartbeat (take it away)" and "caught in one" especially ring with the  bouncy rock 'n' roll of the pretenders.singer dee dee (kristen  gundred) wrote much of the album as a response to the death of her  mother, with the sense of loss, pain and confusion especially poignant  in "hold your hand," "teardrops on my pillow" and "wasted away."preferences will surely vary between only in dreams and i will be,  but that's missing the point. with a smooth and confident follow-up,  dum dum girls have easily passed from buzz band to sophomore-slump  conquerors, with plenty more to anticipate.published nov. 24, 2011 in the tucson weekly.download:dum dum girls - bedroom eyes

tom russell at club congress on wednesday





the storytelling gifts that tom russell has brought to songs for 35 years have reached new peaks on mesabi, another stunning album of southwest-borderlands rock.russell  begins this wide-ranging collection with "mesabi," a song named for the  minnesota iron range of bob dylan's childhood, imagining how strongly  those early influences struck young ears. singing of the "bethlehem of  the troubadour kid," russell also reflects on the san joaquin valley of  his own childhood and the urge to leave it all behind.two years after blood and candle smoke, produced at tucson's wavelab studio by craig schumacher, russell returns to tucson for several of mesabi's songs, reigniting collaboration with schumacher and calexico.but mesabi  is a more-wide-ranging album in sound and lyrical scope, taking on  subjects and locations ranging from cedar rapids to juarez, and from  james dean to disney child star bobby driscoll, whose tragic tailspin  russell weaves into the peter pan story that made driscoll famous.despite  its impeccable production and all-star cast of musiciansâguitarist will  kimbrough, keyboardist augie meyers and pianist van dyke parksâmesabi  is definitely an album of words. it's russell's greatest strength, and  he doesn't hold back. the album's chief fault is the embarrassment of  riches: as these stories unfoldâwhether they're dense, vivid, nostalgic,  bleak or even hopefulâit's best to take them one or two or three at a  time.published on nov. 17, 2011 in the tucson weekly.

centro-matic - dual identities





the versatile will johnson finds himself in a hard-driving, centro-matic phase these dayswill  johnson is a songwriter who works in bursts. he's also a songwriter who  keeps multiple bands and projects alive at the same time.so what makes a song a centro-matic song?"i  will get into certain sounds or certain type of songs for a stretch,"  he says. "these days, i'm writing more hard-driving music."johnson  will sort his batches of songs by feel, instead of setting out to focus  on a particular band. the songs come easier when he blocks out those  other intentions."more times than not, i'll kind of binge-write.  i'll take two or three weeks and just devote as much time as i can to  the act of writing and getting sounds down that appeal to my ideas. once  i'm done with that, i'll start to sort it out," johnson says. "if i  over-think it too much as far as which band or what category a song goes  in, i'll take the chance of losing the guts of the song itself. i find  it's better to sort it out later."circling back to hard-driving  rock music was just a matter of time for johnson after recording with  his more-somber band south san gabriel, drumming for the monsters of  folk supergroup, and releasing a stark collaborative record with  magnolia electric co.'s jason molina."last year, i was writing  these really stark, more-acoustic narrative storyteller kind of songs.  it's just the type of guitar i purchased and the type of place i was  recording in. it just inspired that type of song," he says. "whereas  these days, i'm really just getting into a lot of noise and sounds and  going for a more-aggressive approach vocally at times. it's funny; the  older i get, the more toothy some of the vocals become."johnson wrote centro-matic's 10th albumâand first proper release in five yearsâon the bass guitar, which gives candidate waltz a different sort of feel, energetic but straightforward."my  wife has this great bass guitar from back when she used to play. i got  all the guitars out knowing i was going to spend two weeks on writing. i  picked that one up, and i just loved it," he says. "i got attracted to  the idea of writing on a different plane. it dictated some different  things rhythmically and encouraged some different things vocally in  terms of cadence. it inherently changes some decisions that i would have  made. it leaves a little more space, a little bit more to the  imagination than just strumming a guitar."candidate waltz  marks the 15-year point for centro-maticâjohnson, scott danbom  (keyboards, violin, harmonies), matt pence (drummer, producer) and mark  hedman (bass, guitar)âand is in some ways a throwback to the band's  earliest days in denton, texas."sometimes in the studio, we have  kept it loose and loud, with a lot of feedback and hiccups here and  there. but with this recording, we worked hard to make it terse, but not  cold or unfriendly," says johnson, "multitasking" with his 10-month-old  daughter during a phone interview from his texas home. "it's a  little-bit-different recording process. we economized the overdub world  ... on candidate waltz."from time to time, we've been  known to layer things up and put heaps of overdubs, and that's fun  sometimes," he says. "but with this one, we definitely wanted to peel  things back more and let the instruments we did leave in speak a little  louder and maintain a little bit more presence."with essentially  the same lineup as centro-matic, south san gabriel depends on much of  the same musical chemistry. but keeping both bands going simultaneously  creates a bit of a dual identity, something johnson references on "only  in my double mind.""there has been a certain musical duality to  our efforts over these last 15 years. sometimes, it does involve  shifting identity," he says. "we tend to fall back into it pretty  easily, and i'd like to believe it's a testament to the fact that we've  maintained the friendships very carefully and very beautifully over all  these years."when the band started, johnson says, he had no clear  vision of where centro-matic would find itself in the futureâjust that  the bandmates were committed to playing music together."i kind of  figured we would be playing music together in some capacity this far  down the line. i didn't necessarily think it'd be centro-matic, but i  figured we'd find some reason, some way, to keep playing music. we've  become husbands and fathers, but we've found a way to want to keep  making music in our lives."i'm proud of the fact that we've  continued to not take ourselves too terribly seriously. we've managed to  take it all with a bucket of salt as we go," johnson says. "that's not  to say we don't take the art seriouslyâthe recording and the live show,  we want that to be as good as it possibly can be. but the inherent want  to keep things respectful and loose within our friendships has hopefully  added longevity to the band."after recording candidate waltz,  johnson rented a cabin in the texas hill country for another burst of  songwriting. returning with 26 recently sorted-out songs, johnson says  it's clearly another centro-matic batch."we'd scattered for a break between albums, and candidate waltz  brought us back together. i'm looking forward to getting everybody back  together in six or eight months. i'm thinking and hoping this will be a  faster turnaround."that should be no trouble for centro-matic,  which streamlined the recording and release process by going without a  record label for candidate waltz. self-releasing for the first  time was brought on by the band's tight-knit relationship with fans, a  testament to the band's perseverance. a pleasant byproduct was the time  it opened for another creative burst from johnson."the fact that i  was so inspired to write is hopefully a testament to the energy that  the band has received through the encouraging recent tour," he says.  "we're all looking forward to getting back to the studio and seeing what  comes out of the next record."the fact that there's always one more record in us is an encouraging thing, and we might as well get that."published nov. 17, 2011 in the tucson weekly.

does the u.s. know what to do with these french bastards?





plush welcomes the inspector cluzo, the self-proclaimed 'original funk 'n' roll duo'when the bass player quit, the inspector cluzo marched onward as a two-piece.all  the advice they received said otherwise, and the precedent said  otherwise, but mathieu jourdain and laurent lacrouts felt they could  play funk music as a duo. with no bass."we started with a bass  player, but he wasn't good enough, and he decided to go and play  different stuff. we said, 'go away. we don't care, and we'll make it  work as two-piece,'" says drummer jourdain. "groovy funk rock without  the bass seems to be not possible, but we did it."jourdain and  singer-guitarist lacrouts have been playing together for 17 years, first  in the band wolfunkind, and for the last three years as the inspector  cluzo. the frenchmen refer to themselves as the "original funk 'n' roll  duo.""we're used to each other, and this is why it is working. we  play really tight, and the energy produced is big," jourdain says  during a phone interview from a tour stop in atlanta. "we've been  listening to funk music for a very long time. we were really into it,  and we're very sensitive to the groove from the funk music."with a  style that passes from fishbone- and red hot chili peppers-style funk  to the groovier side of rage against the machine, the inspector cluzo  have toured relentlessly since 2008, building a fan base from europe to  australia, and playing festivals in japan, korea and taiwan.while  growing up in france, jourdain says, funk music was hardly prevalent.  as fans, he and lacrouts would need to hunt down import releases in  small record shops. as funk musicians themselves, a local welcome was  slow to come."in france, it was hard for us, because they don't  have the culture of funk music. they're more mainstream in music. if you  hear french radio, you would throw up," he says. "we first started  getting abroad, and it worked better there than in france. because it  worked elsewhere, france started waking up, and we could build  something."fishbone was among the funk bands that were able to  break through in france, and the pair opened for the los angeles band a  number of times with wolfunkind. they befriended fishbone, and singer  angelo moore suggested they name the new project the pink panther. legal  concerns brought about the new name, the inspector cluzo.they also borrowed their energetic performance style from fishbone."we  don't want to get off the stage without making sure that the audience  is on fire. we took that from fishbone. they're like that, really into  making people crazy," jourdain says. "that's what we're trying to do  every night. it's never the same show every night, because depending on  how the audience reacts, we try different ways."the band has released two albums in france, the inspector cluzo and french bastards. both albums were repackaged into a single release for the band's first full u.s. tour."we're  having a lot of fun, and we have very good feedback from the shows. we  are totally, happily, surprised at the good reactions that the audiences  have," jourdain says.despite growing success overseasâ530 shows  in 28 countries, and selling 50,000 albums in three yearsâthe band had a  difficult time breaking into the united states."it's a different  experience. we made it by doing everything ourselves. we're music  craftsmen. we do everything from the recording to publishing to booking  shows," jourdain says. "we were not used to the u.s. market, so it was  hard to find a way to enter it, to make promoters answer e-mails, but  finally, we could hook up a whole proper tour."because  high-energy funk music is hardly the norm for french bands, jourdain  says, the inspector cluzo have been able to take advantage of the  element of surprise, giving audiences way more entertainment than they  might have been expecting."it's funny. here, the audience doesn't  expect that kind of music and that entertainment. i think they just  expect a band playing, but there's a lot of interaction and jokes, and  we're pushing a lot."the band has a third record ready for mixing  and mastering once they return to france, but jourdain says they  couldn't refuse a chance to extend the "french bastards tour" to the  united states."the music is full of energy, groovy, so it talks  to everybody. you can dance; you can head-bang on some parts; and the  energy is shared with the audience. whatever the language, wherever you  are, it seems to work," jourdain says. "that's why we keep on going and  try to visit as many countries as possible."published nov. 10, 2011 in the tucson weekly.the inspector cluzo performs friday, nov. 11 at plush, with marianne dissard and mr. free and the satellite freakout

live review: mates of state & generationals





the  pairing of mates of state and generationals guarantees hooks and  harmony galoreâan abundant display of how to make pop songs shine.both  bands are built around a duo and the ever-present interplay between  musical counterparts. in mates of state, it's husband-wife duo jason  hammel and kori gardner, while generationals offer grant widmer and ted  joyner, a songwriting duo with a friendship that dates back to their  early high school days.the generationals, from new orleans, have  developed a strong tucson audience through frequent touring and a  connection through park the van records to golden boots. the band's  throwback pop has grown a bit spacier and fuller as a five-piece.opening with "nobody could change your mind," the band raced through a set that mixed standouts from 2009 debut con law, 2010 ep trust and this year's actor-caster.  highlights included motown-influenced "when they fight, they fight,"  the lively "you say it too" and the bouncy set-closer "trust."however,  the appreciative plush crowd clearly turned out for mates of state,  whose nearly 20-song set touched on midcareer favorites like "get  better" and "the re-arranger" (from 2008's re-arrange us), and "for the actor" (2006's bring it back), before moving into more songs from this year's mountaintops.with  hammel on drums and gardner on pianoârounded out by guitar and frequent  trumpetâmates of state has a fine balance staked out between powerful  and precise drumming and nimble, playful piano. and those harmonies!covers  of jackson browne's "these days" and daniel johnston's "true love will  find you in the end" were both re-envisioned in mates of state's poppy  and adorable style.the band's final encore was "palomino," the first song on mountaintops and one of the year's best singles, a burst of exuberance that had the still-packed house jumping and fist-pumping.published nov. 10, 2011 in the tucson weekly.

damn does this song rule...





i'll have a full review of last night's mates of state & generationals show in the tucson weekly on thursday, but today i have to highlight "palomino," the first song on mates of state's new album, mountaintops. "palomino" is quickly becoming one of my favorite songs of 2011, and it's an amazing video, from director jimi patterson:and as a bonus, mates of state covering jackson browne's "these days":
