bleeding / pain after bm's 



hemorrhoids 



hemorrhoidal and anal fissure disease are the most common causes of bleeding from the colon/anorectum. 






treatment options












 





painful bm's 



anal fissure 



can be many things, but anal fissure is a leading cause of severe acute pain during/after bowel activity. 






cause and treatment












 





itchy, painful / burning rectum 



pruritus ani "anal itching" 



has many causes but is usually related to hemorrhoidal disease and diet/lifestyle. 






cause and treatment


















hemorrhoidshemorrhoids can be defined in a couple of different ways. the “not so clinical definition” is they are merely varicose veins located in the anorectum. a more recent study has described the presence in the anal canal/lower rectum of specialized highly vascular “cushions” or “pads” consisting of discrete masses of thick submucosa which contain blood vessels, smooth muscle and elastic and connective tissue. such cushions are present in everyone, and it is suggested that the term “hemorrhoids” be confined to situations where these cushions are abnormal (enlarged, inflamed) and cause symptoms.learn moreanal fissurean anal fissure is a linear ulcer usually extending from just below the ano-rectal line to the margin of the anus. the pain associated with fissure disease is disportionate to the size of the lesion with post-defecatory pain (intense burning) lasting anywhere from minutes to hours. location is usually in the posterior midline (90%), which according to schouten, may be explained by relative ischemia in that area because of the sphincter spasm or increased resting pressure of the surrounding sphincteric musculature (internal/external).learn morepruritus anipruritus ani is a bothersome and sometimes intense itching or burning sensation of the skin around the anus (rectal opening). it is most noticeable at night or after a bowel movement. the most common complaint is an irresistible urge to scratch.learn more
