coupon tips

                  us






feona: i was just in stop and shop (our local supermarket), and the cashier told me that i could use my manufacturers coupons (which the store doubles) with the coupons the store prints out and gives you at the register when you check out!   i had no idea.  i confirmed this with the head desk.  does your grocery store allow this?  try using
      manufacturers' coupons with "the printed out at the register coupons" and the coupons from 

coolsavings.com.
  use two coupons together for one item! my neighbor said you could do this.   i haven't tried it yet.   are the groceries free yet?   my personal best is 75% off one single shopping trip. you should have seen the clerks face!  i felt like i won the lotto.
       
gabi: you can also use the store flyer coupons with the manufacturers coupons at any major drug store chain such as eckards, cvs and rite-aid.   these drug stores have sales every week on their store brand of diapers or the premium brand diapers such as huggies or pampers. you have to have all the coupons to take advantage of the savings.   thank you to gabi for this tip.




in store coupon tip. shared with me by my  on shopping trip. you go to cash register and tell them you forgot your coupon and can you still us the current coupons. if it is a instore charge card coupon than pay your bill with cash or check immediately at customer service after checking out if you get annoyed at too many bills. this worked for me for a 20% percent discount for a regular charge. worth the minute that it too. i am sure this would work with some other stores too. worth a simple question. can i use the current coupon? i forgot mine at home. thanks sue for this department store tip.

i have been using momsview for more that 4 years now. it saves me money on every single online purchase i make. i
 have also successfully used printables when i shop at brick and mortar stores. i find the site to be accurate, the
 coupons have expiration dates or if there is no expire date, that is also noted. i never do any shopping without 
going to check for store coupons at momsview. the site is easy to use, no flashing or weird colors and overall very
 easy to navigate. i haven't paid shipping costs in years because of momsview.

this site is top notch! it is extremely helpful and wonderfully supportive. the coupons are always of the best quality
 & savings. it is kept current and up to date. the members are still using a message board that has an archive where 
you can find the answer to just about every parental and otherwise question you may have. more people need to chat on
 that. but otherwise - it is a site that i visit daily not only for coupon resources but also for friendship & support.
 please join me!
