 bass fishing, bass 
  boats and all 
  that goes with them is my "second career". 







 it's been many 
        years since i updated this site. life often gets in the way of our plans.
        i do appreciate the interest you have shown over the years and will do 
        my best to make the site relevent again.




we lost ken cook, the classic champ, in january of 2016. 
          he and i fished many of the same pro tournaments in the early 80s, were 
          friends and spoke frequently for over 30 years. he was from oklahoma 
          and a former freshwater fisheries biologist, whereas i am from texas 
          and a video engineer.
