our values















at evolution, our motto is “setting a higher standard”, and we strive for that daily with each decision we make and every client we interact with. since opening in 1999, we have been albuquerque’s only studio dedicated solely to the art of body piercing. we are albuquerque’s first members of the association of professional piercers, and we continue to set ourselves apart by offering the highest quality jewelry and safe, accurate procedures performed by highly skilled piercers. we serve a vastly diverse clientele and remain dedicated to maintaining a positive and welcoming environment and to offering guidance through each client’s individual piercing experience.















evolution as a family is dedicated to maintaining an environment for all individuals to feel welcomed and appreciated for who they are, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, age, or ability. we value action in learning and speaking up for ourselves and others. any misuse of authority, unsolicited invasion of personal space, and inappropriate or toxic language are not tolerated within our space.















at evolution, all needles used for piercing are sterile and single use. all jewelry and instruments used for piercing are properly processed and sterilized in an autoclave prior to use. these items will either be opened from sealed sterile pouches or sterilized in a statim autoclave in your presence — note that statim cycles will include an integrator strip so you can see that sterilization parameters have been met. all of our autoclaves are spore tested weekly by an independent laboratory to ensure that they are in proper working order. records of test results are available upon request.
