this is what we are left with





on holloween  night 2009, we closed the golden door of our little gem of a store for the last time.  there was no more trying.  the inspirational star nebula chandelier was the last thing to be removed. in reverence, love and ceremony we  took it apart. one brilliant crystal at a time. our beautiful little universe called collective was now a black hole, an empty space, a void in our own lives, a  void in our community.on december 31st, 2007 the first seeds of greed contributing to this particular halloween night forced us from our old grand beautiful space at 5323 ballard ave. these seeds are sadly two very familiar faces. faces i  have said good morning to on a daily basis for so long. one; a local landowner. the other; a family member/ business partner.i have yet to write about the profoundly selfish and devious events of the first act. when the time is clear, when i recover from the devastation of it all.... i will....write.in this, the second  act, our valiant attempt to recover from the first act was not enough. this time the weeds of greed took over.  we are now one of eight small businesses in ballard fallen under the weight of the great recession.  the trickle down effect from all the corruption  pillaging our nation had finally reached us and so many others.  for them and us there was no bail out money, no sba loans....no big bonus. there was simply nothing with the  exception of one reality. we had been deceived. that deception caused the loss of our ground and our livelihood.  we had struggled enough.the third act has begun and however great the struggle, however great the loss, there is indeed a soothing that is available through retrospect. like the net of indra, all the jewels reflect the truth of the other. in the aftermath of this epic time it is clear, like the brilliant light of morning, it is clear; we are  not empty.this is what we are left with; these are the jewels that will revive us.1. we are left with  the beautiful memory of what we created together.2.  we are left with our community and the dearest of relationships and lasting friendships.3. we are left with all goodness born of the time and space called collective.4. we are left with each other and the goodness left here on ballard avenue.5. we are left with our home, our minuscule apartment perched above this avenue.6. we are left older, a bit worn out, but wiser.7. we are left with our wild things; feathered friends, tiger, jordy and larry bird.8. we are left with  a great teacher, a wolf dog named maya.9. we are  left, in spite of it all, with small sparks of hope and a little sliver of faith.

i'll be your mirror





this morning i was revisiting my jewelry box. though i love jewelry and i have some lovely things,  i have worn only one necklace for this entire last year. the simple tiny crescent moon which delicately hangs from a thin piece of silk thread surely was crafted from some old sacred bone. i wear it constantly and this tiny sliver of a moon has become for me  a symbol of faith.faith is sometimes so difficult to access especially when the simple desires of ones life seem to be slipping away as if someone is grabbing it out of your hands. what was so dear to the home of your heart  is but a memory or a lingering wish.this man i love and i have worked so hard and sacrificed so much to keep our dream alive and to keep these  shop doors open. in spite of familial failings, increasing rents and a major move, we are still here, on our street, in our community, just in time for the greatest recession of all time.today i am feeling especially distant from faith. it's not just the struggles of business ownership, it's not the enormity of and the impact of the recession and the lousy timing of it all, it's the weight of these past two years and how it rides so heavy on the heels of these uncertain times. it's the disintegration of the family part of my family business and the loss of relationship with a beloved daughter. it's the the profoundly sorrowful witness of a son's journey into mental illness. it's working so hard to regather my own life only to find myself standing by watching as it hangs precariously as if by a thin silk thread.with one last glance in the mirror as i leave the apartment, i catch a glimpse of the little bit of faith i have left hanging around my neck and i make my way one block to our store.putting  on my smile i opened the shop door. the flood of the  sunday farmers market shoppers filled the empty space. this place is more than  a retail shop it is our heart and this  avenue is our home. i thought to my self " we'd be better of selling milk"...right now people need substance not vintage furniture." i stood frozen behind the counter wondering how we were going to survive. wondering if i had made the right choice to keep the store going. as i stood there, i surveyed the sea of faces coming and going. they were the new and the familiar. they were our community and extensions of our community and they were all part of the reason we were here.  did they have any idea how hard it was for us to be here now to keep these doors open?just as that thought  formed, she walked through the door... as if on a mission. she had  a bouquet of brilliant  flowers in one arm and a  tiny  bundle held close to her breast in the other. i didn't recognize her a first, it had been a long time since i had spoken with this  women  one day long ago as she lingered in my shop.  as she approached, i suddenly remembered her clearly, she had lost her faith. desperately wanting to have a child she had  been told that it would not happen.  on that day so long ago, i simply encouraged her to  have faith because i knew that in faith resides a sea of possibilities.as she simultaneously set the flowers on the counter and unwrapped the tiny bundle at her breast she said, "i wanted to thank you. " she slowly  unveiled the face of her beautiful baby girl and she continued. " you are why she is here! you encouraged me to find faith  in spite of what the doctors were telling me. i heard you, i really heard you that day and i am convinced that that is why she is here." just as she finished her sentence, her husband walked in with a toddler in tow. i smiled and wanted to say that he must have had something to do with this too! in her forty's and against all medical odds, she had given birth to not one but two beautiful healthy children. she was beaming and she was in that moment in time , my mirror. if i had any doubts, at the very least i knew that on this day i was  exactly where i should be. the rest would work itself out.i'll be your mirrorreflect what you are, in case you don't knowi'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset.the light at your door to show that you're home.lou reed

cracks in the curtains & the blink of an eye





" life is like the blink of an eye. what is it worth? nothing. but the eye that blinks - that is something. i guess i blinked, on accident. sometimes though, i have found accidents to be the most fortuitous events in my life. you meet the one person who reminds you what you are, what you do, how to be happy. " chaim potokas we hovered somewhere between sleep and wakefulness, the summer morning light made it's way through the magnificent old tree just outside our window. it then moved brilliantly through the cracks in the curtains, the curtains that hang long, green and gracefully, behind our bed. they are old and quite beautiful the way old things are always  beautiful to eyes that behold them. vintage silk and clearly custom made, they are a perfect compliment to our tree. this morning the light and wind play peacefully together. the leaves and fabric move magically in tandem. all i can see is a glowing field of luminous green before me and i am mesmerized awake.the tree has been here maybe a hundred years. the curtains, for another lifetime, had lived just up the road before moving in with us. you see, we accidentally found them while treasure hunting one early fall day last year. treasure hunting is what we love to do. it's our lively hood. and though most everything found goes into the shop, once in a while a treasure will find it's way home to us. these beauties had previously adorned the bedroom window of a rather elegant lady, who herself, like us, was a lover of textiles and old things. she traveled the world but always returned to ballard; to her home, to her room , to her long graceful green curtains.as it is with every such sunday under our very special window, our street is transformed into a bustling market place. beyond the cracks in the curtains, beyond the magnificent tree canopy that we can literally touch, a plethora of white tents, in yet another blink of an eye, begins to spring up, side by side, back to back, filled to overflowing with a bounty of locally grown goods. on my way to the shop this morning i will buy a freshly picked  bunch of organic red and golden beets, two big fat pink dahlias and two sugar dusted cherry strudels. it is inspiring to experience this transformation of community week after week, year after year. it's a phenomenon really. all  of this bustle beckons me into gratefulness as i lay blinking my own eyes open still seeing green. how sustainable is all of this!i can hear the market vendors setting up. it's there, in and amongst their labor and laughter, i fondly remembered my own year of selling under a tent and how it led me here. it too feels like the blink of an eye, now six years ago when i accidentally found my way to ballard avenue, a new home, new community, new right lively hood and eventually to this beautiful man who is waking up next to me.some things are certain, at least for a while, like these things that shelter us; curtains, trees, tents...home, community...friends... and sunday mornings like this one on ballard avenue.it's time to seize the day, smell the coffee, eat strudel and open the shop door.tip for the day: keep blinking

returning





a few mornings ago i woke up in the middle of another remarkable dream. i have often had what are known as epic dreams. in this dream i was standing under the old bell tower where ballard ave, and 22nd ave. converge. dawn was breaking and the fresh morning light in this ambrosial time had begun to co mingle with the quiet left over from the night. always at this early hour of the morning, time always seems to stand so still....always on this street...always in this old, old sailors town.  for a moment there was not another soul in sight on the street nor in my dream... at least not for a moment.before i actually saw him , i could feel his grand vibration. i could hear his massive body moving. the four pillars of his magnificent form  were hitting the ground hard like  an ancient rhythm... dinegga...it was dinegga....but this time he had a body. in otherworldly dream like motion he slowly walked past the old collective storefront, glancing, just shy of  a minuscule moment,  into the current shop which exist there. glancing  into the memory of his old home ...into the memory of my old home, into the old home of our shop fondly known to all as collective.he didn't pause to wonder, he just kept walking, walking six doors down until he reached collectives new home. standing at the door with his enormous nostrils flaring open wide, he stood there motionless.the warm air of his body met the cold air of the atmosphere and he completely steamed up the glass on the door to my heart. he wanted in. he rubbed his body back and forth against the glass wiping away the steam so he could see, and then his breath would steam it up again. he was  indeed relentless. dinegga was relentless with the bellows of his his life giving breath and the rubbing of his body so he could see clearly.by this time i had made my way to the porch of the little green house next door to our new storefront. he saw me there and with out blinking an eye, he stared me down... i knew i had only one choice...the choice to let him in......i would have to let him in. how could i not. how often does a dinegga show up. i could only imagine what would happen though. the new store is so , so little. it would be worse than a bull in a china closet.maybe i should divert him. maybe, just maybe, i could convince him he had the wrong storefront. after all he had lived down the street ( at least his head did ) for twenty five years. i was sure he was disoriented. ballard ave. has changed a lot since his head was taken down five years ago.  though i wondered and had asked, no one ever knew what happened to him. now on the other hand maybe i am the one who is disoriented. that's what happens when you work seven days a week 14 hours a day in the depths of a great  recession almost depression... but no.... dinegga insisted on entering. besides, the old storefront is now full of fancy and beautiful girly clothing, and the truth is, this sacred one prefers dwelling amongst old things.i was afraid, afraid knowing i could be crushed by his presence, but then again i could be crushed by the challenges occurring in my life now couldn't i, so i stood anyway. i stood beneath his enormous body and while there in the shelter of his sureness, i very carefully and ever so slowly inserted the little gold key into the door....in the blink of an eye and the click of the key, i woke up .... i woke up and in that moment i remembered my blog, my long lost blog where i first wrote of him. "the stories from ballard ave." i remembered the amazing and remarkable chain of events that followed my first encounter with him. i remembered all the days gone by since then..i remembered finding my home, my lively hood, my community and the man i love. i remembered dinegga and the meaning of the sighting of this sacred one.... i remembered that when, according to the legend, one has a dinegga sighting, something sacred and good was on the horizon. i remembered all the stories i have gathered since. in this moment, all i could possibly know, in spite of everything spinning out of control in our business and our lives, spinning out of control  in the times and in the world..... all i knew in that moment, all i know now is that i have to  return to telling the stories. the stories from this place called home. the stories from ballard ave.remember your stories.

one thing leads to another





originally posted monday january 22, 2007last night i noticed curtis steiner and  mortimer hanging out in the little field next to cugini cafe. the little field is a tiny green belt of sorts, surrounded on three sides by the  ancient brick and mortar walls of three of ballard avenues' older landmark buildings. it is a small oasis for man and beast and the only undeveloped piece of property on ballard ave. as i lingered on the other side of the street, appreciating from afar my friend, his adorable mutt mortimer and the slice of sacred ground they stood on, i was reminded again; curtis steiner is exactly why i had come to this street the night of the dineega encounter.the bigger story that brought me here was most certainly catalytic, i might even say it was alchemical in nature. at the very least, for me, to tell it requires a shot of jagermeister, sad yet soulful cello music , and a box of kleenex. perhaps the details will reveal themselves in a future posting....maybe and then maybe not. maybe some stories are better left untold. the most important thing is that from the bones of that story, there arose for me a new direction . physical survival along with the craving of right lively hood led me to a place where i would meet curtis steiner. i would find myself far from the halls of a hospital, migrating from healer to junk dealer, it's funny how one thing leads to the other.being a junk dealer is hard work. every sunday for over a year i would get up at 4:00 am, load up my little eagle summit to overflowing with whatever i had found that week. furniture, books , art, found objects, whatever caught my eye. i remember driving down the steep part of phinney avenue hoping that the furniture strapped to the top of my car wouldn't fall of, and it was always there, at that same spot in the road, that i would feel this effervescent sense of excitement rise up, turning my tiredness into unbounded energy. i looked forward to the whole scene unfolding before me week after week, the big white market tents popping up, rain or shine. the empty street magically turning into a small village. my whole being stood alive taking in the sights, sounds and aromas which were emanating from the lifeblood of this; my new tribe. curtis steiner  would pass through every sunday.... and more than once he would purchase something from me. each time, without fail, it was my favorite find, the beautiful, the odd, the thing i always secretly hoped wouldn't sell so that i could keep it. on that particular sunday he purchased a small primitive stool from me . it was an amazing little piece, a work of art really . it's beauty had been revealed by the ravages of time and the organic unveiling of it's loved on layers layers of red, black, green and blue. i asked him that morning just what did he do with my favorite things. he said " i have a little shop on ballard avenue. you should come down sometime and check it out..... and so i did, very late that very night....and it just so happens that souvenir is right next store to the site of the dineega encounter and once again one thing leads to the other.

about the stories




kiva


from the very first day i walked down this avenue, i felt as though i had been here before. the great dejavu of my life had occurred. no it was nothing remarkable, it was simply clear and certain which in and of itself is actually quite remarkable. in  arriving, i literally felt as though i had walked into a lucid 
dream. everything seemed mysteriously memorable and  deeply familiar. and so it was, i had arrived; strangely somehow home. 

to quote the great joseph campbell, " we all need to tell our story and understand our stories. " 

these stories are just that.
