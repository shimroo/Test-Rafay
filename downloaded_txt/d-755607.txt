southern california wildfires 



now is the time to pull together. 



the wildfires in pacific palisades, altadena and surrounding areas have caused unimaginable damage affecting all of us – our family, friends and communities – in lasting ways. we’ve all been moved by the sacrifice and selfless dedication of so many, including firefighters, other first responders and volunteers. at sycamores, we are shaken, but we are undeterred. our mission remains the same: to serve others and help them create a better life. 






you can help

























we've been serving southern california since 1902, and we're here for good. 





									when individuals are healthy, supported and have a deep-rooted sense of wellbeing, communities flourish. with a focus on under-served populations, sycamores impacts over 18,000 vulnerable children, youth and families in under-served communities with programs, services and support. we believe this starts by giving people exactly what they need, however unique that looks.
