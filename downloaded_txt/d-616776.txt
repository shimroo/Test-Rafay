founded in 1989 foster parrots, ltd. is the largest avian rescue organization in the northeast u.s.a. we are accredited by the global federation of animal sanctuaries and are a founding member of the country’s leading avian advocacy and information organization, the avian welfare coalition. foster parrots has worked collaboratively with organizations like the jane goodall institute, born free usa and world animal protection in our quest to bring assistance to captive parrots who have long suffered the consequences of pet trade exploitation and public misinformation.

 


“for me, the sight of a parrot living alone, living in a cage, deprived of flight, miserably bored, breaks my heart. and the parrot’s too, perhaps.”

—  jane goodall, foster parrots supporter



foster parrots diversity statementa sanctuary is a place of refuge and safety. the new england exotic wildlife sanctuary is a safe haven for both parrots and people! just as we embrace the differences, uniqueness and individual beauty of our birds, we also celebrate those qualities in the humans who so generously invest themselves in the care of our sanctuary residents. foster parrots, ltd. does not tolerate workplace discrimination or harassment based on race, color, gender, gender orientation, sexual orientation, age, marital status, religion or disability.
