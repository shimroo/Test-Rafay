welcome to the nist chemistry webbook

the nist chemistry webbook provides access to
data compiled and distributed by nist under the
standard reference data program.


the nist chemistry webbook contains:



thermochemical data for over 7000 organic and small inorganic
compounds:

enthalpy of formation
enthalpy of combustion
heat capacity 
entropy
phase transition enthalpies and temperatures
vapor pressure


 reaction thermochemistry data for over 8000 reactions.

enthalpy of reaction 
free energy of reaction 


 ir spectra for over 16,000 compounds.

 mass spectra for over 33,000 compounds.

 uv/vis spectra for over 1600 compounds.

gas chromatography data for over 27,000 compounds.

electronic and vibrational spectra for over 5000 compounds.


constants of diatomic molecules (spectroscopic data) for over 600
compounds.

ion energetics data for over 16,000 compounds:

ionization energy
appearance energy
electron affinity
proton affinity
gas basicity
cluster ion binding energies


thermophysical property data for 74 fluids:

density, specific volume
heat capacity at constant pressure (cp)
heat capacity at constant volume (cv)
enthalpy
internal energy
entropy
viscosity
thermal conductivity
joule-thomson coefficient
surface tension (saturation curve only)
sound speed



you can search for data on specific compounds in the chemistry
webbook based on name, chemical formula, cas registry number,
molecular weight, chemical structure, or selected ion energetics
and spectral properties.



nist reserves the right to charge for access to this database in the future.


the national institute of standards and technology (nist) uses
its best efforts to deliver a high quality copy of the database
and to verify that the data contained therein have been selected
on the basis of sound scientific judgment. however, nist makes
no warranties to that effect, and nist shall not be liable for
any damage that may result from errors or omissions in the
database.
