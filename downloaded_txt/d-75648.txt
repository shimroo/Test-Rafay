empowerment in focus: how professional headshots are helping women with justice involvement reclaim their professional identity



oct 31, 2024




finding meaningful work with adequate pay is a challenge for many of us, but particularly for women with justice involvement. "re-entering society after incarceration can be challenging for women, as time incarcerated can significantly impact self-perception,” raquel nicholson, the director of our women’s justice program, acknowledges. there are so many barriers for these women to find employment and associate board president, cassie siskovic, knew she had the resources to help these residents overcome at least one.

the sanctuary model



in recognizing that many of those who come to us for help do so with histories of trauma, providence house utilizes the sanctuary® model, which promotes safety and recovery from adversity through the active creation of a trauma-informed community. this approach allows us to go beyond a simple exchange between “client” and “service provider” and instead creates an emotionally safe and supportive space for residents to heal and grow.
