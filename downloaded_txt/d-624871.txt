trend-setter in innovative regional american cuisine
 
"the #1 restaurant in pasadena"food critic erica wayne of the pasadena weekly


 

a pasadena destinationopening to rave reviews in 1984, the parkway grill has been a powerful force in the regional american culinary movement and at the forefront in bringing trendsetting cuisine to pasadena by specializing in a seasonal, market-driven approach that incorporates diverse influences and classic french technique. thanks to its progressive spirit and innovations like an exhibition kitchen and extensive use of a wood-fired oven, the parkway grill is often referred to as "the spago of pasadena". the design of the parkway grill is a study in casual sophistication, striking a perfect balance between elegance and rustic approachability. the brick walls are adorned with elegant paintings by millard sheets and mixologists prepare hand-crafted cocktails at the expansive bar, an original from 1920's chicago. parkway's award-winning wine cellar, comprised of upwards of three thousand bottles, includes a broad selection of wines served by the glass.

parkway’s innovative chefs have showcased an intriguing array of dishes using locally sourced ingredients. the tiki salad and brick-oven baked cambozola pear flat bread are perennial favorites, and when the sun sets, the trademark lobster crêpes and whole ginger fried catfish take their star turns.



parkway grill's exhibition kitchen features a mesquite burning grill and oakwood burning oven, one of the very first of its kind in los angeles. both are essential in helping create parkway's award-winning american regional cuisine.
