we invite you to stay and relax at our updated bed and breakfast in eastham on cape cod. the inn is in a quiet residential neighborhood, yet central to all the best attractions the outer and lower cape has to offer. walk the ‘outer cape’ beaches listening to the waves lapping on cape cod bay or crashing at the national seashore. enjoy some of the finest dining experiences that the cape has to offer, starting with the famous whalewalk gourmet breakfast.
awaken to the aroma of fresh-brewed coffee, sizzling bacon, one of our many delightful pastry items, fresh fruit, and a different entrée every day. view the gardens on our brick patio under the shade of the pergola, the indoor dining area, or your private balcony space, while enjoying your first meal of the day.
after a full cape cod day of exploring, bicycling, swimming, and shopping, end your afternoon with a visit to the spa and remove any tensions that you brought to the cape with a massage, swim, or workout. book your date and time when you make your room reservations, or enjoy a moment in nature in the gazebo, porch, or from your balcony. enjoy your vacation to the fullest at the whalewalk inn.
the main building at the inn was built in 1830 for henry harding, a renowned whaling captain. in the early nineteen hundreds, it became a gentleman’s farm, known as whalewalk farm, owned by the kent family of pr lorillard tobacco fame. the farm was purchased in 1953 and turned into the well-known bed and breakfast it is today. since that time it has been updated and luxuriously redecorated, with guest comfort in mind, making it one of the best lodging options in the lower cape cod area.
