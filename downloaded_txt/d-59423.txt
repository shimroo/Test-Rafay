area school ranks 42nd on newsweekâs list of countryâs top-250 online colleges

san jacinto college has been recognized as one of americaâs top online colleges for 2025, according to a new study released by newsweek.

published on newsweekâs website and print publications late last year, the ranking placed san jacinto college 42nd out of 250 institutions nationwide to make the list.

california state universityâs online program topped the list.

âonline learning continues to expand in the united states as colleges and other education providers seek to attract students who live outside the immediate area and working adults drawn to the flexibility of online classes. studies suggest online learning has yet to reach its peak and is expected to grow in coming years,â said newsweek editor nancy cooper. âfor those looking to further their knowledge â from individual non-degree courses for the curious or for professional development to a full academic degree â online schools offer customized opportunities to people in all stages of life. with so many choices and no physical location to visit, finding the right program can be challenging.â

san jacinto college chancellor brenda hellyer said the honor validates the area collegeâs commitment to its online program.

âthis recognition from newsweek validates our ongoing commitment to providing accessible, high-quality online education that meets the needs of our diverse student population,â said hellyer. âbeing ranked 42nd among the nationâs top online colleges demonstrates that our investment in digital learning technologies and student support services is helping students complete their higher education credential.â

the ranking was based on a comprehensive evaluation of online education programs across the united states. the assessment considered four key pillars: institutional indicators, rating of experience, overall satisfaction and student recommendations.

rankings were determined through an extensive study involving more than 10,000 individuals who have completed online college degrees in the united states. the evaluation criteria included organization, support, price, reputation, success, recommendation, practical relevance and overall satisfaction with the online learning experience.
      newsweek was assisted by data research firm statista in calculating the studyâs findings.

san jacinto college offers 26 associate degrees and 34 workforce certificates entirely online. students can earn a degree in areas such as computer information technology, health care, global logistics, general studies and business. the collegeâs online programs offer students the flexibility to pursue their educational goals while maintaining work and family commitments, according to college officials.

âthis prestigious recognition reflects the collegeâs commitment to delivering high-quality online education and meeting the evolving needs of todayâs students,â a statement from san jacinto college read.
