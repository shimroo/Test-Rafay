outage type: sewerage - planned


15 jan 2025

sewer relining works 
											

sewer relining works - 

over the next two months, auxiliary crews will be working across ayr to reline several sewer pipes.
											







									sewer relining works - 

over the next two months, auxiliary crews will be working across ayr to reline several sewer pipes.

why is this happening?
sewer relining improves the lifespan of our essential infrastructure, ensuring it remains reliable and efficient for years to come.

what to expect:
•	crews working in various areas around town.
•	minimal disruptions as most work is non-invasive.
•	in some cases, crews may need to enter private property to complete the work. affected property owners will be notified in advance via letter drop.

council appreciates your patience and cooperation as the works are carried out.

for more information, contact council’s customer service centre on (07) 4783 9800.
