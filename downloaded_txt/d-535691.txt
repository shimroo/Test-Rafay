    etc gymnastics where olympic dreams begin
 gymnastics is an excellent sport, from seasoned athletes to very beginners. in gymnastics, your child will learn perseverance, endurance, discipline, and dedication. no matter what level your gymnast aspires to, these skills will travel with them for life. here at etc, we offer gymnastics for children ages 2 to 18 years old. new athletes will begin classes based on age, then progress based on skill level. starting with our dipper program moving through stars, ninja, tumbling, or teams, our experienced instructors follow a customized curriculum designed to work in unison with the proper progressions necessary to grow with the sport.we also offer recreational and competitive usag gymnastics teams. our invitational teams offer various levels of commitment in order to provide a program that works best for your gymnast and family. at both locations we have all stars our recreational team. our smyrna gym hosts our usag xcel team, and our murfreesboro gym hosts our usag developmental program and usag elite program teams. our murfreesboro usag teams are coached by olympic coaches with proven records for success.

  my daughter just started gymnastics here and she loves it. i love it as well. the trainers are really good and i love that you can see your children no matter where they are while sitting in the parents area. great place if you are in the rutherford county area.
