                                        this was the first time i used jane’s roses. since  i don’t live in the area i called with some questions and the owner was just wonderful answering them.  after the arrangement was delivered the recipient sent me a photo.  the orchids were exactly as described and absolutely gorgeous!  the recipient also mentioned that the driver was really nice, when trying to reach them.

i will definitely use jane’s roses again.

                                        ordering from afar, i was delighted to discover jane's roses in my friend's neighborhood instead of going through some outfit in new jersey.  i could relax and trust that what was pictured would be what my friend received, and it was--beautiful, artistic, and fragrant.
