    fairbanks alaska & plan your visit to our great state, we have made available
      here a number of resources. 
fairbanks, alaska is:


fairbanks,
      alaska, 358 miles north of anchorage (by way of the parks highway), likes to think that it (instead of delta) is the end of the
    alaska highway. its central location makes it the focal point for the tiny
    villages scattered throughout the surrounding wilderness, and fairbanks is a staging point
    for north slope villages such as barrow and the oil fields of prudhoe bay. 
      yet, 
      unlike anchorage, it still retains its down home "frontier" feel. 
      it is contained within the north star borough, similar to a county, but 
      which is roughly the size of new jersey!
alaska may be known for its 
      harsh winter climate, but fairbanksans prefer to enjoy their wonderful summers to the fullest while they can. the interior has 
      temperatures ranging from 65 degrees below zero in the winter to 90 
      degrees above in the summer. 
      gardening is big in the interior.

fairbanks is called "the golden heart of alaska," a
    reference to the character of her people as much as to the location in
    alaska's interior, or to the discovery of gold in 1902.
because we are just 188 miles south of the arctic
    circle (above which the sun neither sets during
    the summer solstice, nor rises during the winter solstice) we also have very long summer
    days. the shortest winter day of the year has less than three hours of sunlight, the
    longest (around june 21) never really ends, though officially it has over 21 hours.

we hope that with our site we are able to answer your questions
    about our city, and that you will even consider visiting in the off season, too. many of
    our attractions - the aurora borealis
      (northern lights), dog
    races, etc., cannot be enjoyed in quite the same way in the summer. and besides, winter
    rates are often lower. please take advantage of our search engine to explore 
      this site - it will often make your seach much quicker. it is below the 
      menu on the left.

our state is:
 now known as "the last frontier" but before
    that it was known as 
     "the land of a thousand smokes" due to 
    activity of 140 volcanoes (52 of which have been active since 1760) and
    earthquakes. but
      it is a huge state, with room for a wide variety of landscape, from small waterfalls
    like this one, to huge mountains, flat treeless tundra, hot springs, glaciers, and on and
    on. we cannot do our state justice describing it here, or even showing you pictures. you have
    to experience our state. and much of the fun of the trip is here, in the interior.
