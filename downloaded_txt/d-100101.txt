welcome to guy wolff pottery













since opening my shop in 1971 saying "welcome to wolff pottery" is the first thing i have said to everyone coming through our doors.   the pottery is just 1.1. miles west of bantam center on rt. 202. the house number is 1249 bantam rd. bantam, ct 06750 (for your gps or google maps).finding one's way as a truthful craftsmanover the years the pots i make have taken on different jobs made in different kinds of clays but with every project the over all search has been my interest in understanding what makes old pots so vital, so alive, and so good.
