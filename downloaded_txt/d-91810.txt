blockchain smartphones are the avant-garde devices propelling us into a new era where seamless interaction with web3 apps, next-generation privacy features, and strict security for digital assets has become the norm. these nifty gadgets offer unrivaled privacy and security for our digital assets while unlocking seamless interactions with decentralized applications (dapps). as smartphone industry titans wade into these uncharted waters, a tidal wave of groundbreaking inventions is set to wash over the mobile world.
although each device sports its unique combination of features, they all share a common goal: to emphasize blockchain, crypto, and decentralized applications beyond the capabilities of a standard smartphone. many offer secure self-custody of crypto assets, while some even support running a full bitcoin node or mobile crypto-mining. integration with other crypto projects, like the slotfever casino, is also one of the main unique selling points of the industry, and today we’re going to explore it. let’s jump in to the market overview!
top blockchain smartphones on the market
although blockchain smartphones have yet to conquer the mainstream, a select few have made their mark and won the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. however, remember that blockchain phones follow the principle that you get what you pay for, where more affordable models may not match the advanced features of their high-end counterparts. curated just for you, here’s our roundup of the most notable blockchain smartphones currently available.
the finney phone: a crypto connoisseur’s dream
the sirin labs’ finney phone is a feature-rich device tailored for crypto enthusiasts. it includes a built-in hardware wallet that manages transactions and offers exceptional security for users’ private keys. additionally, it comes with an integrated token conversion tool, enabling effortless swapping between various cryptocurrencies.
priced at $999 on sirin labs’ official website, the finney phone is a tempting option for those seeking to merge the best of blockchain and conventional smartphone technology. for those eager to explore digital currencies, the finney phone offers sirin labs’ “learn and earn” rewards system, allowing users to study specific cryptocurrencies and earn rewards. underneath, it shares similarities with the htc exodus 1, featuring a snapdragon 845 chip, 6gb ram, 128gb storage, and a camera setup with a 12mp rear and 8mp front shooter.
pundi x blok on blok (bob)
the pundi x blok on blok (bob) challenges the status quo, merging modularity with the power of blockchain technology. its distinctive appearance and innovative features make it a fascinating addition to the expanding realm of blockchain smartphones. while the original pundi xphone prototype maintained a familiar design, the upcoming bob edition takes a daring leap into modularity. the bob is a feast for the senses, sporting an array of snap-together attachments, complete with latches and dials.
the bob allows users to toggle between two operating systems as needed; an open-source x os powers the blockchain mode (encompassing all of bob’s decentralized processes), while the android mode offers a familiar experience akin to traditional android-powered devices. interestingly, the company also claims that users won’t require a central service provider for making calls or accessing the internet on the blok on blok.
electroneum m1: the blockchain enthusiast’s pocket-friendly companion
electroneum, primarily known for its versatile software wallet, has boldly ventured into the smartphone arena with its electroneum m1. this device fuses cloud mining prowess with a wallet-friendly appeal. embracing its role as a “cost-conscious android smartphone,” the electroneum m1 proudly sports a price tag below $100. despite this low price tag, it still incorporates 4g capabilities, 8gb storage, and front and rear cameras.
it’s worth noting that certain sacrifices come into play, as with many budget offerings. the m1’s mediocre display and camera quality may not satisfy those accustomed to more premium devices. as such, the electroneum m1 serves as an ideal secondary device for blockchain-curious individuals who prefer not to splurge on a high-end phone.
klaytnphone: a powerhouse collaboration for blockchain enthusiasts
samsung, a household name in the smartphone industry, joined forces with ground x to create the klaytnphone—a flagship blockchain phone operating on the klaytn network. this collaboration gave rise to the klaytnphone, a device that encapsulates the best of both worlds—superior design and innovative blockchain technology wrapped in one sleek package.
at first glance, the klaytnphone bears a striking resemblance to the galaxy note 10 in terms of design. however, the klaytnphone distinguishes itself from its sibling through a suite of web3-centric features. users can effortlessly access various blockchain-driven services, while the klaytnphone’s private key manager ensures top-notch asset security. furthermore, each device comes with a generous bonus of 2,000 free klay tokens, allowing users to dive into the native dapp store and discover a plethora of web3 games and blockchain applications.
solana saga: reigniting the crypto and blockchain hype
the solana saga, a cutting-edge blockchain phone conceived by solana labs and asset management firm osom, has set the stage for a resurgence of interest in blockchain technology within the smartphone domain. built upon the solana blockchain for its web3 functionality, this groundbreaking device boasts several features that cater to the evolving needs of modern users.
among its many standout attributes is the solana mobile stack (sms) software development kit, a web3-first sdk that allows users to tailor their experiences by crafting bespoke tools and apps. the solana saga also has a “seed vault” for secure private key storage, solana pay for qr code payments, a mobile wallet adapter, and a dedicated dapp store.
slated for launch in early 2023, with shipping set to commence soon after, the solana saga aspires to invigorate the solana ecosystem and inspire smartphone users to embrace the web3 revolution at approximately $1000.
htc desire 22 pro: affordable metaverse access in the palm of your hand
the htc desire 22 pro, a mid-range crypto phone from the creators of the groundbreaking exodus 1, offers affordability and virtual reality capabilities. users can enjoy an immersive metaverse experience through the innovative viverse ecosystem by streaming content to the vive flow headset.
the desire 22 pro provides secure vive wallets for storing digital assets like nfts, cryptocurrencies, and crypto-powered vive marketplaces. this captivating device, launched on august 1, 2022, and retailing at around $400, brings the exciting world of metaverse and crypto within reach for many.

htc exodus 1 – the original blockchain phone
since its launch in late 2019, the htc exodus 1 has gained popularity, thanks in part to htc’s established reputation in the smartphone industry. the device’s success can also be attributed to its unique features, such as the built-in hardware wallet and private vault called zion. this secure component within the phone stores users’ private keys for various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, and erc-20 and erc-721 tokens.
zion’s trusted execution environment (tee) adds another level of security by conducting and signing transactions in an isolated area, protecting against malware. the exodus 1 also offers a sharp 6″ quad hd+ screen, a powerful snapdragon 845 processor, a high-quality dual-lens rear camera, and a 3,500mah battery.
htc has introduced two successors: the exodus 1s and exodus 1 – binance edition. each version offers unique features and pricing, with the binance edition catering to crypto enthusiasts with native support for binance’s decentralized exchange and chain. at the same time, the exodus 1s allows running a full bitcoin node from an sd card.
the future of blockchain phones
blockchain phones are transforming the way we engage with blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies. gone are the days of envisioning colossal, power-hungry mining rigs as the sole means of participating in blockchain consensus. today, battery-operated handheld devices bring crypto mining right into the palms of our hands, lowering the barrier of entry to the crypto sphere. with over 80% of adults worldwide owning or regularly using a smartphone, the surging popularity of web3 technologies implies that blockchain phones could play a significant role in introducing crypto to millions of people in the coming years.

space heaters – an essential for offices and gaming rooms





								post author

july 4, 2022













a small space heater allows you to thoroughly heat a space, and the objects in it, with ease. you will, by reading this guide, learn how much electricity a small space heater uses, and how to reduce this electricity usage.
what is a small space heater?
a space heater is a heater that’s used to heat up small and medium-sized spaces. rather than being large and cumbersome, space heaters tend to be light and portable. given this fact, a small space heater is a device specifically used to heat small spaces. just like a regular space heater, a small space heater is portable. this makes it easy for you to bring the heater into other small spaces.
what can you do with a small space heater?
small space heaters offer anywhere from 200 to 600 watts of power. you can use this power to thoroughly heat a space that is around 50 square-feet. one of the most common uses we see nowadays are within the gaming industry, where players who want to keep hands warm while gaming usually employ small heaters around their station. heating larger spaces, while possible, can be challenging.
some examples of spaces that are within the 50 square-feet range include:

a personal office
bathroom
small bedroom
studio apartment living room
dedicated gaming room

each one of these spaces can be thoroughly heated with a small space heater.
how does a space heater work?
right before we dive into this question, there are two primary types of space heaters to be aware of. the two types of space heater are:

infrared space heater
convection space heater

you can use an infrared space heater to heat objects – a bed or desk, for example – as well as people, such as yourself. but, you can’t use an infrared heater to heat every inch of a space. you can use a convection space heater to heat the air within this space. this allows every inch within a space to receive this heat and to, in turn, warm up considerably. no matter the space heater you choose, you will have access to several heat settings. each one of these settings determines the number of watts the heater is using and the heat it produces.
selecting a higher heat setting will use more watts and, in turn, more electricity. selecting a lower heat setting will use fewer watts and, as you might expect, less electricity.
how much electricity does a small space heater use?
small space heaters tend to offer around 200 to 600 watts of electricity. you can select a particular heat setting and, in doing so, determine the number of watts the heater uses per-hour.
just as an example, let’s say you turn your small space heater to 600 watts. doing so means that your space heater will use 600 watts of electricity, every single hour it is running.
since electric companies charge by kilowatts, and since 1000 watts is 1 kilowatt, we can turn that 600 watts into 0.6-kilowatts. let’s say you run your small space heater at 600 watts, for 50 hours, throughout the month. you can multiply 0.6 kilowatts by 50, which is 30 kilowatts. right after doing so, you can take your electric rate and find out how much 1 kilowatt costs. you can then multiply that cost by the number of kilowatts your small space heater has consumed.
what is the best way to reduce the cost of running a small space heater?
to reduce the cost of running a small space heater, you can:

purchase a space heater with energy-efficient features
wear warm, cozy clothing
make use of the 10w-per-square-foot principle

the last one is the most useful.
every square-foot, within a space, equates to roughly 10 watts of power.
since this is the case, if your bedroom is 40 square-feet, you can set your space heater to 400 watts. by doing so, you will be able to heat the objects within the space/the space in its entirety.
or, like linus, just build a dedicated gaming pc that can act as a heater, that is also a solution:

conclusion
no matter the small space heater you use, as long as you select the appropriate wattage and take electricity-reducing measures, your electricity bill will remain low.

how to surf the web on a ps5





								post author							
 

							by dmg webmaster 




								post date							
 

february 27, 2022













at this point in time, sony isn’t offering a web browsing app on the ps5. unlike other console releases that the company has had, the app doesn’t come standard, and there is no option to download an app from the playstation network, or psn. for many people, this seems to be a warning that the system isn’t able to be modified or jailbroken.
however, this simply wasn’t the case. a web browser is able to be accessed on the ps5, and you just have to know how to do it. esportsheadlines.com gave us a basic understanding on how to access the internet browser on ps5, and today we’re going to show you our twist on the method.

accessing a web browser on the ps5
the below steps are going to explain to ps5 users how a web browser can be accessed, even without an official application. this will enable access to websites across the internet.
step 1: access the settings menu
this is going to be located at the top left of the ps5’s home screen.
step 2: locate and open the user’s guide
the user’s guide is located under the user’s guide, health and safety, and other information section in the settings menu.
the user’s guide is a web page that users are taken to in a web browser. however, the application that opens the user’s guide doesn’t allow users to navigate to other web pages.
step 3: navigate to the playstation.com/help hyperlink
this hyperlink takes you to playstation’s help website. on the website, you’ll find several different links.
step 4: select any one of the 6 links below the search bar
any one of these links should work. each of the links leads to another help section web page that has a youtube video embedded into it.
step 5: play the youtube video, and travel to the youtube website
when the youtube video begins to play, a link will appear in the bottom right corner of the video, allowing you to travel to the main youtube website when clicked. youtube will ask you to sign in, which you can ignore. however, you do have to agree to their service terms and conditions.
step 6: click the “share” button on the youtube video and “share to reddit”
by sharing the video to reddit, the browser will redirect you to reddit’s website. you’ll be asked to login to reddit. when doing so, select the “continue with google” option that you are given.
step 7: select the privacy hyperlink at the bottom of the page
when you’re redirected to the google sign-in page, there will be links at the bottom of the page. select the link labeled privacy.
step 8: select the google privacy and terms link in the top left corner of the page
the privacy hyperlink navigates you to google’s privacy and terms page. the next step is to navigate to the privacy and terms homepage by clicking the logo/ link in the top left corner of the page.
step 9: click the link to google at the bottom of the page
at the bottom of google’s privacy and terms homepage, there will be a hyperlink labeled google. clicking this link takes you to the google homepage.
step 10: use the google search box to navigate to other websites
by searching for websites using google, you’ll be able to travel to them. the browser will function similarly to a web browser application, with the exception of the fact that you can’t use the address bar.
things to remember
this is not the official playstation 5 web browser app. as such, you cannot navigate to any website you’d like by typing it in. instead, the process requires you to navigate the links above and then use google to search for the websites you’d like to visit.
on the other hand, this also means that you have to navigate back to google to be able to visit a new website if you plan to. it may be a good idea to search for specific web pages within the website you’re visiting, especially if you don’t plan on spending a lot of time on the web page. then, to get back to google, you’ll have to go through the same steps listed above.
does sony plan on releasing an official web browser app for the ps5?
if the system settings indicate anything, then an official web browser app is in the cards for the ps5. under the menu titled system, there is an option that toggles settings for the web browser. as such, it’s likely that a native web browser is being developed.

steam deck competitors: which one will remain standing post-release?





								post author							
 

							by dmg webmaster 




								post date							
 

january 29, 2022













handheld pc. a name that is typically used to refer to portable gaming consoles with complete desktop operating systems. valve’s steam deck is just but one of them, a single entity among the many models already out there. every one of them has a single mission:
provide a technologically superior option to the aging nintendo switch.
naturally, due to their similar objectives, competition is inevitable. would the steam deck prevail against them? let’s go through some of the top contenders available now and in the near future.
level of competition we are looking for
anything that comes near or over the steam deck’s theoretical performance is, of course, an instant inclusion. more specifically, though, a worthy-ish steam deck contender might have one or more of the following things:

operating system usability, not just in usage but in types as well.
heavy promotion of a particular (reasonable) game type specialty
superior ergonomics can dictate the long-term use aspect of a handheld pc.
if availability and price make a specific model significantly more accessible.
unique product features might make it more interesting to buy regardless of specs.
cooling system serviceability. good heat dissipation is a requirement, not a feature.
storage upgrades, ideally like the steam deck sd card.

 
steam deck best potential competitors overview

gpd win max 2021
aya neo next (pro)
onexplayer 1s

gpd win max 2021



display
8-inch 1280×800 ips touchscreen


cpu
ryzen 7 4800u or core i7-1195g7


gpu
radeon vega 8cu, iris xe g7 96eu


ram
16gb lpddr4x 4266mhz


storage
1tb nvme ssd



gdp is technically one of the earliest within the handheld pc gaming space, introducing products such as the very first gdp win in 2016. with the competition now in full swing, newer models of its lineup needed to keep up with the times. incorporating the ryzen 4000 mobile and intel tiger lake was a significant step towards this, making the portable machines game-worthy for 720p gaming at stable frame rates and doubling as an entirely usable laptop.
yes, laptop. unlike other models that opted for a complete gaming console look, gpd kept the clamshell design, putting gamepad controls at the upper end of the keyboard and behind its chassis. as a result, it is less ergonomic but somewhat more functional. moreover, it immediately puts a unique factor on it that could help make it still somewhat worth getting despite the “monstrous” performance of the steam deck’s upcoming rdna2-igpu based custom apu.
 
 
onexplayer 1s



display
8.4-inch 2560×1600 ips touchscreen


cpu
up to ryzen 7 5700u or core i7-1195g7


gpu
radeon vega 8cu, iris xe g& 96eu


ram
16gb lpddr4x 4266mhz


storage
2tb nvme ssd



onexplayer’s main weakness as a product is that it has constantly been introduced far more as an enthusiast item than the already-exclusive packages of other handheld pcs. sure, it may have impressive specs. but at a price that would already cost you a complete entry-level desktop in the tumultuous tech year of 2021, it was consistently a hard sell for people who want a simple pocket machine to pass the time.
that being said, this premium spec specialty may just be what it needs to keep its relevance even as the steam deck arrives. the latest onexplayer 1s maintains its whopping 8.4-inch 2560×1600 ips touchscreen, making it one of only two contenders sporting anything higher than 800p. so, on the one hand, you have the option to render in stunning qhd for less intensive titles. and at the other hand, you can combine its ergonomics to create a practically functional handheld office.
aya neo next (pro)



display
7-inch 1280×800 ips touchscreen


cpu
ryzen 7 5825u


gpu
radeon vega 8cu


ram
16gb lpddr4x 4266mhz


storage
2tb nvme ssd



unlike gpd, which leaned more on experimentation and planning when launching its first few products, the aya neo splashed into the already thriving handheld pc market with pure performance in mind. as a result, the first aya neo started with a relatively modest ryzen 5 4500u apu, which is good enough. still, it was more intended to balance efficiency, making cooling and prolonging battery life (to acceptable levels) more manageable on the design.
here comes the potential problem. its aesthetics leans hard on the simple pull-out console design. meaning it will clash directly with the steam deck. the ryzen 7 5825u is a fantastic gaming apu, an emulation machine with its ryzen 5000 architecture. but without substantial price cuts or other upgrades such as a battery life boost, the steam deck will make future post-release purchases of this product seem like an instant waste.
bonus: aya neo next rdna2 version – the mythical “razer deck”
hands down, the single most significant factor to the steam deck’s upcoming dominance over all other previously released handheld pcs is the use of its rdna2-based integrated graphics. while vega-based igpus have consistently proven the viability of 750 ti-like performance in a small form factor, the next zen 3+ processors are set to amp it up further, possibly introducing the first mobile devices with 1050 ti-like performance.
a future version of the aya neo next, recently confirmed through a blog post, might also sport a similar rdna2-based apu. if the deal with amd is approved, it would be a worthy blow-per-blow challenge to the steam deck. the fabled “razer deck,” a joint project of qualcomm and razer, evades the issue of hardware limitations entirely through the use of updated cloud and local hosting technologies. this, too, should prove to be a formidable contender for valve’s “nintendo switch killer.”

review: sandisk extreme portable ssd 4 tb

december 19, 2021













although the price still needs some adjustment, ssd’s have finally pushed out the traditional hard drives out of the market. sure, you can still find them in cheap laptops and some prebuilt pc configurations, but most, if not all mid-range devices feature at least 256 gb of pure solid state drive technology. the trouble, though, is not internal, but rather external.
sure, there are some great options for 512 gb, 1 tb and even 2 tb external ssd drives, the samsung t5 being one of them, but past that you’ll soon hit a wall because there just aren’t that many high capacity external ssd drives out there.
you could build your own external ssd, we wrote about it just a couple of weeks ago, but the truth is that a diy solution can’t compete with a complete product in terms of water, dust and damage resistance, as well as craftsmanship and warranty. luckily, sandisk came out with their newest extreme portable ssd series, so if you’re an enthusiast who needs 4 tb of storage, this review will surely interest you. let’s jump right in to it!

what does my isp see when i use a vpn?





								post author

when you use a virtual private network to obfuscate your web communications, your internet service provider is the first party that could feasibly pick up on what you’re doing. in theory. in practice, it might not even know what’s going on in the first place. more importantly, it likely isn’t in a hurry to find out.
let’s underline that notion with some practical advice before getting into any more what-ifs: read your isp’s privacy policy and you should have an exact answer regarding what kind of user data they’re logging and looking for, in general. alright, maybe that’s not going to happen because nobody has that much time on their hands, but at least make your google search queries company-specific if you want concrete answers concerning particular isps.
why your isp might know much less than you fear
yes, an isp could probably see that you’re using a vpn, assuming it actually cared enough to look. *actually* look to see whether the public ip address assigned to your household is behaving in a way that corresponds to your usage patterns. it’s likely not doing that, though. as that would require spending money in order to produce results that can’t be monetized en masse. or at all, depending on how cynical you are.
here’s the thing, though: the fact that many of us *are* cynical when it comes to our isp’s intentions and willingness to act in good faith is precisely why we probably shouldn’t be worried about whether they’re going to any lengths to snoop on us. the u.s. is already among the most expensive countries in the world when it comes to the cost of broadband internet access. and its irregular population density means that anyone not living in the suburbs or big cities probably receives horrible service relative to how much that service costs because regional monopolies are a thing, whether the fcc is feigning otherwise or not.
in effect, the isps became much more strategic about when to push consumers’ gears. privacy is a big issue these days, sure. but because of digital advertising behemoths such as google and facebook, not 20th-century telecoms struggling to grapple with this new reality. if this was 2005, you could at least argue there’s no way of telling whether or not your isp stores detailed browsing history logs of every individual user. today, we know they don’t – they can’t, owing to the fact that ssl is everywhere.
and the main reason ssl is everywhere because google search started penalizing websites that don’t use https. you’d think google would be fine with the world not using cutting-edge cryptography to secure bank transactions and searches for “funny cat videos” as equals. but google already knew what you were doing and where your queries were directing you thanks to your reliance on gmail, chrome, or any other out of a dozen or so “free” and widely popular services it’s managing. the aggressive ssl adoption primarily crippled isps with data-harvesting ambitions – it’s not like they could afford to protest much in public.
that would be the gist of why most isps don’t go to great lengths to keep logs of user traffic. plus, storing that information costs money so until they figure out how to make us pay for those logs, they’ll do their best to avoid upsetting shareholders with any unnecessary expenses. so, assuming you use any vpn, at all, your browsing history is at the very least safe from the prying eyes of your isp.

what is a ddos attack and why do they still work?





								post author							
 

							by dominik bosnjak 




								post date							
 

december 18, 2021













in a broad sense, a distributed denial of service (ddos) is a cyber attack that leverages a botnet consisting of many different devices in order to overwhelm the target with bogus requests and consequently make it unresponsive to legitimate ones.
but as is the case with most attack vectors that are commonly encountered nowadays, the devil is in the detail. meaning there’s an overwhelming amount of variety to ddos attacks, whereas new techniques and phenomena are recorded on an almost daily basis.
so, while this article will cover all the bases in order to serve as a good starting point for learning about ddos attacks, no singular source will teach you everything there is to know about the subject matter at hand. this the case with most cybersecurity topics, though. so you’d do well to try staying up to date if you have more than a passing interest in distributed-denial-of-service attacks.
is there a non-distributed denial-of-service attack?
kind of, as cybersecurity researchers generally divide dos attacks into three broad categories: advanced persistent dos attacks, application layer dos attacks, and distributed dos attacks we’re examining in detail herein. note that the only underlying logic to this division is the incidence of a given technique archetype. otherwise, a ddos is defined by its attacker, an aldos (more commonly referred to as a layer 7 dos) by its target, and an apdos by the attacker’s prep work.
if you dig deeper, you’ll even find mentions of protocol attacks (defined by their targets) and volume-based attacks defined by their strategy, degradation-of-service attacks defined by… ok, you get the picture. in practice, there’s a lot of overlap between all of those definitions. as with many other topics related to hacking, most ddos knowledge doesn’t fit neatly into any given definition. primarily because it evolves too fast for typical definitions to keep up.
why do ddos attacks still work after 25+ years?
according to a late 2004 edition of the internet protocol journal, the world’s first ddos attack was carried out a quarter of a century ago, in september of ‘96. its target was new york-based panix, the third-oldest isp on the planet.
as for its technique, the so-called syn flood, it was pretty primitive relative to contemporary solutions. it essentially came down to several hundred (or perhaps just dozens of) clients sending connection requests without waiting for a response. in a pre-dsl world, that was all it took to bring down some network systems.
yet ddos attacks have only been gaining momentum in the meantime. due to that persistent trend, the record for history’s largest ddos attack is often broken several times in a given calendar year. and the overall annual volume of such hacks is currently close to doubling, according to a 2020 cybersecurity report from neustar.
therefore, asking why do ddos attacks still work is hardly the central question right now. since from a pure numbers perspective, you could argue that they are working better than ever. the key to their longevity is twofold: the issue comes down to the extremely broad definition of what constitutes a ddos attack in the first place and the fact that you can’t really make a typical network completely invulnerable to such shenanigans.
another important factor contributing to the persistence of ddos attacks is their accessibility. because launching a primitive syn flood or something of the sort can be as easy as downloading a few scripts. provided you know what you’re looking for, that is. the general availability of exploits revolving around low-level ddos vectors is arguably the sole reason why the term “script kiddie” even exists.
one final thing illustrating how easily achievable ddos attacks are is the fact that they can even be accidental. if a piece from some obscure website suddenly goes viral on social media or a content aggregator such as reddit, there’s always the possibility of its servers getting a so-called “hug of death”.
they can consequently begin denying service requests because they’re overwhelmed with legitimate traffic. even an unsuccessful ddos attack, intentional or not, has the potential to significantly slow down a given website or online app.
there’s no such thing as ddos prevention – only mitigation
since it’s not economically feasible to make any given server completely invulnerable to ddos attacks, guarding against them comes down to mitigation techniques focused on risk management. most of those are focused on identifying suspect traffic patterns, i.e. requests not made by humans.
in other words, you have ddos attacks to thank for those annoying captchas existing. and while manual ddos defense mechanisms were also a thing in the past, botnets and other bogus traffic sources have gotten so sophisticated that contemporary ddos mitigation solutions are pretty much exclusively cloud-based and automated.
does a vpn prevent ddos attacks?
yes, a virtual private network can protect you against most types of ddos attacks. in fact, that’s the main reason we’re digging deeper into this subject matter in the first place. at this point, you should at least have a vague idea of what ddos attacks are and how they happen. now, if we add a vpn to the equation… well, everything falls apart from an attacker’s perspective.
without the ability to resolve your true ip address, the attacker is unable to target your smartphone, tablet, pc, or whatever it is you’re using to access the internet. meaning your actual machine cannot be added to their botnet.
worst-case scenario, your vpn server or proxy will fall prey to the attacker’s methods, which usually won’t affect you beyond making your connection unresponsive for a couple of seconds. until the intermediary obfuscating your ip address automatically reconnects you to an unaffected server node, that is.
if you really want to get technical, the actual worst-case scenario is that you have to do that manually. if you don’t, companies will usually advertise that feature as “ddos protection” or something of the sort.
even the very possibility of your vpn falling victim to a ddos attack is a stretch because most service providers nowadays will usually have much more robust anti-ddos protections in place than the average netizen. being targeted by ddos attacks is a much more realistic threat to modern vpns than having their infrastructure absorbed into a botnet meant to power ddos attacks.
now, there is one notable exception to this – if a hacker already knows your real ip address because they obtained it before you established a secure internet connection. not even a triple vpn will help you in that case. and your only bet is to get a new ip address – not from your vpn provider, but your isp. most support dynamic ips these days, so that shouldn’t be a problem.
regardless, if you suspect you’re a target of a ddos attack, with or without a vpn, consult with applicable local regulations. because such cyber attacks at the very least constitute harassment in most parts of the world and are hence illegal.

amd surpasses own 2014 pledge to make 25x faster laptop chips





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

march 27, 2021













six years ago, advanced micro devices inc. (amd) publicly pledged to spearhead the next major evolution in mobile processing, stating that it will improve mobile cpu speeds by a factor of 25 come 2020.
six years later, the company not only delivered on that promise but actually surpassed it by a considerable margin, with its latest ryzen 7 4800h cpu outperforming the original baseline approximately 31.7 times, as per amd’s laboratory testing. which still leaves plenty of wiggle room for this promise to have also been fulfilled in real-world usage scenarios. most notably gaming, one of amd’s core focus points since forever.
as expected, this achievement is largely based on amd’s no-compromise commitment to techonological integration instead of a bling pursuit of clock speeds or some other arbitrary metric. this state of affairs is reflected in the fact that every new generation of amd cpuis isn’t just faster and more powerful, overall, but also significantly more energy-efficient.
of course, it bears reminding that this r&d strategy is hardly unique to amd.; its long-time rival, intel, has been practicing pretty much the same philosophy since it became a serious player in the silicon industry. if anythiong, it would be impressive to consistently move to tinier process nodes without delivering both efficiency and processing prowess improvements.

samsung removes ads from its applications





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

march 26, 2021













many people are annoyed by those pesky ads showing every time to open some (or better to say – most) applications. however, there is a difference in delivering them, so while some show from time to time, other applications show them each time we click something. some users are so frustrated that they decide to delete the whole application! so samsung, as one of the leaders in the global application market, decided to stop this practice.
earlier this month, this company confirmed it would remove ads from its primary, pre-installed applications like samsung weather, samsung themes and samsung pay. this news came from south korea, and for now, it is not exactly clear if this practice will take place only in this country or globally. ads are supposed to be removed by one ui software updates, but it is still unknown if they will happen gradually or in the next big update.
android operating system often pushes annoying ads after the user downloads some application from the google play application store, and sometimes overloaded web pages look even more messy and annoying. however, there are android hacks that can help you remove those ads and let you wander through the wilderness of the internet more freely and carelessly.
later this year
many things are still not clear with this news, so the exact date. however, some information says everything will be ready by the end of the year. one source from samsung stated for the newspapers: ‘our priority is to deliver innovative mobile experiences for our consumers based on their needs and wants. we value feedback from our users and continue our commitment to provide them with the best possible experience from our galaxy products and services. therefore, the update will be ready by later this year.’
enjoyable experience
since samsung is one of the core players in the gadget market, its decisions can make a difference in our lives and influence other global players in this field. the company decided that users’ enjoyable experience is more valuable than the money earned from ads.
this change will be an excellent step for most of samsung’s popular applications since it will make it much easier to use them. nobody will have to make anything shady to get rid of ads or switch to other, similar applications with the same functionality. the phone’s essential apps will look clean and neat and will function well.
win-win option
this shocking announcement seems like a win-win option both for the company and its users. we have already noted what it will bring to users, but how will it help samsung itself?! even though this is still a huge company, things are not goldy as before. for example, xiaomi, a chinese smartphone manufacturer, has been eating a considerable part of samsung’s business, and this brand has already pushed ads from most of their primary applications. also, samsung has already put a lot of effort into a more extended software update policy, meaning most of its gadgets should last longer, plus frequent security updates. the company decided to fight, and all this seems like an excellent way to go!

oculus quest 2 system apps updated with 90hz support





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

march 25, 2021













oculus began rolling out a new update to the oculus quest 2 firmware that enables a variety of new features, introduces some key changes, and fixes a bunch of other stuff at once.
at the front and center of this software upgrade is system-wide support for 90hz refresh rates which should deliver a substantial improvement to the overall user experience associated with the vr headset. the gadget technically supported 90hz rendering from day one, but that was not the case for all of its system apps such as expore, store, browser, and oculus tv.
in fact, facebook’s subsidiary was rather coy in talking about this feature prior to the headset’s october release, so this is more like them making good on their original promise instead of introducing a completely new functionality to the quest 2. some of the games that support 90hz vr displays include superhot, beat saber, job simulator, echo vr, space pirate trainer, and racket: nx.
more such titles are promised to follow in the very near future as developers are still scrambling to update their games with 90hz support. in the meantime, oculus link has been updated to allow for switching across 72hz, 80hz, and 90hz mode directly from your windows pc, depending on the exact level of performance your rig allows for.

samsung joins google’s android enterprise portfolio with smartphones and tablets alike





								post author

								post date							
 

march 23, 2021













samsung has been holding out on google’s android enterprise recommended program for years, but it has finally agreed to join the said ecosystem with a wide array of both smartphones and tablets alike. the two companies announced the move in a prepared statement published just moments ago.
this is arguably the biggest expansion of the android enterprise recommended initiative since its inception. as it covers pretty much every galaxy-branded device that is running android 11 or will be running android 11 in the future. some of those include the galaxy s20, galaxy s20+, galaxy note 20 ultra, and the galaxy xcover pro 4, as well as higher-end tablets such as the galaxy tab s7 and tab s7+.
for clarity, “android 11” in the context of samsung devices means one ui 3.0 and above, as that is how samsung is calling its own implementation of what’s otherwise a largely (but not entirely) open-source operating system for mobile devices and iot offerings. following this expansion, enterprise customers will have even more options when it comes to choosing devices that they can deploy at a large scale in order to support their employees.
meaning all of the aforementioned samsung products will be managable using existing g suite tools for administrators.

zepp z is a stylish smartwatch you can afford

march 20, 2021













chinese digital health company zepp announced several new wearables earlier today, with the star of its online product event being the zepp z, a sleek-looking smartwatch that punches way above its weight in terms of both functionality and design.
at $349.99, this device is advertised as a modern smartwatch that you can afford
with the focus of its user interface and capabilities being managing and keep track of one’s health in a convenient manner.
to do that, the zepp z will depend on your ability to pair it with a smartphone, but the good news is that it works with pretty much any such device that you are likely to be using as your daily driver. it features an always-on display that, paired with some of its first-party watchface designs, will make it a rather inconspicuous device that you can’t really tell apart from a traditional timepiece unless you know what you are looking for.
that’s largely due to its high-fidelity, 326ppi display capable of reproducing 100% of the ntsc wide-spectrum color gamut that can easily play the role of a mechanical watch. the device is already available for pre-orders as of today and will start shipping to u.s. customers by early december.

best buy prematurely reveals dji mini 2 u.s. release date





								post author

								post date							
 

march 18, 2021













in what appears to be another example of a retail listing gaffe, best buy appears to have revealed the u.s. release date for the much-anticipated dji mini 2 drone, a device that promises to offer a rather praiseworthy combination of form, function, and pricing.
according to a fresh pair of reports citing carefree best buy employees who are just trying to enjoy life and offer a stellar customer service in the process of doing so, the dji mini 2 is pegged to hit the united states next week. that fateful day is said to be the 4th of november, which falls on next wednesday.
so, here you go: that is the all-but-guaranteed release date of the next mainstream remote aircraft from the industry’s long-term leader. the chinese company has been mum on the subject of a new mini drone being in the works, but given the amount of pretty official-looking press renders and screenshots of email correspondances with multiple super-forthcoming best buy reps, even if the dji mini 2 doesn’t end up launching next week, its official unveiling certainly appears to be imminent.
which is understandable as despite the likely logistical issues dji has been dealing with throughout 2020, much like every other consumer tech company on the planet, not putting out an attention-grabbing product in time for the shopping-intensive holiday season in the world’s largest market for premium gadgets – the u.s. – would constitute a pretty devastating end to the calendar year.
and that is really saying something this time around, so we have no doubt that dji will do everything it can to launch the mini 2 in the u.s. asap.

new canon ai cameras are so sensitive to light that we suspect alcoholism





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

march 18, 2021













canon’s latest mirrorless flagship that costs nearly $4,000 – the eos r5 – has a maximum native iso sensitvity of 51,200. not bad, right? well, depending on your point of reference, as illustrated by the company’s newly announced range of artificial intelligence cameras optimized for recording footage in the absolute worst of all photography scenarios – those devoid of any significantly sizable light sources.
enter the canon ml-100 and the canon ml-105 which aim to quite literally test the limits of physics with their ultra-sensitive cmos sensors offering a bafflingly high level of sensitivity to light amounting to iso 4,500,000. these impressive models, each available in configurations for two of canon’s mounts for a total of four possible combinations, leverage machine learning algorithms with extremely photon-sensitive sensor cores in order to raise the bar in log-light photography.
well, in a general sense of that word, mind you, as this kind of specialized hardware is naturally intended for industrial use alongside thermal imaging equipment and similar tech your average photography enthusiasts probably can’t afford while still maintaining ownership over any other property.
as such, it is no wonder that canon isn’t publicizing any specific price tags to go alongside this military-grade equipment.

how to configure dmz on your router





								post author							
 

							by dominik bosnjak 




								post date							
 

march 12, 2021








a dmz (demilitarized zone) on a home router refers to a dmz host. strictly speaking, this is not a true dmz. a home router dmz host is a host on the internal network that has all udp and tcp ports open and exposed, except those ports otherwise forwarded. they are often used a simple method to forward all ports to another firewall/nat device.
 
how to configure dmz host
step 1: login to the management page
open the web browser and type the ip address of the device in the address bar (default is 192.168.1.1/192.168.0.1/192.168.0.254). press enter.
the default username and password are both admin. click ok to log into the device.
step 2: configure the dmz
for wireless routers and 3g routers (green gui)
click: forwarding > dmz > enable/disable. input the ip of host device (here takes 192.168.0.100 as example), then click save.

 
for wireless routers and 3g routers (blue gui)
click advanced > forwarding > dmz > enable/disable. input the ip of the host device (here takes 192.168.0.100 as example), then click save.

step 3:  restart your router for the changes to take effect.
 
for adsl routers
 
blue gui
click:  forwarding > dmz > enable/disable. input the ip of the host device (here takes 192.168.1.100 as example), then click save.

orange gui
click advanced setup > nat > dmz > enable/disable. input the ip of the host device (here takes 192.168.1.100 as example), then click save.


note: power cycle/reboot your router for you settings to take effect.

lenovo amid first ryzen 9 4900h adopters with legion slim 7





								post author

								post date							
 

march 5, 2021













not long after amd took the wraps off its ryzen 9 4900h, mathematically the most powerful mobile central processing unit ever created, chinese laptop maker lenovo jumped on the first opportunity to leverage this impressive silicon.
in fact, it ended up being one of the first companies to do so. which brings us to today’s announcement of the legion slim 7, lenovo’s latest windows 10 laptop catering specifically to aficionados of video games. besides the powerful amd processor in question, lenovo’s newest ultrabook also features the nvidia geforce rtx 2060, a max-q design gpu allowing for real-time ray-tracing on the go.
interestingly, the company opted against using the second-generation ray-tracing gpus from nvidia which just got announced several weeks ago under the rtx 30 series brand. that is most likely a result of recent shortages, however, and not an outright technological or product design decision.
anyway, this 15-inch gaming powerhouse will be available for purchase in the united states in just a few days’ time, with its official release window being late october. it will start at approximately $1,369.99, according to lenovo’s msrp information, so better start saving if you’re hoping to pick up one of the top configurations, though this introductory price isn’t that steep relative to the competition.

new razer mouse boasts an 8,000hz polling rate





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

march 1, 2021













razer’s latest gaming mouse, the viper 8khz, will ping your pc 8,000 times per second in an effort to deliver a truly lag-free experience.
is this a gimmick, or something that will make a real difference?
razer’s patented hyperpolling technology is what enables this level of control precision. at 8,000hz, the razer viper 8khz surpasses the response frequency of an average gaming mouse by a factor of eight. razer claims this will translate to an eightfold improvement in terms of input delay, down to one-eighth of a millisecond (0.125ms). granted, that might not make a huge difference at the silver iv tier of cs: go. but that shouldn’t matter, since the viper 8khz is targeted at the highest echelons of competitive gaming where even the smallest advantages can mean the difference between victory and defeat.
u.s. consumers can already purchase the razer viper 8khz – either directly from the company or one of its authorized resellers. the cutting-edge gaming mouse is priced at $79.99. you’ll be able to fine-tune its performance and rgb profiles via the razer synapse 3 app, as is the case with every other contemporary razer peripheral. assuming this product launch is a success, the viper 8khz likely won’t be the last mouse with hyperpolling support that razer releases.

unity ditches openvr support in surprising snub to valve





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

february 26, 2021













one of today’s most popular game engines, unity, is ditching support for openvr in a surprising snub to steam creators at valve. the company announced the move earlier today, clarifying that it will also be ending support for samsung’s gearvr and google’s daydream virtual reality platform as part of the same decision aimed at improving its operating efficiency.
valve already confirmed it is working on a replacement for unity’s lack of official support for its platform that wasn’t expected to affect openvr seeing how that particular technology ecosystem is still in active development and hasn’t been effectively abandoned by its creators like daydream and gearvr were. for reference, openvr is the same technology that powers steamvr, one of today’s most widely used vr apis and a direct rival of facebook’s oculus solutions.
the decision appears to have been rooted in technical reasons, however, as unity has so far offered support for the aforementioned vr systems through a plugin system that has since been abandoned in favor of more universal support for extended reality headgear. none of the older tech really fits the bill and so unity technologies is pulling the plug on them altogether, leaving valve to figure out how to extend the support moving forward.

google’s tilt brush just got ported to ps vr

february 20, 2021













tilt brush, google’s award-winning tool for creating works of art in a virtually real environment, is finally available on the playstation vr platform – and ps4, by extent – as of today. google and playstation said this port is something fans of both companies have been clamoring for years.
they did not, however, reveal what made them finally pull the plug on the porting project right now, i.e. why haven’t they done so much sooner. regardless, tilt brush is now here for everyone to download and enjoy for a one-time fee of $22.99. this is the same price attached to the pc version of the app. and in case you don’t have a psvr setup ready to go, then a new ps move motion controller two-pack & tilt brush bundle are here to facilitate your entry point into the world of vr art.
furthermore, if the pc platform is anything to go by, expect tilt brush to be regularly available on the ps store at a discount. apart from a psvr headset and two ps move motion controllers, the app also requires a ps camera, and a ps4 console, ideally the ps4 pro in order to function properly, though it should also be supported by the upcoming ps5.

gopro hero9 black debuts as the cheapest mainstream 5k camera in the u.s.





								post author

								post date							
 

february 17, 2021













gopro today unveiled the hero9 black, which is the stylized name associated with its latest action camera; one that is debuting as the convincingly most affordable mainstream option for 5k video capture for virtually every consumer demographic in the united states.
of course, this is still a device designed primarily for recording extreme sports and other such adrenaline-filled situations, yet at $499 and given its newly improved stabilization features and new lens modules, it certainly looks like a tempting proposition for even much tamer circumstances.
gopro, for its part, appears to have gotten this year’s messaging spot-on, as the hero9 black is advertised alongside a memorable tagline promising “more of everything.” and it is pretty straightforward to see what exactly its marketing was going for, which is more than what could have been said of many past gopro product launches, so we are more than eager to give credit where it is due right now.
if you happen to be a gopro subscriber, you can even slash off an extra $100 off the hero9 black price, the company confirmed. both gopro and its nationwide distributors are now accepting hero9 black orders, though it may be a few more weeks until the entirety of the new camera’s accompanying lens portfolio also makes its way to the market.

lg k92 lands in the u.s., offering affordable 5g





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

february 13, 2021













lg’s latest android smartphone, simply called the lg k92, is available to buy in the united states starting from today. its very name already reveals its mid-range ambitions, but no single model number can do justice to the value proposition lg has in store for us this fall.
namely, the k92 retails at only $359, thus being one of the cheapest avenues toward the fifth generation of mobile networks currently available stateside. the only device that seemingly outclasses it in terms of pricing is the galaxy a51 5g released by its largest domestic and global rival samsung. but that particular handset is a decisively entry-level contraption and, therefore, one that is just as likely to frustrate tech aficionados as impress them with 5g.
the lg k92, on the other hand, uses qualcomm’s snapdragon 690 soc, which is a known quantity only a step below the pixel 4a 5g, lg’s closest 5g-ready mid-range competitor which is about $150 more expensive to acquire right now.
combined with 128gb of flash storage, 6gb of ram, a 4,000mah battery with quick charge 4.0, and a quad-camera setup centered around a 64-megapixel sensor, the lg k92 should make for a truly great 5g-enabled gift this holiday season.

global smartphone chip shortage is imminent, qualcomm warns





								post author							
 

							by archie 




								post date							
 

february 6, 2021













a global smartphone chip shortage is imminent but will hopefully be resolved come summer, industry giant qualcomm warned as part of its latest quarterly earnings report.
which manufacturers are most at risk?
in other words, the effects of all of the unexpected logistical challenges arising from 2020 are still going strong. and despite its undisputed status as an industry leader in terms of both turnover and volume of high-end chipsets, qualcomm anticipates the incoming shortage will affect it as much as anyone. not least because it still depends on foundry businesses from tsmc and samsung to manufacture its acclaimed system-on-chip designs for mobile devices. ultimately, smaller smartphone players such as sony and oneplus might be the most affected by the shortage. as their chip orders weren’t a priority, to begin with. ditto for lg, which was reportedly pondering exiting the smartphone market completely even before supply issues over key components seemed as certain as they do now.
lost business is lost business, however, which is a large part of the reason why the mood at qualcomm is far from celebratory, even as it just reported a massive 62% revenue increase over the final three months of 2020. in total, qualcomm generated in excess of $8.2 billion, with approximately $2.45 billion in profit. the latter figure is even more impressive as it illustrates how qualcomm managed to keep bolstering its profit margins in an aggressive fashion. the chip giant attributed this achievement to strong momentum in the 5g segment that smartphone manufacturers were rather eager to embrace in recent times. as for this year’s chip shortage, san diego said anticipates things to return to normal in the second half of the year.

qulacomm unveils next-gen reference design for wireless earbuds

								post date							
 

january 19, 2021













qualcomm is hoping to facilitate the adoption of its latest and greatest wireless audio technologies with its newest reference design for one such product, called the qcc5141. that name does not exactly roll off the tongue, but it isn’t meant to, anyway, this is something aimed at consumer electronics manufacturers and not the mainstream market.
that does make it a good look at the future of such products, however. almost three out of four u.s. consumers want to be completely free of wires when it comes to audio, according to recent market data, and that is what qualcomm is trying to promote with its newest wireless technologies such as the fastconnect system announced earlier this year.
the qcc5141 reference design is based on the company’s new bluetooth audio system-on-chip of the same name which is meant to be both the brains and the storage of modern wireless audio solutions as small as earbuds in the vein of the airpods and galaxy buds from apple and samsung, respectively.
though it is still too early to say who will be making use of the said soc from qualcomm as the company still isn’t naming any names for the time being. that should change come spring, however.

huawei introduces new wearables, high-end matebook laptops

january 19, 2021













“huawei seamless ai life new products global launch” is the elegant name of today’s online event that the chinese company used to announce its fall 2020 lineup of consumer electronics.
the new products include two wireless audio solutions, a pair of wearables, and another couple of high-end windows laptops from the matebook family. the lattermost category consists of the matebook 14 and the matebook x, both of which feature largely bezel-free designs and pretty sizable trackpads for maximum comfort.
then there are the huawei freelace pro wireless (but wired to each other) earbuds designed for workouts like running, as well as the more stylish freebuds pro, a pretty obvious rival to apple’s airpods pro. finally, the new wrist-worn wearables are similarly divided into one that is more closely targeted toward athletes in the huawei watch fit, and another general-purpose fashion statement with a chop in the form of the huawei watch gt 2 pro.
with today’s announcement out of the way, huawei is almost done with high-profile product launches for this year. the only remaining range of devices that it is yet expected to announced before 2020 comes to a close is the mate 20 series of android flagships. those traditionally launch in the second half of october, so more details on the matter will probably follow very soon.

facebook books snoop dogg for venues on oculus quest

january 15, 2021













snoop dogg, aka dj snoopadelic, is preparing a virtual performance for the “venues on oculus quest” app.

but how will they look?
as many glass wearers know, there’s only so much of ar you can enjoy the higher your prescription goes. but luxexcel, a tech company specializing in 3d printed prescription lenses, and waveoptics, designer of waveguides and light engines, announced last week the showcase of their ar prescription smartglasses. glasses integrate three important elements of ar: an encapsulated waveguide, in the curved body of a 3d printed prescription lens, and a projector. with the waveguide being completely flat, the images are fairly high-fidelity-looking, and thanks to the 3d printed structure, the projector offers perfect alignment in an optical module. knowing that almost 70% of adults today need eyewear, this news will definitely intrigue many. smartglasses are supposedly compact and robust enough for real-world usage, yet the provided waveguide is thin and lightweight, making it comfortable to wear.
besides glasses being comfortable, they’ll also look fashionable, so consumers will have a chance to proudly show off their new eyewear. smartglasses will debut at the spie. ar, vr, mr conference on march 18th, 2021, while the prototype samples will be available in q2 2021.

razer blade 17 gaming notebook launches in the u.s.

the razer blade 17 is how razer is calling its latest high-performance windows laptop, officially unveiled for the united states earlier today. this is a new edition of the most popular laptop lineup from razer to date, which refers to the 17-inch display category.
as that tends to be the most popular combination of screen real estate and portability among consumers interested in no-compromise ultrabooks, highly compact computers that are still suitable for carrying around without much effort. the razer blade 17 uses intel’s 8-core i7 processor line up to the 10th-generation i7-10875h cpu.
it pairs this processor powerhouse with the nvidia geforce rtx 2080 super graphics card in its most expensive configuration, as well as a 17.3-inch display offering an insane, 300hz refresh rate, also courtesy of the said nvidia tech. of course, don’t expect a 300hz refresh rate from any 4k mode, but 4k 120hz functionality isn’t anything to scoff at – we are still talking about a laptop, after all.
now, for the worst part – the fact that this thing, in all its high-tech glory, will indeed cost an arm and a leg to acquire. razer already confirmed u.s. pricing starts at $2,599.99, and that is before any sales tax you might be required to pay.

asus unveils two slim powerhouses in u.s.-bound m415, m515

asus has taken the wraps off a pair of new slim ultrabooks in the form of the m415 and m515, both of which are bound for the united states and canada in the coming weeks. the duo primarily differs by screen real estate as the asus m415 offers several 14-inch led configurations, whereas the asus m515 is equipped with a more traditional 15..6-led panel.
both boast screen-to-body ratios just short of 85% and support for resolutions up to 1080p. while the default configurations will be sold with one of several available windows 10 versions, asus also intends to do a limited release of windows-less m415 and m515 models which will run one of today’s most bizarre linux distros in wide circulation called endless os. both notebooks will be offered with amd radeon graphics gpus in either the rx vega 8 or the more higher-end rx vega 10, though asus is also working on one entry-level variant without a dedicated graphics for each form factor.
the 14-inch m415 weighs approximately 1.5kg (3.3 ibs) in total, which makes it one of the most portable workstations at this performance level money will soon be able to buy. speaking of which, a concrete release date with specification options and detailed pricing structure are all expected to be publicized by asus before the end of the year.

apple overtakes samsung in q4 2020 smartphone sales

there’s no doubt 2020 took a heavy toll on the smartphone industry, but it seems nobody notified apple about that ordeal, a new idc report suggests.
does apple have a non-zero chance to retain this lead in q1 2021?
the analytics firm estimates the global smartphone market shrunk 5.9% year-over-year, dropping by about 80 million device shipments to 1.29 billion. at the same time, apple moved 15 million smartphones more than in 2019, shipping 206 million units in total. that’s a 7.9% improvement largely fueled by the iphone 12 which allowed apple to easily overtake samsung in q4 shipment volumes, as the figures attached herein illustrate. in the meantime, samsung’s mobile businesses declined at a much faster rate, losing out on around 29 million product sales, or 9.8% annually. note that for the purposes of idc’s report, the term “shipments” is used interchangeably with branded sales. meaning it doesn’t denote the actual, physical movement of inventory between manufacturers and their distribution chains.
it goes without saying that apple’s fourth-quarter lead is all but guaranteed to dissipate during the opening three months of 2021. primarily because the cupertino-based tech giant isn’t putting out any high-margin smartphones in the coming weeks. whereas samsung will be kicking off this year’s flagship race in under 24 hours, seeing how the galaxy s21 series is scheduled to go on sale tomorrow – both in the u.s. and abroad.
