about our theatres
shea’s performing arts center (shea's pac) is a campus of three theaters in downtown buffalo comprised of shea’s smith theatre, shea’s 710 theatre, and the historic crown jewel, shea’s buffalo theatre. these venues boast varying styles of performing arts, but all are sure to please the audiences that attend. from touring broadway to international collaborations and local rentals, shea's pac helps enrich the buffalo theatre district and supports main street's downtown business renaissance.






shea's buffalo
646 main street
shea’s buffalo theatre, the historic crown jewel of shea's pac, opened in 1926 under the moniker of “the wonder theatre”.  originally serving as a movie house under paramount pictures with “an acre of seats”, it would later stage vaudeville shows and play host to the likes of the marx brothers, frank sinatra, george burns, bob hope and more.

shea's smith
658 main street
once laube’s old spain, now a 237 seat “black box” theatre, shea’s smith theatre has played host to off-broadway productions, comedy, and collaborative productions with local theatre companies since 2000. somewhat of a chameleon space, it also offers ample room for events and special occasions with the adjoining shea's bistro & bar.

shea's 710
710 main street
shea’s 710 theatre is the latest space to be added to the shea's pac campus.  housing 558 seats and offering broadway productions and plays produced by local and international theatre companies, it is considered a “thrust stage”, where the stage projects into the auditorium and audiences can sit on three sides.
