training: if you want to learn some of this youself






















welcome to limbermen.
last update (weekly updates): 



 (back from the dead after 5 years)  updates somewhat regularly



mail me if you are flexible!



when looking at all the flexibility related sites on the internet one might think that it's
an exclusively female domain. well, with adequate training, men can achieve 
quite some range of movement.

here you will find a lot of images and informations about men's efforts
in flexibility. check out the pictures and the links.

contributors, read this:
if you mail me pictures, please write clearly in your mail that the pictures are for the website.
if you don't do so, i will consider the images as private and not for publishing. so you can
still share pictures privately with me without fearing that they show up somewhere else.
take care not to send mails bigger than 500 kb !!!!


how to do good pictures? 
best picture format for images on the internet is jpeg (jpg). to have a good
impression the image should not be too small.
in gerneral with jpg you have to find a balance between 2 sizes.

 the file size of the image should be between 50 and 100kb
 the picture size from  320x200 to 600x800 

and the image quality 'as good as possible'. 

to achieve this play around with the jpg compression factor (i use 85%, or
low compression or high quality). don't turn compression off completely
as it will make very big files. 

how to view real video
go to the realnetworks site
click on 'real player free' picture (at the bottom of the page)
click on 'realplayer basic' (the free player)
fill out the form and take care to deactivate 'notify me of important new ...' so you don't get emails
download the program and follow the instructions










many thanks for all the encouragements and support i get. and thanks to all those who share
their pictures. we all appreciate a lot.
