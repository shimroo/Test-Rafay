hardware stores are optimistic places


stephen shore, eddie’s wagon wheel, bridge street, struthers, ohio, october 27, 1977


**a new poem by klipschutz**

snap election

oops! the waffle
iron lady did 

her my bad 
predecessor

one bad better
and i am 

the egg man in a union 
tradesman’s truck 

with an old school 
megaphone shouting

labour lives
france drinks to that

thrown beneath the bus
she lies some more

chewed up and spat 
the fleet street flacks 

agree the pm tastes
like rubber chicken.

do you feel like a remnant of something that's past


rebecca kennedy, glowing eyes

*     from a december 11, 1970 letter from hunter s. thompson to rolling stone editor john lombardi:

..."but by 'music' i don't mean the nitty gritty dirt band. if the grateful dead came to town, i'd beat my way in with a fucking tire iron, if necessary. i think workingman's dead is the heaviest thing since highway 61 and 'mr. tambourine man' (with the possible exception of the stones' last two albums...and the definite exception of herbie mann's memphis underground, which may be the best album ever cut by anybody). and that might make a good feature: some kind of poll on the best albums of the '60s... or 'where it was at in the rock age.' because the '60s are going to go down like a repeat, somehow, of the 1920s; the parallels are too gross for even historians to ignore.

"so, for whatever it's worth -- to either one of us, for that matter -- here's the list from raoul duke:

1. herbie mann's memphis underground
2. bob dylan's bringing it all back home
3. dylan's highway 61 revisited
4. grateful dead's workingman's dead
5. rolling stone's let it bleed
6. buffalo springfield's buffalo springfield
7. jefferson airplane's surrealistic pillow
8. jazz innovator roland kirk's albums in general
9. miles davis's sketches of spain
10. sandy bull's inventions

"jesus, what a hassle to even think quickly about a list like that. even now i can think of 10 more i might have added... but what the fuck, its only a rude idea. but a good one, i think, and particularly for rs. the implications of the final list would vibrate far beyond the actual music... it would be a very heavy fucking document. you may want to give it some thought."

already rolled in the breadbox


melody owen, cutaway: carphone, 2015


dust congress house poet emeritus klipschutz
weighs in with a year-end ditty on matters political… 


our party

you’d need a history degree and a photographic memory 
to know which roman to compare to donald trump,
and only other bookworms would care. 
we can’t tell the emperors apart.
they built monuments, didn’t they, and pulled stunts, 
crucified christians before lunch, 
handed corn out by the bushel when they had to.
bread and circle jerks! emperors live on 
in monty python youtube clips.
the one who made his horse a priest
came up in a peculiar protest song.
this is our party now, no encyclopedias allowed.
we don’t have time for some shotcaller in a toga 
who polls at 2 percent name recognition.


his new book, a visit to the ranch & other poems,     
can be ordered here.

or contact the publisher directly:

last word books & press
111 cherry st. ne
olympia, wa 98501

(the book will be on amazon soon,
but etsy takes a smaller cut
and doesn't own the washington post.)
