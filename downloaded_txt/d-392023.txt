what was once an elitist game can now be played by anyone – best online casino baccarat 










baccarat is another casino game that isn’t overly complicated to play. while it may have once been a game played only by the rich aristocracy, and secret agents, it can now be enjoyed by anyone at a baccarat casino online. a basic understanding will be required before you play online casino baccarat.
 but you won’t need to spend hours learning it and then practicing. basically, the game uses 6 decks of cards and there are two participants, you and the banker. you each get dealt a hand and to win you’ll have to pick the hand with the highest total. the highest is a 9 and the lowest is 0. you have a number of options when it comes to betting. bet on yourself, the banker, a tie or a combination of all three.
you need to learn the basic rules
before you start playing casino online baccarat, there are some important rules you need to understand. unless you’re playing live dealer baccarat, the game is completely automated, and most real money online casinos will have the same house rules. 
be warned that there are some exceptions, so check before you risk any real money. when it comes to looks, baccarat is very similar to blackjack. but the difference is that there are no decisions to make, apart from which hand to bet on.
the first thing you need to understand is the value of the cards. picture cards and tens are worth 0. aces are worth 2 and cards from 2-9 keep their face value. when playing casino baccarat online your score is the total of the cards in your hand.
 the best hand is a 9. if the value of your hand is more than 9, as in double figures, it is only the right hand number that counts. for example, imagine your cards are a 9 and an 8. the total is 17 but only the 7 counts as your score.
the aim when playing at an online baccarat casino is to get as close to 9 as is possible. two hands are dealt and both are face down. a player can choose to bet for the banker, themselves or for there to be a tie. then you have to decide how much. 8 points (le petit) or 9 points (le grande) are the ultimate winning hands.
 if these numbers are dealt in the first hands the round comes to an end. if there is a tie this will also end the round. any other total and the dealer can give you another card, depending on the total. the decision as to whether another card will be dealt is made automatically, by the games software.
you only need to worry about three different bets
betting at the best online baccarat casino is not very complicated at all. there are only three options. you can bet on the banker to win, the player to win or for there to be a tie. if you want to place a tie …

advantages of playing at mobile casinos 










there are advantages and bonuses when playing on a mobile application than using a desktop. some are more od quality of life improvements, but they should not be overlooked, as even a single step forward is better than a huge lounge backward.
special bonuses for mobile users

as if playing from wherever you want was not a bonus enough, many casinos offer special “mobile play” bonuses to their customers. usually, it happens, when a user’s initial registration has been made from a mobile device. in such a case, you may receive a bonus in the form of free spins, or cash back deals. even though these bonuses may be considered as more of a token gesture than an actual advantage, they still manage to sweeten the deal just enough to get you reaching for the phone. an important note is that some of the mobile bonuses will not be granted if your initial registration was made from a desktop machine and you subsequently enter the casino from your phone.
money may be confusing, but on mobile it is made simple
the federal reserve, national interest rates, and dow jones may be hard to grasp concepts for some, but mobile payments are not. multiple technologies are being integrated into mobile devices, which make payment as easy as the click of a single button. boku is an innovative platform, which makes online payments much less bothersome. the company keeps close relations with mobile operators and a wide array of corporate clients. boku undergoes a multi-channel advertisement campaign for its clients, through its own channels and the platforms of mobile operators. web portals, e-mail messaging, sms offers, and many other methods are utilized in order to grant the end-user the best offers and a fast method of payment for them. all payments are charged to the client’s phone bill, just as conversations and data exchange are. many online casinos have partnered with boku so deposits to your account’s balance can be just a click away.
there is more than one one-click service out there
apple pay is changing the way users of apple technologies shop. your iphone, ipad, mac, or apple watch device can be charged for purchases in the apple store and affiliated partners. this way, deposits to the casino are charged to your apple wallet and no more than a single click away.
so many applications, i am panicking 
it is true, that a lot of casinos have separate applications for the “slots”, “table games” and “online betting” sections, but do not let that get you feeling down, or even concerned about managing all of them. your credentials are the same for every instance of the casino’s application. this means that even though the applications are different, you still use the same account to access them. this means, that you also use the same wallet. a single deposit to the casino offers you unlimited access to all gambling options, no matter which application you are using.
