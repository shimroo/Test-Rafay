welcome to
            the future of dyno 
                simulation software



 




virtual engine dyno is a computer 
                software program used by engine shops and 
                performance 
                enthusiasts to simulate building, modifying, tuning and dyno testing automotive engines before component 
                purchases and engine assembly. using virtual engine dyno, engine 
                horsepower, torque, rpm, 1/4 and 1/8 mile et and mph are 
                instantly calculated. engine changes are only a mouse click away 
                allowing users to find the best engine combination before component 
                purchases.
whether you are into drag racing, 
                muscle cars, circle track or street,
                virtual engine dyno is the only choice if you are serious about 
                making power!
