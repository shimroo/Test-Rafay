bbc music magazine
fantastic news! three chandos albums have been featured in bbc music magazine's november and december issues.
 choral & song - december recording of the month


welcome joy: a celebration of women's voices receives a brilliant five star review. *****
"the 12 superb sopranos and altos of the corvus consort sing the complex, close-knit textures of these works with delicacy and pinpoint accuracy. louise thomson’s immaculate, virtuosic harp playing conjures scenes that take us from scented gardens to sun-baked landscapes and haunted moonlit forests. the vocal/instrumental balance is well-nigh perfect in chandos’s clear, nuanced recording."
orchestral choice - december


adrian sutton's violin concerto secures the spot as december's orchestral choice. *****
"a colourful selection of imaginative new works"
chamber - november recording of the month


schumann: works for oboe and piano obtains ***** from rebecca franks.
"played with such warmth and eloquence, the arrangements chosen here often feel as if they were tailor-made for the instrument, while the sensitive programming paints a loving portrait of the schumann household."

rip benjamin luxon


one of britain’s finest international singers, benjamin luxon, died on the 25th july aged 87. born in redruth, cornwall, luxon began his career as a member of the english opera group, the company formed by benjamin britten for the performance of his own and other contemporary operas. luxon became one of britten’s key singers and the composer wrote the role of “owen wingrave” specifically for luxon’s voice. luxon became an important singer internationally, performing at the royal opera house, glyndebourne, tanglewood, the teatro alla scala, paris opera, oper frankfurt, wiener staatsoper, and the metropolitan opera. he went on to work with some of the most important conductors and orchestras and made over 100 recordings, including many for chandos. luxon was made a commander of the british empire (cbe) in 1986 for his service to music.
 
rip sir andrew davis 


we are saddened by the news that sir andrew davis, the renowned british conductor, passed away peacefully on saturday, april 20, 2024, surrounded by family after a battle with leukaemia. sir andrew recorded exclusively for chandos records from his first album elgar’s crown of india in 2009, making almost 50 recordings and gathering countless accolades and awards in the process. we will miss a wonderful musician who imparted so much to all who worked with him in such a generous, self-deprecating and humble way. rip andrew.

  kaleidoscope chamber collective



25% discount on kcc discography
hailed by the times for its ‘exhilarating performances’, the kaleidoscope chamber collective was dreamed up in 2017 by tom poster and elena urioste, who met through the bbc radio 3 new generation artists scheme. the collective operates with a flexible roster which features many of today’s most inspirational musicians, both instrumentalists and singers, and its creative programming is marked by an ardent commitment to celebrating diversity of all forms and a desire to unearth lesser-known gems of the repertoire. in 2020, it was appointed associate ensemble at wigmore hall, where the group makes multiple appearances each season and, in may 2021, was invited to give the hall’s 120th anniversary concert. it broadcasts regularly on bbc radio 3 and has recently been ensemble-in-residence at the aldeburgh festival, kettle’s yard, ischia music festival, and cheltenham festival where the group gave several world premières and collaborated with sir simon russell beale and the cast of the lehman trilogy. the collective has also made recent festival appearances at cambridge, dublin, lammermuir, oxford lieder, and chamber music by the sea, in maryland, usa. its début recording for chandos records, american quintets, was an editor’s choice in gramophone and nominated for a bbc music magazine award. passionate about inspiring the next generation of musicians, the kaleidoscope chamber collective has featured in the learning festival of wigmore hall and directed courses for the benedetti foundation. for more information, please see www.kaleidoscopecc.com, where you can also find links to the websites of the individual musicians.

'the violin part of the four bagatelles barely strays beyond first position; dego imbues it with charm and wit. pianist francesca leonardi is very fine throughout, captured in a close and well-balanced recording.'

'i particularly like the short central arioso movement, where aasgaard shows off some heart-rendingly beautiful playing. the sound chandos provides (ralph couzens is the engineer) is clear and well-balanced.'

'concerto for orchestra, with its symphonic aspirations, is arresting, consistently inventive, and potent – with deft writing between the exhilarating and the expressive this is music that journeys and arrives, a standout opus in rrb’s catalogue.'
