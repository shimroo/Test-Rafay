 we do not reject anyone who wants to climb in pairs or small
groups and in some cases, trek alone. we will always do our best to accommodate
your specific needs. we work with country based tour operators and local guides
who have proven their success in their field. we work with local guides who
know the local conditions, customs and culture and most importantly, the
mountains that they spend so much time in. who better to escort you around the
country than the very people who live there?

we regularly give back to the communities we work in and will readily get involved in charity climbs and treks, offering you the lowest cost trek possible.
 
we are committed to environmental sustainability and regularly get involved in cleanup operations e.g. bi-annual treks up kilimanjaro to clean rubbish off the mountain, annual treks on the everest base camp route to clean up what we can.
