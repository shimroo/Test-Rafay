top ten reasons to choose larsen bay lodge 


variety! we fish both saltwater and freshwater at world-class levels.
 high limits! due to our remote location, we have higher limits across the board for all species of fish.
 fleet of boats! we have a fleet of comfortable landing craft-style boats for saltwater fishing.  the boats have heated cabins and bathrooms!
 protected waters!  many places in alaska require long boat rides in the open ocean to access the saltwater fishing grounds, but we fish close-by in protected bays just
 minutes from the lodge.
 floatplane! we are the only lodge on kodiak with our own floatplane and exclusive access permits to local freshwater rivers.  that means easy access and private experiences are just minutes away.
 first class!  our accommodations and dining experience are exceptional.  in addition, we have a sauna, hot tub, kayaks, wifi, satellite tv, beach bonfire patio and more! 
 expertise and pride! we are a family-owned business, operating for three generations in larsen bay.  we know the area better than anyone and take great pride in sharing and protecting this incredible island.
 weather!  our weather in larsen bay is better than the majority of alaska.  kodiak has a mountain range across the middle of the island that protects us on the westside from 60% of the precipitation.
 bears!  observe the mighty kodiak brown bears! no concrete paths, no gift shops, no fencesâ¦just the bears in their natural habitat.  truly a unique experience.  
 no outhouses or generators! many camps in alaska run off generators.  but we have a hydroelectric plant, so you have all the comforts of home.

"thank you for hosting our trip to larsen bay lodge! everything from the accommodations to the meals was outstanding and then there was the fishing. limiting on salmon and halibut while enjoying the scenery of kodiak island was inspiring. our floatplane trip to the river, casting for salmon while watching the bears fish, was such a special day. our trip was more than a vacation. it was an adventure of a lifetime."

"larsen bay lodge was absolutely fantastic! from the scenery to the food, everything was first class. the thing that most impressed me however, was the staff's passion for what they do and their desire to bring that same joy to me as their guest. when we were out fishing, every time we brought in a fish the guides had a genuine excitement, even though they have helped bring in thousands of fish throughout their time there."

"mike and tamarin, we wanted to take a moment to thank you guys and your crew for showing us a great time. we have been thinking about that trip, planning and saving for years and you guys made it worth while for us. from the food, to the fishing, to the company everything was more than we hoped for. we were especially impressed by the language/lack of cussing by everyone that works for you. it is a rarity these days and was good to see."
