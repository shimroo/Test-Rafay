change a child's story ❤️
court appointed special advocate (casa) volunteers are appointed by judges to advocate for the best interests of children in foster care. this best-interest advocacy makes a life-changing difference for children who have experienced abuse or neglect. children in foster care who have a casa volunteer are more likely to succeed, adjust to change, and they’re half as likely to re-enter foster care.
