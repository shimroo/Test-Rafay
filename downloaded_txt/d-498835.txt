as good as it gets.
we have been going to the golf coast for 40 years. silver dunes in destin is as good as it gets. the very accommodating beach personnel and the lack of crowded beach is a huge plus.

our stay in destin
our five week stay at silver dunes was wonderful! this is our fifth year staying here and every time it has been great! the staff from amber, mary lou, andy and others are always very pleasant. our property is always clean, neat and well furnished. golfing at blackstone, eagle springs, links, and regatta bay was fantastic. i would definitely recommend to friends and family.
