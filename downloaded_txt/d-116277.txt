covid-19 update




                    on behalf of peak cycles and bikeparts.com we hope that everyone is safe and well. we will remain open under normal business hours until further notice. we are taking every precaution necessary to remain open.
                    
                    in our peak cycles bike shop in golden, colorado we will continue to perform bike repairs and sales. due to covid-19 we are not allowing any customers into the shop at this time.  we have a table and bike stands in front of the shop so we can bring products and/or bikes to you outside for purchase. our service department is also performing pick-up and drop-off of repair bikes outside.  we are not allowing any bike rentals or demos until further notice.
                    
                    for online customers, bikeparts.com is running at normal capacity as are our shipping companies usps and fedex. we have experienced very few delays for most of our us customers over the 2 weeks.  for local online customers, you can pick up your will-call orders at peak cycles.  call ahead for curbside pickup or come to front door and we will grab your order for you.
                    
                    we are committed to slowing the spread of covid-19, and to keep our customers, employees, and communities safe. we hope that this horrible situation ends soon and that everyone takes care of themselves both mentally and physically. if you can get out and walk, hike or ride, then take advantage of it. it certainly helps with stress and anxiety during difficult times. lastly, don't forget to stay in close contact with friends and family, especially those isolated. thank you for reading and we wish you well.
