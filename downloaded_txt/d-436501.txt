*subversion 
                  site*



you have found the mountainbike militiamen movement subversion site.  here you  have access to information you will need to "ride the apocalypse". if you are easily offended, have a weak stomach, or you are a politically correct vegisexual treehugger chi-chi boy technoweenie squid you better go cryin' home right now.  this is the mountainbike militiamen movement and we  mean to ride even if we have to be mean to ride.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~













 






* 
                  the mission statement *








if 
                      you are easily offended or 
                      afraid of the truth (often the same thing) then you best 
                      go away, you’ll only get hurt hanging around here.
the mountainbike militiamen movement was formed by a handful of
        mountainbikers from nepa (north-eastern pennsylvania) strictly for their own amusement.
        eventually it became a venue to spout off politically incorrect and libertarian rhetoric.
        later the original mission expanded and became a force to resist and fight the dark-evil
        we mountanbikers face in everyday life. some believe we’re dangerous right-wing
        militants who preach a scorched earth policy if the bastards won’t let us ride.
        others think we’re leftist-liberals hell-bent on a socialist bike wing of government
        responsible for "tricycle to cruiser" entitlements. it has been suggested that
        this is satiracle—good-natured tongue-in-cheek fun. you may draw your own
        conclusions, (we know it’ll be difficult for some of you). while the open exchange of
        ideas is encouraged, the  mountainbike militia doesn’t care
        what anyone else thinks, and those that don’t like it be damned. now shut up and go
        for a ride.
the above statement is
        the earliest m*m*m* document known to exist. it was uncovered in
        a secret cache along with a 12 gauge shotgun made out of ¾" water pipe and a 2 x
        6 sometime in the late 90's.

mountainbike militiamen conspiracy board







the conspiracy board is a forum
        where mountainbiking survivalists can rant, rave, buy & sell, share ride info,
        and most importantly, plot against all who would oppose our inalienable   "right
        to ride".

news
they say no news is good news, 
			but for the subversion site  it's meant broken links (including 
			the forum), no t-shirts, nothing new whatsoever.  yep, the 
			movement has been in a crusty cobwwweb stasis cocoon for far too 
			long.  we can only hope our enemies have forgotten about 
			us.......
...anyway, the 
			major links are fixed, a new batch of t-shirts is in, and we're 
			working on a new shopping cart for the t-shirts where you can use a 
			credit card or your  paypal account.

			remember, keep your chains lubed and your guns 
			loaded, we're all in this together even if we're alone.
