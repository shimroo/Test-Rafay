our lady of fatima's peace plan from heaven
the peace plan from heaven is a call for prayer and penance offered
                                        in reparation for sin. our lady said at fatima, "war is a punishment for sin."
                                        she asks for communions of reparation on the first saturday of the month and 
                                        that we daily offer up each act as a sacrifice for sin, pray the rosary, 
                                        be consecrated to her immaculate heart, and wear the brown scapular as a sign
                                        of this consecration.



pope pius xii blesses the second international pilgrim virgin statue
on october 24th, 1952, the holy father, pope pius xii, graciously granted an audience to three priests
                                        of the scarboro foreign mission society: rev. d. stringer, very rev. a. chafe, vicar general, and 
                                        rt. rev. wm. c. mcgrath, custodian and director of the pilgrim virgin tour. after blessing the pilgrim virgin statue, 
                                        his holiness imparted a special blessing to the work of the society and to the fatima pilgrimage.



why the world needs the rosary
the great marian prayer for peace is so relevant in the current culture.

before cardinal karol wojtyla was our pope, at the eucharistic congress in philadelphia
                                        on aug. 13, 1976, he declared: "we are now standing in the face of the greatest historical 
                                        confrontation humanity has gone through... we are now facing the final confrontation between
                                        the church and the anti-church, of the gospel and the anti-gospel."  that is still true today.

first saturdays explained
"i promise to assist them at the hour of death, with all graces necessary for the salvation of their souls."

on june 13, 1917, lucia asked the blessed virgin to lead them to heaven. the blessed virgin answered: 
                                    "yes, i will lead jacinta and francisco there soon. but you (lucia) will remain here some time longer. 
                                    jesus wants to use you to make me known and loved. he wants to establish in the world devotion to my
                                    immaculate heart (through the five first saturdays.) i promise salvation to those who adopt this 
                                    devotion and the souls who practice it (the five first saturdays) will be beloved of god. they will be 
                                    as flowers placed by me adorning his throne."

no one can say there is no hell
hell exists, and we might go there.

"i, sister faustina kowalska, by the order of god, have visited the abysses of hell
                                so that i might tell souls about it and testify to its existence... the devils were full
                                of hatred for me, but they had to obey me at the command of god.  what i have written 
                                is but a pale shadow of the things i saw.  but i noticed one thing: that most of the souls 
                                there are those who disbelieved that there is a hell." (diary 741)
