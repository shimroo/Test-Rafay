university commencement

    commencement is a tradition that marks the intersection of the past and the future.
    at the university of new mexico, we thrive at this intersection, embracing our state’s vibrant culture founded on
    wisdom that has been handed down from our elders—part of a colorful legacy inherited from all those who have shaped
    the past, present, and future of this rugged, beautiful land.
    at the same time, we look to those same traditions that keep us connected to the lessons of the past as new
    inspiration for the forging of our future.
