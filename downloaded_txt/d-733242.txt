creating space you never knew you had.
making it work better and look better.
now happily retired!  the original founders richard moved to norwich, england, and mike moved to venice, florida.  however, we still do miss our many clients after decades of retailing exciting modern wall systems and lighting just as we did from our first store, modern spaces on university street in palo alto, ca.
at the minimal space we added the following services

custom storage solutions
professional space planning
small remodeling jobs

so that we could take complete responsibility for solving small space problems from concept to completion.
the minimal space has always been associated with modern spaces, also owned and operated by the original founders. the focus of both companies was on modern design projects … such as closets, wall systems, offices, bathrooms, or remodeling a complete home … from start to finish.
