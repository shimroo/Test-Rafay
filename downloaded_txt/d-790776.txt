westcliffe: how the west used to be 








the wet mountain valley 



located in south central colorado, the wet mountain valley and its hub towns, westcliffe and silver cliff, are sandwiched between two stunning mountain ranges. to the east are the wet mountains (12,600 ft). and to the west are the towering sangre de cristo mountains–the longest mountain range on earth, with many of its peaks more than 14,000 ft high.




one the last places of its kind 



our valley is considered by many to be one of the most unspoiled regions in all colorado, if not the entire west. it’s one of the last places you can live surrounded by natural beauty of this magnitude–without crowds, traffic, and eye-popping real estate prices.

















 





 











 





 
















what clients are saying... 









" 



mattie has her finger on the pulse here at all times. in our buying experience, mattie showed her strongest suit: she’s a master at bringing two parties together and working out the sticky details when the sellers and buyers don’t see eye to eye as yet. she makes it happen with grace and a smile.
