the kutztown folk festival’s new logo combines the classic geometry of the local eight-pointed barn star and the six-petaled flower of life, punctuated by the image of the tulip. as the most prevalent barn star in the vicinity immediately surrounding kutztown, the eight-pointed star anchors the logo with a sense of place in the community. representing the points of the compass and the rays of the sun, this design has become locally synonymous with the agricultural traditions in the region fostering neighborly cooperation and friendship – the backbone of a folklife celebration.the six-petalled flower of life is a favorite motif of the pennsylvania dutch, adorning folk art throughout the region. a pattern that can be repeated infinitely, it represents the festival’s commitment to passing on and sustaining cultural traditions over many generations.the tulip, depicted as sprouting leaves and mature flowers, shows the potential for growth and significance at every phase of the cycle of life, inviting young and old to join the kutztown folk festival family and explore the region’s folklife traditions.the kutztown folk festival logo was created by patrick donmoyer, director of pennsylvania german cultural heritage center - kutztown university.
