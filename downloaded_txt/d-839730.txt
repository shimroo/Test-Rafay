visit the bronx at flickr





hi,i have been having technical problems blogging photos from flickr to blogger lately. it seems it is a common problem many other flickr members are also experiencing. it seems it is something from blogger's end. this is the first time i have been having problems blogging from flickr. i hope this problem is fixed soon.if you want to continue to view the beautiful array of photos in the bronx photo group, go directly towww.flickr.com/groups/thebronx.-- clarisel gonzalez, editor, the bronx (aka the bronx bloggers)
