	 another generation (writing)
	 
    
i went to queens for the weekend. i'll tell you about it tomorrow.eli 23.6. sent me a short piece he's working on for the oxford review of something or other. i enjoy editing his work because i understand, and i can usually tease out the heart of what he's writing, sometimes before he sees it himself. plus the editing process is so rewarding. it makes you defend what you believe to be important and why.writing creatively is exhilarating for him compared to academic writing, and it's thrilling for me to see how much he loves it and how committed he is to acquiring skills and developing. the calls when we talk about writing are so memorable, and it helps me be more excited about my own writing, because getting up every morning and working on a novel can be such a slog.i wouldn't be surprised if he becomes an academic with an enormous amount of creative writing as a side hustle. i want to be around for as long as i can to see what happens.

leading off this week, a wonderful video (thanks, qt3 forums): the hidden pattern in post codes.an excellent read: ‘it’s a cowboy show out there’: the deadly lottery of the snakebite antivenom industry.gee, what a surprise: did you know the top brass at arma and dayz studio bohemia interactive bought a 'disinformation outlet' in 2023?quite the bizarre story (but not in a bad way, really): a flooded quarry, a mysterious millionaire and the dream of a new atlantis. from wally, and i couldn't even collect any blurbs for mine: the end of the blurb. thank god. christie's is having an ai art auction (anything they can make money from, i guess): what is ai art? and now it's lucrative: 100,000 eggs are stolen in pennsylvania amid shortage. from c. lee, and it needs to be read: their democracy died. they have lessons for america about trump’s power grab. and another: the broligarchs have a vision for the new trump term. it’s darker than you think. this is a bad, bad trend: the cod-marxism of personalized pricing. what an incredible moron: video game exec pleads guilty to crashing drone into firefighting plane during la wildfires. a fascinating read: black death, covid, and why we keep telling the myth of a renaissance golden age and bad middle ages. this one, too: the lost towers of the guelph-ghibelline wars. in other words, a minimum wage barely over $7 is a dystopian joke: mapped: the living wage for a family of four, by state. this is why inflation could be insanely dangerous for the economy: visualizing the growth of u.s. consumer debt. so many close calls, considering the consequences: when russian radar mistook a norwegian scientific rocket for a u.s. missile, the world narrowly avoided nuclear war. a gentle story: a sunfish got ‘lonely’ when its aquarium closed for renovations. then, staff found a creative way to cheer it up. a thoughtful rumination: marjorie liu reflects on the immortality of superman. and this as well: advice for those contemplating suicide: flee the situation instead.

after cleaning the house and putting in 250+ edits (for 12 pages, and if you think that's bad, you should have seen the first draft), it was already almost 3 and i still had my full set of stomach/hip/back exercises to do (which take about 45 minutes).i had nothing. i was desperate.so i put on bachman turner overdrive's greatest hits, not because it was going to help much, but because that album is tied to a specific moment in my life.summer before junior year in high school, to be exact.the #1 tennis player on the team was named jeff w, and he was cool. not with the asterisk "tennis cool," either. he could have played any sport he wanted, and the way he played tennis--by serving and volleying, along with hitting big topspin on his forehand--was physical in a way that none of us could copy. he was extremely popular, and life seemed easy for him.life often turns out not easy at all for those people, but i digress.he was playing a league match at the tennis center one late afternoon, and i was a few courts down practicing my serve or something. he came swaggering in with a boombox, and when his opponent came a few minutes later, he asked if playing music was okay. his opponent didn't care, so he slapped in a cassette tape of bto's greatest hits.the weather was perfect. the sun had gone down just enough that it wasn't glaring on the court. and cool jeff was demolishing the guy he was playing while bto played in the background. i hit serves and snuck a look whenever i could and it was the greatest day ever.it's been 46 years, and i never hear bto without thinking about that day. i made it through the exercises, which were hell on a hot biscuit today. thanks, jeff.

i was talking to eli 23.6 today and he said something that i'll always remember.he said people who lose parents at a young age (he was 19) all have one thing in common: they are better able to feel joy than the people around them.i didn't understand.he said going through such a profound sense of loss opens you up and makes you more human. yes, you feel sadness more fully, but you experience joy more fully, too.it's a terrible price to pay, he said, but he's happy in a way he never was before because he can better feel happiness. he also gained a sense that the world is beautiful, even though horrible things happen in that world. my description isn't nearly as eloquent as his explanation.it's a reminder that being his dad opened me up in almost the same way. i feel more than i could ever feel before, in every direction.

i've written about this before, but i can't seem to get it out of my mind.it's so hard to find a website with limited content. worse, much of the content is totally out of their alleged area of expertise. almost every website has their own wirecutter imitation section making recommendations on hundreds of projects they've "tested." tom's hardware testing blenders? sure you have.even wirecutter is far from the mission of the new york times. i miss the days when the times was a newspaper, and choices had to be made about which content to include. that forced quality upwards. now, though, damn near everything in the dumpster gets included. it makes sense if you consider what businesses are trying to do. in the newspaper and magazine era, it was to inform/influence. now the only consideration is engagement. websites will put anything out there to make people stay because then they can serve more advertising.i like chatgpt, and it's great for serving information without ads, but it's still only summarizing everything it scrapes off the web, and most of what is available to scrape is garbage. if the big promise of ai was to serve bad content in a more convenient package, it wouldn't have sounded so promising.i'd feel better if i saw a way out of this, but i don't. enshittification is unstoppable.

i finished a long workout at the gym yesterday and felt great.when i started walking back to my car, i felt a sharp pain in my ankle. not soreness. pain.i couldn't figure out what i'd done, because i'd had no discomfort at any point during the workout. i thought it was transitory, but it wasn't. it stayed.when i woke up this morning, i tested it out and still felt quite a bit of pain. an ankle is particularly tough for me, because the way i deal with sciatica is to--among other things--sit less. i write standing up, too. i put on a heavy-duty ankle brace on, just for protection. as i was walking to the kitchen, i realized i was limping and walking very slowly. at that moment, i had a strange reaction.i was intensely angry.for twenty minutes or so, i was angry, which is incredibly uncommon for me. i don't get mad about much, unless it's bullying assholes screwing up the country. this, though, took me for a ride.i've been watching mom 94.11 get older. c's mom is also over 90. they both use walkers now, which is the standard for almost everyone over 90. it's necessary, but also hard. a walker shrinks your life so much. the world in which you exist gets smaller and smaller. mom would never admit it bothers her, but she's a strong, proud, hard woman (anyone who grew up poor in the depression is hard), and it can't be easy.part of me is angry that life diminished her that way. now i'm so conscious of fighting that for as long as i can that even a limp sets off my radar. i didn't understand until today.

ken p. has more links later on, but let's lead off with this: 'she believed you have to take sides': how audrey hepburn became a secret spy during world war two.also from ken: an oral history of twin peaks by its unforgettable stars: ‘i put my waitress uniform on and began bawling’. from chris m., and it's both an interesting analysis and concerning when it comes to ultrasonic humidifiers: better air quality is the easiest way not to die.more from ken p., and this checks out (mcsweeney's): how to become a professional writer. the jackets will be here soon: beat the heat: ucla’s new cooling device drops temperatures by 16 degrees continuously. this is ugly: subaru security flaws exposed its system for tracking millions of cars. this was inevitable and will only get worse: the pentagon says ai is speeding up its ‘kill chain’. i like this very much: developer creates infinite maze that traps ai training bots. don quixote would appreciate this: building a medieval castle from scratch. from wally, and the predatory scams trying to ensnare writers never ends: usa pen press: the ghostwriting scam of a thousand websites. this is quite thoughtful: culture, digested: neil gaiman is an industry problem. it's what we've all been wondering, of course: are popovers yorkshire pudding? very true: i loved pokémon trading card pocket – until i didn’t. from c. lee, and it's one of the positive uses of ai: stanford medicine's ai model accurately predicts cancer prognoses, treatment efficacy. no surprise: ‘it’s a death sentence’: us health insurance system is failing, say doctors. this could be game changing (if anyone would get it): new vaccine from mit and caltech could prevent future coronavirus outbreaks. this is amazing! smart glasses mimic insect eyes to assist the visually impaired with macular degeneration. this is discouraging: buffett’s berkshire hathaway operates the dirtiest set of coal-fired power plants in the us. this is welcome news and also somewhat obvious: california just debunked a big myth about renewable energy. a fascinating video: why is japan so weak in software? fascinating: how did the chess pieces get their names? a terrific read: masters of the knight: the art of chess carving in india. a classic from the digital antiquarian: the crpg renaissance, part 1: fallout.

	 rabbit hole
	 
    
when i saw today that only one nfl player (ken norton, jr.) had won three consecutive super bowls, it sent me down a deep rabbit hole.what started the journey was knowing that his father was ken norton, who most famously broke muhammad ali's jaw in a fight in san diego in 1973 and won a shocking split decision.i remember this fight quite vividly because i watched it live on abc's wide world of sports one saturday afternoon (4 p.m. central, always). at 12 i was still a huge ali fan and couldn't believe what i was seeing as ken norton controlled most of the fight. in the 11th round, he broke ali's jaw in four places, and ali fought the last round that way.howard cosell was a much better boxing announcer than i remembered, by the way.ali was sluggish in the fight and barely danced, a far cry from his younger days, but when he did, his footwork was mesmerizing. this led me back to what was considered his most dominant fight in his prime, against cleveland williams in 1966. i found the full three-round fight here and spent the entire time watching ali's feet. he was incomprehensibly quick, with probably the great footwork of any heavyweight fighter in history.the other fighter who i always thought had incredible footwork was mike tyson, although his technique was cut to cut off the ring instead of dance. tyson never reached his peak because his personal life was an abandoned mine train (later to include a rape conviction and prison sentence when he was 26), but i always wondered who would win a fight between the two at their best.i can't watch boxing anymore. we know too much about cte now and what a terrible toll it takes on fighters. like today, though, i can watch the old fights, ones long in the past, and not feel like i should be ashamed for supporting the sport.

after watching nba highlights over the weekend, i have a conviction about the future: when the aliens come, they'll wipe out humanity, then see victor wembanyama and say, "okay, buddy. you can come with us."i don't know of any nba trade in my lifetime where a superstar approaching his prime was traded for a lesser superstar past his prime without a slew of additional compensation involved. eli 23.6 messaged me over night with "luka" and a bunch of shocked face emojis. i assumed he scored 70 points in a game, went out and checked the news, and my jaw hit the floor."devout christian" justin tucker is now being accused of a similar masseuse roulette scandal as deshaun watson. i think eight women have come forward at this point with credible accusations of sexual assault. i said this about deshaun watson and i'll say it again: professional athletes do not go to an endless stream  of different massage therapists. athletes use massage to fine-tune their bodies for an extraordinarily high level of performance. it's their livelihood. they will have a favorite and not go to anyone else.it's a gigantic red flag when any athlete goes to therapist after therapist. that alone is a strong indication that something untoward (and dark) is happening.
