education




arkansas state university
agribusiness • 2001

                        studied agribusiness at arkansas state university in jonesboro, ar.
                    






work




stallard chassis
student • 1999-2001

                        attended the mark stallard summer camp, basically learned more racing knowledge in one summer than i had in the previous 3 years of racing. probably one of my most memorable journeys was being a 20 year old kid driving to delaware and racing all over pennsylvania summer of 1999. formed many friendships along the way.
                    




swindell motorsports
cleaner • 2009

                        i consider this the sammy swindell school of "keeping things clean", the man is a perfectionist and i was along for the ride. enjoyed most every minute of it, did knoxville nationals one year and then some regional races, still maintained my friendship through the years and considered it an honor learning from the best. even though you must wash every window and mirror of the truck as soon as you wake up every morning!
                    






skills





                        i can do pretty much anything in regards to building and maintaining a racecar. i enjoy working on the car almost as much as driving.
