reviews






testimonials





















“have become a regular customer for the past 8 months and so enjoy supporting local businesses . observations and comments: 1. great separation of family side and bar side built into what should become a historically acclaimed building in mukilteo, 2. they brew their own beer .. several staples, but they are always innovating .. all are great, including their root beer (add ice cream and make it a float), 3. they have a number of special events each month to grow the business, not just for themselves, but for other local brewers as well, 4. the music is a great casual mix, with options for customers to choose their song preferences, 5. management does a wonderful job of hiring and supporting great staff and offering two customer appreciation programs, 6. great food options .. individual, hot rock grilling, shareables, happy hours, and don't forget to leave space for dessert (the ice cream is amazing), 7. and you can get a bowl of peanuts and throw the shells on the floor and not worry about the cleanup effort (they take care of that overnight).”






















“awesome spot, if you're down in this location you'd be a fool not to stop in and come in for a beer and a bite to eat. one side of it is a restaurant where you can sit down at a table and the other side is a bar or you can throw the peanuts on the floor. beer is delicious, they have many flavors to choose from. food is equally as delicious. there's lots to see around this area so come check this place out.”-drew kilkenny






















“excellent food that was delicious and speedy. we started with the pulled pork tots and they were the highlight of our meal. i got the cuban and my wife ordered the tacos and they were both delicious. most impressive was our fantastic bartender named gage. he was super friendly and knowledgeable. on his recommendation, we ordered several rounds of "knotty mary's". amazing experience and would 10/10 go back. hopefully that bartender is there when we go!”-gregory teich
