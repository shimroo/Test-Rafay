2013       the last 40 years have shown that over the long term, property in switzerland is generally a sound investment.    the reasons are that switzerland is a desirable place to live, the political situation is stable, the economy is well run and the taxes are favourable. most importantly, there is a massive shortage of suitable building land. the economics of supply and demand do the rest!   what's more, unlike most investments, property has one distinct advantage: you can live in it!  and since everyone needs to live somewhere, property can improve your quality of life to a much greater degree than cash in the bank.   many in switzerland have traditionally been enthusiastic renters.  but with interest rates continuing to maintain historic lows, people are waking up to the benefits of home ownership. homes.ch will help you get a slice of the swiss property pie.
