all disk collections are for those who wish to browse, and
consist of eclectic recipes of diverse ethnicity, and are not segregated as to
category, such as "desserts," "entrees," or
"soups."  browsing the collections will be an experience of serendipity.

why are these pages called disks??  when spike and i each started our
collections, computer harddrives were very small and we saved files on
"floppy disks"  - 3.5" disks which hold about 1.4 mb of
data.  so, each page is the amount of information which we could store on
one floppy disk.
