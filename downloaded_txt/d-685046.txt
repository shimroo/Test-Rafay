how to relieve hay fever naturally





 if you're like millions of people around the country plagued with seasonal allergies, the return of summer can literally bring tears to your eyes. instead of being outdoors and smelling the roses, allergy sufferers have already retreated indoors to battle a war of sneezing fits, scratchy eyes, runny noses and the dreaded post-nasal drip. the culprit, commonly known as hay fever, attacks when your body's immune system over-reacts to dust, pollens, grasses and other allergens in the air. traditionally, people with seasonal allergies have sought temporary relief from over-the-counter medications in the form of antihistamines, decongestants and nasal sprays.   but chronic sufferers have become all too aware that allergy medicines can cause annoying and sometimes even dangerous side effects. there are other effective healing approaches such as medicinal herbs that are available, and in general, are much safer with fewer side effects. the herbal method in treating allergies involves naturally strengthening the immune system, providing support for the adrenal glands and using the right combination of herbs.  so if you're sick and tired of your allergies, fed up with annoying side effects that can rival the allergies themselves ,check out these natural remedies and get on the road to healing. first, let’s look at a natural approach that is based on chinese medicine philosophy.   it’s a natural juice fasting method that is a blood purification and cleansing diet to promote a strong immune system and good digestion.   health experts recommend a juice using raw carrots, celery and apple juice. magnesium-rich foods are also believed to help prevent allergies. lima beans, white and red beans, millet, or bananas.  you can add sprouts, green, leafy vegetables, root vegetables, and yellow fruit and vegetables to the diet and occasionally eat brown rice. studies show that vitamins, minerals and herbs enhance the immune system without weakening the body's defences in the long term.  here are just a few examples : * vitamin c - a natural antihistamine, improves adrenal function  * grape seed extract - an immune booster  * magnesium - relieves brochospasm  * vitamin b12 - reduces inflammatory response  * vitamin a - an anti-inflammatory, improves immune system  there are even more effective medicinal herbs not included in this article, for hay fever, eczema and other allergies, check out my ebook  “ how to blast your allergies away forever ! “

allergy relief - top 4 ways to fortify your immune system





intruder alert!  intruder alert!  unknown attacker has breached the perimeter.histamines, the foot soldiers of your body's immune system, rush to the front lines, desperate to keep you safe. they gather in your throat, tightening its muscles in order to block entry. they gather in your eyes, trying to wash the intruder away in a flood of tears. and they gather in your sinuses, prepared to forcibly expel the attacker with a tremendous sneeze.your body doesn't understand that this is a false alarm. harmless substances such as pet dander, dust, and pollen are viewed as a threat because you have an immune system disorder. your body is being maddeningly overprotective.this overprotective dynamic is created because your immune system is weak and therefore feels vulnerable.you need to strengthen your immune system to, in essence, build its confidence. once it's confident, your immune system will be better equipped to take those allergens in stride. the allergens will become more of an annoyance than a full-blown threat. the histamine foot soldiers will always be at the ready - - but you can take them out of red alert status.top 4 tips for natural ways of strengthening your immune system:* get plenty of vitamin c. our bodies can't produce vitamin c on their own, and yet, we rely on this hardworking vitamin to stimulate the production of the white blood cells that are so vital in our fight against disease. that means we have to get our vitamin c from dietary sources such as citrus fruits, melons, tomatoes, and leafy green vegetables.* exercise regularly, doing something you enjoy. you don't have to go out and run a marathon.  you don't have to lift weights . do something fun, and do it often.* sleep 7-9 hours per night. in today's rush-rush world, a full night of sleep is a rare and precious commodity for many people. allergy sufferers in particular should prioritize sleep for its rejuvenating properties. think you're on edge if you haven't gotten enough sleep? imagine how that histamine foot soldier on the front line feels. trigger happy, ready to jump at the slightest shadow.* drink lots of water. in addition to keeping your body lubricated, water literally flushes impurities out of your system. that means there's less work for your immune system to do, and a relaxed immune system is a healthy immune system.

natural remedies for the common cold and flu





the reasons many of us get winter colds and flu are numerous. viruses causing most respiratory infections are always mutating, and our immune systems have trouble handling these ever-changing germs.viruses can survive on non-porous surfaces for hours. if you turn a door handle recently touched by a sneezing, sniffling person, then lift a hand to your nose, you’ve infected yourself. some respiratory viruses, notably influenza, become airborne when someone coughs. you only need to inhale three tiny viruses to become sick.the symptoms are usually runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and cough.influenza is not as common as colds. two main types of influenza viruses — a and b — cause most cases of the flu. influenza viruses spread in the air and via direct contact. flu symptoms are usually dramatic, with sudden onset of chills, fever and muscle aches. nasal congestion may not be as marked, but the cough can take weeks or even months to resolve.another thing to consider is that the flu may cause a worsening of underlying chronic medical conditions.there are some natural herbal remedies which work against common cold and fluremedies for the common cold and flu:elderberry - elderberry is a traditional herbal remedy for upper respiratory infections. it’s has been shown to reduce the severity and length of flu symptoms. the constituents in elderberry have a specific action against flu viruses.echinacea: a natural remedy that is popular for boosting the immune system. its antiviral and antioxidant properties make it popular for treating the common cold and flu.astragalus: a natural remedy that is widely used in china for boosting the immune system. it is traditionally used as an energy tonic but is popular for treating common colds, respiratory infections and the flu.goldenseal: a natural remedy with powerful anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and astringent properties. the root is used for reducing colds, flu, fevers and other respiratory problems.ginger: a natural remedy with powerful healing properties. it is used as a diaphoretic to fight off cold and flu. ginger is well known for treating motion and morning sickness, migraines, nausea, arthritis, respiratory infections. because of these features, it is popular for treating the flu.vitamin c: eating food high in vitamin c or taking natural vitamin c supplement may help fight off the flu.vitamin d: plays an important role for aiding the immune system to fight microorganisms. some experts believed that the reason why people are more vulnerable to the flu during winter is because of the lack of sunlight. the shorter days equal to less sunlight which prevents the skin from producing sufficient levels of vitamin d. taking natural vitamin d supplement during the winter time is recommended by many health experts.other ways to fight the flu:eating a healthy diet is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of getting the flu. organic food such as fruit and vegetable are loaded with antioxidants, phytochemicals and many other nutrients that are designed to fight off bacteria and virus. no matter how deadly the microorganism, if you provide your body with the right nutrients, it has a very good chance of destroying it.drink herbal teas such as ginger and rosehip, add lemon juiceor cinnamon to give it an extra boost. these are high in antioxidants and full of antiviral properties.drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. being dehydrated can cause the mucous membranes around your eyes, mouth and nose to shrink which increases the chance of microorganisms getting through these barriers.your body needs about 8 hours of sleep per day. getting enough rest will help boost your immune system.
