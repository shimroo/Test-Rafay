who we are 
we're not just a running store

fleet feet chicago was founded in 1996 by dave and lisa zimmer, a local couple with a huge passion for running. neither had previous retail experience (dave was in finance, lisa in marketing), but they understood the transformational power of lacing-up a pair of sneakers. both quit their jobs to pursue a shared passion, soon opening chicago’s first fleet feet storefront on north avenue.
today, fleet feet chicago has grown to seven stores across chicagoland, along with one in rockford, and is the highest grossing franchise in the 190-store collection. they are continually voted as one of the “50 best running stores in america.” their impact on the local running community is unparalleled, evident by the zimmers’ personal philosophy they infuse in every customer touchpoint.
 
“we live by a simple belief: running changes everything,” says dave zimmer. “it’s more than a motto, it’s something we live every day and believe wholeheartedly. from the customers and communities we serve, to the organizations we are then able to support, running has the power to change lives.”
 
since 1996, fleet feet chicago has worked to transform running from a casual activity into a sought-after lifestyle. their personalized, in-store fit process is only the beginning of their customers’ journey. they continue to educate and engage their community by hosting weekly fun runs, offering training programs through fleet feet training program x chicago endurance sports, sponsoring advanced athletes through the new balance fleet feet racing team, supporting dozens of charity endurance programs, and even partnering with the chicago area runners association and the bank of america chicago marathon on major industry initiatives.
