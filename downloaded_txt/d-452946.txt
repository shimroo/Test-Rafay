the village of laggan lies at the heart of the parish of laggan on the upper reaches of the river spey, one of scotland’s finest fishing rivers and approximately 10 miles from its source. the village and surrounding area is an ideal base from which to explore the spectacular countryside of this part of the central highlands of scotland. there are cycling trails (nearby is the laggan wolftrax mountain bike centre) and walking trails for all skill levels and abilities and the peaceful agricultural and forest landscape has abundant wildlife.  red deer, golden and white-tailed eagles, osprey, pine marten and red squirrel are just some of the wildlife that can be seen within the area along with meadows of wild flowers and wading birds.
staying in the area also provides the opportunity to explore the peaceful countryside with the chance to understand the significant history and archaeology of the area from the "45" and general wade's road through the corrieyairack pass to the ancient pictish fort at dun da lamh - a scheduled monument site - see separate page on laggan heritage.  
along the a86 westwards towards fort william, creag meagaidh national nature reserve and ardverikie estate (glen bogle in the monarch of the glen tv series) can be found. these have also featured in more recent productions, the crown and the latest james bond film - no time to die. to the east lie the larger towns of newtonmore and kingussie with their own golf courses so laggan is an excellent base for touring by car or bike and an ideal location for many outdoor activities - e.g. fishing in the spey and surrounding lochs (permit required), hill walking and mountaineering to name just a few.
