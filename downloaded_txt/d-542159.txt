from the president's table 





 









 





hello everyone! happy foundation day!i greet you with joy and cheerfulness! 




in union with the universal church’s launching of the ordinary jubilee year of 2025, we have adopted the theme of hope for our foundation day celebration. it is our dear pope francis’ personal aspiration that hope be the overarching theme of the upcoming jubilee year, which is duly reflected in the opening words of the bull of indiction, with the latin title “spes non confundit” which translates as…hope does not disappoint. yes, hope never leads us to failure or disillusion. that is why we shout out loud here at ua that “in hope we are saved!” 







in celebrating such hope, we inspire joy and appreciation of god’s wonderful gifts. such giftedness pushes us forward and brings us closer to such hope and salvation. and so at ua, we celebrate our charisms! we discover and cultivate them as such is god’s desire and intention!we manifest and share them unselfishly for the good of the community! as we recognize countless gifts and charisms of every assumptionist, we champion and endorse our six charisms demonstrated and upheld by our founder archbishop emilio cinense and lived out for years and decades by those who were in ua long before us: catholicity, excellence, values, relationship, leadership, and mission!with the guidance of the lord and the hand of the blessed virgin mary holding us, may our ua charisms and countless other charisms give us genuine hope as we celebrate our foundation day and gaze towards the future with faith and joyful expectation!to everyone, cheers and happy foundation day!
