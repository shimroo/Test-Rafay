    welcome to the queensland air museum
 the queensland air museum is run entirely by volunteers to preserve australia‚Äôs aviation heritage. you will be amazed and inspired by our collection of over 80 historic military and civilian aircraft set on two hectares in beautiful caloundra on the sunshine coast.¬†many of our military aircraft have played essential roles in defending our nation and supporting our allies throughout the 20th century and into the 21st. our exhibits also include iconic civilian and utility aircraft complementing our military theme, making the collection the largest and most diverse in australia.¬†our restoration and conservation work is challenging and ongoing. since 1973, we have salvaged, purchased and restored over 100 aircraft. in addition, we have a large display of aero-engines, an extensive range of rare artefacts, books and reference materials and a growing collection of audio-recorded stories from the people who have lived our aviation history.the queensland air museum is a not-for-profit organisation that receives income from visitors and private donations. your visit will contribute significantly to our ongoing work and enable us to continue the preservation of this unique collection.
