everybody knows australia is an amazing country, but during 
                their holidays in australia travelers often discover it to be 
                even more amazing than they had expected. 
                and now that there are more cheap flights to australia available 
                on the internet, and accommodation and tours can be booked easily 
                online, australia has become a very attractive destination!

                sydney, uluru, the great barrier reef and the daintree and many 
                other amazing places are ready and waiting for you!
                australia is the only country in the world to occupy an entire 
                continent, and it is packed with diverse regions; vast dry deserts 
                and outback, lush ancient rainforests, snowy mountains, the colourful 
                great barrier reef, tropical paradise islands, all with their 
                own unique amazing flora and fauna . 
                add to this the aborigines and their ancient culture, and the 
                friendly cosmopolitan population originating from nearly 200 different 
                countries, and we reckon we got the most amazing country in the 
                entire world!

                climbing the harbour bridge in sydney, shopping in melbourne, 
                wine tasting near adelaide, scuba diving the great barrier reef, 
                bushbashing a 4wd through the endless outback, cuddling koalas 
                in australia zoo, the choice is yours !
