the cybernet resources tech blurb was updated to the latest version of its software today.  from the looks of it, everything went well with no problems, but if you find any weird problems, please contact me.  also, if you haven’t noticed already, the tech blurb has been being updated daily, and will continue to be updated fairly frequently from now on.  also, the site of the week will be coming back soon and you can expect some anime reviews and various other main site content in the near future.

happy birthday to me! ~ 25 jul 2006 by: webmaster christopher

it’s my birthday today, july 25.  so…happy birthday to me!  yay!  that’s all.  oh, just to make this post slightly more meaningful, it seems there are still dns issues with the site, or maybe more specifically, isp caching issues.  however, it is extremely weird the caching issues would be going on and off for people.  i’ll be contacting my host yet again to try to resolve these issues.  also, i would like a million dollars for my birthday.  please send the money via paypal to webmaster@cybernetresources.com.

cnr back yet again... ~ 23 jul 2006 by: webmaster christopher
view/add comments(0)
some of you may have been wondering just what happened to cybernet resources...unfortunately...i don't even really know.  i sort of got caught up with school and other projects and cnr just slowly died.  bots took over and the forums died out.  however, from now on, i will start writing as much as i can again in the tech blurb and writing larger articles for the main part of the site every so often from now on.  i wont really have time to write full articles very often, so if you are interested, please give me a shout.  also, if anyone would like to be able to post in the tech blurb, also give me a shout. moving right along, the cybernet resources comic will be coming back, this time by a different artist who is another friend of mine.  enzo, the old artist, may still do some comics, but he is also very busy like i am.  finally, a whole new dynamic comic system is being worked on and will be used when the comics start being published again.  this will allow lazy artists to post easier and for lazy people to find comics without all the hassle there is now.  anyways, that’s pretty much it.  i’ll keep you all updated.oh, one more thing.  the forum bot problem is pretty much under control, and active spam moderating is being done on all areas of the site.  bots should just go away because they wont get any more than a few hours of exposure and i may just end up reporting them. :)

well, sort of a minor announcement, but from now on, bigger versions of all screenshots will be available by clicking the screenshots in all new reviews.  i originally didn’t do this due to bandwidth issues, but i figured i would somehow manage.  also, make sure to mark your calendars for the cnr after-christmas christmas party on monday.  check out http://www.cybernetresources.com/chat/ for the times.  finally, we now have a new major writer for cnr, going be the name of omegadeus.  he will be writing for the tech blurb and main areas of the site. :)

well, i sort of took a week and a half break from cybernet resources due to the months of work i put into redesigning it.  however, i’m back now and will finally begin to publish new content every day.  plus, i published 3 new anime reviews for your guy’s reading pleasure today.  sorry for the wait.
