“this area’s most extraordinary restaurant”- frommer’s

we are excited to announce we are re-opening on tuesday, october 22, 2024. we weathered both hurricanes better than we could have ever expected and for that we are grateful! please come in and support our amazing family that has missed you all so much and are ready to get back to serving you in the exquisite euphemia haye way!











chef owned & operated since 1980chef raymond & d’arcy arpke followed their passion for fine food and purchased euphemia haye, a tiny 28-seat restaurant on longboat key, in 1980. in the forty years since, they have expanded the restaurant, added the haye loft, and built a family of staff. most impressively, their care for our guests and the dining experience has never waned. we invite you to come dine with us and “let go.” enjoy a glass of wine and feast on our award-winning global and american food while you look out onto our beautiful tropical grounds.many thanks to team renick for putting together this wonderful video tour. follow along with ray & d’arcy as they walk you through the restaurant. (note: the video was filmed pre-covid.)

the haye loft



enjoy a drink, nibble on a few appetizers and a dessert in the more laid back upstairs haye loft!



we apologize for any inconvenience, but we are not seating any parties over 6 people upstairs in the haye loft.





















the loungethe haye loft was formerly the apartment of the restaurant’s original owner, so when designing the lounge, we gave it a swanky “bachelor pad” style. whether you cozy up to the dark maple bar or enjoy your drink on our tropical terrace, you may just want to stay for the entire evening. with a full bar including top-shelf liquors and wines by the glass or bottle, the lounge is the place to be on longboat key! 













the dessert roomvoted best desserts by every local magazine and newspaper more times than we can count, but that only tells a part of the story. the dessert room is popular with locals and visitors who want to enjoy our fine fare in a more casual environment. plus, full view of our desserts - all made fresh daily by our outstanding pastry chef! reservations are not accepted in the dessert room, so walk on in!
