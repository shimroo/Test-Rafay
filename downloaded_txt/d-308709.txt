our mission

ifi works to create an environment in indiana where families can thrive. this includes:
 

policy work at all levels of government so that god honoring public policies will help hoosier families and not hinder them.
leadership development so that we have god honoring leaders across all institutions who will serve the families in their communities well.
bridging the gap between the ministers of god and the ministers of government so that the power of the gospel can break bondage and make inroads into our state’s most pressing problems...and that, ultimately, broken families can be healed.
protecting the fundamental rights of families when they are legally attacked, through professional advice and referrals to legal assistance.
