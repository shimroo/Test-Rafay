macungie borough authority requests voluntary water conservation - 11/14/2024 

 on november 1, the pennsylvania department of environmental protection announced a drought watch for lehigh county.

following the macungie borough authority meeting on november 14, 2024, the authority has asked for voluntary water conservation for the borough of macungie.

residents and businesses are encouraged to reduce their nonessential water use as much as possible. for example, at home there are many simple ways to use less water:

- refrain from watering your lawn.
- refrain from car washing. if you must wash your car, it's better environmentally to go to a drive-through car wash that recycles the water.
- donât let the faucet run while brushing your teeth or shaving. take shorter showers. for example, consider not washing your hair daily.
- run the dishwasher and washing machine less often, and only with full loads.
- refrain from watering your garden.
- sweep your sidewalk, deck, or driveway, instead of power washing or hosing it off.
- check for and repair household leaks. for example, a leaking toilet can waste up to 200gallons of water daily. quickly fixing a dripping faucet or running toilet is a great way to reduce water loss.
- simply being mindful of how much water you use in everyday activities can lead to small changes that add up. the current drought conditions will take a significant amount of rainfall to make up for the deficit experienced over the last few months.
again, the macungie borough authority is asking for voluntary water conservation in the borough of macungie.

welcome to macungie borough




macungie is a lenape indian phrase signifying "the feeding place of the bears" or, as it was translated by the early pennsylvania german immigrants, "baere schwamm" (fertile meadow of the bears).  the macungie region was first settled by pennsylvania german immigrants around the year 1735.  the village of millerstown, now the borough of macungie, was established in 1776 by peter miller of upper hanover township, montgomery county, when he purchased 150 acres of land along a king's highway in what was then a portion of northampton county.

on november 15, 1857, the village of millerstown was incorporated as a borough. in 1875, the borough was renamed macungie. macungie (pronounced ma-cun-gee) is the second oldest borough in lehigh county, pennsylvania. the borough has a total area of 1.0 square mile.
