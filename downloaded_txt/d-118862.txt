from the initial call, to receiving the record player after restoration, the customer service was stellar. i was updated by both email and phone during the process - that was appreciated. i do not have enough adjectives to describe how wonderful this shop is and how thankful i am to have my great aunt's hifi working again!

pro tip - if you can, ship your fragile, irreplaceable piece of equipment in a crate if large, or a cooler if smaller. my turntable weathered the trip up to ny in a double packing, double box setup, but the delivery company did damage it on the return trip.

whatever you think is well packaged and protected, is really not. save the heartache and ship using a non easily crushed container (like a cooler.) fylp restoration happily accepted it back and fixed the, thankfully nonextensive, damage as if it never happened!

thank you, thank you, thank you!

i was referred to this shop by a friend, for the purpose of refurbishing my ar3s. unfortunately, they are booked until 2023, but they responded to my request immediately and offered another solution. thanks all!

what a great place. they fixed my wife's record player and shipped it back to texas for me. she was beyond thrilled to have her antique record player that her mother gave her fixed and running again. thanks so much for the amazing customer service and quality workmanship. i highly recommend using for your listening pleasure to repair your antique record players and radios.

came here after a local repair shop said that they could repair it and only made it worse. they know what they're doing and i wish that i talked to them first. great communication and they explained what the problem was and how it was repaired.

my turntable was taken to a couple local shops here in il who said they specialize in “fixing” older turntables and vintage radios. not so!
i got tired of getting my unit back with the same problems.
shipped it to fylp and bam! done! they fixed it completely! drive idler replaced, serviced upper and lower bearings on motor,replaced motor mounts, replaced cracked on/off switch, cleaned / re lubricated changer mechanics, fixed platter and aligned tone arm.
it works flawlessly now. i can’t thank them enough! fylp is the real deal!
