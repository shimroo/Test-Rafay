 fernandez music
              was established in 1985 but my experience with spanish
              luthiers extends back to 1965 when my father and i started
              to deal with guitarmakers from his homeland. since the
              1990's i have imported over 13,000 guitars and i have
              personally set-up the last 8,000 of them. see ronald louis fernandez
