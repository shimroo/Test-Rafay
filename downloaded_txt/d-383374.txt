cultivating gospel transformation






 



sundays:sunday school–9:00 am  worship service–10:00 am get directions 
 

welcome to christ church.
here at christ church, we are captivated by the gospel. that means that we hope to see lives transformed by this good news that god’s grace is given to us in jesus christ; not in living the “right way” or “doing the right thing.” so, we invite you to visit christ church. it is our prayer that you will experience the gospel both intellectually and relationally here, and that you too will have a heart transformed by the gospel.
