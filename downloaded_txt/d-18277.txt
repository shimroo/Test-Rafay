this etf is different from traditional etfs. traditional etfs tell the public what assets they hold each day. this etf will not. this may create additional risks for your investment. for example:

you may have to pay more money to trade the etf's shares. this etf will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information.
the price you pay to buy etf shares on an exchange may not match the value of the etf's portfolio. the same is true when you sell shares. these price differences may be greater for this etf compared to other etfs because it provides less information to traders.
these additional risks may be even greater in bad or uncertain market conditions.
the etf will publish on its website each day a “tracking basket” designed to help trading in shares of the etf. while the basket includes some of the etf's holdings, it is not the etf's actual portfolio.

the differences between this etf and other etfs may also have advantages. by keeping certain information about the etf secret, this etf may face less risk that other traders can predict or copy its investment strategy. this may improve the etf's performance. if other traders are able to copy or predict the etf's investment strategy, however, this may hurt the etf's performance.

for additional information regarding the unique attributes and risks of the etf, see each fund's individual product page. ivra
