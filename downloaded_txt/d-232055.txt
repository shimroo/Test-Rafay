dumbo: the flying elephant.
dumbo, the flying elephant, is one of the best rides for kids in the disney world, and you must never miss it out. it might seem like it is similar to any other rides in the amusement parks or the village carnival but this machine was said to be designed by leonardo da vinci, and kids just love going on this ride. you will be able to find this ride in new fantasyland in the magic kingdom. as the ride is so popular, they introduced a similar ride in the new fantasy land area.

the seas with nemo and friends:
finding nemo was a brilliant movie, and disney has made a stunning breakthrough by bringing the characters of finding nemo in a fish tank. the illusion is perfect that it will make you think that there is a real fish in the fish tank that looks exactly like nemo.
turtle talk with a crush:
turtle talk with a crush is similar to the fish talk of finding nemo. it is in fact in the same pavilion, and you will be completely baffled to see the characters to appear as if they were real. there is a surfer who interacts and even chats with the viewers. turtle talk with crush is perfect for children, and it was quite underrated but in the year 2016, the characters of finding dory were added, and it gained some attractions.
voyage of the little mermaid:
voyage of the little mermaid is a theatrical version of the animated film. you get to hear many of the popular movie songs, and if your kids are into theatre, then it is a great place to take them. the theatre sound effects are brilliant, and your kids will simply love it.

what makes the atlantis resort so unique is its size and diversity. the resort is essentially a water/theme park, high-end resort, tropical oasis and world-class aquarium all rolled into one, so there are plenty of things to do and something for everyone! the atlantis resort sits on the beautiful caribbean beach and offers many activities such a banana boat rides and jet skiing.
there are numerous pools and water parks right in front of you aquaventure is atlantis’ new 63-acre waterscape. the power tower sits in the middle of a mile-long river ride called the current. riders are pushed along in their tubes – double or single – by a series of rapids, waves, and surges. no need to exit your tube to access the slide rides at the top of the tower – conveyor belts transport riders to the top. once there, riders can choose from three tube slides: the drop, the falls or the surge. braver souls can abandon their tubes for a vertical drop through the abyss.
the mayan pool sits at the base of the mayan temple which houses the leap of faith (another vertical drop slide), the jungle slide, the serpent slide (which empties into a clear tube surrounded by sharks) and the challenger slides (side-by-side slides that time each rider’s descent to the bottom). there are also a series of smaller slides, hot tubs, and waterfalls around the base of mayan pool.

san diego, california
san diego families spend significantly more on housing than those in most other cities, at $1,592 and $1,355, respectively. for this reason, san diego makes the 10 worst kid-friendly cities simply because it is extremely expensive to raise a family in san diego without living outside your means.
cleveland, ohio

san antonio, texas
not surprisingly, san antonio has a lot of the same problems that other cities in texas have. a low graduation rate and high crime. one area where it does do better is in the number of playgrounds. this alone, however, is not redeeming enough to take it off the list of the worst cities to raise children. this information was found on forbes.com.
los angeles, california
according to forbes.com los angeles makes the list because it has the second highest cost of living, on the list of 10 worst cities to have a family in addition to only one playground per 10,000 residents, and a meager graduation rate, it’s no surprise that the city of los angels is on the top 10 worst cities for children.

kid friendly cities: report card 2004
march 15, 2018march 15, 2018
 

 

this is the ninth edition of population connection’s report on children and cities. its mission is to present the best available data on the social, economic, educational and physical environment in our cities–exactly where our children live, grow, learn and play.
letter from congressman jim mcdermott (d-washington)
congressman jim mcdermott (d-washington) is currently serving his 8th term in the u.s. house of representatives. mcdermott was the first member of his family to attend college and went on to finish medical school. as a physician, rep. mcdermott is especially interested in health care issues and is leading the fight in the house of representatives to guarantee all americans comprehensive health coverage.
from the president
teen pregnancy. you may have read recently that teen pregnancy rates in the united states have been going down and are now at all-time lows. that is absolutely true. however, it is more important to recognize that teen pregnancy and birth rates in the u.s. are still, by a wide margin, the highest in the industrialized world.
population and kids
since we began putting out theâ kid-friendly cities report cardâ almost 18 years ago, there’s been one question that pops up at each release: why is a population stabilization organization interested in looking at cities as kid-friendly.
sex ed and kids
with no federal policy or funding supporting comprehensive sexuality education, state laws primarily govern what local districts teach. if a state mandates sexuality education or prescribes what is taught if sexuality education classes occur, these laws set the parameters for classroom teaching. for example, california does not mandate sexuality education but requires school districts that implement sexuality education to follow certain guidelines
community and kids
a city is a noise, a smell. the murmur of the crowds at six and the quiet of the streets twelve hours later. steinbeck called his beloved monterey “a stink, a grating noise.” “but seen through other eyes” he describes a transcendent place of warmth and quiet beauty.
health and kids
healthy mothers and healthy children go hand-in-hand, which is why some of the indicators that contribute to theâ kid-friendly cities’â health grade are intrinsically related to motherhood. when women receive quality reproductive health care and are given the opportunity to space or limit their pregnancies, their children benefit too.
the shaw ecovillage project
“the thing about this neighborhood,” says jimmy, a staff mechanic draping his long arms over the bike he is working on, “is that i grew up three blocks from here and i never came down to this corner.” yet, on this sunny saturday afternoon, jimmy is working with dozens of local children who hang out regularly at the shaw ecovillage project, an award-winning program for kids in an often-troubled area of washington, dc.
statistical analysis
what can we tell by looking at particular indicators in the survey? do any of the indicators have a large significance in relation to a city’s overall grade? we ran several statistical analyses to determine whether there was any relation between individual indicators and a city’s final grade in each category and overall rank. all of our indicators were weighted evenly in determining the final grade, but we wanted to know which indicators would show the largest correlation to the overall grade.
