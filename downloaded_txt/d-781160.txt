driving to/from work in bangalore



i started driving again to/from work. key takeaways:the traffic in bangalore is exactly as chaotic as it is made out to be. people do not think while driving...driving in a car protects you from the evening rain. it is a major fun to splish splosh the car in the next lanekishore kumar is still the best. rahat fateh ali khan, kay kay and abhijeet could come close, but there are some limitations.it is important to choose a time to commute. starting from home before 8:15 am is necessary and leaving around 5:00 pm is absolutely essential.

tuesday superstition



i need to find out the root cause behind the tuesday superstition in south india - essentially no one starts any work on a tuesday. someone needs to tell microsoft though - they are unveiling the next update of windows phone 7.x on a tuesday :-)

return of the blogger



after spending too much time on facebook, almost to the tune of an hour daily, i have decided to give it a rest and return to the platform i love the most - blogging. this again needs to become my favourite pass time. as i see it, the 140 character limit on twitter and few character limit on facebook does not allow me to express my literary skills :-) to the fullest. i am fed up of trying to create one liners just to keep the humour going. i will now start blogging again - few blogs a week here and more on my astrology page. i am planning to start investing some serious time on astrology blog as well.

hooray, i was a sitting duck !



i went to watch the mumbai-bangalore ipl match and heard one of the blasts at around 3 pm. did not understand what it was - it never crossed my mind that it could be an act of terrorism and i was so close to the epicenter of the blast :-) it was only after they started flashing a message about the match being delayed, did people started talking about bombs.i will be very honest, at no point was i scared. ticketgenie.in (the online ticket site where i purchase the tickets) had earlier lost my tickets in courier. when i confronted them, they gave me rs49/- tickets (the guest pass to pavilion). now the issue was what if the match gets canceled, what refund would the organizers give me :-) this was the only thought that crossed my mind, apart from the fact that i would not be able to see sachin tendulkar play... basically, my brother put it succinctly - "haath to aaya, par muh na laga", roughly translated as "i had (food) in my hand, but could not eat it".but the match happened - and it was a good match. i shamelessly cheered sachin's team, much to the chagrin of my fellow bengalureans, but i did not care. after all, mumbai's team is called indians and i am an indian first and a challenger later. the only thing i was pissed about is bangalore's fielding and that they chose to hold on to tendulkar's catch alone.

mile sur mera tumhara



in tune with, pun intended of course, with my current state of mind of cribbing against anything substandard, i would like to trash the new “mile sur mera tumhara” video that is being telecast now on television. this reincarnation essentially belongs to the same category of karzzz and sholey (rgv ki aag) and brings out the following points:  the population of india has grown a lot in last 20 years and hence all these additional hero/heroines from bollywood needed to be accommodated. the egos of these people are inflated and all of them wanted separate screen space for themselves. shah rukh khan misunderstood the meaning of phrase - “passion towards one’s own country” and portrayed the same expression in this video as he did in “suraj hua maddham”. salman khan had to compromise with a vest because he was not allowed to take off his shirt.  let put an end to sequels and remakes…
