ketubot
ketubot from orthodox to reform to interfaith,
                our ketubah designs and texts will make your jewish wedding beautiful.








tallitot
in some jewish traditions, the tallit (or "talis") is wrapped around both the bride and groom during the ceremony, to symbolize their unity. gallery judaica offers tallitot to complement the style of the couple as they stand together under the wedding canopy.








mezuzah
a mezuzah comprises a piece of parchment called a klaf  contained in a decorative case and inscribed with specific hebrew verses from the torah.
