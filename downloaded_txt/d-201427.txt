what alaska homeschool students say about pace statewide homeschool








“as most of us know, high school can be a challenge. fortunately, i was able to have the best experience at pace, a homeschool where i feel comfortable with my education and well-being.”








“i tried a couple of the other larger homeschool programs and can’t tell you how happy i am with pace. everything from helping me find the right learning style of my student to the ease of paperwork. no one supports you better than pace!”








“choosing pace was the best decision for our family. it aligns perfectly with our values and the moral framework we want to instill in our children. the supportive community of like-minded families is a bonus!”
