masterclass in advanced psychotherapy skills, vol 1: deepening client self-discovery

03:58:17
by orah krug, phd

                                asking “how do you feel?” is a typical way we try to help clients expand their internal awareness. but unfortunately, it’s often a dead-end, and many therapists don’t know how to follow up. in this masterclass, you’ll learn powerful techniques to help clients accelerate the internal discovery process so they can gain additional resources to tackle the problems bringing them to therapy.
