maine weddings by a native maine planner
katherine is a native of maine who truly loves her work. she has been planning maine weddings and other events all over her beautiful home state for more than ten years. with her extensive knowledge of maine and her many contacts, katherine is adept at all facets of wedding planning. no detail is too large or too small, and, for that matter, no wedding is either. katherine once arranged a maine wedding with 300 guests where the ceremony was held on the mainland but the reception was on an island! katherine shepherded bridal party and guests from the church to their cars to a boat to the island and back again, and it all went off without a hitch. she's also planned an intimate wedding where only the bride and groom and their two witnesses were present, and the ceremony took place on a romantic cliff top overlooking the sea. for a maine wedding the possibilities are endless. whatever your dream, katherine will help you turn it into a reality. 
katherine proudly serves same sex couples for their weddings. 
experienced maine wedding planning
because of my ten yearsâ experience in planning maine weddings i have contacts all over the state, and can assure you a beautiful wedding pretty much anywhere you want it. i can help you get the maine marriage license and help find the right minister or justice of the peace to perform the wedding in maine. iâll find the sites for the rehearsal dinner, ceremony, and reception. in the weeks leading up to your maine wedding iâll act as liaison among all the wedding vendors â reception manager, florist, photographer, baker, band, etc. â and coordinate all the hundreds of details that go into making a perfect wedding. tell me your concerns and questions, and iâll deal with the vendors so you donât have to. on your wedding day i will be there behind the scenes, overseeing every detail and ensuring that the wedding and reception run smoothly. from helping the wedding party get ready before the ceremony to making sure your gifts and that top layer of wedding cake for your first anniversary are safely stowed in the bridal car at the end of the reception â iâll be there, doing my absolute best to make your wedding day flawless.
