learn morewhat people are sayingi have to thank pathways health & research centre for providing a fantastic environment for my 2 kids to grow and learn how to interact with other children. thank you so much!
“it was fantastic. my daughter has already practised being brave, so i think she’s really on her way to finding her confidence.
“the time talking with the parents was really good because we were allowed to talk about our kids in a non-biased and non-judgemental environment. everyone was able to share their tips and experiences on dealing with things!
“i really enjoyed it, i think it was beneficial because i saw a change in my daughter – she has been a lot more regulated. yes, she’ll have an occasional tantrum, but we’ve learned skills to cope with this better.
“the fun friends and friends for life program is superb! the skills my children took away from the program are simple but vital ones that need to be taught in schools and generally in life. the program facilitators, michelle and agata had a wonderful connection with everyone and really care about what they are doing. thank you to the team at pathways. 
“dear michelle and the team, thank you so much for this amazing opportunity to understand how our little fellas’ minds and bodies work. it has been such a positive experience for us as a family and i know we will continue to care for each other and fill each other’s buckets with lots of love and respect. fun friends holiday program 2018
