qualifacts executive ehr buyer's guide
if you are an executive looking to replace your current ehr system or adopt a new one, you might not know where to start and/or feel overwhelmed by the number of options available in the market. how do you find the best ehr system for your organization’s unique needs and goals? how do you ensure that the ehr system you choose will improve your efficiency, quality of care, client satisfaction, and revenue cycle management?this buyer’s guide is designed to help you answer these questions and more. it will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the benefits of an ehr system for behavioral health and human services providers, the best practices for selecting and implementing an ehr system, and the key features and functionality to look for in an ehr system. unlike other buyer’s guides that might favor certain vendors or products, this guide is vendor-agnostic and based on objective research and opinions from industry experts who have supported hundreds of executive teams through procurement. our goal is to help you make an informed decision that will benefit your organization and your clients.

"i have attended mhca conferences and presented at mhca in the past.  i appreciate the small conference learning, project/learning communities, ceo interaction and learning about bh-aca issues across the u.s.  i would very much appreciate continuing my relationship with mhca." 


 
mary monnatpresident/ceolifeworks nw
  


 


we have a strong desire to grow our organization and serve a greater number of people.  we want to provide more efficient and effective services, and expand our regional organizational footprint.  in order to accomplish these goals we realize the need to learn from other successful organizations.  we realize that by joining mhca we will be exposed to the best organizations from across the country, and hopefully by gaining that perspective we will strengthen our competitive position into our own market.  while our focus is to learn from others, we also hope to modestly share the successes that we have enjoyed when applicable.  from a ceo standpoint, this is a great opportunity to promote leadership development, stimulate thought, and broaden my outlook.
