welcome




the university of wisconsin–madison department of philosophy is located in helen c. white hall, right on the shore of beautiful lake mendota and at the heart of the university campus. its faculty carries on a long and proud tradition of highly acclaimed teaching and research in core areas of philosophy—especially in the philosophy of science and ethics, but also in metaphysics, epistemology, and the history of philosophy. the department attracts nearly two hundred undergraduate majors, and its outstanding ph.d. program has placed graduates in some of the best departments in the country. along with its colloquium program, the department regularly hosts conferences and is the home of the annual wisconsin metaethics workshop.
