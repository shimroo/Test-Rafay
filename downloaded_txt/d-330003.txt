welcome to dark chronicle


what is legacy of kain?
the legacy of kain series is a collection of video games developed by crystal dynamics  (acquired by eidos  in 1998; eidos is now part of the square enix group) and silicon knights .
starting with blood omen: legacy of kain in 1996, there have been five games charting the vampire kain's rise to power within the land of nosgoth, and his attempts to reclaim his true destiny. since legacy of kain: soul reaver was released in 1999, the series has had a second lead character in raziel, a soul-devouring wraith who holds the key to kain's future.
most recently, a free-to-play online multiplayer game called nosgoth was announced in 2013. this sixth game is a departure in format from those that have gone before, featuring neither kain or raziel, and it is set in the time period between raziel's execution and resurrection as a reaver of souls. it is being developed by psyonix .
what is dark chronicle?
dark chronicle is a legacy of kain fan site, originally established in 2002. it aims primarily to be a reference source for the multi-layered storyline of the series: a memory-jogger for veterans that hopefully makes the story more approachable for newcomers too. its secondary purpose is to promote news from and for the fan community.
