	 el senor de los milagros, sf 2005
	 
    
it's a great day to be peruvian, as far away from the catholic church as you might be.  el senor de los milagros is like our lady of fatima and la virgen de guadalupe, a tale of miraculous faith and a celebration of nationality and culture that unites the diverse peoples of peru every october.  the local bay area now has at least 6 different celebrations of this feast day, the founding one being at mission dolores in san francisco.  la hermandad del senor de los milagros hosts the mass and cultural celebration every october 16(or the sunday nearest that date).my dad is a founding member of the san francisco hermandad.  membership requires that you help carry el anda(the heavy wooden platform carrying the image) in the annual procession. it also requires that you wear royal purple robes with a white rope belt.

	 a mama's cooking in the east bay
	 
    
i know jose and rafael because their mother's sister is in the legion of mary with me.  the boys are tall, dark, and handsome but their mama wants to make sure they get right and do it quickly.  in the process of doing my pit-bull thing and checking their homework club cards, i've gotten to know their whole family and finally ventured to their mom's peruvian restaurant this past weekend.  hidden near the san leandro shoreline, luisa's place is on the far edge of san lorenzo, past several factories and the sleepy suburban residential blocks. both a mexican and peruvian restaurant, luisa's boasts authentic drinks, main dishes, and desserts to impress the most discerning peruano food fan.  as we made our way to the far end of grant ave.(right off hesperian blvd. and washington ave. and not far from 880), we eagerly anticipated the meal.  my mom had heard rave reviews from friends and dad had sampled the alfajores, recent gifts from a friend. we stepped into the warm familial vibe of luisa's(both boys came out to meet my whole family)where everyone watched the mexico vs. peru soccer match on the big screen.  we ordered sweet chicha morada(purple corn drink) and dabbed our french bread with bright red rocoto(hot chili sauce.)  the meal began with papa rellena(stuffed potatoes), toasted golden brown, thick with sauteed, seasoned beef, exuding the wonderful scent of garlic and parsley. mom and i ordered pollo a la brasa(seasoned rotisserie chicken), my brother ordered arroz con pollo(green chicken and rice), and dad ordered the quintessential meat and potatoes dish, lomo saltado(sauteed flank with tomatoes, onions, and fries).  our chicken came with crispy fries and fresh salad.  dad's dish came with a mound of white rice. everyone was treated to freshly marinated red onion slices.  the meal had down-home appeal and authentic flavor.  we left the restaurant feeling impressed and involved as our hosts shook our hands or sent us off with warm hugs.  luisa's place is located in san lorenzo on grant ave.  they are open thursday through sunday from 2 to 6pm and they recently started serving breakfast on saturdays and sundays.

	 my favorite shots
	 
    
these are out of sequence for a reason.  i could go on and on but they speak for themselves. they represent the essential impressions of peru, the country which is mine in blood only:  earth, sky, and many survivors amid the debris and dust.

	 old lima
	 
    
tourists love the splendor of colonial lima's architecture.  my family never spends too much time in the capital but one of these days i will. it's a city out of a foreign film.

	 my first bullfight
	 
    
no need to panic animal rights activists.  the bullfight i attended was more family comedy routine than inhumane spectacle.  no swords were used.  eight different bulls were used. one was ridden bronco style but otherwise they were charging clowns including one in drag as mexican comedy legend, la india maria.  we laughed and screamed like crazy.  after all, the bulls are still scary.  i also experienced having a tray of steaming peanuts placed on top of my head and the agony of sitting on old stone benches. ouch!

	 we love birthdays!
	 
    
my uncles jose celebrated his 50something birthday while i was visiting. we celebrated family style with plenty of cristal beer(yum!), picante de cui(guinea pig fricasee), and lots of huayno dancing.  i opened up the dance floor and soon even mom was out there.

	 why i love peru
	 
    
i'm always offended when people rave about visiting peru. i know it is unfair because i should be happy non-peruvians have so much admiration for my homeland.  i think it bothers me because most visitors won't ever truly understand loving a place the way one does when your family is there, either living or dead.  my abuelito marcelo calderon died on july 19, 2001.  he was my father's father, a man who loved music, walking, and spending time with family. he was sensitive, a man who was not afraid to cry like a baby for any and every reason.  when he died, it hurt my father a lot and it left a void in my life.  there isn't a sunday mass where i don't offer his name up for prayers.  when we returned from churin, i asked to go visit my grandpa.  accompanied by my cousin bertha and my nieces, my father and i went to visit his grave.  i didn't want to cry for fear of upsetting my dad.  still, it was an emotional moment when i touched the stone.

	 a day in the life
	 
    
href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1212/216/1600/huachomarketplace.jpg">href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1212/216/1600/huachowastemanagement.jpg">what i miss most about peru are the daily routines, the sights and sounds everyone else takes for granted, the things which make me glad i have a semi-photographic memory:  the noise and smells of la plaza, the people, everyone calling out "caserita" or "caserito", the sacks of wheat, rice, and beans, the yellow chickens hanging from hooks by their beaks, the vendors on bikes and on foot, the packed earth ground, the multicolored flock of cuis(the slang term for the covered motorbike taxis)offering one sol rides, chickens, ducks and guinea pigs in cages, lurid tabloids, the thump of knives on wooden blocks, the obsidian faces of my paisanos.  every morning, the same amazing experiences.

	 heading home
	 
    
two other great things about churin are its climate and elevation.  it's not high enough to get me sick but the air is definitely very clean compared to huacho and especially lima(where the smog seems worse than la).  because it is higher up the sierra, the seasons are reversed so it's summer in churin while  the coast is in winter.  we headed down the hill back to the bus stop but not before the touristy snapshots by the river.

	 lovely town
	 
    
churin is actually a beautiful town. the town square is small but quaint.  before we had a wonderful dinner of pollo a la lena(fire-grilled chicken), the family hung out in the plaza.  i love my abuelita. she is a fierce, strong woman with a sarcastic edge. a woman after my own heart. or before it.

	 banos de fierro
	 
    
the most renowned spa in churin are the banos de fierro at the bottom of the hill. there are two but we went to the older, larger ones.  they are called iron baths because the pools are made of iron and sulfur of some sort is added to the near-boiling steam bath. it smells like rust but it makes your muscles and bones feel great.  even abuelita joined us and had a great time.

	 peruvian spa town
	 
    
churin is renowned for its hot springs and good food. when we first arrived, i have to admit i had doubts.  there were tin roof shacks and more dirt than ever.  then the hotel owners descended on us like hungry scavengers.  my dad, ever the nice guy, tried to hear them all out as they yelled over each other.  i, seasoned solo traveler, tore my duffel bag out of a woman's grasp and headed uphill, determined to find decent lodgings for us.  we settled on the nicest hotel in town.

	 the road to churin
	 
    
we were only in huacho for a day when we decided to have a spa trip to churin.  its thermal baths make it a native tourist favorite.  however, the two hours of bumps and jolts on the dirt road made it memorable as did the beautiful sights on the road.  this breathtaking mountain is one of dozens.

	 my second floor digs
	 
    
i shared the second floor of my grandma's house with my uncles. my tio erasmo, my dad's stepbrother, happens to be a carpenter so he made me this sturdy new bed. it had the sweet smell of bananas and helped me get plenty of rest.

	 the real peru
	 
    
my peru isn't incan ruins or exotic jungle. it isn't andean panpipes, giant animals carved in desert sands, or any of the ethereal, beautiful images produced by promperu(the peruvian tourism campaign responsible for lush commercials in peru and the "awaken your sixth sense" newspaper ads here).  my peru is real, earthy, harsh, yet poignant.  it has an edge.  like me.  this picture was taken from the rooftop of my grandmother's house. i would handwash my laundry there every few days and take in all the urban growth in huacho.

	 a fighter
	 
    
my tio jose(affectionately known as bakcentro, a nickname attributed to his goalie skills) loves his roosters. apparently the fights don't begin until october when the first round of festivals begin.

	 destination huacho
	 
    
huacho is two hours north of lima.  it is considered a city and if you go downtown, it feels like europe with more smog, lax traffic laws, and lots of people who look like me.  a lot of people in huacho are from la sierra so there are a lot of festivals and clubs for people from different areas, towns, and villages.  my family in huacho still raises animals.  tio jose has fighting roosters. this baby chick will one day grow up to be a chicken who will help build up his family of roosters.

	 the family in lima
	 
    
my tio delio is my father's older brother.  he is 70. his second wife, tia maria, works in the fish market and is the best seafood cook we know.  they are very warm and affectionate.cousin violeta is my tia maria's daughter from her first marriage.  she lives on the second floor of the building with her two grandkids.  she is fun and sweet and is set to become my tio roman's third wife.  in peru, almost everyone is your cousin, even if only by marriage.  out of respect and love, we call each other cousin.  we don't distinguish between second or third cousins or cousins once removed. in fact, i've never been able to understand those concepts.  if someone isn't my first cousin(the children of a parent's biological sibling), they are called cousin.

	 another real peruvian experience
	 
    
in addition to the gray skies, dogs are everywhere in peru.  mutts, purebreeds, small, large, mostly very skinny.  flea-bitten, mangy, malnourished, scarred.  they look out from doorways and off rooftops, roam the dusty streets in packs, or climb the heavy stone steps out of company's sight.  they are better pedestrians than humans, rarely getting hit by the thousands of taxis, bikes, and motorized carts that flood most urban and suburban areas. tio delio has two dogs.  the blonde is bobby.  he followed cousin violeta and i to the payphone.  apparently, he follows everyone in the house everywhere.

	 at long last the photos from my trip home
	 
    
we embarked on our voyage on july 16.  everything went smoothly until we got to lax and realized our connecting flight was delayed for 6 hours.  by the time the airline got it together, it was nearly midnight when we boarded the plane.  mom and dad were troopers, as always.  my memories of peru from my very first visit at the age of 4 until last month's voyage are of a land of dust and gray skies.  my family came down from la sierra way back in the day to the coast. most of them don't live in lima but lima is our first stop because of the airport and my tio delio. this was my first pic as we rode in the taxi to el naranjal. gray sky, of course.

	 off to the motherandfatherland
	 
    
at noon tomorrow, we will head over the san mateo bridge to san francisco international airport.  we will arrive in lima, peru on sunday morning.  for the majority of my brief trip, i will reside in huacho, a city about 150 kilometers north of lima.  both sides of the family have resided in huacho for decades, having come down from la sierra(the hills)permanently.  my family comes from a long line of farmers but in the last generation have become tradesmen and business owners.  a few relatives have completed university studies.  my time in peru will be spent mostly with my maternal grandmother.  my abuelita chelia still raises her own chickens, pigeons, guinea pigs, and other animals.  i am looking forward to the home cooking and general sense of calm you feel living in peru.  check out the links for pictures of huacho, peru: http://www.huacho.net

	 why peruvians can't diet
	 
    
potatoes.  white rice.  bread.  these are all foods to avoid for the first two weeks of the south beach diet(which i've been contemplating for about a week since  i want to lose 10 pouds).  there are all foods taboo to the folks on atkins.  ironically, these are staples of peruvian cuisine. visit any peruvian restaurant true to the culture and you will be greeted with a basket of bread to dip in rocoto sauce and your entree is likely to include potatoes and a heaping side of white rice. americans are obsessed with dieting.  given the obesity rate in this country and our failing health, it's no wonder we want to watch what we eat.  but what to do when you're a hyphenated american?  if you're the second generation in the states, chances are you balance two cultures in all respects, daily food intake included.  what if the foods your culture holds near and dear are supposedly bad for you?  what if you still visit the folks on the weekends for home-cooked meals?  what if you're going to the homeland on vacation? how will you explain to the folks back home about your dietary restrictions?  it is a dilemma i have grappled with since summer began. in a week and a half, i will be in peru.  i will be seeing several relatives for the first time in nearly nine years. i will more than likely be treated to breakfasts, lunches, and dinners and even a restaurant visit or two.  will i be watching what i eat then?  of course, i will be careful to watch what i eat.  i don't eat red meat and i'm allergic to shellfish(the greatest peruvian-american tragedy since ben bratt hooked up with julia roberts.)  but will i pass up freshly baked bread(my great-uncle used to run a bakery), steaming white rice and potatoes served with every meal?  probably not.  it would be like rejecting peru itself. the incas were the first people to harvest the potato. the spaniards took them back to europe and the crop was especially plentiful in the lovely green isle of ireland.  you know the rest of the story.  my dna has programmed me to crave carbs.  my culture has taught me to value them.  i will watch what i eat here but can't promise to do so on vacation.

	 bal stop #2:  machu picchu, san mateo
	 
    
this family favorite is now housed in a larger venue on b st. but has the authentic appeal it had when it opened years ago across the street from the st. vincent de paul thrift store.  the storefront window features a doll dressed in cholita fashion along with the requisite peruvian housewares.  once inside, there are several tables and larger than life paintings of colonial cuzco on one wall and manco capac and mama ocllo emerging from lake titicaca on the other. every table is given french bread and two sauces with their menus. the lime green rocoto sauce was mild but tasty.  the garlic and parsley spread was not too oily and smelled divine.  our group decided to try two traditional peruvian appetizers:  palta rellena(chicken salad stuffed avocado) and papa a la huancaina, my absolute favorite(boiled potatoes in feta cheese sauce).  we also ordered a pitcher of chicha morada(sweet purple corn punch). service has always been a little shaky at machu picchu, friendly but painstakingly slow. i am happy to report that our appetizers arrived one after the other not too long after we ordered.  both dishes were spread on fresh lettuce.  the palta was firm and the chicken salad tender, mixed with what tasted like fresh diced carrots and mayonnaise.  papa a la huancaina was mild but delightfully rich and creamy.  the chicha seemed freshly made with the right blend of lemon juice and pineapple chunks. we ordered our entrees: ceviche mixto(fish and shrimp in lemon juice), lomo saltado(the perennial steak and potatoes sautee), pollo saltado(the no red meat-eater alternative), camaron al ajo(shrimp in garlice and white wine sauce), and pescado saltado(the fish version of the other saltados).  with the exception of the ceviche, all the dishes came with long-grain white rice. unfortunately the fish dishes arrived before the saltado and the shrimp so there was awkward waiting. my pollo saltado was wonderful.  the chicken breast pieces were larger than usual, tender chunks rather than the fajita-like strips i usually make.  the tomatoes, red onions, and french fries were cooked to the right consistency.  everyone else had a favorable review of their meal. another great surprise was the price.  everyone paid $21 which included the tip.  if you're willing to brave the peninsula traffic and to search the neighborhood for parking and you don't mind some waiting, machu picchu is a great authentic peruvian restaurant.
