our washington ranch 
			consists of more than 12000 acres, located in the magnificent 
			columbia river gorge national scenic area. 
			this ranch is located across the columbia river from the dalles, 
			oregon. it is an operating cattle ranch and 
			we raise approximately 18 species of exotic animals, most of which 
			are available for sale. we take pride in raising only the finest 
			quality animals which receive the best of care and food available. 
			we welcome any inquiries 
			regarding the availability of our animals.
our ranch contains 
			abundant fresh water springs and wonderful well water, which helps 
			keep the animals healthy. our animals are not enclosed in tiny pens 
			like a zoo, but roam in spacious wide-open areas.
