   frequently asked questions
    
     can you tell me more about what you do?

  




  chocolate fountain heaven offers the best quality chocolate fountain services in the area. Â in addition to our chocolate fountains, gerra & rick are musicians who perform for wedding ceremonies followed by cocktail hour music as well as funerals and memorial services. call us today if you would like to learn more about what we do, or book a service.



   what kind of chocolate can be used in the fountain?

  




  we recommend chocolate that has been formulated for chocolate fountains, where adding oil isn't needed.Â 



   what is the maximum number of guests that the chocolate fountain will serve?

  




  the quote that we give with our large fountain includes enough chocolate for the number of guests who are attending. additional chocolate for a larger number of guests can be included in the quote.



   what dipping item isnâ€™t recommended to use with the fountain?

  




  anything that will break apart easily or is crumbly--especially pound cake--which tends to compromise the smooth, flowing nature of the chocolate. "chocolate fountain heaven" recommends a more heavenly Â healthful, choice--low fat or no fat angel food cake. it has a more substantial texture than the regular angel food cake.



   do you provide the dipping items?

  




  because of liability issues, only chocolate fountain heaven can provide the dipping items. they will be priced on a per-person basis.



   iâ€™m having a garden event. can the chocolate fountain be used outside?

  




  we do not recommend using the chocolate fountain outdoors. the chocolate fountain has such a sweet, inviting aroma that all god's 'heavenly' creatures are tempted to partake! in addition, the chocolate must be kept at a certain temperature, and fluctuating outdoor conditions will greatly affect the chocolate's integrity.



   how long can i have the chocolate fountain at my event?

  




  most people are using the chocolate fountain during the appetizer segment of their event. our package includes 2.5 hours of fountain enjoyment, and this is usually plenty of time for your guests to enjoy this unique experience! should you decide to use the chocolate fountain throughout the event, additional time can be quoted. additional time beyond what is contracted is $35 per half hour.



   who is responsible for set-up, tear-down and clean up of the chocolate fountain?

  




  we are! we arrive about 90 minutes before the designated starting time, ensuring that your guests will smell the sweet aroma of the chocolate as they enter the room. a professionally dressed attendant will be there at all times to show your guests how to enjoy the fountain as well as to keep the fountain pristine at all times. presentation is of utmost important to us. our attendants are more than happy to replenish the accompaniments and to keep the appearance of the table at its finest.



   what are the table and electrical requirements?

  




  the chocolate fountain requires a 120 volt grounded electrical outlet within 10 feet of the location of the fountain. in addition, a sturdy table is mandatory. if itâ€™s not level, the chocolate will not flow properly. please re-confirm these requirements with your banquet manager before the event so that there is no delay in the set-up of the fountain. in addition, the banquet facility should provide a table skirt.



   who decorates the area around the chocolate fountain?

  




  we do! whether it's a wedding reception, baby shower, graduation party, birthday bash, or Â chocolate fountain heaven incorporates theme-based fabrics to decorate the base of the chocolate fountain. Â our chocolate fountains look absolutely fabulous!



   what happens to the leftover chocolate?

  




  Â we are happy to send you home with our premium leftover chocolate if you provide us with a few smaller, plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. Â it keeps beautifully for about a year in the freezer. Â if you choose not to take the chocolate home, it is disposed of. Â we do not recycle our chocolate from customer to customer. Â 



   whatâ€™s required to reserve the chocolate fountain?

  




  a $200 non-refundable deposit is required to reserve your date. all major credit cards are accepted by either using pay pal on our site, or calling us with your credit card number. if you choose to pay by check, your date can only be held for 3 business days. after we receive your deposit, you will be sent 2 contracts via us mail. sign them, keep one for your records, and mail the other to us. the balance is due 2 weeks before your event.
