april brings dramatic changes to palmer. the days grow rapidly shorter – literally by losing about 6 minutes of daylight each day so that breakfast is now in the dark, dinner the sun, if seen is dropping into the horizon. winter is clearly setting in as also evident in the early morning station opening image - recent persistent snowfalls whitewashing palmer’s rocky terrain.

one of my favorite places to be is in a boat, but when i’m not out in a zodiac in my sea boots and bright orange hellies and float coat, i can often be found indoors, clad in much less conspicuous garb – well, unless you count my banana print crocs as conspicuous. where do my flashy feet and i spend time when i’m not dive tending or helping with the experiment? see the station from my perspective in this whimsical tour of palmer featuring my main haunts and treasured station features.

last week we had the opportunity to go on a ‘dive trip’ beyond our normal boating and diving range. we usually dive from open, zodiac boats as you’ve read about in other posts, and we don’t go out of what is referred to as the “local” boating area. that is within a radius of two to three miles from the station. a main reason for staying relatively close is because if a diver somehow had a bad leak in their dry suit (unlikely, but not impossible) going much further would make for a very cold ride home.

antarctica is renowned for its isolation from the rest of the world. there are no cities on the continent. no homes, no businesses, and, most importantly, no grocery stores. this can become a problem when you are trying to feed forty-five people on station, and the closest grocery store is days away.

i have been doing a lot of diving lately.  most of my underwater excursions (6 in the last 4 days!) have included videotaping the lovely communities living on the seafloor in the waters around the station. much of what we see is permanently attached to large rocks so we cannot collect them to live temporarily in the station’s sorting table.  for today’s episode of all creatures i will use scene grabs from the videos to introduce you to creatures that are fixed in place.  read on to ‘be at home’ with these homebody critters.

the time came for me to pack up my belongings and head back home. leaving station, i had lots of mixed feelings. i’d made so many great friends who i knew i wouldn’t be able to see nearly as often, and i was sad to leave the beautiful ecosystem i’ve gotten to know over the past few months behind. however, i was also really missing my friends and family in alabama and was excited to get back. as the ship got loaded up and ready to leave, i shared emotional goodbyes with all my friends, including hannah, jami, chuck, and maggie, who are staying on station to continue the experiment. i stalled for as long as possible before finally boarding the lmg and waving to palmer station as we pulled off the pier and into the southern ocean.

a couple of weeks ago, we were able to start our main experiment for this field season that took nearly two months to set up. while this was a super exciting accomplishment, our team’s work is far from over. there are certain tasks (like titrations, spec work, and molt collecting, oh my!) that need to be completed daily. these tasks not only help ensure that our ph treatments are correctly set, but also allow us to collect some of our data throughout the experiment. today, i am going to walk you through a typical workday for experiment maintenance.

now that we have the experiment started, as hannah discusses in her most recent post, we’re done sorting amphipods and have moved onto doing seawater chemistry. every morning we test six water samples from randomly selected buckets to give us more precise measures of the conditions than a ph probe by itself can provide. each of us has our own job that we take care of, which for me is running titrations to calculate the alkalinity of the water (a measure of the sample’s ability to buffer added acids and resist changes to ph). meanwhile, jami is running the spectrophotometer to determine ph, and hannah is measuring the ph of all 24 tanks with the handheld probe to make sure the ones we aren’t testing that day are still at the right level.

as you’ve read in other posts, we wear a lot of stuff when diving. a lot of heavy stuff. we have to get everything into the boat on station and onto us at the dive site. then we need help getting it back into the boat at the end of the dive, and everything has to get back out of the boat on return station to make diving possible overall. that doesn’t happen without a lot of help and hard work by the dive tenders.

sunday morning until 1pm is team uab in a’s ‘day’ off for the week. despite the high winds the night before and again predicted for our day of leisure, the morning weather was somewhat calm and i decided a trip to the backyard was overdue. backyard? why shouldn’t our southern home have one? palmer’s is the rocky area behind station before reaching the ice/snow of the glacier introduced in my first entry. the image below shows the expanse of our rocky, bouldered backyard ending at the glacier’s edge.

the lmg left the dock around 9:15 am on february 10. the boat was rocking quite intensely at first, so i decided i would put on my scopolamine patch that night. the patch is good for three days, and we were scheduled to reach the infamous drake passage sometime on the morning of the 12th.
after lunch, we mustered in the lounge for a fire drill and safety training. we boarded the impressive lifeboats and toured the labs. it was amazing to see how everything from trash receptacles to centrifuges had been secured to ensure lab safety on the ship. in the afternoon, we donned float coats, sea boots, and fisherman’s gloves to practice climbing up and down a ladder.

after a combined 13.5 hours of flights and 10.5 hours of layovers – all the while wearing kn-95 masks – i finally arrived in punta arenas, chile around 4:30 pm local time, along with my fellow lmg-bound friends, whom i had met on the way. after checking into the hotel and having dinner at the hotel restaurant, i went straight to sleep. it had been over 24 hours since i’d been able to sleep without a mask on and in a bed.
