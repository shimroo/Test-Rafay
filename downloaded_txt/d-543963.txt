if you use email, be sure to put 
"internet training" in the email's subject, so i have a chance to notice your 
email in my inbox. once we have emailed a couple of times, i will create an 
email filter that should automatically move your email into a "client folder" in 
my email program. there i will notice all your emails regardless of the email's 
subject.
