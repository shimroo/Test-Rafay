bolt removal and replacement techniques
when possible, bolts should be replaced by reusing & expanding the original hole. there are many different types of bolts out there and techniques to remove them often take specialized tools and techniques. our goal here is to help educate climbers about how to be good hardware stewards to the climbing areas we love.

why support the asca?as our cliffs are receiving more traffic from climbers than ever before, the bolts that we trust our life to are aging. we need to maintain this hardware in a coordinated and informed way.  asca rebolters have the time, experience, and desire to replace many more bolts with the help of your donation.
