p i o n e e r   t o w nimagine a day when desperadoes faced off with the local law and decent citizens rubbed shoulders with card sharps and fancy ladies. in pioneer town, located at 7a, you can spend the day and weave your way through the opera house, cowboy museum, game room, bottle house, print shop, ice cream parlor, log cabins and storefronts. take a few pictures of your kiddos in the shoe-shining seat, on the life-sized plastic horse or behind the “wanted" poster.

o u r   s t o r y   7a ranch has been a family-owned resort for over 70 years. in 1946, r.l. czichos bought seven acres of ranch land along the blanco river with a dream to create a family vacation resort. since then, wimberley has been hit hard by flooding, but renovations and rebuilding are in progress and 7a is finding new life. each year, new memories are made as individuals, families and groups come back to visit this magical place.




    a unique history
  

























 

w i m b e r l e y ,  t xour cabins and houses are set in a pretty little town called wimberley. slow-living is the motto here. find sweet art galleries, small shops and home-style eateries throughout this texas destination. hiking, swimming, shopping and site-seeing are the main wimberley attractions.
