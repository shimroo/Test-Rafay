the middle chamber
a symposium on masonic esoterika


the middle chamber: a symposium on masonic esoterika is a day-long conference devoted to topics of interest to the craft. this is an opportunity to gather together with other masons who are interested in a deeper study of the symbolism and a more profound examination of the mysteries of our fraternity.
we are once again offering this chance to attend presentations by some of the area’s most prolific masonic authors and speakers. it is also an excellent time to connect with other like-minded brethren to assist each other in our collective journey toward more light.
while there is no fee to attend, we do ask that you register using the link at the top of this page. meals will be available at your own expense during the scheduled lunch break.
this event is open to master masons only, who are in good standing with the grand lodge of tennessee, or with any other grand lodge with which it is in amity.  a current dues card indicating that the attendee is a master mason in good standing will be required at the door.
the middle chamber – a symposium on masonic esoterika is made possible with support from the following:

the tennessee lodge of research
the nashville valley of the ancient and accepted scottish rite
west nashville phoenix lodge #131

our sincere appreciation goes out to these organizations for their ongoing support.
