i am incredibly happy by the results i have received after taking dragon herbs brand supplements. they are high-quality, and their team of herbalist will help you for free.

— harmony s.





amazingly powerful chinese tonic herbs. herb blends and tinctures you can actually feel working. i’ve never seen 8:1 ratios with tinctures from other companies. watch out everything here is addictive!!

— noah v.





quality products, no fillers, reasonable prices and above all they work. i won’t go anywhere else to purchase as i trust the authenticity and ron doesn’t compromise the quality. just need an elixir bar in nashville, tn.

— m.j. r.





estoy tomando alchemy tonic is the best , es lo mejor para desayunar y evitar grasas y azucares. eleuthero en gotas me ayudó a estabilizar mis nervios y el american ginseng es hoy mi favorito para trabajar sin fatigue. gracias ron teeguarden y gracias a tu equipo de personas dedicadas a ayudarnos en la salud. desde dallas texas.

                        di tao – authentic locations                    


dragon herbs is truly different from every other company in the western world in its emphasis on obtaining its herbs from the genuine original sources from which the herbs made their reputations over thousands of years. in asia, there is a term for this — it is di tao. di tao literally means “earth tao,” but its real meaning is “the authentic true source.” learn more » 




                        major tonic herbs                    


what is a “tonic herb”? the term “herb” is used more broadly in asia than it is in the west. in asian tradition the term “herbs” refers to botanicals, just as it does in the west. but the term also includes natural minerals (from earth and sea), and it includes some animal products that have known functions, such as deer antler. 99% of dragon herbs ingredients are botanical, and 98% of our products are vegan. a few are natural minerals and a few are derived from animals. go to learn menu and select major tonic herb to learn more about each major tonic herb.
