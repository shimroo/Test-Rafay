what are bossons?

bossons decorative pieces were made by w.h. bossons, ltd., of congleton, england between 1948 and 1996. they include wall masks (heads), animals, barometers, mirrors, thermometers, bookends, lamp bases, pottery figures and much, much more!more information and photos are available in the 'about us - bossons artware' tab.










































 
it is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of donna mclernon on may 19, 2024.

donna served as the 4th president/ executive director of the international bossons collectors society from 2015 until her passing. she worked diligently throughout these years to support the organization – communications,  the newsletter, annual meetings,  finances, website and everything else that goes with managing the organization. 
but it was donna’s organizational skills, positive attitude, her appreciation of the bossons artwork and her love of the contacts and friendships developed during her tenure that made her truly shine.
thank you for all you did for the ibcs. you will be missed.=================================
please be assured that options are being reviewed to ensure the continuation of the organization. we will go forward
