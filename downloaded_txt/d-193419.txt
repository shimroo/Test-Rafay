kiskiack golf course in williamsburg
dean fiel, 9/14/2016
    kiskiack golf club is located in a top 25 golf destination and is a 4 1/2 star rated golf course and is just a small sample of what williamsburg golf has to offer.  the golf course is a favorite for locals and golf travelers alike.  the resort style-country club feel provides a fun, yet challenging experience for golfers of all skill levels.  kiskiack offers 5 sets of tees, that range and up to almost 6800 yards.  the front nine allows you to relax as the course flows through natural terrain, rolling hills, and mature hardwoods, along with 2 lakes that come into play throughout the round, before a testing uphill finish.  the back will provide more enjoyment, yet plenty of trouble for much of the 9 holes, if you hit the ball to far right off the tee.  starting of the back nine is a par 4 with an elevated tee that dog legs right overlooking water.   setting up the signature par 3 eleventh hole that will require an accurate shot to navigate the beautifully surrounded green by water, to the par 5 eighteenth hole that offers much risk/award.
