welcome to harland's creek farm, llc!      
we are an organic farm in chatham county, north carolina. we grow and sell organic herbs, flowers, and fruits.
                                                  organic eggs are available from our pastured-raised hens 
we farm organically to protect the earth, our staff, and our customers. we use plastic-free packaging—paper and glassine. since we adopted plastic-free packaging we have kept over 30,000 plastic bags out of the waste stream.
the seasons rule
greens love the cool days of spring and fall. tomatoes need heat. roots spend a long time in the ground.  visit our product list page weekly to see what is available.
