berries & bliss at the foot of mt. monadnock

 

monadnock berries is more than a pick your own berry farm with a view that makes you want to stay forever. it is a place where people come together, because family is central to everything we do. some families work the land here alongside our own, some gather here to pick berries and connect year after year, others celebrate their union here with weddings. everyone who gives to or harvests from this land feels a special connection to it. we grow delicious, bountiful blueberries, raspberries, gooseberries and currants. we cultivate memories, health, and kinship too.
