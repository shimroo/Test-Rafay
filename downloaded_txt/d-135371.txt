            133 - obama's america vs. mccain's america: ten reasons undecideds
            should choose obama
 

            usually on blast the right you hear me condemn right-wing ideology
            and policies. not only the theory, but the negative effect of
            right-wing rule on flesh-and-blood humans.

            then the idea is, you use the information to win the water cooler
            wars, to "blast the right."

            with just about a month to go before the election, arguing with
            right-wingers isn't the most productive use of your time now, i
            don't think.

            this presidential election could well be razor-tight. the polls
            consistently indicate that 4-8% of the electorate says they're
            undecided. and what really struck me, up to a total of 18% say they
            could still change their mind.

            so in this podcast i'm going to set out ten reasons undecideds and
            persuadables should choose obama, hopefully in a way undecideds and
            persuadables will find convincing.

            a bit softer in tone and rhetoric than usual, since undecided voters
            are generally ideological and want "just the facts,
            ma'am."

            the ten reasons cover the following areas:

            1. proper role of government
            2. supreme court
            3. right to choose
            4. taxes
            5. minimum wage
            6. unions
            7. health care
            8. safeguarding our food, water & air
            9. presidential vetoes
            10. war and peace

            132 - right-wing deception is exemplified by sarah palin and john
            mccain: a case study in earmarks
 
             
            today, you'll hear all about earmarks, one of john mccain's pet
            issues.

            sarah palin claims to be a reformer, yet she is the empress of
            earmarks, requesting this year more per capita than the governor of
            any other state.

            would it surprise you to learn that mccain seems quite confused
            about the facts, and that palin is clearly outright lying?

            plenty of clips of these two esteemed elected officials to keep your
            blood boiling.

            bonus points: can you guess whether it's the blue states or the red
            states which overall take far more out of the federal treasury than
            they put in? listen to find out the answer...

            (ps: right-wingers, if you want to write in to me, fine, but at
            least do me the courtesy of listening to the podcast first. please
            don't respond just on the basis of the brief preview above.
            thanks!!)

in our 
              country: 
10% of americans grab 
              46% of the income and control 
              71% of the wealth. how on earth can the rest survive with so little 
              left over?
americans, 
              let's take back our country! 

globally:
25% of the people grab 
              75% of the income and
              20% of the people control 
              86% of the wealth
there's 
              simply not enough left over for the other 4-5 billion people to 
              survive!
people 
              of the world, let's take back our planet! ...and the pope 
              agrees!

all 
              you need to know

the modern conservative is engaged in one 
              of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search 
              for a superior moral justification for selfishness.
                                      john 
              kenneth galbraith

the jack clark corollary

everything the right-wing does is designed 
              to accomplish one of two things, either:
              (a) transfer wealth from everyone else to the rich, or,
              (b) distract everyone else from the fact that (a) is occurring.

take 
              the right-winger's iq (ignorance quotient) test!

right-wing 
              freedom-of-speech deniers, heed these words:
"to announce that there must be no criticism 
              of the president, or that we are to stand by the president, right 
              or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable 
              to the american public." 
              (theodore 
              roosevelt, 1918)



share 
                the burden equally: 
                reinstate the draft!
