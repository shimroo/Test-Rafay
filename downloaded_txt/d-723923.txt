 “enter by the narrow gate. for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. for the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few." 
matthew 7:13-14serious words from jesus! in our world today those who follow him can readily see the masses on their trek to destruction on the wide path! it's all around us. yet, as followers of jesus christ, we are commanded to share his gospel with all those around us. sometimes though, we forget that is the holy spirit that does the convicting and the saving of a lost sinner. we, dear brothers and sisters, are just messengers of his word!each week, susan and i are honored to engage in street ministry right here in the vibrant west houston/katy area. our drive-thru prayer initiative, which kicked off about a year ago, has been a tremendous blessing, connecting us with a diverse array of individuals. from the homeless seeking solace to neighborhood residents out walking their dogs, from busy mothers with children to seasoned businessmen, and from delivery drivers to nurses and hospital staff — our encounters are as varied as they are meaningful.﻿in the midst of these interactions, we have the privilege of sharing in the joys and struggles of those we meet. from heartfelt conversations with pastors and church staff to comforting chats with patients and real estate agents, we listen to their needs, hurts, and pains, and offer prayers of support and encouragement.
 
 drive-thru prayer
spring 2024﻿
 through our prayers, we aim to guide each individual towards god's "narrow gate," the path to eternal life. it's truly awe-inspiring to witness god's hand at work in the lives of many we encounter. while some outcomes are clear, others remain unknown, but we trust in god's sovereignty and leave the results in his capable hands. together, we continue to spread hope, love, and faith in our community, one prayer at a time.
