dr. gene scott's bio
dr. gene scott was the pastor of the university cathedral, the largest protestant congregation in downtown los angeles. 
dr. scott's teaching style was characterized by a professorial approach to investigating, unpacking and presenting god's word through studies in languages, grammar, history, theology, sciences, psychology and other academic fields. consequently, his work was exhaustively researched, and during his lifetime he amassed the largest collection of rare bibles in private hands.
 dr. gene scott and pastor melissa scott, ph.d., are the first and only biblical scholars to provide 24/7 global access to pre-recorded and live messages, with students in 180 countries. a staunch advocate for church freedom, dr. scott helped write and fought for passage of the petris bill, and was a steering voice for church leaders nationwide who are indebted to him for his research, advocacy, and clarity on the subject of giving.
