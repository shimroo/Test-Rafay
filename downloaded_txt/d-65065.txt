never before have we   seen an elvis presley concert from the 1950's with sound. until now! the dvd   contains recently discovered unreleased film of elvis   performing 6 songs, including heartbreak hotel and don't be   cruel, live in tupelo mississippi 1956. included we see a live performance   of the elusive long tall sally seen here for the first time ever. 
+ plus bonus dvd audio.
this is an excellent release no fan should be without it. 
the   'parade' footage is good to see as it puts you in the right context with color   and b&w footage. the interviews of elvis' parents are well worth hearing   too. the afternoon show footage is wonderful and electrifying :   here is elvis in his prime rocking and rolling in front of 11.000 people. highly recommended.
