frequently asked questions
where are you located?
the sfspca rescue ranch is located in homestead florida.
when may i come visit the horses available for adoption?
the sfspca rescue ranch is not open for public visits.
potential adopters are allowed to visit the horses after their adoption application has been approved. the adoption application is available on the website.
volunteers are allowed to visit the ranch after completion of their orientation class.
donors are invited to schedule private tours for their chosen group of participants.
what is the horse or livestock adoption fee?
horse adoption fees vary. generally, the horse adoption fee’s start at $500.00. the thoroughbreds adoption fee are slightly higher, and generally start at $1,000.00. there are always variable factors that may decrease or increase an adoption fee.
livestock adoption fees vary, but are generally nominal, the quality of home placement matters most. we will not adopt out if there is any likelihood they will be sold at auction or used for meat.
will you take in my horse or pony?
unfortunately, we are not able to take in “owner surrender” horses, ponies or other animals. all our animals have come to use because of abandonment, starvation or some kind of cruelty situation. we are a transition facility; we are not a sanctuary.
how can i volunteer at the south florida spca?
step one is to become a member of the south florida spca through our website here.
step two is to schedule your attendance at our volunteer orientation class.
step three is to reach out to schedule your day and time to volunteer.
