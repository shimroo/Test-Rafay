sunglasses tips
when it comes to sunglasses, we've been there, done that, now serving 387 tips in 26 categories ranging from aviator sunglasses to water sports sunglasses.











											what kind of sunglasses should i wear while i waterski?
									 	

invest in your eyes and your safety with water sports sunglasses
eyesave tip: when you're waterskiing, it's imperative that your line of vision is clear. after all, the other skiers, boaters and swimmers count on it. however, between the sun shining and the wind blowing in your face, you don't always see as well as you should. so it's no wonder that more and more waterskiers are investing in water sports sunglasses.
a great pair of water sports sunglasses, like maui jim sunglasses, will offer great protection against the sun's harmful uv rays, and yet still be versatile enough to perform all of your favorite water activities. also, with rubber nose grips and saltwater effectiveness, you'll be looking sharp while watching your friends and family ski – and seeing sharply when it's (finally!) your turn to ski. 
so before you head out to the boat, make sure you grab your pair of maui jim sunglasses. you'll not only be protecting your eyes, but you'll help be helping to protect everyone else in the water too.

											where do i find sunglasses for surfing?
									 	

watersports sunglasses that fit you and your lifestyle
eyesave tip: as a surfer, you naturally spend a large portion of your day in the sun. you probably prepare for your day in the ocean by applying sunscreen, eating a healthy breakfast and drinking plenty of fluids. however, if that's all you're doing to prepare for the sun then you may be skipping a crucial step in planning for your day – putting on your sunglasses. research has indicated that a large amount of exposure to uv rays can increase a person's chances to develop cataracts. if you haven't already invested in a pair of water sports sunglasses, then check out arnette sunglasses. 
“the original action sport eye wear brand,” arnette sunglasses are made with quality and style in mind. no matter what sports you play, with polarized, green, gray (smoked) and brown lenses, they are sure to have just the right pair for you. arnette sunglasses for water sports will not only fit you, but they'll fit your lifestyle.

											what are the  best pair of sunglasses for a fisherman?
									 	

see more fish with the costa del mar 580 lens
eyesave tip: when you're fishing, you're probably not thinking about the sun's uva and uvb rays damaging your skin and your eyes. you're probably not even thinking about the beautiful scenery around you. you're probably only thinking about one thing: catching that fish. but did you know that the right pair of sunglasses can actually help you catch a fish?
costa del mar sunglasses created a patented line of lenses, called the 580 lens, that can help you separate your fish from the water. the lenses enhance color and sharpen contrast by blocking the yellow light that your eyes can't process. when wearing the 580 lens, you can see the fish more easily and at greater depths than using your eyes alone. plus, they are so comfortable that you may forget you're even wearing sunglasses.
so before you get on that boat, remember to bring your costa del mar sunglasses. you'll not only be protecting your eyes, but you'll be more adept at sighting fish.

											what are the best driving lenses?
									 	

going for a drive? bring your serengeti sunglasses along for the ride
eyesave tip: a long drive can give you time to think, de-stress and unplug from the high-tech world. long drives can be a great bonding experience for family, friends or couples too. whether you're driving around in circles or following your favorite scenic route, it's important to shield your eyes from the sun's glare. that's why serengeti sunglasses created their exclusive line of polarmax lenses. they cut the glare from the sun and the water so you can concentrate on the scenery. plus, they offer virtually 100% uv protection of both uva and uvb rays. 
so whether you're taking a drive just to clear your head, or to spend quality time with your spouse, be sure to take your serengeti sunglasses with you. wearing them will not only protect your eyes, but their anti-glare technology will also help you see the road more clearly, so you can protect your loved ones when you're behind the wheel.

											where do i find sunglasses with 100% uv lenses?
									 	

get 100% uv protection with kate spade sunglasses
eyesave tip: when you're out in the hot summer sun, protecting your skin is as important as keeping yourself hydrated. that's why your mother always tells you to, "wear sunscreen!" and, "drink plenty of water!" however, did you know that the sun's uv rays can also cause damage to your eyes? that's why it's important to wear good, quality sunglasses with 100% uv protection.
kate spade sunglasses are not only trendy, but they offer great protection for your eyes. wear the meryl oversized glasses with smoky lenses to look like a movie star while walking down the street. then don the sweet allie aviators (complete with decorative gems on the arms) to an outdoor luncheon. and definitely wear the cute alberta's to look chic at the beach. all of these glasses are 100% adorable and all offer 100% uv protection. kate spade also offers styles featuring polarized lenses, which cut down on blinding glare.
so whatever you're doing in the sun, make sure you're wearing your stylish kate spade sunglasses. your friends will compliment you. your eyes will thank you.

											where can i get one pair of sunglasses to help me perform multiple activities?
									 	

see every inch of the road with smith interchangeable lenses
eyesave tip: whether you're driving into the sunset or cycling through the mountains, you know that your eyes need to see every inch of the road. however, different situations call for different lenses. so you cut the sun's glare by wearing polarized lenses made especially for driving, and you cut the snow glare by wearing sunglasses with an amber or yellow tinted lens. however, did you know that you can now wear the same pair of sunglasses for these situations and more? it's easy. just invest in smith sunglasses with interchangeable lenses.
smith interchangeable sunglasses feature distortion-free, 9 base lenses that give you a crystal clear view of the world while protecting your eyes from harmful uv rays. their patented line of interlock interchangeable lenses comes with polarized tlt carbonic lenses that can be replaced with their up to 14 different shades of lenses. so whether you're biking, driving, or playing tennis, you can do it all in one pair of frames with smith interchangeable lenses.
