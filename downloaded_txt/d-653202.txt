“palm trees ltd planted two trees in about an hour. i was amazed at how quickly [they] dug these huge holes -- by hand! i was also very impressed with how polite and respectful the foreman was to his workers. no yard damage. very professional and courteous....left us with instructions on how to care for them. we are ordering several more trees from them.”



-dan f.








“we had 7 privacy trees put in and they turned out beautiful! the crew was helpful and efficient - there were 8 guys out working! the process was easy and they made great recommendations on the type of tree we needed for our marshy yard!”
