when the minutes become hours: the secretary’s lament



dec 9, 2024




how often has this happened to you: you approach a board member about their willingness to serve as board secretary, and their immediate response is, “oh, thanks for asking, but i’m not a very good note taker.”  or: “i don’t have the time to prepare the minutes.”   or, more likely: “ugh.  really?  there’s no one else who can take notes?”

“you talkin’ to me?  are you talkin’ to me?”
