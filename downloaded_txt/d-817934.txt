the village of country living
 
the village of wadsworth was incorporated in 1962. our current population is 3,517, according to the 2020 decennial census. 
 
we pride ourselves on our rural character, exemplified by the one-acre minimum requirement for residential lots and also the proximity to active farmlands and lake county forest preserve land holdings. 
 
we are located in northern lake county, il, within benton, newport and warren townships. our neighbors include the cities of waukegan and zion, and the villages of beach park, gurnee and old mill creek. 
 

the village of country living warmly salutes and welcomes commuters entering and leaving the state of illinois at the northern end of i-94 at the wisconsin state line.
