masilc promotes greater access, inclusion, and independence for people with disabilities in massachusetts.
masilc works closely with the 10 centers for independent living  (cils) in massachusetts.
every state has a silc. one of the primary responsibilities of the silc is to develop the spil, or state plan for independent living.
