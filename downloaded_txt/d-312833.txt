known for chowders, codfish cakes, apple pie and, yes, enough boston baked beans to merit the nickname beantown, boston also brims with options for new england clambakes, lobster rolls and other seafood-oriented classics. yet the region's multi-cultural populace also brings a treasure-trove of international cuisines from chinese, japanese, thai and other asian delicacies, spicy moroccan dishes and authentic flavors of the ukraine to french-cambodian fusion fare. some insiders claim boston and its cambridge area -- home to the bull & finch pub, tv's classic cheers bar -- have the best casual restaurants of just about anywhere.
