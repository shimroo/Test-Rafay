adventure city is a must go to place, it's a hidden amusement park that sits in the shadows of those big guys. the place is clean, well-kept and with friendly staff that are there to make sure everyone has a good time. triple the fun at a fraction of the cost.

this park was great fun for our whole family. my wife and i took 3 kids ages 7, 8, 9. the kids had so much fun riding the rides and they got to ride as much as they wanted. my kids have been to bigger theme parks and the hate having to stand in line to ride. this was a perfect place them.

we had so much fun. my grandson loved it!! and the best part is he could go on so many of the rides. there was free parking, and the price to get in was very reasonable. my friend and her son came down from vegas, and we laughed and smiled so much watching the kids that our cheeks hurt.
