kelly coleman
otr/l





“introducing interactive metronome to our facility has not only changed our approach to facilitating treatment techniques, but has also allowed us to target a population who felt there was no hope in improving their quality of life. my patients who have completed the im program have found the ability to return to meaningful activities by improving their balance, coordination, and overall confidence in their daily lives. not only has this program brought us great results from a treatment perspective, but it has allowed our facility to grow and be known throughout the community.”
