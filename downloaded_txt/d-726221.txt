    beaver lakefront cabins, suites & lakehouse

a luxurious getaway for couples and adults
resting on the shoreline of beaver lake and within easy driving distance of eureka springs, our elegant cabin resort is designed for exciting weekend getaways, luxurious romantic honeymoons and unforgettable arkansas vacations.

 romantic cabins & suites

with the exception of the hot tub lake house, all of our modern, spacious accommodations are intended for couples looking for a carefully crafted environment in which to enjoy each other's company and reconnect. we offer six secluded, spacious cabins spread out on a hillside facing the lake, an additional cabin we call the bluff cabin built on an interesting rock formation, five relaxing lake view suites in our main lodge building each with an outstanding, panoramic view of the lake, and our two newest treehouse-like sky suites featuring private decks with fire tables, steam showers, and smart home technology.

    hot tub lake house

we are pleased at the addition of the upscale hot tub lake house to our inventory. designed for anything from romantic getaways, couples traveling together to local events, reunions, or vacations with friends, family or co-workers, the lodge can accommodate from two to ten adults and comes with many unique amenities including a luxurious, 7-person hot tub, slate pool table, elevated deck with fire pit, and a beautiful, glass-walled dining room facing the lake. its four bedrooms with pillow-top mattresses, five baths, ample parking and robust audio-visual technology throughout allow you to spread out in comfort, and when its time to go swimming, the lake is a short, 75-yard walk directly out the back door.

 vacation on beaver lake

 arkansas’ best vacation spot

from eureka springs west to beaver lake and in the surrounding ozark mountains, you will find many activities and unique attractions. consider a visit to the national historic register's blue spring heritage center sourcing over 38 million gallons a day. into big wildlife? consider the 500 acre turpentine creek wildlife refuge housing over 100 rescued big cats. the area also offers zip lining, horseback riding, caving at war eagle caverns, scuba diving near the beaver dam, hiking at lake leatherwood, bird watching, and of course, the stunning white river is renowned for its trout fishing and recreational canoeing.

 location

beaver lake is approximately 50 miles long and has 483 miles of shoreline and has numerous coves and branches. we are located at the eastern end of the lake where the water is clear and deep and provides for excellent fishing and quiet seclusion. the lake is quite large, 50 sq. miles, and we're fortunate to be located in one of the larger branches but not on the main body so we don't have to contend with the crowds and noise.
