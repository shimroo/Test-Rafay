what is homeopathy 



homeopathy is a holistic approach to healthcare that has been practiced for over two centuries. developed by dr. samuel hahnemann in 1796 in germany, it is a therapeutic approach that utilizes natural medicines derived from the plant, animal, and mineral kingdoms. these remedies are prepared in highly potentized doses and are known for their effectiveness and safety and aims to stimulate the body’s own healingmechanisms. 







 







derived from the greek words “homoios” meaning “like” and “pathos” meaning “suffering,” homeopathy operates on the principle of “like cures like.” this means that a substance causing symptoms in a healthy individual can alleviate similar symptoms in a person who is unwell. for instance, the homeopathic remedy allium cepa, prepared from onion, can be beneficial for hayfever symptoms like watery eyes or runny nose.
