the wine shop & j. webb wine merchantat the wine shop and our sister store, j. webb wine merchant, we source wines from all over the world, primarily focusing on small, family run producers that match our philosophy – namely wines that have authenticity, character and quality. a very large percentage of our wines are organic or sustainably produced, and many of our wines are exclusive to us in alberta. we have wines to suit all budgets, from everyday drinkers to rare, high-end wines for those special occasions.
