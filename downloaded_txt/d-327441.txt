welcome to walkingworld

on walkingworld you can find over 8000 routes, contributed by more than 400 walk authors. this huge library of carefully prepared guides means you can find a selection of walks, of varying lengths and grades, pretty well anywhere in the country. 

the walks come in a unique format making them very easy to follow, with photographs to illustrate every important decision point and a proper os 1:25,000 explorer map. view a typical example (pdf)

an annual subscription of £18 gives you unlimited access to all these walks. you can print them out, download digital mapping files for your gps and follow the routes on the walkingworld app. with the app you can follow the walk, complete with instructions and pictures, and see your position on an os map.
