i’m a metadata consultant, writer, and researcher committed to transforming our cultural landscape into one that is more equitable, just, and representative.
i have over fifteen years of experience writing about arts and culture for newspapers and magazines and over ten years of experience creating and managing metadata for arts and culture organizations. i bring both of these skills to research projects that assess our cultural landscape, always with an eye for respectful and accurate representation of people and communities. 
as a collaborative and inclusive project leader, i listen, analyze, and communicate transparently and respectfully. i like to learn new things, and will never pretend to know something i don’t. if i don’t know the answer right away, i do my best to return to the table with a solution.
i look forward to learning how i can help with your next project.
for more information, check out my linkedin profile, or better yet, email me.
