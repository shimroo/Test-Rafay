genealogy software
for 11 years, i had my genealogy software links page as a resource for genealogists (over 400,000 hits). in 2008, i replaced it with a site www.gensoftreviews.com that allowed people to review and rate all the software packages. it gave me ideas about what's best for behold. over 15 years, the site received over 6,000 reviews. i took the site down in 2023. 


discussion
i tweet a little. mostly about genealogy, programming behold, and a bit about chess and other stuff.
