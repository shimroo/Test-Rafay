hear what our customers are saying.... 










						paula blessing  was extremely helpful and i would highly recommend her and her office. if you are unable to come to the office, paula will come to y our home  which i appreciate.   above all, paula is very honest.  thank  you paula.					









						there were long term renters in my property that had to be considered and accommodated, laura and paula were excellent at that.  we had 2 offers on the table, the pros and cons of each were explained fully and we made the decision. from a signed contract everything was handled and explained so we had no surprises on the closing day.  we will use this team with complete confidence the next time we have a real estate need.					









						of course their local knowledge of the marketplace is impressive - they've been in the business for decades.  what we most appreciated in working with the blessing thomas team was their responsiveness, strong communication & follow-up skills.  living in idaho at the time of our aiken, sc search we relied on our team to be our eyes & ears.  basically we purchased our new home on-line and felt comfortable doing so 2500 miles away because of paula blessing's due diligence.  we are very pleased with this agency, and our new home, and would highly recommend their services.					









						this is the second time that this team has acted as my realtor.  paula and laura are the best!  they are always professional in their appearance and in their actions.  i would not hesitate to use this team as i know they will do their best for their clients.					









						laura and paula are easy to work with! they have a wealth of knowledge and experience and were able to help us make informed decisions throughout the sale of an older home. they are quick to respond, empathetic, and  patient. they helped us understand everything we needed to know to sell our home long distance. we are grateful to them and couldn’t have done it without them.					









						working with laura b. thomas was an enjoyable, friendly, fast, and thorough process from the moment i requested to view the home until i closed on it. great team. thrilled with my new home.					









						paula and laura were wonderful to work with when selling my house. they kept me informed about the showings of my house and gave very helpful feedback after each showing. they walked me through the entire process of selling a house from listing through closing. they’re awesome and very knowledgeable in what it takes to sell a house.					









						my husband and i worked with paula and laura for 18 months before closing on our new home.  we were relocating from florida to aiken.  paula and laura were patient and gracious.  they made themselves available to us whenever we were in aiken to look at properties.  i would highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a home in aiken.  their professionalism is outstanding and they are there for you from start to finish.  absolutely outstanding performance.					









						paula and her team are highly knowledgeable, capable people who i trusted to expertly handle the details of the sales process. paula and her team know the market in the aiken area and worked well with other realty companies in the area. they kept us up to date on showings of the house and gave us realistic advice on what to do to sell the house. they were very energetic and prompt in communications and getting all the large and small tasks done to complete the sale.					









						both paula & laura were great at anticipating & addressing the details needed to bring the sale & closing together without hitches.  can’t recommend them enough to anyone needing a realtor in the aiken area!					









						i had a great experience with mrs.paula blessing, and her daughter laura. i was a very young first time home buyer, and throughout the whole process i felt nothing but respected. if i ever had any questions they were answered in a timely fashion in a way that was impossible to misunderstand. we closed on my home on time, and mrs.blessing was able to negotiate down 31% for me. 10/10 would recommend! if i buy any more houses in the area i’ll only go to aiken properties.					









						paula and laura did all they could to help us sell our house. advertisement was done across all media sources available. every few months we would discuss different strategies to try to lure potential buyers.  upon an offer, they helped with negotiations and after the inspection with service people to make repairs.  they are a class organization.					









						my mother recently passed away, and we had to sell her home in aiken.  i live in texas, so i knew that managing this process from afar would be challenging.  paula blessing and her team did an absolutely fantastic job helping us through the listing, sale and closing.  they went "above and beyond" in helping us take care of many items involved in a difficult closing.  they were a pleasure to work with.					









						paula and laura were wonderful to work with. their communication and follow up skills exceeded my expectations. 

i would give them 11 stars out of 10 !!!!!!

thanks you paula and laura!					









						the blessing-thomas team was awesome! laura was extremely attentive and saw a home freshly on the market the day of. she was available to show us the home that night and we put in an offer the very next morning. it's because of her attentiveness and willingness to go above and beyond that we were able to get the house. if we ever decide to move from this house, we will definitely go to laura first!					









						these two ladies make the perfect team! they have remarkable enthusiasm, and showed us individual care. they were thorough in their knowledge of the current realestate market, and helped us navigate through the process of selling a home in a specific 55 & over community which narrowed our pool. we chose the best agents for our needs, and we can’t thank them enough!					









						even though the house we went to see was already under contract they worked really hard to find other options for us. after 3 days of looking we came back to the first house and bought it.  working 3 states away they kept in contact every step of the way.					









						the blessing team is great.  paula is very knowledgeable of the area and has your best interest at heart.  she found us the perfect place for our family.  highly recommend.					









						what a great group of aikenites to work with!  made things so easy for my closing...i basically just had to show up as they handled all the details they could for me!  thanks blessing-thomas team at aiken properties!					









						paula and her team went above and beyond to help me find and purchase the right house. they even the extra mile trying to get it ready for my move-in when i was still in texas. i would highly recommend them to any and everyone.
