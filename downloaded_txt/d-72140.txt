"while ai is often seen as the end of human connection in technology, i believe technology still has the power to bring us closer together as human beings.”
annlouise applewhite
it professional oakton college



















"teaching feels like a direct intervention in the lives of students in the classroom where you can, over time, see some kind of impact or change in students. that exposure to content in the classroom helps some students self-actualize, or at least develop some idea of what self-actualization might look like for them."
julian thompson
alumni oakton college



















"honestly, even before i had my nursing license, i knew nursing ran in my veins: medicine and helping others is part of my identity. as a practicing rn, i take pride in the work i do and am beyond grateful that i get to be wholly me both in and out of the workplace."
susanna wagner
alumni oakton college



















"this is the first time that i’ve gotten to take a class to learn about a hobby, and i’ll be gaining professional certification for it. i’d be growing cannabis no matter what; i came to oakton and it really opened my mind to having a career in cultivation."
amber johnson
student oakton college



















“my professor created a wonderful environment for all students. she was incredibly supportive and available. she cracks the surface of each of her students in different ways and it works.”
franklin ocaña ii
student trustee oakton college
