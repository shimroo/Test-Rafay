so anyway, lets get on with the show..... ^_^

hi there, this is your friendly cyber hostess taking you into a journey through a dark sci-fi future in japan, filled with huge metropolis jungles and some very dark and torrid characters. one such setting takes place in oedo city, where cyber crime is rampant and the city is out of control. in step the cyber police, a special force that recruits heavily sentenced criminals to take active duty. who else would be that expendable and think like the criminals themselves. the upside is that they get out of prison, the downside is(yes there's always one of those), that they have to wear special explosive collars to keep them under control. the cyber police chief, hasegawa,  takes charge over the latest recruits, and takes our criminal dogs into some pretty exciting but all too close to death situations. sengoku, benten and gogul are the three main anti-heroes here, they have to solve the crime in a time limit or loose their heads(literally). i hope you enjoy the drawings and cg paintings based on these crazy guys from oedo. there are a few new characters along the way, so dive in a take a look around! ^_^
