the values which shape the alexian brothers philosophy







congregation of alexian brothers charism statement
the alexian charism is the prophetic and daring response of a faith community to the gospel of jesus. it is rooted in prayer and simple life style. in discipleship with jesus, our response is reaching out to the poor, sick and dying, especially the marginated and the powerless. our charism calls us to conversion and total self-giving in continuing the healing and reconciling mission of jesus in collaboration with others.
