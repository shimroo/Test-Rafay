smart furniture and office designs are not currently accepting orders.



thank you.



we want to say thank you to hundreds of thousands of customers, and a team of diverse and dedicated folks in chattanooga, tn, chicago, il, and across the country throughout the last 25 years.you are part of a richly textured story that began in a professor’s woodshop in the late 1990s. there, smart furniture designed its first patented smart furniture and pioneered the web's very first e-commerce-enabled, drag & drop “design on demand” interface, with a focus on personalization that changed the furniture industry.a team of uniquely talented, creative, committed people in chattanooga tn ultimately took the whole emerging concept of “smart" technology and furniture, and made it simple, bringing custom, personalized design to a whole new market –- everyone. all the while, that team maintained a respect for the integrity of designers as well as for our own integrity, earning awards for marketplace ethics along the way.



in doing so, smart furniture set a new standard that virtually all others, including the established companies in the industry, followed. back then, it was unheard of that a customer could design their own furniture online in minutes and receive delivery in less than a week. smart furniture led the way by offering a design and shopping experience that was simpler, faster, and more personalized than anywhere else – leading the furniture industry into a new era with democratized design, human-focused technological innovation, and world class customer service.transitions are not always easy, but there is a lot to be thankful for, and a lot to be proud of.



thank you to everyone for an amazing and transformative 25 years, for improving your industry, your colleagues’ days, and the lives of the customers you served.
