our guiding principles 

we believe that sexual health education is critical to the health and wellbeing of young people in care, and that sexual health education should be:

presented as a normal, natural, and healthy part of human development;
medically accurate and unbiased;
trauma-informed;
comprehensive; evidence-based and skills driven;
relevant to current needs and age appropriate;
taught early and often, especially during adolescence;
updated regularly based on emerging new information;
grounded in social justice and equity, honors the diversity of young people, and promotes awareness, understanding, and appreciation of diversity and inclusion;
provided in coordination with additional resources and referrals as needed;
developed in collaboration with youth in care with ongoing feedback; and
delivered by authentic, qualified and caring professionals in an interactive approach where youth voices, experiences and questions are valued.

many youth in out-of-home care do not have a trusting relationship with an adult that could provide sexual health education during adolescence, when risky sexual behaviors could occur.  we believe that all professionals who care for young people should receive ongoing staff development to facilitate conversations about sexual health education and collaborate to provide sync programming directly to youth in care.
