welcome to jim kelly mortgage services where you can obtain professional independent mortgage advice.
the house or flat you are purchasing may be from an estate agent, your local council under the right-to-buy scheme, from a housing association under a shared equity or shared ownership scheme or perhaps as a private sale from a friend or relative. 
here, we will guide you through the house purchase process, how much deposit you will need and the likely costs involved.
we are not tied to any bank, building society or network and offer a comprehensive range of mortgages from across the market, but not deals that you can only obtain by going direct to a lender.
