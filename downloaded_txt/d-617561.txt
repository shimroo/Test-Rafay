with thanksgiving (and the hopes of sensible eating) now just a memory, we turn to colder weather, falling snow, and the new year to come. fortunately for japanese culture fans, december is just as busy as the holiday season itself. whether you’re hosting guests from out of town or looking to squeeze in an event or two in between parties, we’ve got you covered.
