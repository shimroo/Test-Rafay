about hendrick hospice care

hendrick hospice care is the oldest, most experienced hospice, serving
	 abilene and the texas midwest since 1982. each member of our team of nurses,
	 nurse aides and social workers is certified in hospice and palliative
	 care. combined, they represent 270 years of combined hospice experience.
	 hospice is more a philosophy of care than a place. we provide hospice
	 care at home, in nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and hospitals.
	 hendrick hospice care has agreements with various healthcare providers
	 to offer hospice locally and regionally in various hospitals and long-term
	 healthcare facilities within a 65-mile radius, including 13 counties surrounding
	 abilene. we provide end-of-life care for diagnoses other than cancer,
	 including congestive heart failure, cardiac disease, strokes, alzheimer's,
	 dementia, respiratory failure, failure to thrive, asthma, liver disease
	 and others. hendrick hospice care does not discriminate because of one’s
	 ability to pay and offers financial assistance for those who qualify.
	 hospice is a fully-covered medicare benefit for all eligible patients.
	 hospice also is fully covered by most medicaid and commercial insurances.
	 in addition, hendrick hospice care is the only hospice offering grief
	 support programs for children and a camp for grieving children (club courage,
	 formerly rainbows, and camp courage). these free programs are made possible
	 by donations to children's miracle network hospitals.
our history
in 1982, a group of community members shared the vision to bring hospice
	 care to abilene. shortly after, hospice of abilene was established in
	 a garage apartment behind the episcopal church of the heavenly rest. hospice
	 of abilene opened its doors and arms to the community as they served their
	 first patient in 1983. hospice of abilene affiliated with hendrick medical
	 center in 1993. four years later, a designated seven-bed inpatient unit,
	 the only one of its kind, was opened on the seventh floor of hendrick
	 medical center. this same year, in 1997, hospice of abilene changed its
	 name to hendrick hospice care.
in december 2016, hendrick hospice care center, a state-of-the-art, freestanding
	 inpatient care facility was opened.
hendrick hospice care center
as the need for end-of-life care continues to grow, hendrick hospice care
	 recognizes the importance to provide more inpatient beds to area residents
	 choosing hospice. the single story, 40,800 square-feet complex is located
	 two blocks from hendrick medical center and includes inpatient hospice
	 care, a bereavement center, home care offices, space for volunteer training,
	 common areas for families and visitors and extensive outdoor landscaping.
	 the inpatient area includes 16 rooms, large enough for families to comfortably
	 stay with their loved ones.
hendrick hospice care center includes:


16 patient rooms
family rooms
bereavement center and library
administrative and home care offices
chapel
community room
counseling room
intensive outdoor landscaping
