		my projects and i have been in the new york times,  wall street journal, wired, rolling stone,   on mtv, cnn, bbc, npr, the cbs early show, and nbc's today show.
	


i occasionally advise & invest in startups and coach founders.
before that, i sold my company, and made 1,000 people cry at once.




	before that, i was an entrepreneur. i started photojojo, the world's most fun photography store, where we created clever and joyful photography gear. i launched a worldwide coworking movement known as jelly, helped seth godin start a non-profit,  organized unusual tech conferences, camped overnight in times square,  lived in a commune, published a book, contributed to a wsj best-seller with malcolm gladwell  and others, dropped out of college  to start a company called the daily jolt.

i also survived leukemia (thanks to the power of friends and the internet). bizarrely, that led to a toyota commercial with my dog. isn't life weird?
