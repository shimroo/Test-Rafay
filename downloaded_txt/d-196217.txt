at the players course…

designed in 1992, the players course is carved from wooded terrain and features large, undulating greens which are always in great condition and the contrasting styles of the front and back nines make for a great round. golf on the players course is a combination of wonderful play and incredible scenery.
nestled along the shores of lake marion, the 18-hole players course at wyboo is perhaps santee cooper country’s most player-friendly layout. with very little water and only eight bunkers, this course sets up well for everyone!

“the course is absolutely gorgeous. fairways and greens are perfectly manicured. the doglegs and greens are challenging but fun. a hidden jem out in the middle of farmlands.”
