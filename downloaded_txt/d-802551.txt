our story 




about the brand 


















in the beginning there were no earth, no sky, no sea. out of this desire came the two primal parents papatuanuku ( the earth mother) and ranginui ( the sky father). they embraced in the realm of night and seventy children were born to them, all male, and thus ira atua (the first family) came into being. living in darkness and longing to experience the world of light and day, the siblings decided that their parents should be separated.however, not all the children agreed. tumatauenga ( the deity of war) wanted them killed. tane mahuta ( the deity of man and forests and everything that dwells within) thought they should be separated, with ranginui going above t the sky and papatuanuku dwelling on the earth below. in turn they tried to separate their parents. rongomatane (deity and father of cultivated foods) tried, but with no success. tangaroa (deity of the sea), followed by tumatauenga also tried but to no avail. finally tane mahuta placed his shoulders against the ground, thrust his feet upwards and pushed.the sinews binding his parents stretch back and forth, heaving and swaying, until finally the parents were separated and the children experienced te ao marama (light of day) for the first time. when this happened, tawhirimatea (deity and father of winds and storms) who had not agreed to the separation, went up to the sky to be with his father.when the separation was completed there was only one thing lacking, the uha ( female element). since there were no women, tane took some clay from a place known as kura-waka and fashioned it into the form of a women. then he breathed life into the nostrils, and thus was created hine-ahu-one (the earth formed maiden). tane mahuta and hine-ahu-one had a daughter and thus the family of man had begun.today we are families originated from tane mahuta, father of plants and man. we are spread like the mamaku fern, throughout tai tokerau. we are many families, we are many clusters and yet we are the same family. we form the taurapa (stern post) of the waka and together we provide the stability and the sustainability for economic development for tai tokerau tourism. we are te whanau o te tai tokerau, the families of northland

arrival in aotearoa
 










the maori people first arrived in new zealand aotearoa) over 1000 years ago from their ancestral homeland of hawaiki. they came in great ocean-going double hulled sailing canoes (waka hourua) and they named the land aotearoa (land of the long white cloud). more waka hourua continued to arrive over the next several hundred years, landing in various parts of new zealand. many iwi (tribes) can trace their origins and whakapapa (genealogy) back to these ancestoral canoes. today, maori make up over 14 percent of the population and the language and culture impacts on all aspects of new zealand life

things to do  























the venerated pohutukawa is the reinga, “the place of leaping” in maori legends, where the spirits of the dead leap off the headland and climb down the roots of the 800 year old tree, and descend into the underworld to return to their traditional homeland of hawaiiki. 
















things to do  
















discover what northland has to offer island new zealand.  

















 











maori know the very top of the north island of new zealand as te hiku o te ika a maui – the tail of the fish of maui. according to tradition, the north island was once a giant fish pulled out of the sea by maui from his canoe. wellington (bottom of the island) forms the head of the fish, and the tip of the fish’s tail is cape reinga.  cape reinga with it’s lonely lighthouse gnarled, twisted pohutukawa tree and windswept cliff tops, is a mystical place of rugged beauty. here you can also see the turbulent waters of where two mighty oceans meet (pacific ocean and tasman sea). 











 

















the waitangi treaty grounds present a rare opportunity to experience the place where, in 1840, maori and the british crown first signed new zealand’s most significant document, the treaty of waitangi. the magnificent park like treaty grounds are bordered by sweeping pacific ocean  views and feature the historic treaty house, fully carved maori meeting house, one of the worlds largest ceremonial waka (canoe), guided tours, seasonal cultural performances, quality shopping and fully licensed café.the treaty grounds are open daily from 9 am (closed christmas day) 











 











mighty tane mahuta the world’s largest living kauri tree, is named after the maori “god of the forest” and is estimated to be over 2000 years old. with a girth of 13.8 metres and height of 51.5 metres, tane mahuta dominates waipuoa forest in the hokianga region of tai tokerau.the waipoua forest is home to three quarters of new zealand’s remaining kauri trees and within the forest’s 2,500 hectares, there are a number of walking and tramping tracks, including  wheel-chair access along the boardwalk to tane mahuta.

hokianga  




in biblical times, our great maori navigator and explorer, kupe, sailed from raiatea to aotearoa new zealand and settled at the place we now know as hokianga on the west coast of the north island. kupe described his new home as te  puna o te ao marama –the spring of the world of light.in his very old age he left for his original homeland in raiatea, naming his departure point as te hokianga nui o kupe – the great returning place of kupe. since then, over 200 generations and other migrations have made their mark, but the special landscape and light remain.today hokianga contains the ancestral lands of our maori tribe, ngapuhi. lands that are rich in tradition, natural beauty and a peaceful spirit where the great kauri giants live, awesome undeveloped coastlines, remarkable wildlife, contrasted with small picturesque villages and relics of early european settlements.
