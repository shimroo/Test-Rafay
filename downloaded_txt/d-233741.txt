welcome to smyth county


on february 23, 1832, the virginia general assembly created smyth county from parts of washington and wythe counties. smyth county is named after general alexander smyth who once represented this area in congress. smyth county is located in the lower portion of the great valley of western virginia. interstate 81 runs through the county's central valley, and intersects with interstate 77 approximately 25 miles northeast of the town of marion. three towns are located in smyth county: marion (the county seat), chilhowie, and saltville.
the county has three major valleys carved by the three forks of the holston river, and a large portion of the county is located within the boundaries of a popular tourist destination, mount rogers national recreation area. every year, thousands of visitors and county residents alike enjoy hungry mother state park and the mount rogers national recreation area.
if you grew up here, you know about the pace of life, sense of family and community and the beauty of virginia's great southwest. those things are still the same. even better now that a new career option may be waiting on you to come and claim it.
