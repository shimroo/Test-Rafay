examining our life till he comes

the age of accountability
pdf book, 38 pages
the age of accountability is a question that often comes up in discussion regarding the rapture. however, to best understand the subject, we must look beyond the short term, and ask why is anyone accountable to god at all? it is a heart issue. when we see ourselves as god sees us, we get a stark reality check - that also reminds us of the grace and mercy that he offers through jesus christ.

understanding god's celestial clock
pdf book, 36 pages
the more that we study god's stated requirements for the appointed times, the more we see his emphasis on the firstfruits - and that the appointed times have their own seasons that they must be observed in. by studying god's celestial clock - and the seasons - we see how they were meant to go together - providing incredible prophetic shadows and patterns that the apostles referenced. we will have the best understanding of the time, when we study what god says about it!
