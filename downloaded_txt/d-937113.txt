about parlier







parlier the central place to be in california! we are excited about our new designation as a federal rural renewal community that allows the city to revitalize our neighborhoods and businesses using federal tax incentives. parlier’s booming economy is experiencing a renaissance of development and diversification. a combination of public and private financing is under development for construction of several new housing projects, restoration of the downtown area, and development of the parlier industrial park. with our proximity to major highway networks and international air terminal, and the lower cost of land and labor, parlier is the ideal business location to serve the vast california market of over 35 million people. our expanded housing, restoration of our downtown area, and more specifically our designation as a federal rural renewal community, makes parlier the perfect place to live, work and play.
