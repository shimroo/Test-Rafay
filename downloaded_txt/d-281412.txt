birthdays and astrology

                    the modern astrological sign that one is said to be born under depends on your birthday, and the exact
                    time of birth is used to calculate your natal chart. however, astrology is not limited to the west and in
                    particular the tabloid newspapers alone, western astrology by itself has dozens of branches and various
                    offshoots. in modern india vedic astrology (or jyotish) is commonly used even now in every day life.
                





                            in china chinese astrology has been around for thousands of years and continues to flourish. the ancient greeks formed hellenistic astrology while the mayans of south america also formed their own brand of astrology with the help of their super-precise, world-famous observatories. the ancient egyptians also had their own system of birthday astrology while a unique system of astrology eventually emerged in tibet as well.
