hibernate orm








the fourth beta release of hibernate 7 is now available.

along with many bugfixes and minor improvements, this release features the following enhancements:



the brand-new restriction, path, and range apis make it easy to add programmatic restrictions to hql queries or jakarta data repository methods in a completely type-safe way.


the package org.hibernate.graph was completely re-engineered, fixing a number of long-standing issues with our implementation of the jakarta persistence entitygraph api.


statelesssession is now able to make use of the second-level cache, reflecting the changing role of this very important api in the hibernate ecosystem.


reactive repositories backed by hibernate reactive are now a documented feature of hibernate data repositories.


the hibernate-jfr module was enhanced to send more events to java flight recorder.


hql now provides portable sha(), md5(), and hex() functions.


hibernate processor now features much better support for inner classes.

why you should care about the jdbc fetch size



posted by



gavin king

hibernate orm








last week, jeroen borgers asked on twitter for a standard way to set the jdbc fetch size in jpa, that is, for hibernate’s query.setfetchsize() to be added to the standard apis.
this took me slightly by surprise, because nobody has ever asked for that before, but i asked him to go ahead and open an issue.
after some discussion, i think i’m satisfied that his actual needs can be met in a different way, but the discussion did help to draw my attention to something important: the default jdbc fetch size for the oracle driver is 10.

now, i would never pretend to be an expert in oracle performance tuning, and i don’t use oracle every day.
even so, i felt like this is something that i definitely should have known off the top of my head, after so many years working with jdbc.

out of curiosity, i ran a poll on twitter, which was shared by franck pachot among others:
