from the foot of the taunus mountains into the world
diamant schuhfabrik otto müller kg celebrates 150 years of shoe manufacturing
 
floating elegantly across the dance floor is the dream of many dance enthusiasts. what looks easy and effortless is usually the result of years of training. it is not only about pretty dresses and suits that ensure a chic look, but above all the right dance shoes. only if the foot has a secure hold, the soles are flexible and not too slippery, will steps, turns and jumps be perfect. and all that without harming the health of the feet. this is no easy task for the diamant schuhfabrik otto müller kg from bad soden. as germany's oldest dance shoe manufacturer, the company has achieved international fame and popularity among dancers all over the world - and is celebrating its 150th company anniversary this year on 19 may 2023.
