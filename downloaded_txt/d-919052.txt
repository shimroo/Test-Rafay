psychometric testing and assessment








a proven part of successful recruitment, psychometric testing is recognised as a vital component in improving organisational effectiveness through the selection and development of both teams and individuals.


liam healy & associates, registered occupational psychologists, have been providing assessment and development consultancy services since 1995. 
our expertise lies in being able to carry out an in depth psychological  assessment of an individual, and not simply a psychometric test. as part of this we provide both on-line and direct face to face psychometric assessment, either as an integral part of recruitment, or to fulfil a specific career development, coaching or other development need.  
our team of registered occupational psychologists use psychometric tests to produce in-depth psychological profiles of individuals covering both personality and intellectual ability, from the most senior managerial and executive level positions, to graduate and more junior roles. all of our assessment  specialists hold the british psychological society’s test user qualifications in psychometric testing.
