the election is over, and the holidays are upon us. we have much to be thankful for at capitol coin. our new location is up and running and better than ever. there’s lots to see and much to choose from whether you are looking for a gift for yourself or those special collectors in your life.
if you are looking for something to commemorate the 2024 election, we have trump-vance challenge coin for $60. there’s also a harris-trump spinner challenge coin for $60. this is an interesting piece that spins from one candidate to the other.
if you are ready to move on, why not add to your political collection with an fdr button from the dollar defense division. it’s an interesting pin back with a rarely seen photo of franklin delano roosevelt for $575.
also interesting is a national jewish council 9-piece button set from the 1996 election. at $325 you get a set of history.
for the political items collector who really wants something different, we have flowers from president james garfield’s funeral in 1881. they are $150 for a little piece of history.
if you want to delve a little deeper into political history, we have some buttons from the early 1900s. look at alton b. parker campaign buttons from 1906. from $30 to $275 there is something available at all price points.
we hope you will think of us when you start your holiday shopping. we are here to help.
the 2024 white house christmas challenge coin is now available. at $60 it is the perfect way to kick off your holiday.
