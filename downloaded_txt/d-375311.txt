other injustices in the workplace. undocumented workers and people in unskilled or semi-skilled positions are especially vulnerable to abuse. professionals and executives may also experience on-the-job discrimination and harassment. they may feel boxed-in by corporate culture and the fear of being labeled as troublemakers for voicing their concerns. the new york employment lawyers at the law firm of joseph & kirschenbaum llp have a long history of advocating on behalf of new york workers who have suffered on-the-job discrimination, harassment, retaliation and abusive and illegal wage and hour practices. we have recovered more than $140 million for our clients, who have included restaurant workers, financial services professionals and executives, parking lot attendants, retail employees, creative professionals, salespeople, delivery drivers, it employees, attorneys, and more.wage and hour protectionthe federal fair labor standards act (flsa) and various new york wage and hour laws protect new york workers from exploitation in a variety of ways, including:mandating the overtime premium—i.e., time-and-one-half—for all hours over 40 for most employeesprohibiting tip theft or misallocation of tipsmandating the minimum wageprohibiting unpaid “off the clock” work and trainingrequiring that subcontracted workers on taxpayer-funded jobs receive the “prevailing wage” hourly rate, often a multiple of the non-union market ratewhile these laws apply to most companies and most workers in new york city, victims often need a zealous legal advocate to compel employers to respect them. under new york law, if your employer failed to follow these rules, you can collect what you should have been paid plus substantial penalties for up to six years after the violation.harassment and discriminatory practices in the workplacepromotion, hiring and the terms and conditions of employment should be based on an employee’s qualifications and hard work, not on the person's race, gender, religion or sexual orientation. likewise, people should be free to work without enduring harassment on the job. u.s., new york state, and new york city laws combine to protect these rights by prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on any of the following, among others:racecolornational originreligiongendermilitary servicegenetic traitdisabilityage sexual orientationfamilial statusdomestic violence victim statusemployers may be held responsible for their own discriminatory practices as well as harassment perpetrated by their employees, supervisors or even customers if they knew or should have known it was occurring and failed to take corrective action. this means that workers with concerns over offensive practices may have legal recourse they can
