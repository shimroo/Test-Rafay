more information 











study curriculum:our preschool uses the “wee-learn” educational program for the entire preschool for infants and toddlers. our k-3 and vpk use the “creative curriculum system.” these curriculums have been tested with very successful results. the “wee-learn” curriculum stimulates our infants and toddlers to begin associating particular activities with principles and concepts they will begin to see and apply once they arrive in their respective preschool classes. the “creative curriculum” encourages the student to individually discover the principles there are being taught through a series of classroom activities and manipulatives in order to further their learning experience. all of our classrooms are designed to facilitate the learning experience for children using a variety of educational tools consisting of auditory, visual, and tactile methods. licenses:palmetto presbyterian preschool is licensed by:the department of children and families of the state of florida (gold seal).apple (accredited professional preschool learning environment) (gold seal).cdea (child development education alliance) certified (gold seal). breakfast and lunch-costswe do not have a breakfast program, but our “morning snack” is always offered in the early hours of the day. if parents want to bring their children food suitable for breakfast, our staff should be notified and we will make the necessary arrangements. palmetto presbyterian preschool offers a “hot lunch” program, at an additional cost of $2.50 daily. this program is optional and allows a parent to send a lunchbox with their child.
