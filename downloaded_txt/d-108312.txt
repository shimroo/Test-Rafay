douglas boynton quine - home page
link to professional resume
 
douglas boynton quine is a family man, scientist, inventor, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and explorer.  my exploration of technology led to the creation of this web page as a "favorite" web site list in 1996.  as these web pages expanded, new knowledge led to innovation, patent applications, and ultimately 49 awarded us patents.  

i have created over 150 web pages across five themes or web rings: family, philately / postal automation, the beatles, the philosophy of willard van orman quine, and myself.  these web pages have developed substantial guest books with correspondence from visitors - especially the beatles, boynton family, and willard v. quine sites.

in 2004, this page was reconfigured to become my home page pointing to the various web pages (with over 2,890,000 visits to date).  

the douglas quine favorite links are maintained with new material in my more favorite links web page.  i may be reached by email at:

douglas boynton quine web ring
the dbq web ring (left) provides access to listings of my professional consulting, offices held, philatelic activities, professional employment, research, scientific publications, seminars presented and teaching.  this web "home" page originally served to describe my interests by providing a listing of favorite web sites across many subject areas.  that content has now been folded into my more favorite links web page.  it includes art, automobiles, computing, education, employment, finance, genealogy, government resources, health, kid friendly sites, movies, musicians, news, postal, reference, science, taxes, television, theater, travel, and web search engines.


family web ring by douglas boynton quine
the family web ring (family web sites listed on left) supports the boynton and quine family web pages that i have developed.  current boynton and quine family trees are provided with all descendents of my grandparents.  ancestors are listed as far back as known (8 generations back for quine family members and 32 generations back boynton for family members).  web pages for my parents marjorie boynton quine and willard van orman quine are included. extensive documentation is provided in the boynton and the quine family guest books.  these guest books have served as a resource for family members to discover previously unknown relatives.


willard van orman quine web ring by douglas boynton quine

the wvq web ring (left) provides access the web pages that i developed for my father, the philosopher and mathematician willard van orman quine.  the web pages are extensive including all known books (and translations), published papers, students, lectures, awards, obituaries, and even travels.

philately / postal automation web ring by douglas boynton quine
the philately / postal automation web ring (left) provides access to the web pages that i developed for the auxiliary markings club which i co-founded with john hotchner in 2003.  it provides links to information about my philatelic interests and publications.  the on-line united states postal service postnet and planet barcode decoder allows interpretation of the black postal barcodes on the face of most us mail today.  finally, postnet error 404 is a humorous (but quite correct) error page for those seeking a postnet decoder.


beatles web ring by douglas boynton quine

the beatles web ring (music web sites listed on left) has proven to be the most popular set of web pages.  all beatles albums released in the united states are listed with a song list and links for discounted purchases.  the international listing is growing as information is obtained from other sources.  the alphabetical listing of beatles songs allows quick determination of the cd containing the song (as well as the composer).  the first release listing includes every song the beatles ever recorded (including those never released).  the many volumes of the beatles guest books include the extensive fan correspondence received over the years.  the beatles faq web page answer the most common questions posted by visitors - including every known group that has "covered" a beatles song, the characters displayed on the cover of the sgt. pepper's lonely hearts band album, and how to determine the value of a beatles record, and even the postage stamps designed by paul mccartney for the isle of man (ancestral home of the quine family).

doing good
it is nice to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem.  our public service site has some ways you can help.  i started saving gas with my honda civic hybrid (greenhybrid.com and myhybridcar.com have the best on-line hybrid information).  for fun, i painted the silver logo to be green in the day and to glow at night.

 day  

 night
as technology improved, i migrated to a 2014 toyota prius eco (highest gas mileage non-plugin ever at the time) which has now averaged over 68 miles per gallon for 7 years. i'm doing far better than the 56 mpg rating.
