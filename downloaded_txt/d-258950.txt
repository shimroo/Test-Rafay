pop art was a movement that emerged in the late 1950s in england and the united states as a reaction against abstract expressionism art, which they considered empty and elitist. the common element in the pop art movement is not a similar style or technique in the composition of the artwork but a common theme among all of the pieces produced in this era.
the common theme is the consumer mass market and the commercial world. pop art uses familiar images in a different sense to achieve aesthetic posture with them or express a social critique. as its name suggests "popular art" takes after people's interests and themes.
while artists like roy lichtenstein thought of pop art as something that reflected the serial and non-personalization of art, allpopart.com since its humble beginnings in 2004, has tried to revamp the history of this art movement and give it back to the people. quoting pop art movement icon andy warhol, 1968:
"in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." -allpopart.com makes you and your loved ones subject of the painting.
