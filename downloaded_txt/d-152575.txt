ltrc impact: a look back through the years

about us
for over 30 years, the staff of ltrc has strived to merge resources of state government and universities to help identify, develop, and implement new technology to improve the state's transportation system. we hope that you will take some time to watch the new video and witness some of the ways in which ltrc has assisted the louisiana transportation system over the last 30 years and will continue to do so as the center tackles new problems and challenges every day. the value that the center has brought to the state exceeds savings in the millions through projects such as those focusing on high strength concrete, instrumental monitoring of structures, and recycled asphalt pavements, just to name a few. in addition to the extensive research program, ltrc houses more essential programs and facilities than ever before, such as the technology transfer and training program; the louisiana technical assistance program (ltap); the louisiana pavement research facility, which contains the accelerated loading facility and atlas 30; the engineering materials characterization and research facility (emcrf); the geotechnical engineering research laboratory (gerl); pavement on the move (pom); and the intelligent transportation systems (its) laboratory.
