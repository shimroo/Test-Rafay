talk.origins 
       is a usenet newsgroup
       devoted to the discussion and debate of biological and physical
       origins.  most discussions in the newsgroup center on the
       creation/evolution controversy, but other topics of discussion include
       the origin of life, geology, biology, catastrophism, cosmology and
       theology.
      


       the talkorigins archive is a 
       collection of articles and essays, most of which
       have appeared in talk.origins at one time or another.  the primary
       reason for this archive's existence is to provide 
       
			   mainstream
       scientific responses to the many frequently asked questions 
			 (faqs) 
			 that appear in the talk.origins newsgroup and
       the frequently rebutted assertions of those advocating
			 intelligent design or other creationist pseudosciences.
