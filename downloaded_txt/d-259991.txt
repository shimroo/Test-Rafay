homewhat we dotechnical divisionspowertrain engineering










 
 powertrain engineeringproviding design, development, and analysis on components, engines, transmissions, and vehicles, we also support research and modeling for fuel mixing, combustion, filtration, and fluid flow analysis. as pioneers in measuring engine and vehicle exhaust emissions, we continue to raise the bar with new methodologies of characterizing engine exhaust constituents. today, we are a global leader in measuring fine, ultrafine, and nanoparticles.
