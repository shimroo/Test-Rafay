from dental startup to success: a guide to building and growing your practice

starting a dental practice can be one of the most rewarding, yet challenging, endeavors for a dental professional. navigating the initial stages of setup, patient acquisition, and operational management requires foresight, patience, and strategy. this guide will provide essential steps for building and growing your dental practice, whether you aim to start a general clinic or a specialized cosmetic dental clinic.
step 1: develop a comprehensive business plan
the first step in building and growing your dental practice is crafting a well-thought-out business plan. this document will act as a roadmap for every aspect of your clinic, from financial planning to patient acquisition. for a cosmetic dental clinic, in particular, your plan should account for higher equipment costs and tailored marketing strategies.
key elements of a business plan include:
– mission and vision: define what you want to achieve with your practice.
– financial projections: include estimated expenses, expected revenue, and cash flow projections.
– market analysis: research local competition, demand for services, and target demographics.
– marketing strategy: outline your approach to reaching potential patients and building a reputation.
having a solid business plan helps secure funding, guides decisions, and ensures that you stay on track during the critical early years.
step 2: choose the right location
location is crucial to the success of your dental practice. look for an area with high visibility, easy access, and a demographic profile that fits your target patient base. if you’re setting up a cosmetic dental clinic, consider a location in a high-traffic area with clients interested in aesthetics, like business districts or near shopping centers.
other considerations include:
– proximity to competition: you may want to avoid areas with multiple dental clinics, although positioning close to complementary businesses, like orthodontics or wellness centers, could be beneficial.
– accessibility: ensure your clinic is easy to reach and has ample parking.
– zoning and licensing requirements: familiarize yourself with local regulations before making a final decision.
step 3: invest in high-quality equipment and technology
a successful dental practice requires modern, high-quality equipment to provide the best patient care. as the demand for cosmetic procedures grows, so does the need for advanced technologies that can improve treatment outcomes. digital scanners, cad/cam systems, and 3d printing can enhance patient experience and attract more clients to a cosmetic dental clinic.
key equipment for a modern dental practice:
– digital x-rays and intraoral cameras: these tools provide accurate imaging and improve patient trust by involving them in the diagnosis process.
– cad/cam systems: especially relevant for cosmetic dentistry, these systems streamline processes like creating crowns, veneers, and bridges.
– patient management software: an efficient practice management system can handle scheduling, billing, and patient records, enhancing both productivity and patient experience.
step 4: focus on patient-centric marketing
marketing is essential for any new business, but dental practices must prioritize patient-centric marketing to build trust and attract clients. highlighting your specialization, especially if you run a cosmetic dental clinic, will help differentiate your practice.
effective marketing channels include:
– website and seo: a well-designed, seo-optimized website can attract patients searching for services in your area.
– social media marketing: share educational content, before-and-after photos (with patient consent), and testimonials to engage potential patients.
– local advertising: advertising in local newspapers, magazines, or community bulletins can increase awareness.
– referral program: encourage satisfied patients to refer others to your clinic by offering discounts or other incentives.
step 5: build a trustworthy and skilled team
a dental practice’s success is heavily reliant on the skill and professionalism of its team. patients will not only judge your practice based on their interaction with you but also on the experience they have with your hygienists, dental assistants, and administrative staff. for a cosmetic dental clinic, patient expectations are often higher, making it crucial to hire and train a team that values quality, empathy, and professionalism.
steps to build a successful team:
– hire skilled professionals: invest in employees who are passionate, skilled, and aligned with your clinic’s mission.
– ongoing training: offer continuous learning opportunities to keep your team updated on the latest advancements.
– foster a positive work culture: encourage open communication, recognize achievements, and ensure employees feel valued.
step 6: provide exceptional patient experience
patient satisfaction and retention are paramount when building and growing your dental practice. a positive patient experience encourages word-of-mouth referrals and improves online reviews. for a cosmetic dental clinic, the patient journey often includes high expectations for comfort and personalization.
ways to enhance patient experience:
– transparent communication: explain procedures, costs, and expected outcomes to alleviate patient concerns.
– comfortable waiting areas: make your waiting area relaxing with comfortable seating, soothing colors, and entertainment options.
– personalized follow-ups: after significant procedures, such as implants or cosmetic treatments, follow up with a call to check on patient recovery.
step 7: continuously monitor and improve your practice
building and growing your dental practice is an ongoing process. regularly assess the effectiveness of your strategies, patient feedback, and financial performance to identify areas for improvement. use surveys to gather patient opinions and assess service quality, and look for trends in patient complaints or suggestions to better tailor your approach.
key performance indicators (kpis) to monitor:
– patient retention rate: track how many patients return for follow-up appointments or regular checkups.
– revenue growth: monitor monthly and yearly revenue growth to evaluate financial health.
– new patient acquisition: assess how effective your marketing strategies are in bringing new patients to your practice.
step 8: embrace continuous education and industry trends
the dental industry evolves rapidly, and staying current with the latest treatments, technologies, and best practices is essential. this is particularly true for a cosmetic dental clinic, where patients expect cutting-edge options and treatments.
attend industry conferences, participate in online courses, and join professional networks to learn about advancements and apply these to your practice. staying informed on trends and innovations not only boosts your credibility but can also attract new patients looking for the latest in cosmetic and general dental care.
building and growing your dental practice takes effort, resilience, and a commitment to delivering exceptional patient care. by focusing on a solid business plan, quality equipment, patient-centric marketing, a skilled team, and ongoing improvement, you can take your dental practice from startup to success. whether you’re running a general or cosmetic dental clinic, prioritizing patient experience, embracing technology, and adapting to industry changes will ensure your practice thrives in the competitive dental industry.

understanding gum disease: causes, symptoms, and treatment options

gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is a common but often underestimated oral health concern that affects millions of people worldwide. from its subtle beginnings to its potentially serious consequences, understanding gum disease is crucial for maintaining optimal oral health. in this article, we’ll delve into the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for gum disease, while also exploring its connection to periodontal treatment and the evolution of orthodontics.
the basics of gum disease
gum disease starts with the accumulation of plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that forms on the teeth. when plaque is not adequately removed through proper oral hygiene practices such as brushing and flossing, it can harden into tartar, leading to inflammation of the gums, known as gingivitis. gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease and is characterized by symptoms such as redness, swelling, and bleeding gums during brushing or flossing.
if left untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, a more severe form of gum disease. periodontitis involves the destruction of the tissues and bone that support the teeth, leading to symptoms such as receding gums, persistent bad breath, loose teeth, and eventual tooth loss.
causes of gum disease
several factors contribute to the development and progression of gum disease. poor oral hygiene practices, such as infrequent brushing and flossing, allow plaque and tartar to accumulate, increasing the risk of gum inflammation and disease. additionally, certain risk factors, including smoking, hormonal changes, diabetes, and genetic predisposition, can heighten susceptibility to gum disease.
furthermore, lifestyle factors such as diet and stress can impact oral health. a diet high in sugary and acidic foods promotes bacterial growth and plaque formation, while stress weakens the body’s immune response, making it harder to fight off infections like gum disease.
symptoms of gum disease
recognizing the signs and symptoms of gum disease is essential for early intervention and treatment. in the early stages, gingivitis may present with symptoms such as:
– red, swollen, or tender gums
– bleeding gums, especially during brushing or flossing
– persistent bad breath
– receding gums
as gum disease progresses to periodontitis, symptoms may worsen and include:
– pus between the teeth and gums
– changes in the bite or alignment of teeth
– loose or shifting teeth
– pain when chewing
– abscesses or sores in the mouth
if you experience any of these symptoms, it’s crucial to consult with a dental professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
treatment options for gum disease
the treatment approach for gum disease depends on the severity of the condition. in cases of mild to moderate gum disease (gingivitis), professional dental cleanings, along with improved oral hygiene practices at home, may be sufficient to reverse the inflammation and restore gum health.
for more advanced cases of gum disease (periodontitis), additional interventions may be necessary. periodontal treatment aims to remove plaque and tartar buildup from below the gumline through procedures such as scaling and root planing. this deep cleaning technique helps to eliminate bacteria and smooth the tooth roots, allowing the gums to reattach to the teeth.
in some cases, surgical intervention may be required to address severe gum disease and repair damaged tissues. surgical procedures such as gum grafting, bone grafting, and flap surgery may be recommended to regenerate lost gum and bone tissue, stabilize loose teeth, and improve overall periodontal health.
the evolution of orthodontics and periodontal treatment
advancements in orthodontic treatment have also contributed to the management of gum disease. traditional orthodontic methods, such as braces, were once thought to exacerbate gum disease by making oral hygiene more challenging. however, the evolution of orthodontics has introduced innovative solutions such as clear aligner therapy, which offers removable aligners that allow for easier oral hygiene maintenance during treatment.
additionally, orthodontic techniques that focus on proper tooth alignment and spacing can help reduce the risk of gum recession and periodontal issues. by aligning the teeth and optimizing bite function, orthodontic treatment can create an environment that is more conducive to gum health and maintenance.
understanding gum disease is essential for maintaining optimal oral health and preventing serious complications. by recognizing the causes and symptoms of gum disease and exploring treatment options such as periodontal treatment, individuals can take proactive steps to protect their gums and preserve their smiles. furthermore, the evolution of orthodontics continues to play a role in promoting gum health and enhancing overall treatment outcomes, highlighting the interconnectedness of dental specialties in comprehensive oral care.

orthodontics isn’t merely about straightening teeth; it’s about crafting smiles that radiate confidence and self-assurance. however, this journey begins with selecting a dentist who not only possesses the necessary expertise but also understands the unique needs and aspirations of each patient.
the first step in the orthodontic odyssey is often the most daunting: choosing the right dentist. with countless options available, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. however, by considering a few key factors, finding the perfect match becomes a more manageable task.

dental uniforms: what are the fashion stakes

in the world of dentistry, where precision meets aesthetics, the attire worn by dental professionals isn’t just about functionality; it’s also a reflection of their professionalism and style. dental uniforms have evolved over the years, blending practicality with fashion sensibilities. from the pristine coats of cosmetic dentists to the vibrant attire of dental assistants, each aspect of dental fashion tells a unique story. let’s delve into the world of dental uniforms and explore the fashion stakes therein.
when envisioning a cosmetic dentist, the image that often comes to mind is one of sophistication and precision. their attire mirrors this perception, typically consisting of crisp, white lab coats paired with tailored trousers or skirts. the emphasis on cleanliness and professionalism is paramount, with minimalistic designs dominating their wardrobe. however, within this simplicity lies an opportunity for personal flair. some cosmetic dentists opt for subtle accessories like statement jewelry or designer eyewear to add a touch of individuality to their ensemble. after all, confidence exudes not only from one’s expertise but also from their style.
in contrast, the style of the typical cosmetic dentist’s assistant tends to be more dynamic and versatile. these professionals are the backbone of any dental practice, multitasking between patient care and administrative duties with finesse. their attire reflects this dynamic role, often featuring comfortable yet stylish pieces that allow for ease of movement. while the traditional scrubs still prevail in many dental offices, there’s a growing trend towards incorporating fashionable elements into these uniforms. from trendy prints and flattering silhouettes to innovative fabric technologies, dental assistants are embracing fashion without compromising on functionality.
beyond the conventional norms, diversity plays a significant role in shaping dental fashion. in multicultural societies, dental professionals come from various backgrounds, each bringing their unique sense of style to the table. take, for instance, the case of a muslim nurse’s fashion can be as colourful as a hindu. in today’s inclusive environment, cultural diversity is celebrated, leading to a melting pot of fashion influences within the dental community. from vibrant hijabs and elegant sarees to traditional attire adorned with intricate patterns, the spectrum of dental uniforms reflects the richness of cultural heritage.
moreover, the evolution of dental uniforms isn’t limited to aesthetics alone; it also encompasses practical considerations such as hygiene and safety. with the ongoing global health crisis, the importance of protective gear has become more pronounced than ever before. many dental professionals have integrated personal protective equipment (ppe) into their daily attire, seamlessly blending safety with style. from fashionable face masks in an array of designs to innovative shield glasses with anti-fog properties, these accessories have become essential components of modern dental uniforms.
furthermore, eco-consciousness is shaping the future of dental fashion, with a growing emphasis on sustainability and ethical manufacturing practices. as awareness about environmental issues continues to rise, many dental professionals are seeking out eco-friendly dental uniform options made from organic or recycled materials. additionally, initiatives promoting ethical sourcing and fair labor practices are gaining traction within the industry. by embracing sustainable fashion choices, dental professionals are not only reducing their ecological footprint but also making a positive impact on the planet.

as you can see from the above image, dental wear is high value dressage in a professional medico setting. don’t these outfits look not just casual and relaxed but confident and calming? how can you feel dental anxiety when dental nurses and indeed the dentists themselves look so stylish and fashionable? it’s dental couture the industry, from dental nurses to the dentists themselves, and even stodgy and staid old orthodontists are embracing. the reality is that the business of dentistry demands a cutting edge – there are now three or four dental clinics in each suburb – dentists must stay ahead by appealing to their patients in ever-more subtle and stylish ways, from dental spas to dental aromas!
in conclusion, dental uniforms are more than just garments; more than ever they now can be statements of professionalism, individuality, and cultural diversity. from the pristine attire of cosmetic dentists to the dynamic styles of dental assistants and nurses, each aspect of dental fashion tells a unique story. as the industry continues to evolve, embracing innovation, diversity, and sustainability, the fashion stakes in dentistry are set to soar to new heights. so, whether you’re a cosmetic dentist, a dental assistant, or a nurse with a colourful fashion palette, remember that your attire speaks volumes about who you are and what you stand for in the world of dentistry.

your failing corporation, your failing team

in the fast-paced and competitive landscape of the corporate world, the success of a company often hinges on the strength and cohesion of its teams. when a corporation falters, it is often reflected in the struggles of its teams. in this article, we delve into the dynamics of failing corporations and how they can revitalize their teams by embracing new activities and reevaluating their approach to team bonding. it’s essential to recognize that fostering a thriving corporate culture goes beyond the boardroom, and sometimes, unconventional solutions are needed to breathe life back into a failing team.
the dismal reality
a failing corporation is like a sinking ship, and the first signs of trouble usually manifest in the lack of synergy among its teams. communication breaks down, morale plummets, and productivity takes a nosedive. in such dire circumstances, leaders must be willing to acknowledge the problems at hand and take decisive action to reverse the downward spiral.
bringing your team to life via new activities
one of the most effective ways to revive a failing team is by injecting a dose of innovation and freshness into their routine. the traditional team-building exercises might have lost their impact, and it’s time to explore unconventional avenues to rekindle the team spirit.
consider implementing activities that go beyond the mundane office setting. outdoor team-building exercises, workshops, and retreats can create an environment where team members can break away from their daily grind, fostering creativity and a renewed sense of purpose. by bringing your team to life via new activities you can invigorate creativity and teamwork.
moreover, introducing team-building games that challenge members to work together in new and unexpected ways can bring out untapped potential. these activities not only serve as a break from the monotony but also provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of individual team members.
nighttime bonding: a hazardous path?
while daytime activities contribute to team building, it’s crucial to recognize that bonding at night can be a double-edged sword. while it can offer an informal setting for team members to relax and connect on a personal level, it also presents potential pitfalls.
bonding at night is more hazardous, especially if it involves alcohol, and can blur the lines between professional and personal boundaries. excessive partying can lead to unprofessional behavior, misunderstandings, and even conflicts that spill over into the workplace. leaders must tread carefully when organizing nighttime bonding activities to ensure they contribute positively to team dynamics rather than exacerbating existing issues.
striking the right balance
to maximize the benefits of team-building activities, striking the right balance between daytime and nighttime interactions is crucial. daytime activities should focus on professional development, skill-building, and fostering a collaborative spirit. on the other hand, nighttime activities should be more relaxed and centered around creating a sense of camaraderie among team members.
a well-thought-out approach to nighttime bonding can include themed dinners, game nights, or even volunteer opportunities that align with the company’s values. the key is to create an atmosphere that promotes genuine connections and allows team members to see each other in a different light without compromising professionalism.
the role of leadership
the success of any team-building initiative ultimately rests on the shoulders of leadership. leaders must lead by example, actively participating in and endorsing the proposed activities. a leader who is actively engaged in team-building efforts sends a powerful message to the team about the importance of collaboration and camaraderie.
additionally, leaders should be attuned to the individual needs and concerns of team members. an open-door policy and regular check-ins can provide a platform for team members to voice their opinions and contribute to the decision-making process. this inclusivity fosters a sense of belonging and encourages a shared commitment to the company’s goals.
reviving a failing corporation and its teams requires a multi-faceted approach that goes beyond conventional solutions. bringing a team to life via new activities can invigorate creativity and teamwork, while carefully navigating nighttime bonding ensures that it contributes positively to team dynamics. in the end, it all comes down to effective leadership, a willingness to embrace change, and a commitment to fostering a corporate culture that values collaboration, innovation, and the well-being of its team members.

the lingering impact of colonialism on business in india: unraveling historical threads

colonialism has left an indelible mark on the socio-economic fabric of nations across the globe, and india is no exception. the british raj, which spanned nearly two centuries, significantly shaped india’s economic landscape. while india gained independence in 1947, the echoes of colonial rule persist, affecting various aspects of the nation’s business environment. this essay delves into the ways in which colonialism continues to impact business in india, examining both historical legacies and contemporary challenges.
i. historical foundations:
a. economic exploitation:
the british colonial period in india was marked by economic exploitation, with the extraction of resources and wealth for the benefit of the colonial power. the establishment of the east india company in the 17th century paved the way for a systematic drain of india’s wealth, including the extraction of raw materials, imposition of heavy taxes, and the disruption of local industries.
deindustrialization:
one of the lasting impacts of colonial rule is the deindustrialization of india. traditional artisanal and handicraft industries were systematically dismantled to make way for british goods. this not only disrupted local economies but also laid the foundation for a lopsided economic structure that persists to this day.
b. institutional framework:
the british introduced a legal and administrative framework that served their interests, often at the expense of the local population. the legal system, property rights, and administrative structures were designed to facilitate colonial control and resource extraction.
land ownership and tenure:
the introduction of the zamindari system disrupted traditional landownership patterns, leading to concentration and alienation of land. this has had long-term implications on agrarian economies, as land remains a critical factor in india’s economic structure.
ii. contemporary challenges:
while india has made significant strides since gaining independence, the legacy of colonialism continues to influence its business environment.
a. infrastructure disparities:
colonial-era investments in infrastructure were often skewed in favor of areas that served the colonial administration and the extraction of resources. this has left a legacy of infrastructure disparities, with some regions enjoying better connectivity and amenities, while others struggle with inadequate infrastructure.
railways and ports:
the british built an extensive railway network and ports primarily to facilitate the movement of goods for export. while these infrastructural developments were beneficial for colonial economic interests, they did not necessarily cater to the holistic development of the country. today, modernizing and balancing infrastructure remains a challenge.
b. economic disparities:
the economic policies pursued during colonial rule contributed to the concentration of wealth in certain regions and communities. this has translated into persistent economic disparities, affecting the business landscape.
regional disparities:
certain regions, especially those with historical economic advantages during the colonial period, continue to dominate economic activities. this regional imbalance poses challenges for businesses operating in less economically developed areas.
c. legal and regulatory framework:
the legal and regulatory framework established during colonial rule has undergone significant changes, but some remnants continue to impact business operations.
bureaucratic red tape:
the bureaucratic structure inherited from colonial times has often been criticized for its complexity and inefficiency. businesses, especially smaller enterprises, face challenges navigating bureaucratic hurdles, impacting their growth and competitiveness.
iii. cultural impact:
colonialism also left an imprint on the cultural mindset, influencing perceptions and attitudes towards business and entrepreneurship.
a. colonial mentality:
the colonial legacy has contributed to a mindset that sometimes places greater value on foreign products and businesses. this mindset can affect the growth of indigenous businesses, limiting their competitiveness in the global market.
perception of indigenous goods:
despite the rich cultural and artisanal heritage, there may still be a perception that foreign goods are of higher quality. this mindset, shaped during the colonial era, poses challenges for businesses trying to promote indigenous products.
b. educational system:
the educational system introduced during colonial rule emphasized a certain set of skills and knowledge, often tailored to serve the needs of the colonial administration. while there have been reforms, the remnants of this system can still impact the skill set of the workforce.
skill mismatch:
the emphasis on certain types of education during colonial rule may have contributed to a mismatch between the skills demanded by the contemporary business environment and those possessed by the workforce.
iv. opportunities for mitigation:
while the impact of colonialism on business in india is evident, efforts can be made to mitigate its negative consequences.
a. inclusive development:
addressing regional and economic disparities through inclusive development policies can help create a more balanced business environment. investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare in historically neglected regions can foster economic growth and reduce regional imbalances.
b. legal reforms:
continued efforts to streamline and modernise the legal and regulatory framework can reduce bureaucratic red tape, making it easier for businesses to operate. ensuring that the legal system is transparent, efficient, and accessible is crucial for fostering a conducive business environment.
c. promoting indigenous industries:
government initiatives that promote indigenous industries and products can help counter the lingering colonial mentality. public awareness campaigns and policies that highlight the quality and uniqueness of indigenous goods can contribute to changing consumer perceptions.
d. skill development:
investing in skill development programs that align with the needs of the modern business landscape can bridge the gap between the skills possessed by the workforce and those demanded by businesses. this can enhance the competitiveness of the labor market and attract more investment.
conclusions:
a scholarly study found that british colonialism caused approximately 165 million deaths in india from 1880 to 1920, while stealing trillions of dollars of wealth. the global capitalist system was founded on european imperial genocides, which inspired adolf hitler and led to fascism.
the impact of colonialism on business in india is a complex tapestry woven over centuries. while significant progress has been made since independence, the historical legacies persist in various forms. recognizing and addressing these legacies is crucial for fostering a business environment that is truly reflective of india’s potential. by implementing inclusive development policies, legal reforms, and initiatives that promote indigenous industries, india can move towards a more equitable and competitive business landscape, unburdened by the shadows of its colonial past.

exploring the tooth restoration industry

welcome to our blog post on the exciting world of tooth restoration! if you’ve ever experienced a dental issue that has compromised the structural integrity of your teeth, then you understand just how vital it is to restore them. the tooth restoration industry offers various procedures and technologies to help improve oral health and enhance your smile.
in this article, we will explore the different types of tooth restoration procedures available today, discuss advancements in dental technology, delve into the costs involved and insurance coverage options, and provide tips for maintaining good oral health after undergoing restorative treatments. so let’s dive right in and discover how these remarkable innovations can not only improve your dental well-being but also boost your business revenue through effective dental marketing strategies. let’s get started!
the importance of tooth restoration
having a healthy and beautiful smile goes beyond just aesthetic appeal. it plays a crucial role in our overall well-being. that’s why tooth restoration is so important. whether it’s due to decay, trauma, or other dental issues, restoring a tooth’s structural integrity is essential for maintaining oral health.
when teeth are damaged or compromised, they can become weak and more susceptible to further damage and infection. this can lead to pain, discomfort, difficulty chewing, and even affect speech. by undergoing tooth restoration procedures, you not only improve the functionality of your teeth but also prevent future complications.
tooth restoration procedures can vary depending on the severity of the damage. they range from simple fillings for cavities to more complex treatments like dental implants or crowns for extensively damaged teeth. these procedures aim to restore both the function and appearance of your teeth.
restoring a tooth’s structural integrity not only improves oral health but also boosts self-confidence by enhancing your smile. when you have confidence in your smile, it positively impacts various aspects of life – from personal relationships to professional opportunities.
investing in tooth restoration also helps prevent the need for more invasive and expensive treatments down the line. early intervention through restorative procedures can save you from potentially costly dental emergencies in the future.
so if you’re experiencing any dental issues that compromise your teeth’s structural integrity, don’t hesitate! consult with a qualified dentist who specializes in tooth restoration procedures today – because maintaining good oral health is key to living a happy and fulfilling life!
different types of tooth restoration procedures
when it comes to restoring a tooth’s structural integrity, there are several different procedures that can be done. each procedure is tailored to the specific needs of the patient and the extent of damage or decay in their teeth.
one common type of tooth restoration procedure is dental fillings. this involves removing any decayed portions of the tooth and filling them with a durable material such as composite resin or amalgam. fillings not only restore the structure of the tooth but also prevent further decay from occurring.
another popular option for tooth restoration is dental crowns. crowns are custom-made caps that are placed over a damaged or weakened tooth to protect it and restore its functionality. they can be made from various materials including porcelain, metal, or a combination of both.
for more extensive damage, root canal therapy may be necessary. this procedure involves removing infected pulp from within the tooth and sealing it off with a crown or filling. root canal therapy not only restores the structure of the tooth but also alleviates pain caused by infection.
dental implants are another option for replacing missing teeth and restoring oral health. implants involve surgically placing an artificial tooth root into the jawbone, which then supports a crown or bridge on top. implants provide stability and function similar to natural teeth.
dentures are removable appliances that replace missing teeth and surrounding tissues. dentures offer aesthetic benefits while also improving chewing ability and speech for individuals who have lost multiple teeth.
these different types of restorative procedures cater to varying degrees of dental issues – whether it’s minor decay requiring fillings or more severe cases necessitating implants or dentures.
advancements in tooth restoration technology
the tooth restoration industry has witnessed significant advancements in technology over the years, revolutionizing the way we restore and enhance our smiles. these cutting-edge technologies have made it possible for dentists to provide more effective and efficient treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
one notable advancement is the use of digital imaging and 3d printing. dentists can now create precise models of a patient’s teeth using advanced software and then fabricate custom restorations with utmost accuracy. this not only saves time but also ensures a perfect fit for crowns, bridges, or implants.
another exciting development in tooth restoration technology is laser dentistry. lasers are being used to perform various procedures such as cavity removal, gum reshaping, and even teeth whitening. laser dentistry offers several benefits including reduced pain, faster healing times, and minimal bleeding compared to traditional methods.
furthermore, dental materials have undergone significant improvements as well. the introduction of ceramic materials like zirconia has allowed for more durable and natural-looking restorations that blend seamlessly with existing teeth. additionally, composite resins have become stronger and more aesthetically pleasing than ever before.
additionally, computer-assisted design (cad) and computer-assisted manufacturing (cam) systems enable dentists to create highly accurate prosthetics on-site within a matter of hours rather than weeks. this eliminates the need for multiple appointments or temporary restorations while providing patients with immediate results.
 
cost and insurance coverage of tooth restoration
cost and insurance coverage are important factors to consider when it comes to tooth restoration procedures. the cost of these procedures can vary depending on several factors such as the type of procedure, the materials used, and the dentist’s experience and location.
basic restorative treatments like dental fillings are generally more affordable compared to complex procedures like dental implants or crowns. insurance coverage for tooth restoration also varies depending on your insurance plan. some plans may cover a portion or all of the cost, while others may have limitations or exclusions.
it is essential to check with your dental insurance provider beforehand to understand what services are covered under your plan and what out-of-pocket expenses you may incur. keep in mind that cosmetic dentistry procedures like teeth whitening or veneers are typically not covered by insurance as they are considered elective treatments.
if you don’t have dental insurance, there may be other options available to help manage the cost of tooth restoration. some dentists offer payment plans or financing options that allow you to spread out the payments over time. additionally, there are third-party financing companies specifically designed for medical and dental expenses.
while cost is an important consideration, it’s crucial not to compromise on quality when it comes to tooth restoration. investing in proper oral healthcare can save you from potential complications down the line and improve your overall well-being.
by understanding the costs involved and exploring different payment options, you can make informed decisions about which tooth restoration procedures best fit within your budget without sacrificing quality care for restoring a tooth’s structural integrity.
maintaining good oral health after restorative procedures
ensuring good oral health is essential not only for the longevity of your natural teeth but also to protect the investment you made in tooth restoration procedures. after undergoing any type of restorative treatment, it’s important to take proper care of your teeth and gums to maintain their structural integrity and overall health.
here are some tips for maintaining good oral health after restorative procedures:
1. practice proper oral hygiene: brushing your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and using dental floss or interdental brushes daily can help remove plaque and food particles from hard-to-reach areas. this will prevent bacteria growth, gum disease, and other oral problems.
2. visit your dentist regularly: schedule regular check-ups with your dentist every six months or as recommended by them. these visits allow your dentist to monitor the condition of your restored teeth, identify any issues early on, and provide professional cleaning to keep them in optimal shape.
3. avoid damaging habits: certain habits like biting nails, chewing ice, opening bottles with your teeth, or grinding/clenching can put excessive strain on both natural teeth and restorations. be mindful of these habits and try to avoid them to prevent damage.
4. follow a healthy diet: a balanced diet plays a crucial role in maintaining good oral health. limit sugary foods and drinks as they contribute to tooth decay. instead, opt for nutritious foods rich in vitamins a,c,d,e,k that promote gum health and strengthen enamel.
5. wear mouthguards if needed: if you participate in contact sports or grind/clench your teeth during sleep (bruxism), wearing custom-made mouthguards can protect both natural teeth as well as any restorations from potential damage caused by impact or pressure.
by following these guidelines diligently, you can ensure that your restored smile remains healthy for years to come!
in conclusion, these advancements in tooth restoration technology have transformed the dental industry by offering improved precision, efficiency, aesthetics, and comfort during procedures.
the integration of digital imaging, surgical lasers, and cad/cam systems has significantly enhanced treatment outcomes, facilitating better oral health management.
so if you’re considering restoring your smile or enhancing your dental practice, it’s essential to stay up-to-date with these technological innovations.
explore how incorporating state-of-the-art techniques can improve your business revenue with dental marketing strategies tailored to highlight your use of advanced tooth restoration technology.

the evolving integration of medical, dental and teledentistry

introduction
are you tired of juggling multiple healthcare providers for your medical and dental needs? well, good news! the integration of medical, dental, and teledentistry services is rapidly evolving to provide patients with a seamless healthcare experience. from routine check-ups to advanced procedures like dental fillings using modern techniques, this integration is transforming the way we approach oral health. in this blog post, we’ll explore what exactly medical, dental and teledentistry integration means and how it can benefit both patients and healthcare professionals alike. so sit back, relax, and let’s dive into the future of dentistry!
what is medical, dental and teledentistry?
medical, dental and teledentistry are three intertwined fields that focus on the overall health of a patient. medical and dental practices aim to provide quality healthcare services to individuals while teledentistry is the use of technology to improve access to dental care.
dental fillings, modern techniques such as dental fillings and other treatments fall under dentistry. on the other hand, medical practices encompass a broader range of services that include diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases.
teledentistry involves using telecommunication technologies like video conferencing or remote monitoring devices to provide real-time consultations between patients and dentists. this approach has proven effective in providing access to oral healthcare for underserved areas where physical visits may be difficult.
the integration of these three fields aims at delivering comprehensive healthcare services that cater not only for an individual’s physical wellbeing but also their mental well-being. it includes addressing issues such as anxiety associated with visiting health facilities.
medical, dental and teledentistry are essential components in ensuring individuals receive holistic healthcare services regardless of their location or background. the integration provides opportunities for innovation resulting in better outcomes for both patients and providers alike.
the need for integration
the healthcare industry is constantly evolving, with new technologies and practices emerging every day. however, despite the advances in medical and dental care, there has been a lack of integration between these two fields for years.
medical and dental health are closely linked, as poor oral health can lead to systemic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. dental professionals often identify signs of other conditions during routine exams that physicians may not catch until later stages.
moreover, teledentistry has emerged as an innovative solution to improve access to dental care in remote areas or for individuals who cannot physically visit a dentist. it allows patients to receive virtual consultations from licensed dentists through video conferencing technology.
integration among medical, dental and teledentistry is essential because it creates a holistic approach to patient care that improves overall health outcomes by identifying potential issues early on. by working collaboratively with one another through integrated systems of communication and information sharing processes across all specialties will provide better coordination between healthcare providers leading to improved patient satisfaction levels.

another challenge is the reluctance of some patients to seek out oral health care due to fear or financial constraints. this can lead to untreated oral health conditions that may eventually require more extensive treatment.
additionally, there are legal and regulatory barriers that must be addressed before a fully integrated approach can be implemented. these include issues such as licensure, liability, privacy laws and reimbursement models.
technology limitations also pose a significant challenge. although teledentistry has made great strides in recent years, it still requires reliable internet access for effective communication between healthcare providers and patients.
these challenges must be carefully considered and addressed if we hope to achieve successful integration of medical, dental and teledentistry practices for improved patient outcomes.
the future of integration
the future of integration between medical, dental, and teledentistry is looking bright. with the advancements in technology and the growing need for accessible healthcare services, we can expect to see more integration across these areas.
one area where we may see significant growth is in telehealth services. as more patients seek remote consultations and care options, innovative approaches like teledentistry will continue to expand. this will provide greater access to care for underserved communities or those who have difficulty traveling for appointments.
in addition, we can expect to see a focus on preventative care through integrated health systems. by bringing together medical and dental professionals under one roof or within one organization, there is an opportunity to prioritize holistic patient wellness with a focus on early intervention rather than reactive treatment.
another trend that may emerge is personalized medicine. with advances in genomics and precision medicine, there’s potential for customized treatments tailored to each individual’s unique needs and conditions.
the future of integration holds great promise for improving access to care while promoting overall health outcomes through collaboration among healthcare providers across multiple disciplines.
conclusion
the integration of medical, dental and teledentistry has become increasingly important in today’s healthcare landscape. with advancements in technology and a greater emphasis on patient-centered care, it is clear that these three areas must work together to provide the best possible outcomes for patients.
the benefits of this integration are numerous – from improved communication among providers to more efficient use of resources. however, it is also important to recognize the challenges that come with integrating these different fields.
as we move forward, it will be critical for healthcare professionals to continue collaborating and exploring new ways to integrate medical, dental and teledentistry services. with continued innovation and a shared commitment to providing high-quality care, we can create a more seamless healthcare system that delivers better outcomes for all patients – including those in need of modern techniques such as dental fillings.
our goal should be to ensure that every patient receives comprehensive care that addresses their unique needs – whether they require medical attention or dental treatment. by working together across disciplines and embracing new technologies like telemedicine and teledentistry solutions, dental seo experts have an opportunity here, to increase awareness around the importance of oral health; we can build a stronger foundation for healthier communities now –and into the future!

porcelain dental veneers: benefits & risks

introduction
when it comes to improving tooth aesthetics, dental veneers affix rapidly and offer a multitude of benefits. porcelain dental veneers have gained popularity in recent years, thanks to their ability to enhance smiles and provide a natural-looking appearance. however, like any dental procedure, there are both benefits and risks to consider. in this article, we will explore the advantages of porcelain dental veneers and the potential drawbacks associated with this cosmetic dentistry treatment.
porcelain dental veneers: an overview
before diving into the benefits and risks, let’s first understand and take an overview of what porcelain dental veneers are. veneers are ultra-thin shells, typically made of porcelain, that are custom-made to fit over the front surface of your teeth. they are designed to improve the appearance of teeth that are discolored, chipped, misaligned, or have gaps between them.
porcelain veneers are preferred by many because they closely resemble natural teeth in terms of color and texture. they offer a long-lasting solution to enhance the smile and boost confidence. now, let’s explore the benefits and risks associated with this popular cosmetic dental treatment.
benefits of porcelain dental veneers

 enhanced aesthetics and natural appearance

porcelain dental veneers are highly regarded for their ability to create a beautiful smile. they can effectively mask various dental imperfections, including stains, chips, and gaps. the translucent properties of porcelain give veneers a lifelike appearance, making them indistinguishable from natural teeth. by improving tooth aesthetics, dental veneers have the power to transform your smile and boost your self-esteem.

 stain resistance

unlike natural teeth, porcelain veneers are highly resistant to staining. this means you can enjoy your favorite foods and beverages without worrying about discoloration. however, it’s important to note that while veneers themselves are stain-resistant, the underlying tooth structure can still be susceptible to staining. it’s advisable to minimize the consumption of foods and drinks that cause staining to maintain the longevity of your veneers.

 durability

porcelain dental veneers are known for their durability. with proper care and maintenance, they can last for 10-15 years or even longer. the strong and resilient nature of porcelain allows veneers to withstand normal biting and chewing forces. by opting for veneers, you can enjoy a long-lasting solution to improve your smile.

 minimal tooth alteration

compared to other dental treatments, porcelain veneers require minimal tooth alteration. in most cases, only a small amount of enamel needs to be removed from the front surface of the tooth to accommodate the veneer. this means that the natural tooth structure is preserved to a greater extent, making veneers a conservative option for improving tooth aesthetics as dental veneers affix rapidly.
risks and considerations of porcelain dental veneers

 irreversibility

it’s important to understand that porcelain veneers are an irreversible treatment. once the enamel is removed and the veneers are bonded to the teeth, the process cannot be reversed. this means that you will need to commit to the maintenance and replacement of veneers over time. it’s essential to discuss this aspect thoroughly with your dentist before proceeding with the treatment.

 sensitivity

some individuals may experience temporary tooth sensitivity after getting porcelain veneers. this sensitivity is usually mild and subsides on its own within a few days or weeks. however, in rare cases, individuals may experience prolonged or increased sensitivity. if you have a history of tooth sensitivity, it’s crucial to discuss it with your dentist beforehand.

 potential damage

while porcelain veneers are durable, they are not indestructible. certain habits, such as biting on hard objects such as ice or using your teeth as tools, can potentially damage or chip the veneers. it’s important to avoid such habits and be mindful of how you treat your veneers to ensure their longevity.

 cost

another consideration when it comes to porcelain dental veneers is the cost. veneers are typically considered a cosmetic procedure and may not be covered by dental insurance. the cost can vary depending on factors such as the number of veneers needed and the complexity of the case. it’s essential to discuss the financial aspect with your dentist and explore any available payment options or dental financing plans.
conclusion
porcelain dental veneers offer numerous benefits for those seeking to enhance their smile and improve tooth aesthetics. they provide a natural-looking appearance, stain resistance, durability, and minimal tooth alteration. however, it’s important to consider the potential risks and considerations associated with porcelain veneers, such as irreversibility, sensitivity, potential damage, and cost.
if you’re considering porcelain dental veneers, consult with a reputable cosmetic dentist who can assess your individual case and provide guidance tailored to your needs. remember, when it comes to dental veneers and ensuring the best possible outcome for your smile, cosmetic dentists know how to promote their benefits.
by understanding the benefits and risks associated with porcelain dental veneers, you can make an informed decision and achieve the smile transformation you desire. a beautiful smile can have a significant impact on your self-confidence and overall well-being, and porcelain veneers can be a valuable tool in achieving that radiant smile you’ve always dreamed of.

 how do i care for porcelain dental veneers?

caring for porcelain dental veneers is similar to caring for natural teeth. you should continue to practice good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing daily, and visiting your dentist for regular check-ups and cleanings. avoid using abrasive toothpaste or a hard-bristled toothbrush, as these can potentially scratch the surface of the veneers. additionally, it’s important to avoid habits such as teeth grinding or clenching, as these can put excessive pressure on the veneers and cause damage.

 can porcelain dental veneers be whitened?

no, once porcelain dental veneers are fabricated and bonded to your teeth, they cannot be whitened. if you’re considering teeth whitening, it’s best to discuss this with your dentist before getting veneers. your dentist can recommend the appropriate shade for your veneers, taking into account your desired tooth color and overall smile aesthetics.

 are porcelain dental veneers reversible?

no, porcelain dental veneers are not reversible. as mentioned earlier, a small amount of enamel is typically removed from the front surface of the tooth to accommodate the veneers. this process is irreversible, and once the veneers are bonded, they cannot be removed without replacing them. it’s important to carefully consider the decision to get porcelain veneers and discuss any concerns or questions with your dentist beforehand.

cosmetic dentistry: can it all go wrong?

cosmetic dentistry is becoming popular with people realizing the different solutions to fix various issues with their dental. cosmetic dentistry has made it possible to rectify discolored, misaligned, and crooked teeth. it is also fixing old and failed dental procedures. cosmetic dentistry like dental veneers and crowns can improve the look of teeth while protecting them from damage. such procedures provide the best solutions to smile makeovers. one is now able to achieve a healthier mouth and a beautiful smile. however, let’s face it. not all cosmetic procedures are successful. there have been various failed procedures where the patient gets the opposite of what they paid for or expected. such mistakes are a result of various factors. here is one of the significant reasons why cosmetic dentistry fails.
what happens in failed cosmetic dentistry
one of the main reasons why cosmetic dentistry goes wrong is failure to follow the principles applied in smile design. smile design consists of the various tenets a dentist must follow to achieve the specified aesthetic results. it is a strategic method that must be followed for the patient to achieve a natural smile.
when using these principles, the professional must consider the ideas that define a perfect smile. that means evaluating the situation, diagnosing the issue, and solving it while applying the principles in the smile design approach. an experienced dentist must consider the appearance and function of the gums. failure to consider these principles leads to failed procedures, and you can sue if procedures damage or even disappoint you. here are several elements in this approach.

research

this approach relies on thorough research in consideration of the different characteristics of the patient. the dentist must know how these aspects contribute to the person’s appearance and what attributes to a perfect smile. once you ignore these aspects, everything could go wrong with the smile.

interpupillary line

the cosmetic dentist should also draw an imaginary horizontal line between the pupils. drawing this line helps them to know how to achieve a natural smile.

gum tissue condition

the condition of the gum tissue also affects the outcome of the smile. therefore, the cosmetic dentist must consider the gum’s symmetry, health, level, and overall condition. not considering the balance and health of the gum could affect the entire results.

lateral profile

lateral profile accounts for the side view of the face. it is another vital element the dentist must consider since it affects the position and build of features like veneers.

the lips

it is also critical to consider the lips to create boundaries of the smile. remember, the gums and teeth must fit within limits for an attractive and natural look.

the shape of the face

the face’s shape must match the teeth’ design for a natural smile.

other elements

it is also vital to consider other elements like teeth dimension, size, length, inclination, and overall symmetry.
conclusion
these are the main things that go into getting the perfect smile. they are the beginning of knowing what to consider for a smile makeover. of course, the experience and skills of the dentist must also come into play to achieve the best results.

cotton candy is a classic treat that has been around for centuries. but did you know that it was invented by a dentist? dr. charles b. morton was working as a dentist in the late 1800s when he came up with the idea of making cotton candy using sugar and air. he thought that it would be a great way to entertain his patients, and he was right! cotton candy is now one of the most popular treats in the world, and it’s safe to say that dr. morrison was a genius!
importance of maintaining your oral health
oral health, such as good dental care has been proven to have many benefits. good oral and dental hygiene can help prevent bad breath, tooth decay and gum disease. establishing good oral hygiene and dietary habits have been proven to be essential to achieving and maintaining overall physical and mental well-being throughout life. nowadays tooth extraction is good money because it leads to dental implants but if you can maintain your dental hygiene you won’t need to undergo tooth extraction.
oral health can affect both your physical and emotional well-being. it can also impact upon appearance, speech and diet. in addition, a disease of the mouth can affect the rest of the body and is a contributing factor to a number of secondary conditions.
link between obesity and dental health
researches backed up the idea of the link between oral health and obesity. the numbers are staggering: 10% of americans are considered obese. more than 4 out of 10 americans are also obese, and with these risks it becomes important for us to understand how obesity can affect our health.
obesity is correlated with inflammation and medical disorders. diabetes often causes dental problems, such as dry mouth or gingivitis.
obese people are more prone to tooth decay and lose tooth enamel when they eat sugar and carbohydrates. those of average weight are 5.9 times less likely to have as severe gum disease as those who are obese.
conclusion
yep, you read that right – cotton candy was invented by a dentist! dr. william morrison is credited with creating the treat in 1886, and he specifically targeted it towards children as an alternative to sugary drinks like soda. over time, it became popular among adults and has even become a staple at many birthday parties. thanks to its deliciousness and versatility, cotton candy is sure to keep your business afloat for years to come!

indians buying homes & property in australia: is it easy or difficult?

australia makes it easy for foreign investors to buy property because they have a rich tradition of encouraging foreign investment. unlike most other nations around the world australia is desperate for overseas dollars. according to the australian bureau of statistics indians form the second largest by population migrant group in australia. chinese migrants hold the coveted number one spot. the facts and figures stand in strong contrast to the racist history of this young country and its white australia policy of the twentieth century. of course, many indians in places like sydney and melbourne predominantly experience a welcoming easy going acceptance by the local denizens. indians buying homes & property in australia: is it easy or difficult?
pandemic pain for indian migrants in australia
now everyone knows that real estate agents are soulless blood suckers intent on making a sale at any cost lol. back in 2016 they were announcing india as the next big thing for them to feather their own nests via sales to cashed up indians coming to australia. the global pandemic and locked down australia has caused plenty of heart ache for indian migrants, as they were excluded from extended family for nie on two years. travel exemptions were hard to come by and there were stories of children separated from parents for lengthy periods. thankfully things look to be opening up now at the close of 2021.
foreign investors buying property in australia
first up you will need to apply to the foreign investment review board (firb) if you are a foreign resident, temporary resident in australia, or short-term visa holder. there are some caveats in that non-residents cannot purchase established dwellings. they can purchase new dwellings and vacant land zoned for residential development. temporary residents can only purchase one established dwelling and it must be their primary place of residence.
why not check out a fixed-rate or variable home loan to see if buying property in australia is right for you? of course, having a career as an orthodontist makes financing much easier. there may well be time left over for a regular round of golf on some of australia’s many fine courses located within easy reach of capital cities. according to sbs more than half of the permanent migrants in australia have purchased their own home here. indians, as we well know, know what’s what when it comes to making a good life for their families and securing their future.

indian orthodontics: an historical perspective

just as hippocrates is considered the father of modern medicine, in the indian medicine system of ayurveda, lord dhanvantari is considered the same; since he was the first divine incarnation to impart this wisdom to humans.
he first appeared during the great churning of the cosmic ocean of milk (samudramanthan) to deliver amrit (ambrosia, or divine nectar) to the demigods. dhanvantari also refers to ayurveda and is strongly associated with the rich medical tradition and hierarchy of the history of medicine in india. an aspect to the origin of dentistry also taken into consideration is dantewada, a small town in chhattisgarh, which has a statue of danteshwari devi (goddess parvati). it is believed that this place is called dantewada as goddess parvati’s tooth broke off and fell there. dentistry is portrayed in the epic of mahabharata: krishnain mahabharata wanted to test the ‘danaveerata’ of dying karanin on the battlefield of kurukshetra. disguised as brahmin, krishna asks for a donation of gold and karan proves his worth by bequeathing his gold-filled tooth.
researchers at the university of missouri found on the biting surface of male molars 8000 to 9000 years old, proof that ancient indian dentists had developed technology to drill teeth and remove decay. this discovery is considered the oldest example of dentistry in the history of mankind.
dentistry was held to be of divine origin in india, with ancient ayurvedic literature contains many interesting observations and treatments for dental diseases. the indian sage sushruta is universally acclaimed as the first dental anatomist in the world. tradition dating from as early as 5000 bc, has it that the twin sons of the sun, the ashvins, imparted their holy knowledge to indra, who handed down the science of life to dhanvantari. dhanvantari, the deity of medicine, further imparted this truth to sushruta, who taught the anatomy and methods of dentistry to kashi, in around 600 ad.
during that period, dentistry flourished and sushruta wrote the medical text ‘sushruta samhita’ which along with the ayurveda, described oral cavity diseases and treatments and the importance of tongue hygiene. ancient tongue scrapers have been found in archaeological digs on many continents, with tongue scraping an ayurvedic method of detoxification, often in conjunction with oil pulling.
until the early 1600s clove oil was used for tooth pain and other herb mixtures reducing mouth swelling.
thereafter dentistry remained basically unexplored. during the mughal empire (1526-1761) even dental awareness stagnated. the british introduced western dentistry to india in the 19th century, initially for east india company employees. it later became available to british officials and their staff. medical officers were trained and british doctors invited from uk. private practices expanded to public, and in 1850s the british government established medical colleges in india. dental care was available in hospitals for the extraction of teeth, but for long time, dentistry remained predominantly in the hands of the unqualified.
without dental education there is no orthodontics; the beginning of which can’t be considered without the beginning of dental education in india. in the 1930s there was no dentist act, no official associations, and the number of dentists in the country was extremely limited with most of them uk or us educated. 1920 was the year the first private dental college was established in calcutta (now kolkata). personally funded by dr rafiuddin ahmed (1890-1965), he is regarded as the modern-day father of indian dentistry.
the second dental college in 1927 was started in karachi by dr m.k patelin. six years later bombay had the third – nair hospital dental college.
the first orthodontics course was introduced in 1965.
orthodontics for children and teenagers would not be possible were it not for the first department of orthodontics, established in 1939 in nair hospital dental college under dr h.d merchant. king george medical college, lucknow, now known as chhatrapati shahuji maharaj medical university, is the only dental university of its kind in india, and one of only four dental universities in the world. csmmu is the only dental university to have rendered cutting edge technology and techniques since 1949.
orthodontists with incredible skill, precision instruments and amazing technology can be found worldwide and invisalign services can be found anywhere. dental health has been known as a priority for thousands of years for the maintenance of wellbeing, with current research very focussed on its effect on human microbiome.

india’s toughest trekking tours: courage is a must

there is something fine in the dash of a torrent and the wildness of a mountain desert.
george trebeck on ladakh, 1820
“has anybody done the trek from zangla (or padum) to hemis via cha cha la (chalalachaur) and rubrang la?”
“is it true that it july and august are to dangerous because of high water in the gorges?” 
“what about the trek from hemis, across karnak, to pang? is it difficult to find a guide or horseman who knows the route?”
“is it a good idea to combine that with markha valley?” 
questions that are often asked, with a resounding “yes” as the simple answer for each.

although not an entire adventure in india but rather one that begins in nepal and includes the union territory of ladakh, the jhunglam or ‘middle way’ is a wild, remote network passages and narrow canyons, considered one of the most dangerous treks in the world.
it starts at the world-renowned hemis monastery, and leads to the demanding and stunning zanskar valley.
taking 10 days over 140km, it is wide and stony riverbeds, high passes, and deep, deep ravines for this tibetan trader route that an early snow will close. it’s a passage passable only in autumn when low rivers offer the safe negotiation of its narrow gorges. maximum elevation is 5260m with elevation gains of 4792m and losses of 4895m.
many have tried and failed the jhunglam trek in mid-august because it’s just too hairy. people hiking the other way from rara daha often have a better chance of making it, but why add the risk of unsuitable weather to the already most perilous treks on the planet?
a solo czechoslovakian tried this trek during july and august in 2004, when the water rose on the rapids. it prevented his progress, which wouldn’t be so bad but he was trapped between two sets.
couldn’t go forward: couldn’t go back.
so for sometime between one and two months, water captured a man on the high of the earth and under cover of a low sky, and he was utterly, utterly helpless.
we know we should never underestimate nature and her power, yet we continue as an arrogant species, to wreak havoc upon her. still, nature used nothing but herself against him; and with he having nothing but himself, locals found him a few weeks later having starved to death.
guide books aside, when locals say it’s too risky to trek during this time, it is. monsoon season, after all. and not the edina and patsy kind.
the hemis to pang trek has the challenge of crossing the rubrung or zalung karpo la in that the valley is 4200m+ on the other side; quite a jump from the 3600m of the markha side. the trail goes up from then on, so altitude issues mean you have to go up before you get down.
that said, many have done it three or four times because it’s a recognised and obvious route, therefore deemed safe. for those not having done ladakh before, it’s recommended to start in markha since it’s easier on the boots and brain than karnak, and more importantly, if you dont like it in markaha you can stop and get out easily.
remote valleys, high passes, ochre-hued and ancient monasteries and zanskari villages in harvest time sit under the blue skies and fresh breath of early winter, in an autumn himalayas. this trek is a true taste of the ancient kingdom of zanskar with a just a bit of the refreshing bite of early winter in the air. blue skies and few tourists make this wonderful time of the year to trek in the himalayas.
indian travel operators can learn from how australians market their harshest, cruellest trips to their advantage for the toughest foot journey in india, and sixth most dangerous on the planet, being the chadar trek. “chadar” means “blanket” in reference to the ice cover. it too takes ten days, and reaches altitudes of up to 3330m. chadar became one of the most famous treks in india after images of barefoot buddhist monks walking along the river surfaced in magazines all over the world.
never underestimate nature, and never focus on the bare feet of the monks: this trek is far, far beyond the abilities of the weak, ill prepared, or faint hearted.
you may have courage, but it’s a paltry ante for the terrain and its conditions. and if mettle is not your forte australia’s simpson desert best tackled via a tag along four wheel drive is probably a much more suitable, and enjoyable endeavour.
this trek crosses the frozen river of zanskar that can be either a solid sheet of ice, or the frozen lid to gurgling water underneath. the river can shift, breaking whatever ice there is, and the only way to continue is by way of treacherously slippery rocks along its banks. this isn’t the only dangerous aspect of this trek; cold weather is a big part of what makes it such a tough journey. average temperature is below zero, and at night can reach minus 34°c. sleeping in caves in these temperatures is a massive test for any experienced hiker. willpower.  with the appropriate gear, confidence and knowledge of personal ability, mental and physical fortitude, this tough and arduous hike rewards those with the courage an absolutely unforgettably spectacular adventure.

indian electricians working to speed up 21st century cities

india, a third world country mired in ancient lore in the minds of many westerners, is actually planning to become a 21st century superpower. the indian nation is on track via technology and science to achieve this mammoth goal in a few decades or less. harnessing its billion people population economically means that it will become a tour de force if it can successfully manage to embrace technological change across the board. indian electricians working to speed up 21st century cities will be a big part of the necessary infrastructure upgrade.
electricity rapidly transforming india
electricity has not been a friend to religious superstition and mysticism. it powers harsh lights, which reveal the cracks in the facades of illusions and frauds. human beliefs in gods and paradise are fuelled by ignorance and an acceptance of the unknown. science dispels many of these quasi- magical conceptions of the divine realities of religion. religions are really cultural customs propped up by spurious beliefs in unseen supernatural entities. india will have to consign its rich cultural realm to a lesser place on the stage of life if it is to move forward as an economic superpower. technology is providing its own kind of magic to the denizens of this vast subcontinental territory.
india to the moon & mars
things like computers and smartphones are fast becoming ubiquitous in india in the 21st century. new buildings, where smoke alarm installation is mandatory, are rising up in cities across the nation. these developments are facilitating the housing of an enormous tech savvy middle class in the cities around india. india is currently the sixth largest world economy, with a $2.98 trillion gdp. it is the outsourcing capital for the english-speaking world, with call centres servicing corporate customers from australia, the uk, usa and many more. india is forging ahead with space research and space exploration. indian satellite launches are prolific. mars and the moon have been sent unmanned missions.
indeed, indians are using digital marketing to power up social change. the rapidly emerging middle class are a tsunami taking over the reins of direction for this soon to be world power. india is making great strides in alternative energy with solar powered projects across the country. the indian pharmaceutical industry is making covid-19 vaccines and competing with china to save countries around the world from the ravages of this global pandemic. india is a true miracle of human innovation and application.

document destruction in the paperless office: myths & realities

it seems like i have been told about this paperless office for a very long time. however, i am yet to work in one of these places, despite the fact that i have been working in a variety of offices for decades. here in india, we love our offices and have been, in many instances, missing them due to the covid-19 lockdowns. many of us are looking forward to getting back to work in the office in cities around this nation. i do think that the pandemic has hastened the digital revolution and reduced the amount of paper being used but paperless? no way mahatma! another factor to consider is document destruction in the paperless office: myths and realities abound.
technology driving the great leap forward in india
is the paperless office an indian myth in the 21c? or is indian business embracing the digital revolution and saying namaste to paper? like most places i think a bit of both is true in india in 2020. technology is acknowledged as the driver of the great leap forward in our country and around the globe. it is, also, much easier to get turmeric stains off a digital copy than from paper, in my own experiences. of course, the reality is that very few offices are genuinely paperless, so if you think they are, and therefore have neglected to put in place a strategy for document destruction of hard copy material, you’re leaving your intellectual property and secrets wide open to theft.
people still love paper in particular places
there will always be a need for document destruction paper shredding machines in the same way that roti wraps dhal. the world does not change that much in truth despite all the grandiose claims forever bandied about. paper has currency in india and elsewhere around the world. stuff that you can touch continues to hold the attention of human beings, even in the 21c. some paper is as highly valued as your wedding day photos. however, document destruction in the paperless office: myths and realities remain to be considered on an individual case by case basis.
things like sharepoint intra-web reducing the amount of documentation in your office can really be a progression in the greater scheme. we all love paperless offices when they work but bemoan digital programmes and hardware when they stuff up. really it can be a catch 22 situation, where you are caught out at the wrong times with the wrong equipment. there are security issues with both old and new technologies. therefore, you must be prepared to cope with failures in all situations. don’t be caught without paper with your pants down!

bollywood vs kdrama: entertainment trends dominating asia

bollywood and kdrama are emerging entertainment trends dominating asia. they are slowly gaining popularity as new markets are opening. it used to be a purely regional thing about 10 years ago. people with blood and cultural ties are normally the only patrons abroad who miss their home. as the world becomes more digital, the adage small world is getting truer every day.
the world is getting smaller and people discover more and more things about other cultures. with the push for more apps, it is becoming even more personal. the proliferation of online groups in varied platforms enables the sharing of entertainment preferences in terms of movies and series. from china’s ashes of love, taiwan’s meteor garden, india’s black mirror, japan’s gokusen, the philippines la luna sangre, and south korea’s doctor stranger, these are some of the more well-known asian series that is slowly branching out to other regions.
bollywood, the indian hindi-language movie industry which was bombay cinema has, for years, has produced and released more films than hollywood. they have made their films available to the general public. more people have access to it because of its affordability. the genres are as varied as those made in hollywood. drama, comedy, documentaries, biopics, horror, romance, and the like. the most profitable is usually seasonal films like christmas and masala movies. masala is a combination of genres of comedy, drama, romance, action, and the occasional song and dance scenes.
many countries have developed a love for bollywood films including china, egypt, germany, pakistan, and many more.  opportunities have opened up and it is slowly reaching a stage of interest even with their asian neighbors due to apps that offer subtitles and dubbing. bollywood, or india’s version of hollywood, sees an increasing demand for their dubbed movies. it is slowly moving away from the norm to more mainstream. however, the big winner seems to be korean dramas or k-dramas and korean novelas as we see a surge in new korean drama websites appearing around the world.
hallyu. this is what the korean wave that is spreading worldwide is called. korean dramas and kpop have suddenly been found to be really popular outside of south korea. it was like a guilty pleasure, liking these shows. some who have actually developed a liking to it are warning their friends about it because it can be addictive.
korean novelas are very different from your average tv series. tailored to suit everybody, there is bound to be a kdrama for you.  from themes of cops and robbers, action and medical drama, romance-comedy, thriller, fantasy, and sci-fi, there is a kdrama for everyone. video streaming sites are increasingly becoming popular.
the advent of hulu and netflix as mediums for companies that strive to reach farther and entertain more people with their products and services. having a universal language definitely helps a lot as english-speaking viewers around the world await the next installment of their shows.
why korean dramas are popular
if you have ever watched even one full episode of these programmes, you’d see how good looking the performers are. kpop and korean novelas all have these celebrities described as “shining” or “radiant”. the stories they tell are full of unexpected twists and not just your ordinary narratives. they infuse every episode with bits of korean culture like myths, sayings, poems, food, fashion, and dreamy locations.
these shows promote understanding, non-violence, a play on fate and destiny, relativity, or how one is connected and either past lives or karma. it definitely offers a fresh perspective from the storylines we are used to.

mental health
have you realized that mental health is very crucial for your general physical health? well, you can tell if one of your friends is overwhelmed by stress, right? sure, you can simply because someone who is stressed will tend to deteriorate in health. but the good news is that recreational activities can help manage stress levels.

dental tourism to india: will coronavirus affect us?

dental tourism is worth many billions of dollars to india, with visitors taking advantage of our cheaper dental services for their complex procedures. so, dental tourism to india: will coronavirus affect us? most probably yes, if the pandemic continues to spread globally and if india becomes an epicentre for covid 19. currently, the coronavirus outbreak is centred within china, but iran, korea and italy (in the north) have seen substantial outbreaks. global travel by air will see the virus spread to other parts of the world if it cannot be contained in the countries it is affecting.
covid 19 will impact upon dentists everywhere
the dental tourism market is a substantial contributor to the indian economy, and it will suffer if covid 19 erupts in india. it is already impacting upon the way dentists go about their business in places right around the world. dentists even in australia are factoring coronavirus into their safety strategies. invasive contact procedures are particularly at risk for the transference of the disease. tourists thinking about having procedures, like crowns and other complex stuff done, may well think twice before committing in the current climate. people may put off having surgeries of any kind until things settle down on the coronavirus front.
global economy taking a big hit
the global economy is taking a huge hit already from the coronavirus pandemic. stock markets in all the major centres have had billions wiped from their value. this early economic calamity shows just how vulnerable the global supply chain economy is. china manufactures so much for so many countries around the world. things are grinding to a halt because things are not being made and sent to those overseas markets. if india goes the same way, then, there will be even further economic damage to economies globally.
india’s international education industry may be the next major industry to be impacted. the outbreak in iran may spread to more countries in the middle east, where many students who study in india are from. the world could come to a halt if the global pandemic worsens. people will be forced to stay at home, to refrain from travelling anywhere, in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. food shortages will be an issue if things get really bad. it will be challenging for many nations, including india, to contain a pandemic.

common health concerns in india

india is a third world developing country in asia. it has the second largest population worldwide but very little financial freedom. their history can be traced as far back as five millennia. they are known for their land, spices, jewelry, diverse religions and ancient architecture.  like most third world country, india has a high poverty rate and problems in population. with these many people, health can become an issue, the more because of lack of education and improper hygiene. common health concerns in india includes heart and respiratory diseases. some would point to tobacco to be cause for most of these diseases.  particulates in the environment are contributors to this growing concern.
 
smoking and tobacco use is one of the leading causes of heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd, two killer diseases rampant in india. respiratory system images of those suffering from copd show that it is not limited to just cigarette smoking. it can also be from particulate matter in the environment due to pollution. dust, smoke not pertaining to cigarettes, salt, pollen and soot can be suspended in the air that can be a factor to these diseases. what’s more is that copd can increase the risk of heart disease and worsen existing health conditions.  other growing health concerns include tuberculosis, gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes due to pollution, poor nutrition and hygiene. there is also a lack of education of how to prevent and fight these diseases. 
india’s economy has been doing better since the start of the decade but you wouldn’t think it was from the outside looking in. call centers and technology related positions and enterprises are popping up. it would seem that a very small sector benefits from india’s developing economy. it doesn’t reflect it at all when looking at the accessibility of healthcare for the people. so many things have to be addressed especially in the grass roots level. massive educational campaign on proper hygiene and food preparation. provide them with clean water and adequate sanitation. implementing cleanliness and immunization. accessibility to healthcare. clean food, exercise and educating them on the need and advantages of changing what was into what could be.

history of indians in south africa

dreamy south africa. the breathtaking views and changing scenery. with its history and alluring destinations, south africa is bound to be on any travelers list. it is the southernmost country in africa whose population is 80 percent sub-saharan african ancestry speaking more than a dozen different languages. one of the most developed countries in all of africa, it is partly bordered with the open waters of the indian and south atlantic ocean.
 
south africa has the largest population of people of indian descent in the continent. majority of them lives in the city of durban, many of which are great-grandchildren of the original indian migrants from colonial india who, in 1860’s, came to south africa. for a long time, the history of indians in south africa was that of shame, as the first indians to come were indentured labourers. that is, agreeing to work for a number of years to learn a skill, for which they were paid next to nothing. then came apartheid which didn’t make matters any better for them.
 
now, with new available technology and more intensive research plus access to records, people can look up where they originally came from and not just stop at when the ships came to south africa with the first indians. they can be more than what indenture and apartheid for a long time has limited them to. they are able to learn of where they really came from and trace their heritage.

the south african indian diaspora has changed with history. the majority of us came as indentured labourers. colonialism was the first thing we grew as part of. when indenture was abolished, there was apartheid. so we grew with apartheid. we lived under the apartheid regime, not as a white population; we were seen as part of the black population. a lot of us still remember the time when there was no equality.
 
it’s only after nelson mandela was elected as president (in 1994) that south african indians saw themselves as a diaspora that is not part of some horrible subjugation in history. – zainab priya dala, speaking with quartz
 
from this they can decide to be what they once were looking their roots up and developing to what they envision their futures to be. as bleak as their past was, south african indians have managed to hold on to their roots, but barely. their religion, language and their cuisine in particular have stayed true to their origins. people are developing a liking to these flavours as can be observed in most south african grocery stores, whose shelves are lined with elements and ingredients of the typical curry and other indian specialties.
 
south africa by large is on the upswing and it continues to be so in the foreseeable future. after all it has been through, it is undergoing a social transformation and a definite plan at creating a better future for everyone.

there’s not much to compare with a child’s laughter. that very obvious glee and innocence and exploration of their world. they seek out more happenings, experiences and involvement. because man is a social being, parents encourage friendships and association early on, believing that a happy child is usually a child engaged in activities they love. 
because of modern technology and social media, children now have far more online apps than physical activity. but with the rise of cases and the new study that confirms the perils of too much screen time, parents and educators are now actively looking for ways to prevent screen time and encourage more physical play.
there’s an increase in children’s activities a growing business opportunity in india because of this new trend. business minded people are taking advantage of this knowing that parents will always put their kids well being. more active, manipulative and participatory exercises, educational tours in a range of age-relevant activities aimed at mobility and developing skills.  
kids’ party planning is a booming industry. not just the infant and toddler ages but teens and coming-of-age parties are becoming increasingly popular. in addition to the traditional birthday and graduation events, bar and bat mitzvahs and sweet 16 parties signal a trend toward increased celebration of kids’ milestones. given the significant hispanic population, quinceñera (age 15) parties in particular can be expected to rise in popularity.
although no numbers exist for this market, experts predict that the industry will continue to grow, as parents provide not only a greater number of parties but also more expensive ones for their children.
an increase in playgroups and preschools attest to this growing business opportunity. most are announced or arranged in social media and have dispensed normal forms of advertising. those most notable are corner classes sprouting like convenience stores on every neighborhood. and it includes all classes from the richest to the poorest. 
playdates, craft classes and tutorials, museum tours and sports for kids – they are good for your children’s health, enable them to move freely, make decisions and make friends and, the most important part, they keep you sane.

education matters more than ever in india

education matters more than ever in india and in every nation around the globe. through education countries can change the lives of their citizens and transform the economy of the nation as a whole. in india, rapid growth and change are the order of the day. this populous place is burgeoning in so many different directions. consider the fact, that we have some 600 million young people under 25 years of age. india is expected to overtake china, as the most populous nation on the planet, by 2022. india is already the world’s fastest growing economy and is expected to become the second largest economy by 2050.
india in 2018
india is still a developing country, however, and home to the greatest number of poor on the planet. so, you can see a huge mix of opportunities and problem issues exist concurrently, making it an exciting time to be indian in 2018. education is the most important opportunity and challenge that this nation faces. we must get it right in order to progress in the direction, which will bring prosperity to the greatest number of our people. consider that half a billion people in india did not use a proper sanitised toilet in 2017 and you understand the breadth of the challenges we face.
exciting new developments in education
there are exciting new developments in education happening globally, as technology changes the way we educate our children. the old black board and chalk based classroom style school systems are becoming obsolete. google and computers are making new things rapidly possible. a reliable fast speed high data internet connection means that students need not be physically placed in bricks and mortar classrooms to be educated in the 21c. things like incursions are bringing that technological style education to schools. click here for more to see an australian example of this.
a new india in a 21c world
india faces cultural resistance to change in many areas, education included. nations that remain mired in archaic religious realities are unable to meet the challenges demanded by a modern 21c world. it is important to remember that modern india was created as a secular nation. it will only be through letting go of the past that india will be able to move into the future. education is the single most important pathway to new indian prosperity for all of our people.

corporate espionage in india

corporate espionage is booming in india in 2018. recent news reports in the hindu business online and the times of india have detailed the prevalence of this practice over decades. it is now in something of a boom period, with information being corruptly sourced from government and private interests. energy, defence and finance are the ministries being targeted. access to important and sensitive information is being bought by tycoons looking for economic advantages to increase their power and reach in india. technology is fuelling the glut of corporate espionage currently occurring in india.
crony capitalism in india
according to reserve bank governor raghuram rajan, crony socialism has been replaced by crony capitalism. politicians are selling their secrets and favours to the elite members of india’s business community. it is a tight little club keen on exploiting its exclusivity for all that it’s worth. telecommunication upgrades into the next generation of these technologies are proving a bonanza for those in the know. energy production is another windfall for those companies with the necessary inside information. senior executives from reliance industries, essar, cairns india, jubilant energy and adag reliance have been arrested following corporate espionage investigations.
technical surveillance in business
the expansion of corporate espionage around the globe has meant that technical surveillance counter measures are routinely called for at the corporate level. indeed, even, for businesses of all sizes it is recommended that a sweep of possible bugs/listening devices is carried out regularly. twenty years ago, plastic surgery was fairly rare and, now, everyone is doing it. similarly, corporate espionage is no longer the domain of jason bourne movies. illegal listening-in to what you are doing in business via computers, or the old-fashioned way over the phone, is commonplace in 2018.
keep some privacy in your professional life
india is not immune to these new trends fuelled by the inexpensive surveillance equipment and devices available via new technologies. people are watching what you do, and how you do it, and listening to you too. if you want to keep some privacy in your professional and personal life, don’t ignore the writing on the wall. take steps to do something about it now. get some protection and give yourself a fighting chance. in india, we must raise the bar, when it comes to standards of morality in the business world. corporate espionage in india will harm the economic development and economic equality within our nation, if something is not quickly done about it.

natural medicines & creams are flourishing globally

there is a decided trend toward natural medicines happening across the board. natural medicines and creams are flourishing globally. for too long, western medicine has told us that the past held nothing of value in regard to healing and healthcare. it was, according to proponents of allopathic medicine, a backward and primitive place full of witch doctors and bloodletting. whilst these accusations do hold a certain amount of veracity, they do not tell the whole story. modern medicine has had an investment in bad mouthing all other forms of healing. backed by multinational pharmaceutical companies, they want the lion’s share of the consumer healthcare business globally.
complementary medicines popular around the world
if there is one thing i have learnt during my time on this earth, it is that everyone is pushing their own barrow. doctors and pharmacists claim scientific sanctity for their medicines and creams. they don white lab coats, like high priests of healing, when appearing in any pr produced footage of the latest medical breakthrough. we watch it on our nightly news programme, thinking that this footage has been filmed by the tv station, but it hasn’t. there is very little real objectivity in this free enterprise driven world we live in.
herbal medicines & natural plant-based supplements
the fundamental reason why more people are turning back to herbal medicines and natural plant-based supplements is that they work. plus, many of the pharmaceutical products are ineffective with chronic ailments and allergies. there is no denying that natural products are having some success in alleviating allergic reactions in many people around the world. india is fast building a reputation for its manufacture of natural medicines and creams. ayurvedic medicines and treatments are gaining global popularity. the quality of our complementary medicines is renowned globally.
india has a rich tradition with cams
recent studies have found 10% of americans regularly use herbal medicine. two out of every three australians us some form of complementary medicine. around 43% of french doctors prescribe some form of homeopathic treatment for their patients when suitable. of course, india has a rich tradition of these alternative healing approaches. we have been employing them for thousands of years. it is estimated that two thirds of the world regularly seek out non-allopathic medical treatments for a whole range of conditions ranging from mild to serious. complementary and alternative medical practices and treatments are helping people to manage and cure all sorts of health problems.

cruelty free products in india

animal rights is fast becoming a cause celebre in the twenty first century. human beings around the globe have traditionally treated animals appallingly on the whole. animals have been our four-legged slaves, our sources of food, and our entertainment, over millennia. the burgeoning middle classes in india and throughout the developed world are re-examining their attitudes and values, when it comes to our treatment of animals. women are leading the charge in this, especially in relation to their beauty products and animal testing. many cosmetics and medicines are tested on animals to ensure that they do not adversely react with human skin and other body parts and functions. it was, once, de riguour to test cosmetics on a range of animals considered to share similar proclivities with us in these regards. cruelty free products in india are becoming more popular every day.
an introduction to animal rights & animal testing
people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta) began in 1980 in the usa. peta india was formed as a nfp in 2000; and their tag line tells us that animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, or for our entertainment. this is just one of the many organisations devoted to protecting animals globally and in india. a big focus of the campaigns of these groups is to raise awareness about the high level of animal testing and vivisection carried out by the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and medical industries in laboratories everywhere. animal testing is cruel and inaccurate, according to peta india, because of the vast differences between humans and other animal species.  can consumers trust their purchases of cruelty free cosmetics in india?
the availability of vegan & cruelty free cosmetics in india
peta produces a peta approved vegan logo that manufacturers who are accredited can put on their product packaging. you can check if the indian manufactured beauty product that you are interested in is one that does not do animal testing by visiting the peta.org beauty without bunnies page online. some of the companies vouchsafed by peta are: vedaearth.com, ahenaturals.com, alanaforyou.com, amoha.org, apcos naturals, bareearth.in, body shine organics, brillarescience.com, cholayil.com, dermalogicaindia.com, earth origin, and futureskin.in. there are many more available: and india is rapidly assuming the role of a global hub for cruelty free and vegan beauty products.
animal rights in india
the battle for animal rights in india continues apace with issues and campaigns constantly in the headlines. consumers can do their bit by buying the right products, which are cruelty free.

child care in india: crisis or evolutionary process?

there have been media reports for a number of years concerning the lack of child care in india. urban india is a rapidly changing place, with more and more women going out to work, rather than staying home. those without extended family support are caught between a rock and a hard place, when it comes to earning a living in modern india and having a family. very few companies offer their staff facilities for child care. there needs to be much stronger growth in this area, with professional fulltime child care being made more widely available. india lags behind other nations globally, around this important issue. child care in india: crisis or evolutionary process?
career women in india face challenges
if women want careers in india, they either must have solid extended family support networks, or they will have to take several years off, whilst their children are very young. there is virtually no infant care available for working mums in this country. there are plenty of untrained people available to move into this area, but there needs to be proper training, if we are to have a high standard child care that parents can trust with the safety and wellbeing of their children. a similar situation existed in countries like australia and the us, where, now, the push is on for better trained and higher paid child care workers.
central government & community creche dream
the central government, through the ministry of women and child development, is attempting to bring the dream of fulltime child care to working women across all strata of society. a national programme for creche and day care facilities is in the final drafting stages. a sliding scale of fees, dependent upon the income level of the parents has been proposed by the bpl. preventing endemic corruption infecting this new industry is a major concern for government bodies.
child care industry evolution
issues around things like the vulnerability of children to sexual abuse in the current ad hoc day care arrangements, occurring in low income areas, is driving the creche programme. the central government will fund 60% and the state governments 40% of the total cost of the programme roll out across india. indian productivity may undergo a substantial boom, once this scheme is up and running. more women will be able to work across the country, and the education and wellbeing of indian children will be improved, as the child care industry becomes more professional.

the growth of outsourcing in india

the growth of outsourcing in india
outsourcing has become one of the top trends in the business world regardless of industry. the question on everybody’s mind at this point is until when will this trend continue? india, which is one of the countries that has benefited immensely from the growth of outsourcing along with the philippines, has transformed itself as a major hub. with the constantly changing global business dynamics, what does the future hold for the growth of outsourcing in india?
the role of india
as a major outsourcing destination, india has successfully evolved with the changing needs of businesses. the national association of software & service companies (nasscom) has reported that the share of india in the global outsourcing market actually rose in 2009 to 2010, from 51% to 55% respectively.
india’s biggest competitor is the philippines particularly in front of house outsourcing.
despite competition from its neighbors and other parts of the world, the future of outsourcing in india still looks bright because of its high level of customer service and efficiency. by responding to the needs of customers for cost-effective solutions, skilled staff, quality of service, enhanced productivity, and excellence of business process, india has entrenched itself as a major outsourcing player in the global market.
the large and multi-skilled population is another factor to consider why front-end and back-end outsourcing growth is predicted to continue in the country.
cost savings advantage
no matter how you look at it, cost savings will remain as one of the major advantages presented by outsourcing. the reduction of overall expenses through the payment of lower amount to offshore outsourcing partners made it possible to lower overhead.
as early as the late 1990s there were predictions that cost savings would no longer be seen as an advantage, yet, today, it remains as one of the moving factors that fuels the outsourcing industry. when we look at the financial problems faced by companies during the 2008 to 2009 economic crisis, we see that cost savings has even moved to the limelight. until today, it remains as one of the reasons for the growth of outsourcing in india.
focus on core activities
aside from the cost savings, businesses today are turning to outsourcing even for their core business functions. this can be seen with many smes that find it difficult to maintain their own it departments. the goal is not only to save money, but also to ensure high quality solutions through the use of skilled and experienced specialists from outsourcing partners.
this is one of the reasons why it outsourcing in particular is on the rise in india. there is an abundance of highly qualified professionals that can achieve excellent results using their skills and resources through proven methodologies.
standardized solutions
the future of outsourcing in india will also be influenced by the standardization of outsourcing solutions. these types of solutions are more favorable to companies because they are more affordable compared to customized ones. those who are looking to maximize their budgets can benefit from this through the acquisition of new customers and better business concepts.
in india, this has resulted in the adoption of non-strategic processes that has kept the costs down. the introduction of mass automation tools has resulted in more opportunities while reducing the staffing requirements needed to support business critical applications.
supporting smaller projects
one important benefit that will remain for a good number of years would be the support of outsourcing for smaller projects. this will result in the emergence of smaller players ready to deliver flexible and specialized solutions that support new business concepts.
this means that outsourcing will no longer be confined to businesses, but can also be offered to individuals that are in need of support. this will help support smaller projects that are geared towards strengthening or resurrecting businesses that have been hit hard by failing economies. the surge in smaller services for first-time buyers will contribute to the growth of outsourcing in india.
exponential growth
how can exponential growth be achieved? one of the solutions that industry experts are looking at is the merger of outsourcing and cloud solutions. this is seen as a way of delivering better opportunities for the entire industry. by taking advantage of the cloud, more flexibility, cost savings, and scalability can be achieved.
the merger will also support the migration of existing services and infrastructure so that it can become cloud enabled. this can pose a major advantage for smaller players in the outsourcing industry.
indian outsourcing opportunities
to say that the growth of the outsourcing industry in india has been phenomenal would be an understatement. compared to its neighbors, india remains as one of the favored destination in the global market by companies that are seeking knowledge-intensive services.
it would not be impossible to think that outsourcing may just be the biggest revenue generating industry in the country. maximizing its pool of skilled workforce, india continues to strengthen its position in the outsourcing industry.
the country does not have problem delivering solutions for service that need advanced english capabilities like in the case of content and medicine or knowledge process outsourcing (kpo). by continuing to excel in such fields it would not be impossible for india to become the global knowledge service hub in a couple of years.
what else plays to india’s advantage? it has a huge pool of english speaking lawyers who can extend their legal expertise in the form of patent services and legal support among others. some companies in india that are affiliated with legal firms in the united states have successfully captured as significant part of the american legal market.
another thing to consider in the growth of outsourcing in india is that many of the fortune 500 companies have already established outsource partners in the country. ibm, tcs, and acs are just a few examples. pharmaceutical companies will also find able support in the field of manufacturing and clinical research. there is ample talent in the country to pursue high quality trials and data management that can provide the competitive edge for pharmaceuticals. major indian pharmaceutical companies have also started establishing ties with international pharmaceutical firms to manufacture specific compounds.
infrastructure management services, which covers a wide number of management services for application operations, security and maintenance, and it infrastructure can also be delivered by india. the country is also seen as evolving to a dominant player in the field of engineering research and development. this will mean an expected influx of roughly $1.4 trillion come 2020.
with all of these considered, there is much hope and stability expected in the growth of outsourcing in india.

franchising is undoubtedly becoming the most successful business model around the world. india as one of the world’s largest and the fastest-growing emerging markets, it is ideal to sell franchises to their country. especially when we are talking about foreign brands where the indian masses are attracted giving opportunities to local businessmen to start their own business through franchising. foreign brands such as such as mcdonald’s and pizza hut has proven india’s tastes and needs through customization, it has met the india’s local preferences. these foreign brands found franchising is the best way to enter the geographically vast and culturally diverse indian market which offers the most favorable franchising environment.
franchising in india: who are india’s top franchisers?
based on the hindu business line news, franchise india is helping employees from the it and ites industry that are facing job threats giving opportunities in taking the entrepreneurial leap. gaurav marya, chairman, franchise india encourage all employees in the top four it firms, especially those in the low-salary brackets, are already fatigued doing their jobs to try franchising their brands. franchising laundry store such as uclean became the best option as it’s only needs lower investment and manpower costs with a higher degree of automation making franchising motivating entrepreneurs keep doing it while they continue to work in their respective it firms as they are uncertain about the future of their salaried jobs.
franchising has a bright future in india, with changing lifestyles, growing income levels, demanding customers and the advent of modern retailing the franchise market is growing rapidly. the huge number of indian population around the world greatly contributes to the recognition of foreign brands back to their country. the industries cited as the top prospects for successful franchise opportunities in india include food and beverage, education, apparel, entertainment, courier services, stationery and gift shops, health and beauty, fitness and nutrition. outside india, when comparing franchise opportunities globally such as this one in australia, study first very well if it’s the right brand for you.

the future of business growth is india

many western nations have this idea of india as some place that is overcrowded and not quite in step with the rest of the developed world; however, this assessment could not be further from the mark as india is likely to overtake china before too long as the largest economic power on earth. leveraging her immense population, her high standards of education, her vast natural resources, and the greatest resource of all, her citizenry, india is swiftly becoming the go-to place for business and business investments of all kinds. the groundswell of exponential entrepreneurial growth and business opportunities in india make it ideal for all industries to begin pursuing growth opportunities there, especially for tech savvy australian companies. working with india’s thriving industry sector is a winning digital strategy for marketing agencies in australia.
industry growth
india’s leading hospitals, doctors, and dentists meet the standards of many industrialized and developed nations of the west. however, even though their capabilities are the same, the pricing is not. treatments which can cost thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars in the united states or europe cost much less in india. this has led to a surge in medical tourism where individuals from wealthy western nations travel to private doctors or hospitals in india to seek treatment, getting both the treatment they need and a vacation for less than the price of the treatment alone in europe or the united states. this medical boom and industrial charge means experts are needed in digital marketing to help bring knowledge of these opportunities outside of india. this huge industry growth is leading to immense opportunities for australian businesses with experience in digital marketing to help piggyback on this boom by providing high quality digital services to india’s tech industry.
room for growth
even the supposedly negative issues in india are actually opportunities for businesses with the foresight, the decisive nature, and the entrepreneurialism to turn a negative into a positive. one of the cons of india’s large population is also its ineffectual ability to deal with its pollution, its garbage, and its other industrial wastes. however, environmentalists in india, private corporations and non-profits, and even the government are beginning to understand the importance of proper industrial waste management, recycling, and proper rubbish disposal techniques. for the right kind of advertising business, garbage can be big business with lots of room to grow. the ability to recycle materials in india at a fraction of the cost and then reselling them back to europe or the united states is a huge potential business that not only can lower india’s pollution problem but can make the removal of pollution profitable for the industry that does it and the companies that market, advertise, and mainstream their services.
favourable business laws
currently there is no better time to be investing in india. due to their legacy of having been a british colony for so many decades, many of the business laws in india are reflective of laws in europe and the united states. with similar business laws, a large industrious population, and near unfettered access to resources, personnel, and foreign investment, the future is bright and shining for india and as its star is on the rise, prospective businesses and entrepreneurial investment groups can rise with it.

dentistry in india: boom or bust business?

according to global statistics, the dental market in the world is growing steadily for the last five years. the major bulk of the market expansion is attributed to asian countries, where india is said to be the forefront of this progress. as a matter of fact, dentistry in india is so huge that it will become the single largest nation market for dental services, products, and materials. having said that, the dentistry in india faces a serious challenge; that is, the oral health care awareness in the indian population is decreasing. this leads to the shrinking of the demand in dental services. you can click here to know more about figures and statistics about this decline. this begs us to the question, is dentistry in india a boom or bust business?
dentistry in india: boom or bust business
over the last decade, india has become an international destination for medical treatment and services, including dental procedures. as per the recent government data, dental tourism accounts for the tenth of india’s medical tourism. and this number is seen to grow in the coming years. 
dental procedures and services in india is fairly cheap in contrast to its western counterparts. for instance, a dental filling in the united states or in europe ranges from $300 to $400. but in india, you can undergo a dental filling treatment for 20 bucks. basically, you can avail the same services using state of the art equipment and technology at a very reasonable price. 
the burgeoning population of india is a good sign that the demand for dental services will always be there. in fact, an increasing number of higher learning institutions are offering programs to accommodate the current and future needs of dentistry in india. 
challenges of dentistry in india

oral care infrastructure

almost 99 percent of the dental service providers in india are private entities. there are a few multinational companies that have an active presence in the country’s dental market. after earning their degrees, dentists in india set up their own clinics, where most can be found in the city. the challenge about the infrastructure of dentistry in india is the competition. each year, at least 200,000 students graduate from dental schools. and with the declining awareness in oral health care in the country, the supply of dental practitioners in the country will surpass the demand. 

marketing

some dental practitioners see having a website as an effective marketing tool, which is good. however, most of them fail to look after the website and maintain it. creating a website requires a lot of time and effort. ideally, it will take a year, utmost, to evaluate and assess how the website contributed to the practice’s marketing efforts. but the good news is your most trusted digital marketing team can guarantee that your website contributes to your marketing efforts by regularly monitoring and maintaining it.

the gambling business in india: is it skill or all luck based?

as a billion strong nation, india is a hotspot in terms of gambling businesses and related activities. for instance, sports betting on cricket events, horse race betting, and playing in casinos are among the favourite pastimes and popular gambling businesses in the country. but despite the public’s acceptance to the gambling business in india, most forms of gambling are technically against the law. some legislations about the gambling business in india are either obsolete or unclear. nevertheless, these betting activities attract a huge crowd which, in turn, yield substantial revenues. the recent data regarding the profits of the gambling business in india are discussed in depth when you click here. 
the gambling business in india: is it skill or all luck based?
as mentioned earlier, there are forms of gambling in india that are prohibited by their laws and customs. among the few gambling business in india that are authorised to operate are lotteries. there’s even a legislation — the lotteries act of 1998 —that guides the whole enterprise. like any other betting activity in the country, the lotteries in india are based on luck with absolutely no skill required. 
online gambling is also highly popular among punters in india. ironically, there are laws passed in the country which may or may not pertain to the lawfulness of online gambling. for instance, the information technology act of 2000 has provisions that may be associated with online gambling, but there is no specific allusion that online gambling is indeed prohibited by the law. 
an example of online gambling that involves skill is sports betting. in fact, bookies know the science of sports betting to the point that they can influence the winning odds, depending on the amount of the wager involved. suffice to say, sports betting requires certain skills for you to win that pot. 
another gambling business in india that requires great skill is poker. it is a universal knowledge that playing poker involves skill. according to gambling laws in the country, anything that entails making a wager and is based on luck is illegal. sports betting and poker is skills-based, so on the premise of the law, these are deemed as legal. however, due to the convoluted gambling laws in india, a law enforcer may or may not arrest you for gambling depending on how he/she interprets such law.

the business of working with one billion people: how are things kept in order

people in the western countries are used to fedex and online delivery services that drop-ship items right at their doorstep. but in india, a century-old delivery service called the dabba wallahs, hand delivers hot meals to thousands of hungry indians across the metropolis. one would wonder how are things kept in order by the dabba wallahs, especially that this vast network of dispatching things tends to get tricky as the demands and stops increase. you can click here to know more about the history of the dabba wallahs of india.
the business of working with one billion people: how are things kept in order
the dabba wallahs are a good example of working with one billion people. it is also interesting to understand how are things kept in order, given that the dabba wallahs are part of india’s “poorly educated and decentralised workforce.” 
according to the harvard business review, the dabba wallahs have a system whose backbone is perfectly positioned and mutually reinforcing. if one would correlate it with the western corporate sector, it is rare for team members to do all they can to achieve that synergy. 
the new york times also observed how the dabba wallahs in mumbai were able to intricately organise a labour-intensive operation “that puts some automated high-tech systems to shame.” and for over a hundred years, this tradition of delivering and eating home-cooked meals for lunch thrived. 
the dabba wallahs as a trusted brand
if you are going to ask neeraj aggarwal, the senior director of flipkart, the dabba wallahs are among the most dependable and trusted brands in the country. in fact, they are highly noted for their unique delivery network that has been tested by time to be smooth and reliable, and can withstand extreme conditions. 
for those who are familiar with the movie ‘the lunchbox’, it touches the dabba wallahs and how their system is fool proof. the secret to how are things kept in order is the structure and methodicalness of their process. according to stefan homke of the harvard business school, the system of the dabba wallahs is a “very complicated dance of many, many elements, including the railway system in mumbai.” truth be told, the railway assists the dabba wallahs in a number of ways. one of which is that the railway compels the whole network of lunch delivery couriers to run based on a rhythm.

did you know that western nations and arab countries also contribute to the tons of rubbish in india? according to news reports, tons and tons of garbage from spain, malaysia, greece, and saudi arabia were sent to india last year. this is because shipping municipal waste to the country is four times more cost efficient than recycling these waste. 
over the past years, the government has been making an effort to resend the confiscated waste in ports back to where they came from. however, there are still companies that were able to import waste one way or another. 
dealing with rubbish in india
the growing population in india has its pros and cons. one of the advantages is that its economy is rising. in addition, the country made its way to one of the most powerful countries in the world. but despite these drastic improvements, the government is lagging behind in terms of dealing with rubbish in india. in fact, the country is drowning in garbage. 
but not everything reeks and is gray in india’s rubbish. environmental advocates, private organisations, and the government are all looking for ways on how they can get away from the moniker as the rubbish dump of the world. for instance, mumbai has these so-called rag pickers. these women, in spite of sweeping up the streets for low salary, are dedicated to managing the rubbish in india and segregating them for recycling. 
there are also waste management services companies commissioned by the local government to tackle the growing problem of rubbish in india. but ultimately, addressing india’s garbage problem should begin in the household.

indian business law: a brief primer

much of the indian business law is based on the english common law. as a matter of fact, various legislations introduced by the brits are still being enforced in a modified form until now. the country’s legal history can be traced as early as the bronze age and the indus valley civilisation. since then, the laws in india, including indian business law, have changed from a religious direction to the existing constitutional and legal system the country has today. you can click here to know more about the brief history of indian business law. 
indian business law: a brief primer
when the east india company was established in india, it became the major turning point of the country’s legal history. the company was given the authority to create laws and enact them in a manner they deem as necessary. in most cases, some people criticise the  complexity of the country’s legal system, especially in terms of the indian business law. having said that, there are still provisions of the law that are much simpler than those in the united states and australia.
there are four major sources of indian business law. these are the english mercantile law, the statutory law, judicial decisions, and those from customs and usages. the english mercantile law, which directly translates to the ‘merchant law’, served as the basis of the structure of the indian business law. on the other hand, the statutory laws are the legislations created by the parliament. a lot of indian business laws are statutory laws. 
judicial decisions are crucial sources of the indian business law. the previous cases decided by the higher courts are often referred in cases being tackled in the lower courts. meanwhile, indian business laws based on customs and usages play a significant role in business transactions in the country. 
indian business law and charitable institutions
in 2014, a law was enacted wherein businesses in india are compelled to ‘give’ two percent of its profits to charitable institutions. according to the guardian, india is the first nation to enact such law. companies with annual profits of at least £105m should give away two percent of it in organisations that focus on improving the country’s education system, alleviating poverty, promoting gender equality, and decreasing hunger incidence. as per india’s lawmakers, the law will greatly help the social development efforts in the country.

chiropractors in india: ergonomics introduced to indian businesses

ergonomics is a term derived from two greek words, “ergon,” meaning work, and “nomoi,” which means natural laws. it is the science that studies the relationship between work and human abilities, limitations and characteristics. ergonomist are responsible for studying human capacity and its relativity to work demands.
ergonomists, recently have attempted to explain postures which minimize excessive static work and reduce the forces acting on the body. an individual can considerably reduce risk of injury if they could adhere to some ergonomic principles. however, there is a serious challenge to conservative ergonomic thinking. a person must be a great observer of his or her own joint and muscle functions in order to put these into practice.
ergonomics introduced to indian businesses
smes or small and medium enterprises are almost always the leading pillar of an economy in india. that is why minor accidents, ergonomics snags, out-of-date machinery, and the absence of awareness have generated a necessity for carrying out safety practices. the influence of chiropractors from around the world produced fully ergonomic solutions.
gopal ramnayaran, an entrepreneur in india researched in america some ergonomic garden furniture. hence, he returned home so intrigued and saw the potential for such market in india. he finally began manufacturing the first aluminum-based furniture in the country since 1965. that’s how gopal ramnayaran found featherlite, now a leading furniture company in india.  feartherlite’s 50 year journey started from aluminum chairs to ergonomic furniture.
employees who spend a great time every day in the office. they tend to lose the distinction between home and office space. they would prefer office space designs that keep in mind the ergonomics. industries are continuously changing their operating environment in terms of organization and culture.  proper ergonomics will be of great help for an employee to avoid health hazards at work.
dr. t rajagonal, vice-president of uniliver, have teams observing for employees silently. uniliver spent a lot of time and effort into educating employees on the right posture to implement at their work stations, among other things, for their own benefit. the correct posture on the appropriate chair with a desk at the right height and perfect computer screen position. the temperature and the right kind and amount of light, these are all critical factors.
ergonomics is still a developing discipline in india.  there is the need to increase holistic ergonomic thinking in every work place. good ergonomics can help, that is why a trained occupational health specialist should do a series of ergonomic assessments at the workplace.

high humidity in india and its negative effects

the common and abrupt effect of high humidity is personal discomfort. when it is too hot and humid, our bodies are less efficient at releasing heat which means we sweat. however, this may not deem too dangerous some people might say. but going to work wearing a suit and tie while one’s shirt sticks to your body, and constantly wiping drips of sweat off the forehead!
 
dust mites also love humidity, and they’re one of the main nemeses for people who suffer from asthma and allergies. needless to say, all sorts of bacteria can originate in spaces with comparatively high humidity. people who stay in households or offices that are hit by mold growth and mildew get more often get sick, and their overall health is a lot poorer.
 
how to combat high humidity in india and its negative effects with dehumidifiers:
humidity levels in the city of mumbai peaked, hitting 98% in the of south mumbai and 80% in the suburbs. experts says, peaked moisture levels have great potential to hold pollutants. changes in temperature, precipitation, drought, storms and floods can have negative and positive effects. in chandigarh, a doctor from pgi infers, made a recent analysis. according to him, the old age prescription of covering oneself with a towel and inhaling steam to fight common cold may no longer be valid.  doctor meenu singh analysed and reviewed all worldwide trials conducted on steam inhalation. she concluded in her published work that the process has no effect and only works as a feel good factor!
with ‘global warming’ distressing the world india included, the necessity for office and factory dehumidifier is ever increasing in all areas affected by high humidity. the awareness has been a great challenge. a muggy environment is a breeding ground for all types of microscopic organisms that can be detrimental to your health. mildew and mold spores flourish in it, and they can be highly toxic once they get into your body. if mold is evidently noticeable inside your home, you have a problem that requires instant attention.
 
companies can decrease waste, increase productivity and enhance manufacturing yields by ensuring the correct humidity level with a dehumidifier. it is very important to invest in a high quality dehumidification device because standard systems for heating, air-conditioning or ventilation cannot deliver the desired conditions. by getting a dehumidifier, it is likely to solve these problems if not the very least alleviate them.

can indian businesses put their faith in mystics & yogis?

the east has always had its differences from the west. since roman times, the world has been split into two distinct spheres: the eastern empire and the western empire. the east, as alexander the great discovered, is a rich and exotic realm, with a flavour quite unlike that of its hemispheric counterpart. the spiritual overlaps the material in the east, and there is not the clear demarcation between the zones, as exists in western thought and deed. india, in many ways, is at the centre of eastern consciousness. it is, also, the gateway to this ‘other world’.
can indian businesses put their faith in mystics & yogis?
it is the twenty first century, however, a time of technology, apple, google, microsoft and the digital age. is there still a place for that overlap of the spiritual, the ghost in the machine? can indian businesses put their faith in mystics & yogis? does it offer some unseen competitive edge? or, is it the chain that drags this nation forever backwards? how does this rich tradition impact upon the modern indian business person and their activities? does it still shape indian thinking? so many questions, it beggars belief that these answers must still be given, despite the ever-changing contemporary world.
tradition is the bedrock of identity. the indian yogi, guru and mystic: the babaji, the bhagwan, the buddha, the mahatma, the saint, the holy man. these are all players on a spiritual stage, which dates back thousands of years. disciples and devotees, sannyasins and seekers, form a saffron line that snakes across a great land mass, which stretches from the himalayas to the sea. is it any wonder that people in india still believe and still seek out the guidance that these babas offer?
astrology has its roots in india, coming over from babylonia in ancient times, brought by the aryans to this subcontinental land. since then, stargazing has spread all over the globe, to every corner and crevice. horoscopes are cast in charlestown and canberra, kolkata and koln, cusco and cheboksary. transits are cast and examined for businesses, projects and ideas. mergers, marriages and deals are assessed with the assistance of the zodiac. even, maybe seeking our western psychics, to summon a little occidental magic. when it comes to measuring market trends, is there really anything truly scientific to it? we all like to pretend that sociology is a science, but deep down the tarot readers are just as scientific. can indian businesses put their faith in mystics & yogis? psychic powers? why not? donald trump and his ilk have been doing it for years.

healthcare opportunities for indians worldwide

the west is no stranger to top-quality indian healthcare workers operating in their countries. there are many fine doctors of indian extraction helping people in both public and private practice in the us, the uk, australia and elsewhere around the globe. in many ways, this is the classic story of hard working migrants getting ahead and their children going to college to graduate as medical professionals. it is also, about healthcare workers migrating directly from india to fill those places in western nations. there are opportunities at all levels of the healthcare spectrum for indians to find jobs.
healthcare opportunities for indians worldwide
of the 175 million people who were living outside of their country of birth in the year 2000, some 65 million of these people were economically active. the who report, that these figures are drawn from, warns that the loss of the medical practitioners from the developing world is significant. highly skilled, tertiary educated, professionals lost to the developing world, means the loss of their much-needed skills and a wasted investment by these nations through costly education services. migration figures have double since the 1970s for healthcare workers from india and other developing countries to the west.
indian podiatrists in india-centric communities such as parramatta in sydney, australia, are one such example of this globalisation of skilled labour markets. another, is the many indians working as chiropractors in sydney. migration from indian cities to cities in countries like australia and the uk in the healthcare sector is increasing every year. it is the case of the individual bettering himself and his family, but at the expense of his country of origin. democratic nations, however, cannot prevent this movement, which is, generally, based on economic determiners. only through the overall economic growth of india can they begin to compete in a globalised labour market.
meanwhile, in places like sydney, their communities are benefitting from this influx of talented indian doctors and nurses. the wealthy nations maintain and improve their levels of healthcare, often at the expense of nations that desperately need more healthcare of a higher standard. this is an example of market forces not taking care of things. health as an industry is not served well by a purely free market economy, there needs to be government intervention in health if a nation’s people are to be properly looked after. whether restrictions on indian doctors needing to complete a decade of national service in local hospitals should be instigated is, perhaps, a question worth discussing.

indian elderly vulnerable to selfish younger generations

the statistics are shocking: one in every three senior citizens in india is a victim of abuse. why are the elderly being left in the cold by their families in a land that reveres the old? the scale of the problem in fact goes much deeper than teenage addiction to smart phones, instagram and ‘selfie’ culture, that is not the worst of it.
hundreds and thousands of elderly people are being dumped like unwanted house pets by uncaring family members who take their limited riches before throwing them out of their homes. a recent report by a voluntary organisation working for abandoned and needy elderly people, revealed some shocking statistics. according to the report, one in three senior citizens is a victim of abuse in india.
“some of the abuses we found are as brutal as severe beating of elderly people by their own sons, daughters and daughters-in-law” states the report. it also says that in more than 50 per cent of abuse cases, the perpetrators are family members, with the son being the primary abuser in over 56 per cent of cases, followed by daughters in 23 per cent of cases. the most common reason for the abuse is property related.
mathew cherian, chief executive of help age india says, “earlier, people lived with their children when they were too old to work, but society is no longer parent oriented and the rising trend we notice is that the elderly are moving out of their homes to places that cater to their needs. but there aren’t enough old-age homes in india to house all the abandoned elderly people”, he says.
more than half of india’s 1.1 billion population is younger than 25 and two-thirds is below the age of 35. the number of seniors is growing. by 2016, around 113 million people will be older than 60, and if the recent reports are any indication, a sizeable number of them will require an old-age home.
stories about mistreatment of the elderly can be truly horrifying. a few years ago, there were reports in the indian media about how police caught a man striking a deal with doctors and an organ-transplant broker to sell his unsuspecting father’s kidney, first taking him to hospital for a ‘check-up’ and then telling him he needed an operation. doctors say such practices are commonplace.
according to an activist and charity worker, “all senior citizens we spoke to in delhi said they had been verbally abused, while 33 per cent confided they had been physically abused – often beaten and tied to chairs.”
elderly parents being abused and abandoned is not just an urban phenomenon. in rural india, the family system is eroding, with the younger generation increasingly heading off to cities with their spouses and their children to start a new life – without their parents or grandparents.
according to a 2016 survey, less than 40 per cent of indians now live with extended family. while delhi has the highest number of senior citizens who own property, over the years they become meek and dependent on their children. and that is generally when problems arise.
those who have worked in government service or for a reputed private company receive pensions, but a large majority of india’s population still work as farmers or day labourers. once they are too old to work, they are forced to rely on their children or extended family for support.
there is a government-backed pension programme for the poor called the indira gandhi national old age pension scheme, which provides rs200 a month to people over 60 who live below the poverty line, meaning they earn less than $1.25 (dh4.59) per day. but the amount they receive is barely enough to get them food for a week. the government also approved a bill to increase the pension to rs500 a month to those over the age of 80.
there are shelters for homeless elderly people run by charity organisations across india, but these shelters are usually packed to capacity.
in june 2012, the delhi high court issued an order to all court judges to give “special focus” to the cases involving senior citizens and ever since, courts in other cities are also taking similar steps.
significantly, the bill states that a person would be disinherited if he or she fails to take care of their elderly parents. local communities have welcomed the legislation but says it may have little practical effect. it is said that most parents are far too demoralised, destitute or frail to begin a battle to get a ruling. also very few people want to wash their personal problems in public.

mam ramaswamy’s racing legacy

mam ramaswamy was a man of many talents – a brilliantly successful businessman, a lover of fine horses, and, more than that, a horse racing legend. with a career spanning several decades, it was his unofficial record of 600 classic wins in the races that set him apart. so what were mam ramaswamy’s secrets to business, life, horses and betting? a man who has become a legend in his country is a man who got horse racing down to a science. apart from breeding incredibly fine horses, mam also had his own personal inside tricks and tips for being able to win repeatedly, tips like wearing his lucky suit and his lucky tie. however, unless the suit and tie were blessed by mercury and pegasus themselves, we suspect there is probably a little bit more science than luck in over 600 wins. so unless you can convince the executors of mam’s estate to sell you his lucky tie and suit, we best speculate as to some of the scientific factors that can improve your betting and give you an edge?
a legend in the world of horse-racing and called the ‘turf moghul’ for his expensive passion, ramasamy was the biggest owner of thoroughbreds, having owned at least 1,000 horses in active training in race courses across the country. “not long ago, i would invariably spend a major part of my day with the horses, but now that’s not possible. my trainers take good care of them and i don’t necessarily need to worry,” ramasamy told the times of india in an exclusive interview just a couple of months before his soul left this earth.
racing surface
as the indian business mogul certainly knows, condition of the track is an incredibly important factor second only to the qualities of the horse itself. the condition and type of track plays an enormous factor into whether you’ve picked a winner or a dud. horse racing tips can differ in different areas; for horse races in india this can be particularly important especially given varying climate conditions. horses on a wet or muddy track will race entirely differently than horses on the dry dirt. this matters because a horse which has typically been last might find itself at the advantage due to a slightly slower but more sure footed gallop. determining the type of racing surface and how well previous horses have done on that given track under those conditions is a great metric by which you can determine the statistical likelihood of a win.
has the horse beat the odds in the past?
this is a tip that can help you make significant amounts of money and that is by looking to see if a given horse has won against high odds in the past. a horse that has won against high odds in the past is statistically speaking much more likely to win again against high odds in the future. this is an important factor to consider because if this particular horse is showing good odds of winning then actually it is less likely to win. by being able to identify these statistical patterns in the horses you can see a significant return.
when the odds are at their highest against this particular horse, it’s actually most likely to win. this is not true of every horse, mind you, and each horse is unique and must have specific research done to determine the types and factors that lead to its winning at the races.
along with this tip is another important one and that is not looking merely at wins in a row to determine a winning horse but how those wins are spread out. if a horse has won two or three races in a row previously but has not won for two or three races in a row, its odds of winning the current race may show it going down but by looking at a horse’s history you can determine that this horse is actually due for a win. this is often the case with race horses where they will win after a gap of several races they lost, then go on for several more winning races.
this is because racing takes a significant toll on the body of a horse. those optimal peak times of output cannot be maintained for every single race but you know that the horse has that potential inside it and if it shows a pattern of a few losses and a few wins you can see if this horse is overdue for a win and place your bets accordingly. this is why it’s important to look at not just how often it wins but what were the odds back when it won and how long has it been since its last win. if it has won five times in a row, the odds will seem to be in its favor but the horse is actually more likely to lose.
keeping this in mind can help you bet against the odds and win your money back multiple times over. with these racing tips you will be ready to compete against the 600 race record of indian business legend mam ramaswamy.
