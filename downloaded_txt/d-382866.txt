what our clients say about us? 
alright folks, that’s it. by following these simple guidelines, you can enjoy all the thrills and perks of online casinos as https://casinowis.com/blue-leo-casino-review while minimizing potential harm. stay safe, be responsible and may the odds always be in your favor! 


i have been using the kit quite extensively. firstly let me say the tools and facilitator guide and support materials are fantastic. they are self explanatory and easy to follow.
the activities have facilitated the groups discussion without prompts. through the simple fact that frustration and behaviours we all exhibit will prompt those one or two dominant team players to ask questions or coordinate activities if they feel things are not progressing as they had planned it would turn out in their mind.
the other highlight is watching the staff during the process usually after the first attempt to discover what they thought they didn’t know and allowing new processes’ enter their consciousness.
the questions provided in each activity are great however a lot of the time i have usually only been able to ask one or two of those questions as the group dynamic has provided a space for the emergence of underlying issues occurring within the team when translated back in to the workplace.
to sum up i have found the following quote to be quite profound:  “learning arises from working at the edges between knowing and not-knowing” (french & simpson, p. 182, 2003) the assumption is that the mind grows through exposure to truth. this has been so successful as the activities have been the vehicle to assist in unearthing those subconscious activities which play out in the day to day interactions of the team.
as i continue to use the tool i will no doubt have further experiences emerge with new learning’s to share.

what great training sessions we have had over the past two days; definitely the best connection i’ve had with our front desk staff for any training at our company! thanks to your ideas!
we had two sessions each following the attached program. what i’m sending you is pretty comprehensive though it really is only the notes that i used for presentation purposes. i like to lay out the details so that i can then present them more off the cuff…the spontaneity always seems to keep the energy alive. i hope that this program will be a helpful way for you to take many of your ideas and exercises and perhaps offer them in a fresh context.
i really do appreciate working with you. come visit us in jersey!
thanks again, james.

about us be legendary is an idea created by repario. repario is latin meaning ‘renew, restore, rediscover’.
we found through our philanthropic experiences that we were helping people rediscover what is most important, what is great about themselves and the difference we are making in the world. however, instead of seeing what we are currently doing and doing more, we see only the negative, the gap between who we are and what we do compared to who we want to be and what we want to do.
