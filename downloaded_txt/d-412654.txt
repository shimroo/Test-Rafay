do you like low pitched instruments? is the
upper end of the bass clef just a bit too high for your taste?
are you fascinated by musical instruments that register on seismographs?


read on.


i've always enjoyed instruments that reach
below the bass clef, preferably way below. bassoon is fun, but
contrabassoon is much more fun. why settle for alto flute, when
there are bass
flutes, and contrabass flutes, and subcontrabass
flutes? if
you have similar interests, i hope you'll enjoy browsing through
the  
compendium,
stocked with images (and occasionally sounds) of the larger varieties
of musical instruments. btw, if you have better (or more) images or
sounds,
feel free to send them to me for incorporation. please also feel free
to
join the contrabass
email list, currently available in regular or digest formats.
consider it the
contrabass mania online support group.


if you're looking for a musician to cover
some unusual woodwind parts, try me  .

manufactured.

 more support groups:

 if you have as bad a case of instrument
mania as i do, you might also be interested in the american musical
instrument society. the amis has a
quarterly journal,
an annual meeting, and probably 500 other people like me/us. to inquire
about
joining, contact 
albert rice , the membership registrar. 
 you may also be interested in the  galpin society ,
and
in windworld .
 for independent study, here are  a few books ...

 do you need a support group?

  warning signs
that
you might be a contrabass maniac too...
