do you need a personal injury attorney?

when someone is injured, whether you or a loved one, justice is deserved. if the accident was from recklessness, purposeful intent or even negligence, the injured party deserves justice. no one deserves an injury. our personal injury lawyers excel at dealing with various personal injury claims. we are a personal injury law firm that you can count on. while injuries happen due to a plethora of events, automobile, truck and motorcycle accidents are some of the most common causes. often negligence plays a role, and the party at fault needs to be held accountable. all too often people avoid taking responsibility for their actions and others get injured. other common causes of injury are dog bites, slips and falls, and these are often because of negligence. although the incurred injury was not intentional, the other party is still at fault, and protecting your own rights is important.

do you need a personal injury attorney?

regardless if the accident was due to negligence,
recklessness or purposeful intent, when you or a
loved one has been injured, you deserve justice.
our firm excels at handling a range of different
personal injury claims. automobile and truck
accidents are a common cause of injuries, and
often there are parties at fault who need to be
held accountable for their actions. other less
common claims include dog bites and accident
in which a person slips and falls. while often times
the party at fault did not intentionally cause harm,
it is still important to protect your rights.




wrongful death attorneys
to ease your burden

during our years in practice, some of our cases
have unfortunately involved wrongful death.
we understand the extreme emotional pain our
client feels when they lose a loved one, but we
also know how important it is to seek justice on
their behalf. if you know a victim of wrongful
death, you should contact for a free consultation
as soon as possible to protect your rights.




defending the rights of accident victims

at our law office, we fight for the rights of the injured and families who have lost a loved one in an accident. accidents happen every day in minnesota and wisconsin, and sadly, many of these accidents could have been prevented if only someone would have been more careful.

oftentimes, individuals, businesses, manufacturers, and others can be held responsible for causing an individual to suffer personal injuries or for wrongful death. if the accident was not your fault, you have a right to demand financial compensation for your losses.
