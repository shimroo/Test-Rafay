client testimonials





















"thank you so much for all of your help and support in us purchasing our first home! we truly appreciate you all!"

shelby and courtney





"we are so thankful and blessed to have found this amazing realtor, sue little, with red barn realty in jewett, tx. i scheduled to see homes on lake limestone, met with sue at the office and she was the friendliest and most professional person to meet. she had all the information and a map on the homes we would see and even pulled up another one that had just hit the  market. she took me all the way around the lake and did not pressure me with any obligations. our offer was accepted and from that day on i have felt like sue was my new best friend. i don't understand how realtors do what they do! sue has the biggest heart and was very informative through every step. we both want to thank sue little for not only being our realtor but for being a true friend."

janet & gary walker





"cricket was very knowledgeable and helpful in helping us find our weekend ranch home. he knows the area and people. red barn realty has many benefits with an in-house broker brenda thomas, and office manager faye morford who helps with any questions. cricket treated us like an old friend from our very first meeting and now we are his new neighbor!"

sherry lynn





“good morn’n. if leon county were to have a poll as to the no. 1 listing agent in the county for real estate, your business would surely be voted overwhelmingly as the reigning no. 1, top dog, head honcho, that is to say thank you all for accomplishing so much towards our property in so little time. thanks again.”
