when it gets hard...“we all have times when life feels hard; when we’re frustrated and tired and just want to hide away. if that is you right now, don’t worry – every caterpillar has to rest to become a butterfly and you’ll soon find your wings again. in the meantime, let your angels wrap you in theirs. you are so loved.” – anna taylor
