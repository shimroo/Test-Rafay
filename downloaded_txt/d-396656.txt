max rosen*great dreams campaign volunteer
max rosen, tubman board member and great dreams campaign volunteer has worked in finance, managing endowment and foundation assets for years, but his work at tubman has helped him see the other side of the equation — the mission and impact an organization like tubman can provide.
when he got involved in tubman, he saw the impressive work providing shelter, security, and resources that clients needed. max and his wife jessica dream of helping tubman increase their reach in the community while increasing support to allow tubman to expand and deepen important programming. as a pet lover, the addition of a pet shelter is also near and dear to his heart.
