went bowling with coworkers tonight.  i bowled a 44.  it was a pretty sorry sight.tonight's swim was at the sava pool, 19th and wawona. i go swimming most every night.  i'm trying to learn the wave breaststroke.  as i'm nearing the end of my swim the light go out.  quite an expereince being in a pool with 30 people in the dark.  we all got out and tried to undo our locks.. kinda hard to do a combo lock in the dark.  seems like power went out over the whole block.so i'm going to siggraph. i just booked everything today. i'm leaving tomorrow.link leave a commentwed, jul. 27th, 2005, 12:26 pm 1st swim

i took my 1st swim in the bay today.  i arrived at crissy field a little before 6 and wondered where everyone else was.  a little driving around and i found them on the east side of the beach (it's over a mile long).  strapped on the wetsuit and walked down to the water.  standing on the beach i was very cold, the water was actually warmer than the beach.  i struggled along for a few meters then stepped out of the water and walked along the beach to catch up with everyone else..then got back in.  the water was shallow, i would touch the bottom often.  the current was sweeping me along in different directions.  that freaked me out a little.it easy to breathe on my right side, but hard on my left.  the left was the side i needed to use in order to keep sight of the beach.  i was scared of getting too far out.i got out and walked most of the way back.  the beach was cold.  after i got home my feet were numb.  all and all it was not nearly as bad an experience as i expected.link leave a commenttue, jul. 26th, 2005, 04:58 pm in a state of unbelief

i went to the funeral this morning.  the first i've been to since childhood.  to some degree i've avoided funeral until now.it was a good experience.  i hope my presence supported her family.  i'm glad i got the chance to meet her family and i can totally see where such a wonderful person came from.  her father told the story of how she as a yr 1 old she didn't wait for her parents when she came to a doorway, she looked back to tell them to follow her and went off running.  a good memory of her.the experience made me feel a little better.link leave a commentmon, jul. 25th, 2005, 10:25 pm sad news

a friend of mine passed away last week.  funeral will be on tuesday.  she was such an awesome, fun, energetic person.  she was full of integrity, and was a good friend.  i miss her and the world is so unfair to take her away.  i can't believe that i will not be able to talk to her anymore or that i will not get to see the big smile she often carried on face.  i had lunch with her just recently and she was doing well.  she had been sick for a while, but i'm still just in shock about this. in a state of unbelief.it makes me think of how short life is, and that none of us can count on any more days here.  how much have i left undone, unsaid?link leave a commentsun, jul. 24th, 2005, 05:06 pm cycling

took a good week off, well not off completely.  put myself back into geaer on friday with a trail run, i finally did the sand stairs.  sat. i putted around going up twin peaks.  sun i went cycling with a club that leaves from sf every weekend. let's just say i got my ass handed to me... these guys were relaxing and i was huffing and puffing.  we did 40 miles, avg speed 14.5 mph, 2000 feet ascent.  http://www.citycycle.com/eventsfrmst.htmllink leave a commentsat, jul. 16th, 2005, 07:11 pm i did it

i've been focusing on learning to swim for the past month.   trying to work up to a 400m front crawl.  i'm currently at 66 meter repeats and ready to go to 133m repeats.  but after a month i'm still not confident i can do 400m.so tonight i went swimming.  i got to the pool and found out i didn't have my goggles.  not enough time to go back and get them.  a couple strokes of fron crawl and it wasn't working.  very tough to do front crawl without goggle in a pool with a lot of chlorine.  tried to just do drills.  possible but very very hard.. many of the drills have the same problems as front crawl.  finally i settled on breaststroke. it was easy! i did my 400m and if  a) it wasn't a new stroke to me and b) i have a race this weekend i would have probably done 800m.  shocking... i spent a friggen month stressing out about not being able to swim to save my life but i had never tried this stroke for more than 25 meters.link leave a commentmon, jul. 11th, 2005, 11:06 pm trival things

a friend of mine is having a hard time fighting cancer.  i don't even know what to think.. when i think of her i still imagine her as a strong woman playing soccer, or rollerblading or running faster and longer than me.   my problems are so fucking trivial.link leave a comment
