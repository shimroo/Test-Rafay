triduum invitation
























 








pluscarden abbey we are a community of catholic benedictine monks living in the only medieval british monastery still being used for its original purpose.situated in north-east scotland, six miles south-west of elgin in moray, the monastery enjoys the peace and stillness of a secluded glen, but is easily reached by road from the town. the atmosphere of quiet reflection and of work dedicated to the glory of god is the same now as it was in the thirteenth century, when a community of monks first came to this part of moray.if you visit the abbey today, you can enjoy not only the beauty of its architecture and its setting but also something of the restful atmosphere of devotion that has so deeply permeated this little corner of scotland. the mass and full divine office are sung by the monks each day in the abbey church, using gregorian chant.guests are received in the two guest houses: men and women of all faiths are welcome to make a retreat here and to share in the prayer and work of the community, or simply rest and renew their focus on what is most important.













o vere beata nox! holy week invitation 2025













the prior and monks of pluscarden invite young people (aged 18-35) to celebrate the liturgy with them from wednesday of holy week until easter (16 – 21 april).st. scholastica’s retreat will be set aside for our younger guests: both male and female. this is a self-catering house. essentials are supplied by the monastery, but otherwise people need to bring their own food supplies. contributions by donation are gratefully received: though it is assumed that students would stay without any charge.those taking part will be able to celebrate these, the most holy days of the year, with full immersion in the monastic liturgy. there will be plenty of time also for silent prayer and reading, or for local walks in this beautiful area, or for speaking, as desired, with a monk.if you are interested in joining the pluscarden community for this celebration of easter, please contact br benedict joseph miller osb by email at guestmaster@pluscardenabbey.org or through our online form: www.pluscardenabbey.org

day for the religious of our diocese



10 feb 2025




pope st. john paul ii designated candlemas, feast of the presentation of the lord, 2 february as a special world day for the consecrated life. this year 2 february fell on a sunday, making a special gathering on that day less convenient. so our bishop hugh decided to gather the religious of his diocese together, here at pluscarden, on the monday following.

malachi 3:1-4; hebrews 2:14-18; luke 2:22-4040 days after christmas, the lord comes to his temple. in this way he fulfils the prophecy of malachi, which we had in our first reading today. all lovers of handle’s messiah will instantly recognise these words: the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple... who shall stand on the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire… and he shall purify the sons of levi...

jerusalem: probably around 80 years after the decree of cyrus, allowing the jewish exiles to return home from babylon. a second temple, much inferior to the first, is more or less up and running. but the jewish people remain dominated by enemies all about. if some of them inhabit the holy city, they do not possess it.

the word “phenomenon” came into english from the greek, and technically means a thing or fact perceived, the immediate object of actual perception. today we are celebrating the epiphany of the lord. the word “epiphany” is related to the word “phenomenon” and denotes a manifestation of a supernatural being.
