veterinary epidemiology and public health

epicentre is the lead agency for this collaborating centre. partnering with mepilab and china animal health and epidemiology, we provide world-leading expertise in our speciﬁed ﬁelds for the asia-pacific region. areas of expertise include veterinary epidemiology, veterinary public health, biosecurity and molecular epidemiology. we're pioneers in one health research and training.

woah collaborating centres — animal health management







diagnostic test validation science in the asia-pacific region

the australian centre for disease preparedness is the lead agency for this collaborating centre. we became a member in 2017, along with the faculty of veterinary and agricultural sciences at melbourne university. we each bring a unique skill set in veterinary epidemiology, development and validation of diagnostic tests for emerging and transboundary animal diseases, and endemic animal diseases.

woah collaborating centres — laboratory expertise










            our research
        


fields of research at the epicentre range from diseases of new zealand livestock to the development of more effective animal health care delivery systems for new zealand livestock producers, as well as for subsistence farmers in asia and africa.examples include johne’s disease in ruminant species, mastitis and lameness in dairy cattle, respiratory disease in pigs and sheep, and tuberculosis in farmed animals and wildlife, to diseases of global importance (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza).the epicentre, in liaison with partner institutes, is engaged in extensive research and training in public health and food safety, for example:leptospirosis and cryptosporidiosiscampylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and e.coli 0157.
