  tub to shower renovation

80% of falls at home happen in the bathroom. it is our mission to make the restroom experience safer and more dignified for our elderly and disabled neighbors. we do this by providing accessibility remodels including removing bath tubs and installing walk- or roll-in showers, reinforced grab bars, shower seats and anti-slip tile. our application process ensures these services are provided to those who need them most and could not otherwise afford them. not only do these tub to shower remodels provide a safer experience for the homeowner, our services also provide respite and peace of mind for their caregivers and loved ones.
