major news



addendum:
don't worry. i/we'll continue to blog.  it'll just live on max-dan-wiz.com. (all this will stay up, it just won't be updated.)

yo,

so, maybe you've noticed that we took our sweet time with the whole updating thing.  sorry.  we'll make it up to you.  how?  like this:

this blog is turning into so much more.  and by that i mean this blog now ceases to exist.  well, it's not going anywhere, but i'm not going to update here anymore.  because i'm moving my blog and everything else to the bigger, badder max-dan-wiz.com.  it's a whole website you can join and chat on and do stuff.

fly on,
fang

trl killed mtv killed the radio star



yo,

i mean, mtv, kinda whatever.  but i'm not going to try to contain my exuberance.  think of all the videos that you never saw.  that you were too young for.  that you couldn't watch because your parents wouldn't let you/because you were in a cage. they're all there and it's only in beta.

i want my, i want my mtv music.  i want it.

let's go slamdance!

the dead milkmen |mtv music

i'm so ugly.  but that's okay, so are you.

nirvana |mtv music

can't fight the seether!

veruca salt |mtv music

jerry was a race car driver the age of 65

primus |mtv music

a-ha! pop up video!

a-ha |mtv music

i could do this for days.

fly on,
fang


i want to keep going.  i'm going to keep going.  i'm like kramer with the car salesman & the gas tank.

now don't (you) go all floaty on me



yo,

i think sometimes it wouldn't be so terrible to be your average suburban kid sitting at home on a saturday night eating cheetos and wishing you weren't, say 14, and your parents didn't give you the lamest 10:30 curfew on earth.  because then at least someday you would grow up and go to see bands play on a saturday night and be pretty cool.  and not worry about saving the world. or having a secret expiration date.

in a mood



yo,

you know, i do wish i could answer everyone's questions.  cause even though i'm posting questions, finally.  i know.  i know.  i sorta feel like a jerk because there are so many i didn't answer.  i just have to have time.  and not be under threat of being eaten.  or blown up.  or netted and thrown in the back of a truck.  or, or, or....

so, a happy monday to all of you sitting this morning in algebra twirling your pencils and smelling of shampoo. here goes.
