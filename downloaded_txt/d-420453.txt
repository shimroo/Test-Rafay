      ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
extremely satisfied with holiday pools!! construction began in february. i asked for a realistic time for completion and was told 10-12 weeks. our pool was completed in 11 weeks and 6 days. the communication from miranda during construction was impeccable. we had a couple of minor issues during construction but they were dealt with in a very timely manner. kara is now cleaning our pool once a week and doing a fabulous job! we are enjoying our new pool and would (and have) recommend holiday pools to anyone.

our pool/spa started malfunctioning one day, and our pool maintenance company is holiday pools. so when we saw a holiday van drive by i flagged it down. turned out the gentleman in the van was pedro. but to be clear, pedro does work in our neighborhood but he was not assigned to our house. yet he took the time to stop by and assess the situation. it turned out the breakdown caused by a rodent or rabbit chewing one of our wires -- something i never would have spotted. then pedro who was super nice, said he had a little time, and re-spliced the wire in a few minutes, which got our spa up and running perfectly again. he is such a smart, nice young man, i cannot say enough good things about pedro. he even took the time to explain a few steps i could take to prevent this from happening again. also, holiday pools has been done an excellent job of keeping our pool pristine with their weekly visits.

holiday pools built our pool between june and thanksgiving of 2022. early communications were challenging as they are hard to get a call returned but my neighbor and i would go down to their offices when we had questions or issues and the staff on hand usually gave us an answer that satisfied us. the pool school was very well taught and the guy offered us pool service through holiday if we were interested. i figured especially since it was under contract we should give their service a shot. the very first day our pool guy showed up, sean h., we knew we hit the jackpot. a friendly guy that cares about his customers and representing the company he works for is what all companies strive for. holiday has that in sean. he will make a call to the company for any issues he finds or issues we bring up, and follows back up with us. holiday built a great pool and gave us a great pool guy.one happy customer

joshua does an amazing job servicing our pool which was built by holiday pools. he is extremely knowledgeable and exceptionally thorough with his service. joshua is always very friendly and takes his time when he is here. one of the main reasons we signed another yearly contract with holiday pools is because of him and his excellent care with our weekly maintenance. would highly recommend his service to anyone.d konicek
