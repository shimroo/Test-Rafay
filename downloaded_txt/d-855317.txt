about bblisa




bblisa was founded in july 1992 to provide
a forum for
meetings and
presentations of interest to system and network
administrators in boston, ma, and the surrounding areas.


while "lisa" stands for large installation system administration,
bblisa is for administrators of both large and small networks.


membership in the group is free and becoming a member is as easy as
subscribing to one of our
mailing lists.


the name back bay lisa was adopted after the sister organization "bay lisa", in the san francisco bay
area. back bay is an area of boston, and boston being back east and
also on a bay made the name seem appropriate.


we have a
list of sites that are of
interest to system administrators.
