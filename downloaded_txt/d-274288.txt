located in oceanside, and solana beach.  surf ride boardshops are californias premier surf retail stores.  surf ride was founded in 1974 by twin brothers bill and richard bernard with the original and flagship location being in oceanside on coast hwy.  bill and richard started out in a little 800 sqf adobe building on what was then called "hill street" in oceanside ca.  originally a hobie cat dealership with a focus on the core sports of the ocean.  as sailing became less popular and every time it rained in oceanside the adobe building would leak water through the walls and the streets would flood the front door, the brothers decided it was time to build a new building.  they knew that they needed one that could fulfill the dreams they had of becoming californias premier destination shop for all things surf!in 1984 they began construction on what is now surf ride.  the building was originally split into 3 different business with a restaurant on the side.  as business improved and the need for more space was fulfilled by tearing down walls and expanding the surf department.  business was booming for surf and after 13 years they decided it was time to open an second location.  in 1997 the solan beach location was opened up.  the 7,500 sqf store was custom built from the ground up to house the largest surfboard selection in california.  by 2005 the brothers had both had enough of the daily grind and decided to retire and let the next generation take over the business.  dustin and josh bernard stepped in to let their dad and uncle chase the dream of sailing the south pacific and surfing perfect waves in warm water.  today, dustin is actively shaping surfboards for surf ride under the sr/mfg label and josh is the active ceo of surf ride.  surf ride boardshops are truly one of the last surviving core family owned surf shops in america.  surf ride specializes in having the best boards, wetsuits, and clothing that the surf industry has to offer.  they also have an amazing fleet of rental boards both foam boards and custom hand shaped epoxy boards.  during the summer surf ride surf camp is the best place for kids to learn how to surf!  next time you're in san diego make sure to stop by, say hello and give us a high five!!
