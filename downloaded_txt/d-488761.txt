in 1996 business started to rapidly expand which resulted in the need for a larger facility. in the spring of that year, cri-sil moved from a leased 3,100 square foot facility to its current 34,0000 square foot owned facility. the new site allowed the company to add additional hcr mixing, milling, and extrusion equipment and also allowed the expansion into rtv and lsr materials development and manufacturing.
