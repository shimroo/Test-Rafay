welcome to
the iron range
in any season, we invite you to discover the iron range! explore this collection of small towns and you’ll get to know a region that embraces the best of minnesota. we’re the first ones on the golf course on a summer morning and part of the crowd listening to local music in the park in the evening. we go snowshoeing under the full moon in the winter, and ride atv trails all-day long in the fall. we’re hardy, we’re genuine and we have big hearts — which means when you’re here on minnesota’s iron range, you’re always in for a good time.
let’s discover the range together.
