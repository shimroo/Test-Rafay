about the tilt-up concrete association
founded in 1986, the tilt-up concrete association (tca) strives to improve the quality and acceptance of site-cast tilt-up construction - one of the fastest growing industries in the united states, combining the advantages of reasonable cost with low maintenance, durability, speed of construction and minimal capital investment. over 10,000 buildings, enclosing more than 650 million square feet, are constructed each year using this construction method.
