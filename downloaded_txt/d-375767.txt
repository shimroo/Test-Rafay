	about krc
established over a century ago, kawasaki has left indelible tracks across the landscape of global railway history. originating from the birthplace of the first privately-made japanese steam locomotive and the pioneering aluminum alloy train, our innovation journey continues globally. weâve accelerated from our first ventures to the record-breaking speed of the shinkansen âbulletâ train, marking milestones in safety, reliability, and comfort.
at kawasaki, innovation is our language â our advanced technologies echo this commitment. we constantly push the boundaries of whatâs possible, delivering safety, reliability, and comfort levels that consistently surpass our customerâs expectations. we donât just create vehicles â we generate long-term value, driving savings in maintenance and operations for our clients.
our product range embodies versatility and practicality â from high-speed and commuter trains to light rail and rapid transit cars. each solution is meticulously designed, highlighting our commitment to addressing our customersâ unique challenges. as one of the earliest u.s. rail car manufacturers to achieve iso-9002 certification, our commitment to quality is clear and uncompromising.
a commitment to sustainability and environmental friendliness is woven into the fabric of kawasaki. we are dedicated to developing rolling stock that is vital for transit agencies and contributes positively to the lives of everyday commuters and our planet. 


our presence in the united states is a testament to our global vision and local dedication. kawasaki rail car, inc., or krc, in yonkers, new york, is a beacon of our american operations. krc doesnât only administer contracts and manage projects â it stands as a 150,000-square-foot hub of creativity and craftsmanship where new cars are assembled, old ones are overhauled, and state-of-the-art testing is conducted.
to meet the growing demand for kawasaki rolling stock, we have expanded our u.s. footprint with the rail car division at kawasaki motors manufacturing corp, u.s.a., or kmm, in lincoln, nebraska. this sprawling 332-acre campus is home to a 738,000 square-foot facility dedicated to the manufacture and function testing of rail cars, showcasing our continuous commitment to quality and innovation.
from these two american manufacturing powerhouses, we have proudly delivered over 5,000 rail cars to transit agencies nationwide, perpetuating our tradition of high-quality, high-performance rolling stock.
at kawasaki, we are proud to be your partner in progress, spearheading the future of american railways with the precision and expertise of our japanese heritage. together, letâs drive towards a safer, greener, and more connected tomorrow.
