what our customers say


âwe were looking for carpeting for our upstairs. the sales person at carpetsmart was very helpful and informative.  there was a big selection to choose from and so many colors, which made my wife very happy.  the installation guy came to measure and then the same guy came back to put the carpet in.  it was all done efficiently and neatly. our upstairs looks beautiful and it feels so good under our feet. thank you for such a good experience.â

âi needed carpet for my stairs. the sales person was very helpful. i was asked a bunch of questions and then i was directed to the type that would work best for me. it was affordable and the installer was great about setting up times that worked for me.  installation was quick and my stairs look great. i will definitely use carpetsmart again.â 
kathy i, hamburg, ny


âi am very happy with the work done at my house. i have laminate in my downstairs and a carpet remnant in my basement.  both look great.  the salesperson was very knowledgeable and helped me to make a decision that was not only reasonably priced, but the best quality.







i am looking at redoing my upstairs in the next year and i will be calling carpetsmart for the best service, choices and quality.â 
chuck s, kenmore, ny


âi love the way my luxury vinyl flooring looks. it looks so clean and fresh and changes the whole look of my room.  it was overwhelming to think about what i wanted in my house, but the sales person made the process easy. i was asked questions about the area, traffic flow and how the space is being used. i was shown so many options. the show room is large and there are so many displays to look at and feel all of the different products.  i didnât originally plan on luxury vinyl, but i am so happy with how it looks in my house.â 
karen m, west seneca, ny

âcarpet smart exceeded my expectations with their outstanding customer service and high-quality products. the owner and staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, guiding me to the perfect carpet for my classroom. the carpetâs durability and softness are exactly what i wanted. i canât wait for my students to enjoy our new rug. i highly recommend carpet smart for anyone looking for top-tier service and exceptional flooring.
