our mission statement
the central coast greenhouse growers association (ccgga) was founded to provide a cohesive organization that acts as a good neighbor within the local and regional community, providing information and education to neighbors; other community groups or businesses; and county, state, or federal agencies.

our history
the ccgga was originally organized in the late 1980â€™s. it currently represents approximately 20 local nursery businesses in the general nipomo, arroyo grande & santa maria area. many of these businesses are family owned and operated, and have been located on the central coast for twenty to over forty years. many of the grower/owners live on their nursery sites and in all cases, the management staff of these businesses are residents of our local area making ccgga truly a home-grown organization with its roots in the local community.











about us the ccgga currently represents approximately 17 local nursery businesses in the general nipomo, arroyo grande & santa maria area.
