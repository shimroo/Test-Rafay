              african-american contributors to entertainment - old and new
              


                the impact of african americans in entertainment transcends time and barriers. from the earliest live performances to the worldwide dominance of african-american musicians, filmmakers and television stars, black culture has enriched and changed the entertainment industry in unprecedented ways. this part looks at how african americans have contributed to live events, music, film and television, starting with their early influences to the present day.
                




the power of live performances: a stage for cultural expression

live performances have always been important for african-american artists to express their talent, creativity and resilience. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when opportunities were scarce and racial segregation pervasive, african-american performers still found ways to entertain audiences - often in segregated theaters, small clubs and underground venues. these performances became spaces for resistance, celebration, and cultural expression for black artists in relation to their communities and the wider society.
vaudeville and early performances
the late 19th and early 20th-century vaudeville era saw african-american performers making a comeback in an industry almost entirely without them. vaudeville variety shows included comedy and dance, and black entertainers such as bert williams and george walker became national stars. in particular, williams was one of the few african-american performers on largely white vaudeville circuits. his witty observations and inventive performances mainstreamed african-american culture amid the racist dynamics of the time.
harlem renaissance and the explosion of black entertainment
by the 1920s, the harlem renaissance had become the cultural hotbed of black artists in new york city. harlem nightclubs like the cotton club and apollo theater became centres of black entertainment featuring the era's most famous musicians, dancers and comedians.
such places raised legends as duke ellington, cab calloway and josephine baker, whose live performances were culturally and commercially successful. while audiences were often segregated - often featuring african-americans playing for white patrons - these venues became launch pads for black performers who wove audiences with their skill and charisma.
casino performances: the evolution of live entertainment
black performers became popular in large, mainstream venues. by the mid-20th century, black entertainers were staples of casino showrooms - especially in las vegas - where live entertainment was high stakes. but even this new fame brought segregation to black performers. old-time entertainers like sammy davis jr., louis armstrong and ella fitzgerald entertained predominantly white audiences in casinos but were denied entry to the hotels where they performed because of racist policies.
sammy davis jr., one of the rat pack members, broke down racial barriers in las vegas. davis's live shows - comedy, singing, dancing - attracted large audiences and broke down segregation in the entertainment industry. more black entertainers entered the casino scene and their shows became must-sees - giving black performers hope of finding some acceptance and success in venues that had previously denied them.





african-american influence on music: a soundtrack for change

the most significant contributions by african americans to entertainment have been through music. from enslaved african spirituals to today's hip-hop and rnb, african-american artists have reshaped popular music into a vehicle for cultural expression, social change and artistic innovation.
origins: spirituals, work songs, and blues
late 19th-century blues appeared in the deep south as a blend of african rhythms and european harmony. artists like w.c. handy popularized this music about hardship, love and resilience. the blues became a form of self-expression for african americans, expressing their lived experience and emotions in a segregated society.
jazz: the revolution begins
then, in the early 20th century, jazz took the world by storm out of african-american traditions in new orleans. jazz was a break from classical european music - improvisational style, syncopated rhythms, and new harmonies. black musicians like louis armstrong, duke ellington and billie holiday pioneered this new sound, which spread to the united states and europe.
jazz was more than music - it was a cultural movement that reflected the newfound freedom and creative expression of african americans post-slavery era. around this time black musicians also started receiving more mainstream performance opportunities - some at carnegie hall. yet jazz was also a way for african americans to challenge those social and racial hierarchies by using music as resistance and empowerment.
rhythm & blues (r&b): the sound of soul
in the 1940s and 1950s there appeared rhythm and blues (rnb), a hybrid of jazz, blues and gospel. artists like ray charles, sam cooke, and ruth brown took r&b into mainstream audiences with tender ballads and upbeat tracks about love, heartbreak, and joy. songs like sam cooke's a change is gonna come became anthems for racial equality on r1and1b's civil rights movement soundtrack.
the genre evolved through the decades, with stevie wonder, marvin gaye, and whitney houston merging it with other styles, including funk and pop. today, r&b remains a major force in music, with current artists like usher, alicia keys, and beyonce following in their predecessor's footsteps.
hip-hop: the voice of a generation
by the 1970s, black music was hip-hop again. hip hop emerged in the bronx, new york, from the experiences of black youth in economically deprived areas. hip-hop developed from spoken word, djing & graffiti art.
artists including grandmaster flash, run-d.m.c., and public enemy used hip-hop for political commentary on poverty, police brutality, and systemic racism. it was for the voiceless - african americans complaining and hoping. in the 90s, tupac shakur and the notorious b.i.g. infused storytelling with lyrical ability to create timeless tracks that define today's hip-hop.
modern hip-hop has seen a new generation of african-american artists like kendrick lamar, j. music by cole, and cardi b address current issues like mass incarceration, racial inequality, and mental health.




film and television - cultural relevance and influence
films and television moments that broke stereotypes and represented black life have been created by african-american filmmakers, actors, and directors. from early representations in silent film to today's celebrated auteurs, the african-american presence in hollywood has evolved.






iconic movies: a reflection of african-american life
movies like do the right thing (1989) by spike lee and moonlight (2016) by barry jenkins expose african-american struggles and triumphs rawly. such films portrayed black life as well as social justice issues affecting blacks.
directors who shaped hollywood
directors like ava duvernay, ryan coogler, and jordan peele reshaped african-american storytelling. duvernay's selma (2014) profiled martin luther king jr. these films demonstrate the range of african-american directors in capturing black identity and experience.
cultural impact of african american actors
stars like denzel washington and, viola davis and chadwick boseman show range and emotional depth. washington was a legend in malcolm x (1992) and training day (2001), and viola davis's fences (2016) won her an academy award-the first african-american woman in hollywood.
