naples pier

in january, 1888, there was no pier.  the naples company found and purchased the fastest steamship on the coast: captain merritt's "fearless".  this ship, which ran from punta gorda to naples, entered through gordon's pass, up into the bay of naples, according to the company's promotional brochure.  however, in low tide, passengers had to be shuttled ashore by "lighters" out in the gulf, which featured troublesome sandbars (and some rock'n'roll).

  thus, a construction contract was let to captain james canty in ft. myers in june, 1888, for a 600-foot t-shaped wharf in 18 feet deep water on the gulf side, facing the hotel.  pilings and timbers were off-loaded in the surf and towed ashore.


when the hotel opened in january, 1889, the wooden pier had just been completed.  it was the place for passengers, freight, and fishing.  the post office was located at the foot of the pier (where it stayed until 1922, when an accidental cigarette fire destroyed the building and part of the pier).  a combination boardwalk and tramway fitted with rails extended from the foot of the pier, along pier street (now called twelfth avenue south), to the hotel.  a cart could easily roll materials and luggage, but children loved getting on for a push.  by 1909, a bathhouse and changing rooms were available; freight lifts had also been added.  then, the unwelcome guests arrived!...read the history of naples pier »
