coca
(erythroxylum coca) is a native of the andes mountain. cocaine 
    is its active alkaloid and for centuries, the natives of peru and bolivia 
    chew the leaves for its stimulating effects. sherlock holmes, the fictional 
    detective, is a chronic cocaine user who liked to keep his wits occupied in 
    between cases. coca-cola invented by john pemberton in 1868 contained 
    extracts from coca leaves and was marketed as a stimulant and a remedy for 
    headache. cocaine was later removed from the drink in 1906. the pupils 
    dilate in response to its use and serves as a useful sign in suspected 
    users. cocaine also numbs the eye when applied directly to the eye. this 
    property allows its used as local anaesethsia in eye surgery during the 19th 
    and early 20th century. however, it fell out of favour because of its 
    stimulatory effects on the patients and toxic effects to the eyes.
