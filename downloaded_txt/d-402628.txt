we discovered the cashmere goat while travelling in kashmir in the
himalayas.  the luxurious kashmir shawls, often known as ring shawls
because they are so soft you can pull an entire shawl through a ring,
are keeping the kashmiris, both men and women, warm during their cold
winters and are often passed on as heirlooms within the family.
cashmere is known as the fiber of kings-it is the softest of the soft
fibers and is said to be eight times as warm as sheep's wool.

the goat
cashmere goats have traditionally been raised in the middle east
  and asia, but around 1970 australians discovered that some goats out
  back had a soft undercoat that was consistent with cashmere.  import
  to the usa started in the late 80's.  around the same time ranchers
  in the southern usa discovered that some spanish meat goats had that
  same soft undercoat.  we got our foundation does in 1989, rita from
  texas and lady from australia.
currently the cashmere goat association is working on establishing
  the north american cashmere goat as a breed.  while any goat can
  grow a soft undercoat, we have bred our cashmere goats to produce a
  significant amount of cashmere with a long fiber and a fine
  diameter.
cashmere down
the cashmere down is the undercoat that goats (so disposed) produce
from midsummer to the winter solstice.  in maine it is shed between
february and april, and you can either shear them in february or
gradually comb the down out.  it is covered by guard hair, which can
be either long or short.  at black locust farm we breed for long guard
hair that protects the cashmere from the elements, branches and burrs,
and also gives the goat an elegant look, making it a pleasure to watch
the animal out in the fields.  each goat produces 3 to 8 ounces of
cashmere annually, and a lady's sweater would take around 10
ounces.

land clearing and weed control
while incidentally producing cashmere, our goats are keeping the weeds
out of the pasture for our horses (and get along very well with them),
thereby increasing the number of animals our pasture can support.
they have free access to the woods surrounding our pasture area, and
they are gradually clearing the trees at the edge to enlarge it.
while we had our mature bucks, they were helping a neighbor clear land
  for vegetable farming.
philosophy at black locust farm
we believe in sustainable agriculture and in allowing our animals as
much freedom as is practically possible.  our does and wethers range
free all year.  while the bucks unfortunately have to be confined
during the breeding season, this allows us to plan the breeding to
produce goats with the best possible cashmere.
