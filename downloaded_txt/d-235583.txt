welcome aboard!

you’ll discover that “welcome aboard” is more than just a greeting at signature yachts. it is a guiding principle that motivates our team to be committed to you and your goals both online and in person.
you’ve already located our website. what led you here? are you prepared to purchase or sell a sailboat, powerboat, or yacht? just pondering it? just looking around? just daydreaming? our office and well-stocked lake union marina are conveniently located on westlake avenue in seattle.
now well into our third decade of serving the pacific northwest, signature yachts has sold nearly a thousand new and pre-owned boats. weâve been dealers for many quality yacht brands, like the outstanding beneteau and fountaine pajot yachts we represent today. weâve built a staff of personable, seasoned, and knowledgeable professional men and women.
the fact that we have received several customer-inspired accolades from the best yacht builders may comfort you. teak and brass plaques. parchment certificates. but our most treasured recognition canât be hung on the office walls. it’s the personal reward of having hundreds of repeat clients with whom we share lasting friendships.
join in. walk our docksâand welcome aboard!
