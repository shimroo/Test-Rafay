2023 and 2024 europe river cruises
what differentiates 2023 and 2024 europe river cruises from all types of europe cruising is the destination in which the body of water is located in. in this case, 2023 river cruises along an inland waterway where at one point in time, the cities along these waterways were central points or main cities. the czech republic's capital of prague can be accessed by way of the country's main river, the danube river.
river cruise ships
another thing that differentiates a river cruise tour from an ocean cruise are the vessels or ships seen on most inland waterways. most modern river cruise ships are normally between 350 ft and 450 ft in length. the width of a typical river cruise ship is roughly 72 feet wide, and the capacity is normally between 106 and 198 passengers.

we cannot begin to say what an excellent job that our travel agent, cheryl has always done for us, she consistently does an outstanding job. we are not seasoned travelers and she has always been very patient with us. when we inquire about anything her response is both rapid and fitting. if we were to able to travel more she would be our first choice to utilize due to her fine attitude and talent.
