new year's eve, 1999



i would have each couple turn, 
join and unjoin, be lost 
in the greater turning
of other couples, woven
in the circle of the dance,
the song of long time flowing



over them, so they may return,
turn again in to themselves
out of desire greater than their own
belonging to all, to each,
to the dance, and to the song
that moves them through the night.



what is fidelity?   to what
does it hold?   the point
of departure, or the turning road
that is departure and absence
and the way home?   what we are
and what were once



are far estranged.   for those
who would not change, time
is infidelity.   but we are married
until death, and are betrothed 
to change.   by silence, so,
i learn my song.   i earn



my sunny fields by absence, once
and to come.   and i love you
as i love the dance that brings you
out of the multitude
in which you come and go.
love changes, and in change is true.
