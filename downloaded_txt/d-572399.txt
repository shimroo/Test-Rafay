  northern shipwrecks database.
over the last 45 years, northern maritime research has accumulated a database of 
more than 170,000 world-wide shipwrecks covering over 500 years.
  while this database emphasizes north american shipwrecks,
it also includes shipwrecks in the west indies plus thousands of vessels lost around the world.
  designed for research purposes, the 2002
version of the northern shipwrecks database on cd is being used as an important
resource tool by cuba divers, fishers, maritime historians and nautical archaeologists, 
other users include museums, archives, libraries, universities, 
offshore industries plus government agencies and departments.
  shipwreck information can be recalled by name; 
year month and/or date of loss, latitude-longitude coordinates; country,
state or province; region and area of loss; official number; port of registry; 
place built; builder; owners; captain; as well as partial name, anniversary month 
and date, cause of loss, port of origin, destinations and cargo, etc.
  the northern shipwrecks database uses 

5 main screens to recall data. searches produce a scrollable `summary' screen.
clicking on the desired record provides a printable full-screen of `details'.
