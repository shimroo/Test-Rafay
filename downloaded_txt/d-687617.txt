regal dog boxes are built in ohio with pride by bob
and darlene edinger. just look at our features or check
out a box at one of our dealers closest to you. our
aluminum has a corner interlocking system that no other
dog box on the market uses. this adds to the strength,
and there is no corner moldings that will come off with
in a few months. this locking system is completely
waterproof.


they are entirely insulated with
                three quarter inch poly foam insulation. which
                keeps the box cool in the summer and warm in the
                winter.
		quarter inch luan is used for the lid
                and walls of top-storage boxes.
.040 gauge aluminum is used for the exterior
                of the box. vents are standard on every box made.
full storage, three quarter storage, and
                non-storage dog boxes are available.
we use one inch, and one and a quarter
                screws; no staples. the screws are stainless
                steel to provide you with a longer lasting,
                better looking regal dog box.
