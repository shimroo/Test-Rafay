why do programmers hate javascript? 
posted on  july 9, 2021august 12, 2021 by  samantha george 


javascript is like a big ball of mud right now. people have different opinions on how to fix it, but all of them are wrong. some want to add more classes. others want to add more features. others want to combine all of those into one language. others want to build an entirely new language and start from scratch. now, i’m not saying that all of these approaches are the best or only ways to solve the problem. however, i am saying that all of these approaches are wrong.

the love-hate relationship between javascript and developers is well-documented. many programmers believe that javascript is a language that has no good purpose, can’t be understood, and is not secure enough. while many developers have strong opinions on the language, it is a mistake to believe that most programmers dislike javascript.
advantage of using javascript
javascript is a programming language often used to make dynamic web pages. many programmers often disliked it for its lack of static-type features, and as a result, it is a hot topic of debate in the programming community. the key to success is the ability to work with content. you need to know how to write, you need to know how to edit, and you need to know how to format. these are all skills that have to be taught and learned. they are not innate. but when you make a choice to learn them, you become a better coder.
a lot of people will tell you that javascript has the power to turn the web into an interactive experience, with its more interactive features like javascript promises and the ability to use techniques like closures or functions to create dynamic relationships between objects. javascript is the technology behind almost all of the web pages that you see every day. it was the main technology behind the way internet browsers work, and it’s also been used for creating games and apps. but some people don’t like javascript. they dislike it, hate it, or think it’s useless. this can be because they don’t like javascript. but it can be because they think it’s unethical, because they think it’s unsecure, or because they think it’s ineffective.
