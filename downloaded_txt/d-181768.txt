											double check your doctor's facts before committing to ovarian surgery.
									 	

when your doctor tells you you're at risk for ovarian cancer, do your homework
many women get ovarian cysts throughout their lives but only about 15 cases in 100,000 turn into cancer. several studies have shown that simple ovarian cysts do not cause cancer. some gynecologists suggest that the size of a cyst can indicate likelihood of cancer but this is simply not true. there is no relationship between cyst size and probability of cancer. if you do have a scan and you have a cyst that looks suspicious, some gynecologists will tell you that your only option is to have your ovary removed and that biopsies are not performed in this situation. there are doctors that will perform a biopsy of the ovarian cyst, get the results immediately and refrain from removing the ovary unless cancer is detected. some gynecologists believe that ovaries serve no purpose in women who are menopausal, but studies have shown that when ovaries are removed, the chance of suffering a heart attack increases. your health is very important, so research your condition thoroughly before deciding what to do and don’t passively accept the direction or opinion of a physician who may very well not be keeping up with current findings.

											what are normal blood sugar levels?
									 	

normal blood sugar levels
a normal blood sugar reading will fall between 70-120. this reading will change depending upon the food you have ingested. 
if you are concerned about your blood sugar, you should make an appointment with your physician. he or she can do a fasting blood sugar reading on you which will help determine if you are showing signs of diabetes.

											what causes my skin to age?
									 	

90 % of skin aging
90% of all visible aging is due to sun exposure and is avoidable! wrinkles twenties: first wrinkles appear around eyes and lips thirties: skin becomes less resilient as elastin declines allowing gravity to begin to have its way forties: as elasticity begins to diminish, skin loses its memory and becomes less able to snap back. repetitive movements such as frowns, squinting, or cigarette smoking form the first permanent wrinkles fifties: normal aging changes become more apparent, gravity is certainly a factor. gravity combines with the decrease in collagen and elastin causes skin and muscle to sag. gravity also causes the tip of the nose to droop and the ears to elongate. another important factor in intrinsic aging is the loss of bone mass. as bones shrink away from the skin, the skin retains its size and shape, this leaves the skin slightly bigger than the underlying bones resulting in loose folds of skin and thick wrinkles. nutrition and exercisegood health habits and balanced nutrition help the body to nourish the skin from the inside out. vitamin c, has been shown to support the production of collagen, the strength of the skin. calcium supplementation supports bone mass. anti-oxidants combat free radicals. don't forget water! hydration from the inside is critical for all cells.
