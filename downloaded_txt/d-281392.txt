“[alexander] was one of the rare photographers whose mastery of his craft allowed him to elevate seemingly mundane images of the world of motorsports to the status of fine art… he’s universally acknowledged as one of the premier visual chroniclers of the road racing scene of the 1950s and ’60s, and he created some of the most indelible images in motorsports history.”

— preston lerner
