reality vs negativity





reality vs negativity

in the search for personal success i have and continue to make difficult decisions and take risks. i usually spend a considerable amount of time weighing the options and listing pros and cons before i make a final decision. during this process i like to discuss my plan with friends, family, aquaintances, even strangers. i find that there three types of responses : positive/hopeful, realistic, but supportive and negative/unsupportive. i always appreciate a dose of reality to help ground my often dreamlike ideas, but straight-up naysaying is not only unsupportive, but it's depressing. no one will get anywhere without taking a risk.

for example: i would like buy an rv to use on the road during music tours.
positive: that's a great idea! you could save so much money and cover a lot of ground.
realistic: that's a great idea, but keep in mind the cost of gas, maintenance etc.
negative: it will never work. those things guzzle gas and always break down.

my focus on this rant is "why so freakin' negative, dude?!"

i guess the best thing to do is just ignore it and keep hopeful.
