the real owners of america

if you haven't learned yet, don't understand or actually believe that any political party represents anything except it's self. wake up or at least have a window installed in your navel enabling you to see the real world with your head up your ass. the men the american people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth.-h. l. menckenget this video and more at myspace.com

update: lugar & bayh vote to continue funding santuary cities, screw the victims of illegals

from: www.ifire.org congressman metcalfe of pennsylvania has compiled a report listing the impact of illegal aliens on his state. it has a color-coded map showing crimes committed by illegals. we sure could use something like this in indiana! read the report here: report ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------great idea, and a listing of what individual reps and the state house actual accomplishments on the issues. they often listen to their own speeches so much they start confusing them with action. a list of indiana victims of illegals that are the results of their total inaction on passing illegal legislation would be a damn good way to show they are in reality supporting illegals by their inaction. that is no misrepresenting the facts on a politicians record.the proof of the pudding is the voting records and bills passed each session. the internet makes it a little harder for a politician to peddle bullshit for beefsteak if the voters take advantage of it.we need video like this for indiana showing the state victims along with pictures of our politicians local, state and federal. by not voting for or failing to file and support bills for strict immigration enforcement, these politicians and supporters are nothing more than accomplice's to these preventable crimes committed by illegals.a picture of tate and federal legislaters in indianae senator waterman and rep.borders should be included in this video. they deserve full credit for the results of their failure to do their jobs. but maybe they were to busy with time changes, prayer sessions, pay raises and wringing a few more dollars out of the taxpayers through more or increased taxes and laws with large fine that are nothing more than another tax.george bush will be history after the next election. the rest of these incumbents should be replaced along with him. they are paid to protect and  represent citizens of indiana.

quotes

authority has always attracted the lowest elements in the human race. all through history mankind has been bullied by scum. those who lord it over their fellows and toss commands in every direction and would boss the grass in the meadow about which way to bend in the wind are the most depraved kind of prostitutes. they will submit to any indignity, perform any vile act, do anything to achieve power. the worst off-sloughings of the planet are the ingredients of sovereignty. every government is a parliament of whores. the trouble is, in a democracy the whores are us. -p. j. o'rourke "the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary." -h. l. mencken “most people prefer to believe that their leaders are just and fair, even in the face of evidence to the contrary, because once a citizen acknowledges that the government under which he lives is lying and corrupt, the citizen has to choose what he or she will do about it. to take action in the face of corrupt government entails risks of harm to life and loved ones. to choose to do nothing is to surrender one’s self-image of standing for principles. most people do not have the courage to face that choice. hence, most propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all.”                                                                                    ~ michael rivero“the government consists of a gang of men exactly like you and me. they have, taking one with another, no special talent for the business of government; they have only a talent for getting and holding office. their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they can't get and to promise to give it to them. nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing. the tenth time is made good by looting a to satisfy b. in other words, government is a broker in pillage, and every election is sort of an advance auction sale of stolen goods.”  -h. l. mencken

how the state leads people to their own destruction

http://www.mises.org/story/2749the song that is irresistible: how the state leads people to their own destruction by robert higgsposted on 10/16/2007 margaret atwood's poem "siren song" begins:this is the one song everyonewould like to learn: the songthat is irresistible:the song that forces mento leap overboard in squadronseven though they see the beached skulls.our rulers know how to sing that song, and they sing it day and night. the beached skulls are those of our fathers and our sons, our friends and our neighbors, for whom the song proved not only irresistible, but fatal.the state is the most destructive institution human beings have ever devised — a fire that, at best, can be controlled for only a short time before it o'erleaps its improvised confinements and spreads its flames far and wide.

taking a hammer and nailing it hard

on the 2nd amendment part of this post our new local us 8th dist congressman brad the bullshitter ellsworth has shown his true colors quickly. he will fit in well with the two left coasts politicians in washington, but i bet on him returning us to the well know title of the bloody 8th dist of one  regularly changing congressmen. i took a lot of years and multi-millions of dollars to buy this dist back after the last democrat held it.it's a damn shame when our entertainers and comedians like george carlin and others are more truthful and in touch with reality in america than the pampered prince and princesses we are all allowing to remain in office. the constitution and bill of rights are to trim the bulls horn's not sharpen them to be used against us whenever the feel the urge to exert more control.our 2nd amendmenthttp://massbackwards.blogspot.com/2007/09/taking-hammer.htmlwednesday, september 19, 2007taking a hammer... ...and nailing it hard (emphasis mine).make no mistake. every single politician in washington knows that the surest way to make affordable health care available to every single american is through the private sector. they know that eliminating the regulations that stifle competition, and getting rid of insurance mandates that drive up the cost of even the most basic policies would bring millions of the uninsured back into the ranks of the fully insured. they know that giving individuals the same tax treatment for buying their own health insurance policies that their employers get providing those policies for them would solve much our problem with the uninsured. the know all of these things .. .but they also know one more very important fact. with every private sector solution introduced into our health care system politicians and government lose power ... and that just cannot be permitted.the goal of these politicians is not to bring you health care. their goal is to make you more dependent on government ... and them.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------on a related note (and because it's been about a year since i last posted this one):"how a politician stands on the second amendment tells you how he or she views you as an individual... as a trustworthy and productive citizen, or as part of an unruly crowd that needs to be lorded over, controlled, supervised, and taken care of."~texas state rep. suzanna gratia-hupp-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------my comments inserted.wed, 12 sep 2007 16:50:13 -0400  dear skip, thank you for contacting me to voice your concern about our second amendment rights.  i appreciate your comments and i welcome this opportunity to share my views. what happened at virginia tech university on april 16, 2007 was a terrible tragedy. thirty-two people were murdered, and even more injured, in a senseless act of violence. fortunately, the students and teachers who died that day will not have passed in vain as the lessons learned from this mass shooting have lead to a shared national commitment to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future. [pure f'ing bullshit 20 thousand more laws won't stop shootings as happened there and as a ex-sheriff he damn sure knows it.] in the wake of the virginia tech tragedy, the house of representatives was compelled to reconsider laws and procedures regarding the accessibility of firearms. [compelled, to disobey the constitution over party politics]  specifically, we pursued measures to correct flaws in the national instant criminal background check system (nics) that allowed the virginia tech shooter to purchase firearms despite a history of mental health problems. [as a policeman he knows this is pure blowing smoke up someone's ass. [this kid was not a criminal and was not nor would  not be in the nics data base until we allow people like ellsworth other we know whats best for you to put all of us on their criminal data bases]  we worked with both the national rifle association (nra) and gun control advocates to craft legislation that allows states to take reasonable steps for providing the fbi with the information necessary to conduct background checks prior to firearm sales. [along with all all?  again the hiding behind the we shit of my colleagues not i],  i believe this bill represents a sensible approach for keeping firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous individuals  [he appears to be potentialy dangerous as a person sworn to uphold the constitution do you think he would resign to make us all safer.] the house passed h.r. 2640, the nics improvement amendments act, by voice vote [convenently] on june 13, 2007. though we may not agree on this issue, i hope we can continue our dialogue in the future. [the original question asked why [he] allowed a unrecorded vote on a bill by two of the most notorious anti-gun nuts in washington along with gun group whos leadership seems more than willing to some political pandering themselves.] thanks again for taking the time to share your views with me.  as your representative, i need your input to make the best decisions possible, so please stay in touch!

update  fact:indiana's inaction supports illegals criminal actions.

this is fantastic news! you'll never see mitch daniels doing something like this! our state needs to take action and fast, because the illegal aliens from kentucky will be heading north to indiana. i was heartened to see that u.s. senate minority leader, mitch mc connell has approved of this idea as well. (see pdf files at end of article) let's go hoosiers! enforcement works! call your indiana state senators and representatives to demand action this year! all indiana state senators: 1-800-382-9467 indiana state representatives: 1-800-382-9842 (democrats) 1-800-382-9841 (republicans) click here: kentucky.gov: kentucky governorgovernor ernie fletcher’s communications office governor fletcher takes action to remove illegal immigrants who commit crimes in kentucky, ensures that illegal immigrants are not receiving tax-supported benefits intended for legal residents press release date: thursday, september 27, 2007 contact information: jodi whitaker 502-564-2611 this is a damn good question for every politician/candidate in indiana that takes an oath to uphold our laws. why haven't we seen this being used in indiana at city, county and state levels.what are the sullivan county and city officials doing to prevent this growing problem before it gets out of hand. will the county/city council, or the new county sheriff step up to the plate on this or just play the same ignorance game of we didn't know? our us and state representatives are good at this game. neither sullivan county state senator john waterman or rep bruce borders have represented sullivan county citizens on this issue. a few half assed speeches and a few lame attempts don't make it so. show us the sponsored, cosponsored and passed bill over the past few sessions that reduced the cost and increased hoosiers safety.  that is proof of the pudding the real facts not political hot air speeches. you hired them and pay them to represent you ask them

you and the police

top-ten-10-things-not-do-if-you-are-arrested  top-ten-10-things-not-do-if-you-are-arrested please take note of this advice. you may be arrested for simply being in the wrongplace at the wrong time. the basic ruleis to simply listen to the officer and do as your told, "put yourhands behind your back" and do not do any of these ten things:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the police want to talk to me. should i talk to them?  missouri criminal defense lawyer by randy england, jefferson city,missourimost of us want to talk. some of us mistakenly think we have nothing to hide. others think they are so smart they can talk their way out of trouble. nine times out of ten, they are wrong. an earlier post covered the requirement for police to read a person in custody their miranda warnings before questioning them. often–out of an abundance of caution–the police will read those warnings even when they do not have to.most law enforcement officers carry the card shown below in their pocket and read directly from it. if this happens to you, you should listen: this may be the best advice a police officer will ever give you .miranda cardnotice the question at the very end of the warning card.* it says: "do you wish to talk to us now?"* the answer to that question should be: "no, i want to talk to a lawyer ."this perfectly ok. see warning number 1, above.

local laws target immigration ills

don't hold you're breath in indiana or the wabash valley. recent union complaints plus rumors of a growing illegal workforce locally is being ignored by the media and politicians. this combined with a total lack of balls by todays legal citizens/workers will earn them their just reward. what you think you have and will hang onto by not rocking the boat is a dream. reality is it will cost you and you're heirs dearly, their jobs, their freedoms, their culture and their country. like mexico and third world countries they flee, they will drag us all down to what they fled a third world status a country of serfs ruled by the rich elite's.can anyone locally show us even a short list of politicians, candidates, police, unions or community churches and organizations that have stepped up to the plate to help stop the problem instead of being a part of it? i don't think so!local laws target immigration illsby emily bazarthe usa today, july 12, 2007link http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-07-11-local-immigration_n.htmlocal and state governments have begun enforcing their own new immigration laws, threatening businesses with the loss of operating licenses and fines if they hire illegal immigrants.their efforts increased as congress tried but failed to overhaul the immigration system. a bill died in the senate last month.‘there’s a political vacuum, and state and local governments are moving into it,’ says georgia’s labor commissioner, michael thurmond.eighteen states have passed 57 immigration laws this year, according to the national conference of state legislatures. more than 25 cities and counties also passed measures in the past year, according to the american civil liberties union, including virginia’s prince william county on tuesday.despite the outcry from business and civil rights groups, many target employers, as in green bay, wis.‘that was a premise of this ordinance, to discourage illegal aliens from coming here by making it harder for them to get a job. we’re putting businesses on notice,’ says chad fradette, green bay city council president.• under green bay’s ordinance, which took effect june 23, a firm can lose its business license if it hires illegal workers. fradette says illegal workers have ‘undercut’ the city’s union workforce.a city committee wants to grill the owners of two restaurants on their hiring practices monday, fradette says.green bay alderman jerry wiezbiskie objects. ‘let the witch hunt begin,’ he says. ‘it’s a threatening ordinance to immigrants, legal and illegal.’• beaufort county, s.c., plans to begin auditing employment records in august by sampling 25% of its 5,000 businesses, says county administrator gary kubic. the county passed an ordinance in december that says a business could have its license suspended for hiring illegal workers.former county councilwoman starletta hairston introduced the measure because she says companies that hire illegal immigrants have a competitive advantage. ‘you cannot compete with a business that does not have to be concerned with paying taxes,’ hairston says. ‘they pay people cash under the table.’ her husband had to shift his stucco business elsewhere when he couldn’t compete, she says.• a georgia law that took effect july 1 requires companies with at least 500 workers that do business with the government to verify the legal status of new workers. other states, including colorado and arizona, also have cracked down on employers.• on july 1, business owners renewing licenses in payson, ariz., began signing affidavits that they employ only legal workers. ‘we’re trying to level the playing field,’ mayor bob edwards says.a closely watched ordinance in hazleton, pa., would penalize employers who hire illegal immigrants and landlords who rent to them, but it is on hold awaiting a ruling on a suit by the aclu.the law is unconstitutional because states can’t override federal law, employers and workers don’t have an adequate chance to appeal and it could cause discrimination, says aclu attorney omar jadwat. ‘one concern is that employers will discriminate against those who look or sound foreign,’ he says.

how many illegal workers are replacing local citizens in the valley[update] the tribune star did an article on the bricklayers local #4 complaint about illegal labor recently. but it appears local politicians and media in the valley are hoping it will not be noticed by the voters until it's too late here like many other places. then you will live with the their are to many for us to enforce the laws.  i spoke to one political county chairman in terre haute he feels it is to risky for candidates to speak up on the issue of representing the american workers over imported labor?a post similar to a letter to the editor replying to both mary stansberry published: june 13 and bill livvix jr.june 16, 2007 the present problem is indiana senator's bayh and lugar along with others at local, state and federal levels supporting and encouraging illegals by  allowing selective enforcement of our laws. we don't need finding half way decent ways of handling a problem they continue to encourage the growth of everyday. does anyone really believe they would enforce any new laws either. enforce the present immigration laws equally and the problem will take care of it's self.  local building projects should damn sure have legal workers. where are the unions and politicians in terre haute and surrounding areas, do they represent local workers today? none are totally to blame if american workers/voters are that intimidated and pussyfied today allowing it to happen. i have heard rumors that one union local attempted to picket the hotel but others refused to honor the picket line? anyone know for sure? if questionable illegal workers are being used and you have checked or suspect no state, local or federal taxes are being paid. turn them in to irs, ice, indiana dept.of revenue, state board of health or any other agency that may have interest in their criminal activity.don't rely local officials or immigration they are part of the problem. turn the employers in to the state and federal tax collector's, these critters can put a politician or vampire to shame when it comes to sucking the life [money in this case] out of someone.  click on this link http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l33/trapper11/employersscan.jpg  copy and pass them out to area businesses, groups, churches and unions.i have not verified this section of the immigration laws but i doubt greedy self severing employers or politicians have either, cheap obedient labor and voters are the law today.a post from the indy board on section 8 usc 1324(a)(1)(a)(iv)(b)(iii)of our immigration laws.(quote)"any person who . . . encourages or induces an illegal alien to . . . reside . . . knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such . . . residence is . . . in violation of law, shall be punished as provided . . . for each illegal alien in respect to whom such a violation occurs . . . fined under title 18 . . . imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both."encouraging and hiring illegal aliensthe penalty for felony harboring is a fine and imprisonment for up to five years. the penalty for felony alien smuggling is a fine and up to ten years' imprisonment. where the crime causes serious bodily injury or places the life of any person in jeopardy, the penalty is a fine and up to twenty years' imprisonment. if the criminal smuggling or harboring results in the death of any person, the penalty can include life imprisonment. convictions for aiding, abetting, or conspiracy to commit alien smuggling or harboring, carry the same penalties. courts can impose consecutive prison sentences for each alien smuggled or harbored. a court may order a convicted smuggler to pay restitution if the illegal alien smuggled qualifies as a victim under the victim and witness protection act. conspiracy to commit crimes of sheltering, harboring, or employing illegal aliens is a separate federal offense punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or five years' imprisonment.if someone cannot understand or speak english...yes...it is reasonable suspicion they are an illegal.immigration officers and local law enforcement officers may detain an individual for a brief warrant-less interrogation where circumstances create a reasonable suspicion that the individual is illegally present in the u.s. specific facts constituting a reasonable suspicion include evasive, nervous, or erratic behavior; dress or speech indicating foreign citizenship; and presence in an area known to contain a concentration of illegal aliens.tax crimesemployers who aid or abet the preparation of false tax returns by failing to pay income or social security taxes for illegal alien employees, or who knowingly make payments using false names or social security numbers, are subject to irs criminal and civil sanctions. u.s. nationals who have suffered intentional discrimination because of citizenship or national origin by an employer with more than three employees may file a complaint within 180 days of the discriminatory act with the special counsel for immigration-related unfair employment practices, u.s. department of justice. in addition to the federal statutes summarized, state laws and local ordinances controlling fair labor practices, workers compensation, zoning, safe housing and rental property, nuisance, licensing, street vending, and solicitations by contractors may also apply to activities that involve illegal aliens. we do not need new laws but rather we need brave leaders who will emerge to do what is right for america and enforce the law.

crumbs for the willing slaves

our master's of the modern plantations are corrupted politicians. the indiana legislator's after giving themselves a huge raise with automatic increases much like the one federal legislators screwed the taxpayers with earlier, based the working poor wages on the federal minimum wage laws. that couple of bucks raise in two years might get you an extra quart of gas or milk in two years, maybe.to have a bloated tub of lady killing lard like kennedy and fellow legislators telling the poor how they saved them would make a buzzard puke. “democrats stood together, and stood firm, to say that no one who works hard for a living should have to live in poverty.”but the average party democrat or republican buys this shit for beefsteak and enjoy every bite of it if the politicians, their pappy or gran-pappy said it was so. i don't think it's so much the politicians fault that the voters are so god damned stupid, especially when their voting for something dead and gone. you're old pappy may have been proud of you but you're heirs will most likely curse the mere thought of you for giving their future away. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18847929/fta:america’s lowest-paid workers won a $2.10 raise thursday, with congress approving the first increase in the federal minimum wage in almost a decade. their raise was aprox 4,000.00.president bush was expected to sign the bill quickly, and workers who now make $5.15 an hour will see their paychecks go up by 70 cents per hour before the end of the summer. another 70 cents will be added next year, and by summer 2009, all minimum-wage jobs will pay no less than $7.25 an hour.

this is one of dick lugar and evan bayh's guest workers they recently voted for. these illegals also aided and assisted by the do nothing indiana governor and state legislator's roam around in indiana by the hundreds of thousands.they can come up with endless laws to fleece the citizens out of more of their money. but refuse to pass or enforce anything on this illegal invasion of cheap obedient labor and voters. maybe they could all get together and send her a we feel for you, get well card but shit happens. they should be held personally responsible and be forced to take these criminals into their homes with their kids and grandchildren or spend a few nights in a cell with with this man drunked up and a jar of viagra. i bet they would see things a whole lot differently afterwards. a 27-year-old man is in jail this morning after police say he abducted and raped his 7-year-old neighbor at a southside apartment complex. http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=2007705240590castillo is an undocumented immigrant. castillo had told rubick he is a dual citizen of mexico and honduras and works as a day laborer.read some of the 400+ comments on this article.

my title: sorry ass promoters of taxation

after reading about the county council passing this last sullivan county tax. i thought they may to read a little on taxation. my "read my lips, no new taxes" councilman kassinger's courage seemed to have dribbled down his leg. i would never vote for this out right liar again and will attempt to find some one to run against him next term.the local republican chairman and at least one of his appointed officials here seem to think as long as other counties are doing it, that makes it ok. a case of you going to get raped anyway so lay back and let us in on the act you will learn to enjoy it. hell i think maybe both parties have membership in this partners(socialist's)for progress(taxation)group in sullivan county.tell me again that there is any difference in the two money addicted parties. defenders of slavery: vin suprynowicz on promoters of taxation     self-interested defenders of ‘the peculiar institution’defenders of slavery[snip]the point, for the irony deprived, is that one cannot erect a moral justification for an immoral act by listing the good things you’ve done with your slave’s labor or with the property you have stolen. captured bank robbers are not released based on the assertion they used some of their booty to buy medicine for old people. taking wealth from others against their will, under the threat of brute force, is immoral. if you doubt that’s what "taxation" is, try refusing to pay. refuse to let the armed men in your home or office when they arrive. do "tax resisters" go to prison, or not? if they try to escape, will they be shot, or not?here we have a letter from someone whose main sustenance comes from tax loot, who is retained to train new little fledgling statists how to wrangle ever more tax loot to run ever more government "programs" entrapping an ever wider circle of unfortunates in the "new plantation" of the welfare state, ridiculing the cries of one of his slaves.at least let him to be honest enough to say, "i authorize armed men to loot for me what i need, because i don’t know any other way to get these useful things done, any more than the british could imagine any way to man their fleet or work their plantations without clubbing men over the head." from that premise, some useful discussions might proceed.weren’t many things now considered impossible without employing monopoly government force once done in other ways?

the new #1 killer in our society. it's not cancer or heart disease.

damn where are the crazies, (the cough cough gag second smoke nazi's) this needs to be banned. think of the children and public welfare(health). where oh where are all the md's, ama and other health related organizations hiding on this problem. think of the higher insurance cost we all pay for these groups negligence or behavior. maybe taxing them to death would make them quit the habit.      the new#1 killerthe #1 killer in our society is not cancer or heart disease. the #1 killer is the health care system itself (something doctors call iatrogenic death). this includes death from:medications surgical errors hospital-acquired infections diagnostic machines hospital-acquired malnutrition so how can you protect yourself, particularly when it comes to your prescription drugs?obviously, you can’t depend on the namby-pamby fda to protect you from unsafe drugs.safety for sale: the ugly truth about the fdathe fact is, fda scientists live under enormous pressure from their supervisors to keep information about side effects to themselves, knowing their jobs and promotions are at stake. in turn, supervisors are pressured by influential politicians and bureaucrats who receive support of various kinds from powerful pharmaceutical companies.

death of an american dream

the american workers both voters and non-voters over the last few generations have allowed the removal of most of their backbones and balls by politicians, unions and their appointed groupies allowing the total pussification of america's citizens.the followin poster is hitting the nail dead on the head. it can't be said any better than what he has posted. it's a fitting discription of any employers of illegals anywhere. that includes local employers in terre haute and surrounding  wabash valley counties.[quote who="cardcat in the indystar"]people are saying it wrong. it isn't jobs that americans won't do. it's jobs americans can't make a living wage on.that is utter b.s. saying americans are above the work. drywall, landscaping, brickwork, concrete, paving, roofing all were american jobs that allowed people to make a decent living.the firms that hired these workers are criminals. greedy, traitorous, bastards that can't look past today and their own paycheck.[/quote]death of an american dream
