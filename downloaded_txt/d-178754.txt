                    “a.g. russell premium scout knife - the knife is attractive and well-made – but nearly useless. the spring is so strong that i broke two thumbnails trying to open it. i did get the main blade open, so i can use it with the blade remaining open. but i needed pliers to get to the secondary tools out – and then only after the main blade was open. so there is a safety issue.
changes: reduce the spring tension substantially. do this and the knife will be a good product. rating: 1/10

                    “
a.g. russell featherlite one-hand knife - this 3" folder combined with the neck sheath makes for the most common sense neck knife on the planet. when worn, it's half the length (4 1/2") of a 3" fixed blade and weighs less than most. disappears under a t shirt.  the sheath is secure but still easy in/out. blade shape is perfect for everyday use. wearing sweats with no pockets around the house, i no longer have to stop and 'go get' a knife; i sling this when i wake up and wear it all day long. one handed easy open/close. the aus 8a blade came sharp and is fine for an edc. this knife has done for me what ruger did with my guns...i'm not a brand snob anymore. what works, works.
changes: the plastic thumb stud works well, but a metal one would up perceived value overall.
rating: 10/10

                    “a.g. russell power ball c32 folder - fantastic knife, d2 is one of my preferred steels, love the wood handle. really like the ball bearing opening. the clip needs to be heavier duty, it easily bends when i just take it out of my pocket. you need to upgrade the clip. i have to rebend it regularly.
​a regular customer, andy.
changes: upgrade the clip
rating: 10/10
