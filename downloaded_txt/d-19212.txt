    i ordered a 5lb lot of scraps in hopes of having workable stropping leather.
the finish of the leather was beautiful and workable. the pieces were generous and exciting to see.
being a newbie to specs for leather a better idea how to gage thickness or weight would help. maybe when better versed it will not be as difficult for me. fast service nice people.
