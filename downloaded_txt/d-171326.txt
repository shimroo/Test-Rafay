after nearly twenty years of volunteers and staff working passionately to grow central iowa’s music scene, the non-profit greater des moines music coalition (dmmc) has made the heartfelt decision to officially dissolve the organization. we want to commend the many volunteers, sponsors, donors, advocates, and event attendees that supported the dmmc’s cause over the years.  
in 2005, the dmmc was founded with a mission to build a stronger and more diverse music scene in a community that was lacking in music venues, events, festivals, and support for local talent. today, central iowa’s music scene is thriving, with dozens of venues, successful events, and an exceptional and sophisticated pool of local talent. the landscape has changed significantly, and we believe the many other music-related organizations and businesses in central iowa are well-positioned to continue the work to foster our local music culture, and strive to position des moines as a nationally-recognized music city. over the years, the dmmc hosted dozens of local music events, summer music camps, music business education sessions, and fifteen editions of the 80/35 music festival. while the future of the 80/35 music festival is not currently determined, it will no longer be operated by the dmmc. over the coming weeks, we will work directly with our partners, vendors, and supporters to wind down operations. for any additional information, please contact us at dmmc@desmoinesmc.com. thank you, des moines. your passion for music has made all the difference. with gratitude, the greater des moines music coalition
