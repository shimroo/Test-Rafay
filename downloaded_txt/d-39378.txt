ohio association of area agencies on aging (o4a)
















the ohio association of area agencies on aging (o4a) is a nonprofit, statewide network of agencies that provide services for older ohioans, people with disabilities and their families. the association engages in national and statewide advocacy to address issues which have an impact on the aging and disability network and older ohioans and people with disabilities, provides services to members, and serves as a collective voice for ohio’s area agencies on aging (aaas).

every other year we sponsor an advocacy conference at which area agencies on aging and aging network partners can learn about important policy and legislative initiatives.  held during the state budget process, the conference educates participants about o4a’s budget priorities, as well as those of state agencies and advocacy partners.  visit our advocacy page for information about o4a’s advocacy efforts. the event includes a legislative reception where participants can meet their state legislators and share information about issues of importance to the aging network.
