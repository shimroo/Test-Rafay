donegan wins the award for his dedication to the association, friendship with fellow pga of america members, and positive attitude.                                                                                     february 17, 2025 (college station, tx) -                                  during today’s 57th stpga education summit and annual meeting, president bryan minnick, pga awarded the second-ever president’s award to fellow pga member chad donegan from the city of new braunfels.                                                                                     this award was established two years ago when former president james brown awarded the first president’s award to steve hammond. this tradition was started to provide the outgoing president an opportunity to select one pga of america member that they felt was deserving of recognition in front of their peers.                                                                                     “during my time as president, chad provided me with insight, friendship, and a desire to keep the organization as strong as possible,” said minnick, the current head professional at traditions club in bryan, tx. “chad is a true friend to everyone.”                                                                                     chad has been a pga member since 2002 and has continued to elevate his career to his current position of being the director of parks and recreation for the city of new braunfels and overseeing landa park golf course. during this time, chad has also made himself an asset to the association and his fellow members by serving on the board of directors and as the championships committee chairman.                                                                                     he loves to play the game but most importantly, he loves to represent all viewpoints and not just a select few. he is a person of strength and regardless if it is professional or personal items, he remains positive and builds relationships.                                                                                     chad was surprised with this recognition during the morning session of today’s education summit and annual meeting for the southern texas pga. congratulations chad!
