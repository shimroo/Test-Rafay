welcome to the home for
      old  toys and dolls

 for this 
        site, an old toy is any push, pull, crib, or 
        stand up children's 
        toy made prior to 
        1945 and made of wood or metal. most of the toys featured here were made 
        between 1890 and 1935 but we do have pictures, catalogs, and descriptions of toys 
        made up to the 1970s.  
here
you will find toy photos, toy company histories,
        and online old toy shops 
        where you can buy great old  toys. new information is being added 
        daily. we now have over
        586 pages 
 of toy articles, identification guides, and 
        old toys catalogs with 
        more than 10,000 photos of old toys and dolls. most of these articles were written 
        by toy researchers, toy collectors, and family members of
        the old toy companies.

 so we can tell it is not junk email. emails with no  subject will not be opened. 
      i'll need to see pictures of your toy to identify it.  i don't know very 
      much about non-wooden toys nor toys made after wwii. except for schoenhut 
      dolls, i know next to nothing about dolls.
