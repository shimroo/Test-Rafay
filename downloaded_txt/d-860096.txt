fantastic alsace, land of fortified castles like stone sentinels perched along the crest of the vosges mountains, dozens of castles watch over the plain from the north to the south of alsace.
these marvels of medieval defensive architecture can be seen in the distance, their imposing silhouettes silhouetted against the peaks.
they carry with them the memory of centuries of history and have seen generations of men and women come and go.
nestling in the heart of the vosges forest, the mystery they exude has inspired tales and legends that blend reality and fantasy.
an exceptional alsatian heritage, with the highest density of castles in europe, a must-see. learn more
