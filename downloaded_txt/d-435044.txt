      history of ff/pc, 1988-2022
      







our stallions
and mares historically produce gentle, sensible and willing equine
partners who have excelled in dressage, eventing & driving.

due to their trainability and kindness, they often double as the
family favorite ride/drive pony and quality breeding stock. 
our purebreds are true to type, maintaining the qualities of which
native connemaras
are so
adored. 
our breeding stock are inspected and approved by the acps and
hwsd tested.



connemaras
are much more than the standard "sports pony". 
they are the premier breed of all-purpose equine.
consider a connemara!
connemaras perform
in dressage, eventing, jumpers, driving, foxhunting, 4-h, trail
riding, endurance, games, polocross, therapeutic riding and western.

connemaras really can do it all!


if you
want a large pony/small horse from a breeding program that has
consistently produced sound, successful athletes with lovely temperaments,

choose a "foothills" connemara or "piedmont"
connemara cross/sport horse! #urconnemarasource
