dkim is in fact enabled.                              p821  page 821 it is not entirely accurate to say that "if a                            message receives a pass or decline                            from all the routers in the sequence, it is bounced                            as an unroutable address." in fact, exim may either bounce or reject such                            messages, depending on the context.                              p827  page 827 contrary to the statement in the debugging                            section, exim does fork when given the -d                            flag. however, it does not detach itself from the                            control terminal.                              p852  page 852 in the configuration file excerpt, the line that                            sets dkim_selector should do a lookup                            on $dkim_domain, not $sender_address_domain                            as shown.     no formal errata are available for this printing                            yet.                            we will update this list after the next printing has                            been finalized.             x frequently asked questions about ulsah4e  i'm teaching a course that uses unix and linux system            administration handbook as a textbook. are there slides,          outlines, or other materials available for instructors? unfortunately, no. this is something we'd like to do, but          the scope of the book makes it likely that different courses will          choose to focus on different aspects of the material included in the          book. if you have specific suggestions for supplementary materials          that you would find helpful, please let
