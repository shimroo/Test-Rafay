serade_blacki'm glad to see that my few die-hard friends still communicate via lj.  facebook is just so not fandom oriented, because i do not care to share my inner fangirl with my cousins and work friends.  facebook is way too personal and though lj is as well, there is a certain place and time for this to be read.i've been hidden.  dean and i are expecting our first child in august.  things have been up and down, but overall, i'm more than pleased with what we've come out being since our shit.  everyone goes through shit, right?  some go through worse than others and some of the worst isn't so bad.  but, things were bad.  we're still rebuilding and i'm happy to say that i've made the right decisions on where my life is heading.  so, we're expecting a son in august.  his name will be tristan richard bowden and boy, are we excited!with that, i've been addicted to watching the entire seasons of the x-files.  oh, it's like 1999 all over again for me and with it...i've discovered my new obsession "would-leave-my-husband-for" in david duchovny.  so much so, he's in my dreams.  oh, that smoldering mulder...i've thought raunchy rude things about you, fox.  so, i ventured off into reading a little scully/mulder.  interesting.  not bad.  not great, either.  but, alas, i love him and he's made "the list" that i shall one day have laminated.don't think i'll be making leakycon this year.  not because i don't care for the producers of the con, but because i'll be 8 and a half months preggers and almost ready to pop.  i will go if my dr. says i can go, because hell, it's 2 hours away!  but, really, it's just to visit friends, not to truly participate or enjoy programming like i normally do.  besides, my bellatrix corset is a wee bit tight these days.  if i go, i'll make up a funny costume as a preggers!bella and make the hubby be sirius.  morbid, but hey, it's my fantasy! ;)

i'm here...


nov. 28th, 2010 at 6:02 pm



 


serade_blacklately, i've felt so disconnected.  my husband and i have been going through some stuff that is rebuilding everything that we are.  i'm not proud of some of the things that have come up, but i'm also not going to blabber our business to everyone.  i remain strong, hurt, but trusting.  we will overcome this massive hurdle for the better.as for hp, i'm always here.  saw dh twice with some wonderful friends (my ic, or inner circle...which just means we live less than a mile away from each other) and are already planning leaky con details in july.since july, my goodness, loads has happened.  most importantly, i've gotten close with a new friend.  my sister, tatiana422  and i have been fortunate to have gained a strong friendship with the guy that played lucius in our hp chessmatch from this summer.  it was a great eye opener and still is, that you need friends...important friends that don't judge and have weaknesses.  said "lucius" has been just that.  he's been a great confidante, a brother, a drinking companion, a locked safe of secrets kept and in the end, he's just a friend.  nothing more.  nothing to believe anything different, just that friend.  new people coming into your life are good, as long as they don't have a reputation with others.  hp has done a lot for me, as it has for others, and i'll always think fondly for it.meanwhile, i'm cringing for the holidays...

post potter depression ppd


jul. 25th, 2010 at 11:15 am



 


serade_blackit's still hitting hard.  luckily, i've got my bestfriend nearby and we can just smile and sigh and know what we're both going through.  of course, out of it, we got close to a friend that was surprising.  we brought along someone we knew we would have fun with, but ended up gaining the trust and newfound friendship that was unexpected.  for that, i'm grateful for the harry potter world and all that is involved.  i cannot wait to take another trip very soon up to the wwohp, when it dies down, to really appreciate the detail and ambiance of the atmosphere.  those days cannot come soon enough (come on, september)!for now, i have a confession to make.  i am still wearing my bellatrix necklace (the raven skull with black cording) that she wears in the movie.  i wore it for the character and its been on my neck since we got in the car and drove up to orlando.  again, it was just for a costume, but sadly i'm afraid to take it off, because i feel that i'll lose a little bit of that magic that i try to look for everyday.  it's a reminder of a fantastic weekend, its a reminder of bonding, its a tokken of fun that i do not care to lose.  so, what i'm saying is, if you see a delta air lines gate agent wearing a raven's skull necklace, don't bother asking ;)

serade_blacki have stories to share, but for now, i'll just narrate with pictures:the chessmatch absolutely rocked.  i'm so proud of my cast and friends that truly pulled together for this performance and as i look back, i'm saddened that we won't be doing this again for a couple of years. :(  for now, some pictures (taken from the hpef flikr account).my husband as sirius black *swoon* (that's me as bella looking absolutely shocked that snape is getting the crap beat out of him)our gorgeous lucius getting dragged off by dementors:my beautiful sister narcissa (tatiana422) fighting mad eye moody:lucius beating the crap out of mad eye moody with myself (as bellatrix) and narcissa cheering him on!me as bellatrix fighting molly w:

infnitus...only days away!


jul. 3rd, 2010 at 5:23 pm



 


serade_blackwell, we're less than 2 weeks away from infinitus.  infact, this time in 2 weeks, we'll be half way into it, have already partaken in the live! wizard chessmatch (show), gone to the night of 1000 wizards, danced the night away at the grad night party on thurs night and have presented my 3 different roundtable/presentations.  oh, so excited.the chessmatch is in its final dress rehearsals and its all coming together so nicely, i got chills when voldemort and harry interacted with the "final battle" and bodies were all around (i'm dead, sirius, madeye...all happens in split seconds) and my bestfriend/sister tatiana422 (who plays narcissa) just looked at me and grinned.  we've wanted to do this since lumos and we're so excited to get the opportunity.  oh...so awesome.  so, again...who is going to infinitus on my friends list?!
