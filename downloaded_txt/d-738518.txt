northshore and more!



lent is coming (that's right; a month from now we will be in full-on lent mode), and that means lenten retreats and suchlike. your favorite nunblogger is lined up for two engagements (so far) for lent. the first of these is march 13, a morning of reflection in new orleans' northshore community (that is, the north shore of the giant lake that is itself north of new orleans). everything starts with confessions, then mass (i'm the cantor, too!), my talk, and an optional marian stations of the cross. sister helen will be with me to make it easy for everyone to get a copy of my book; i can just focus on meeting people and signing books. then at the end of lent i am scheduled to give a parish mission at st. joseph's in lareauville, la. that will be april 11-13, leading right into holy week. we will be running a parish book fair alongside the mission, so that through the books, the mission can continue in people's homes.in june, i am booked for three days in san angelo, tx (where the cathedral, fittingly enough, is sacred heart). if you are not in the new orleans area, ask your parish (or diocese!) about bringing me in for an event!

i'm still here! (and this is what i've been doing.)



it's still january as i write this, so happy new year! things have been really hopping for me since the summer: retreat, followed by choir practice (for our christmas concert series); a women's retreat in texas that had to be prepared and then actually given (it was delightful to be in mineral wells that weekend!); a week with my family (we visited ocean springs, ms); ten days of talks and book signings (and a radio interview!) in st. louis (i had just enough time to read pope francis' new sacred heart encyclical; the first sacred heart encyclical in 68 years!). when i got back from missouri, i had just over a week for self-guided concert practice, and then three weeks on the road with the choir; and, in the middle of january, a quick trip to boston to give a presentation to our sisters who were then meeting for our provincial chapter.  as you can imagine, i was just going from deadline to deadline! now i have a few weeks to catch up on everything else until the next series of deadlines comes. happily, in between some of those events, i was able to finish editing and designing a group guide for the nine first fridays. it is a kind of supplement to my book, for people who want to make the nine first fridays with others, whether that's a group of friends, a prayer group, or a parish. it is a free download, so get your copy at this link: https://pauline.org/pbm-resources/come-to-me-group-guide/. inside you'll find extra readings, discussion questions, kids' pages, even a chart for keeping track of your first fridays! the group guide also features music: a spotify playlist for each of the nine fridays, and one with music that is suitable for eucharistic adoration. in addition to these musical resources, there is something new (and very special!): an original eucharistic adoration song with lyrics that i wrote, set to music by one of my chicago friends, christian stirling. the music can be copied freely; christian and i just want people to sing to jesus, and acknowledge his divine, merciful, real presence.so download the guide now, while you are still thinking about it! you can share the link or even a printed copy of the guide freely, especially with prayer group leaders and parish ministers. let's get a movement started!i also invite you to sign up for my community's new newsletter. see the inaugural issue at https://online.fliphtml5.com/untp/qibc/#p=4

concert season is here!



it’s advent, so i am in boston with the choir, getting our 2024 christmas concert lineup lined up in my head. this year we are adding a new bit of technology that is taking some getting used to, but which will be a real boon for those of us on the stage (and hopefully for the audience, too!): in-ear monitors (like earbuds, but wired to a radio receiver). this means we will be singing with two radio devices clipped to our habits: one for the monitors, so we can hear the music tracks, and the other for the microphones, so you can hear us. ear buds never did work for me, so i’ve had to add yet another layer of technology to my monitors: i’m using sheer medical tape to glue the things in place. so far, it works.two of our regular singers had to bow out of this year’s concert series due to pressing commitments, so there will only be seven sisters on stage, plus our tech crew: sister carly (handling visuals) and our long-time sound engineer, matt girard. (matt has worked on our albums for about twenty years, so he knows our voices well.)just as the choir itself is a bit smaller than usual, so is the tour. this year we will only be singing in three cities: new york (staten island), boston (natick), and new orleans. the new york event is a “dinner and a show” type of evening. the first performance (this thursday) sold out almost immediately, but there are still seats available for friday night. if you are in brooklyn or the new jersey areas near staten island, i think you would find it worth the bridge toll to make it to the island. we also still have seats available for boston (natick high school) next weekend (saturday dec. 14, 7 p.m.; sunday dec. 15, 3 p.m.). the saturday show usually sells out early, so if you prefer that date, don’t wait. walk-ins will probably be disappointed. tickets are $35; group rate for bulk purchase of 10 tickets is $250; sponsorships are available, too!there will only be one show in new orleans, on wednesday, dec. 18 (jesuit high school auditorium). weather permitting, there will be ample free parking on the campus. refreshments follow the show! tickets are $35; there is also a group rate for 10 tickets ($250). we welcome sponsorships, too!so,  “come to bethlehem” with us! i’d love to see you and your family in one of these three cities! meanwhile, we are praying for an abundant outpouring of grace from the sacred heart of jesus on you and all whom you love.

recommended resources for scripture study and reflection



lots of books here! don't be intimidated! it's just a list with some explanation of each title. all good material for coming to a better understanding of the bible.i'll start with the non-book resources for the auditory learners:the bible in a year podcast is one way to go. father mike schmitz does talk at an incredibly fast pace, so if you are using this in prayer, i suggest slowing the play speed down. the ascension press media player allows you to do that (the first speed option, 1x, is normal speed; click that and select 0.8 to slow the playback down ever so slightly).the daily mass readings calendar from the united states conference of catholic bishops has an audio function, but you have to click into the calendar day to find it. click on the day, and then select "listen podcast" to hear the day's mass readings and responsorial psalm.now for the books!!!if you are looking for a solid but approachable companion to the bible, i can wholeheartedly recommend a catholic introduction to the bible: the old testament by john bergsma and brant pitre. although the authors are top-level scripture scholars, they write for "real" readers. notes include recent findings from archaeology and ancient manuscripts, and how each book of the bible has been understood by the church fathers and used in liturgy. (i can't wait until their volume on the new testament is ready!)

also by john bergsma, commentary on the sunday readings:
the word of the lord: reflections on the sunday mass readings for year a
the word of the lord: reflections on the sunday mass readings for year b
the word of the lord: reflections on the sunday mass readings for year c
the word of the lord: reflections on the mass readings for solemnities and feasts



anglican priest and scripture scholar esau mccaulley delves into key passages of paul's letters (among dozens of other biblical books) that were historically twisted to uphold the institution of slavery and racial injustice in the united states. his book, reading while black: african american biblical interpretation as an exercise in hope, is especially addressed to black readers, but i found it extremely relevant to the questions american society is facing. mccaulley looks at several key areas in which the scriptures have been kept from speaking fully to the american situation: prison reform, politics, justice, protest. he brings his broad knowledge of the word of god to bear on the issues. (i have dozens of paragraphs marked for further reflection.) his reflection on slavery (and on the applications of deuteronomy 23) is amazing. 


dr john bergsma's jesus and the old testament roots of the priesthood demonstrates how many of the old testament prefigurings and institutions were fulfilled (super-abundantly!) in jesus and in the church. this is especially clear in the gospel of john, which in a way is the most "priestly" of the four gospels. if you have questions about the priesthood in the church, or about the difference between our baptismal participation in the priesthood of christ and that exercised by our ministerial priests, or even simple questions like why catholics call priests "father" (when jesus said, "call no one on earth 'father'"), or if you would like to see in a fuller way how very many old testament types were pointing to jesus and to the church, this very readable book is for you.
jesus and the jewish roots of mary: unveiling the mother of the messiah, by louisiana native dr. brant pitre, presents the mother of jesus in the light of the old testament "types" (prefigurings that were historically real, but also prophetic symbols). this is especially important as we read the gospel of john. dr pitre is an engaging author; i made great use of the catholic introduction to the bible (old testament) that he and dr bergsma co-authored.

dr edward sri's companion to the gospel of matthew is a good study guide: it even has reflection questions and space for you to write your answers! mystery of the kingdom: on the gospel of matthew (kingdom studies)

do you get tripped up by the parables? we can go far astray in grasping jesus' point if we interpret his parables from the individualistic standpoint of the 21st century. as we read some of the most beloved parables of luke, you might find this double volume extremely enlightening, as i did. the author of poet & peasant lived and taught in the middle east for decades, and brings his intimate awareness of traditional cultural expectations to bear specifically on the parables of luke. granted, the degree of literary analysis is meant for doctoral students, the cultural parts are very graspable. please note that the author is not catholic, so sometimes his comments reflect an approach to the bible or church life that is disconnected from the continuous tradition we know in the catholic and also orthodox churches.


dr. john bergsma's fascinating presentation,jesus and the dead sea scrolls: revealing the jewish roots of christianity, gives the ordinary reader a sense of the many points of contact between the gospels and the culture, spirituality, writings, and expectations of the essenes. in many ways living a kind of porto-monasticism, the essene communities sought to prepare for the coming of the kingdom of david through fidelity to the "works of the law" (sound familiar?) in rigorous cultic purity. their leadership seems to have descended from the aaronic high priesthood, and their founder was clearly a prophetic soul imbued with the holy spirit. many practices and expressions that we find in the gospels and the letters of st paul are found nowhere else in extant literature than in the dead sea scrolls, making them amazingly valuable in authenticating, from a purely historical perspective, some of the very details that had been deprecated by "historical criticism" as invented or anachronistic.  

are you intimidated by st. paul? n.t. wright's paul: a biography is the book i would recommend to someone who wanted to read one (only one) book that combined the life and letters of st paul. written by a noted scripture, this is a flowing narrative that is scripturally enlightening and historically sound. wright gives the reader a way of following paul through the acts of the apostles and the writing of his letters, making paul the person that much more approachable, and the letters themselves more readable as a result of having a social and historical context.the case for jesus: the biblical and historical evidence for christ by dr. brant pitre is a book of apologetics: not apologizing for the faith, but defending and explaining things that can be easily misunderstood. in this case, pitre presents the person and ministry of jesus in the light of scripture and history in a readable, convincing way.

i don't have a lot of resources specific to acts, but if you would like to go further into this unique book of the bible, the two-volume set (witnesses of the messiah for acts 1-15, and envoy of the messiah for acts 16-18) by stephen pimentel seems to fit the bill. 
the sections include study questions for groups, too!


years ago i attended a lecture series by dr james papandrea on the book of revelation and found it very helpful. his book, the wedding of the lamb: a historical approach to the book of revelation, is kind of expensive, but there is a kindle version in case you are looking for a companion to revelation by a catholic theologian.

essential resources for theology of the body



as the original theology of the body fangirl, i pay attention to material that purports to present or promote pope john paul's thought. this is not a list everything worthwhile on the topic, but of the resources i consider most essential for getting into the heart of the matter. there are tons of other resources available, but these are the foundational ones.for starters, you might consider discover theology of the body, the 10-part video lecture series by franciscan father robert sprott for a live-streamed event we did in chicago back in 2013 (before "live-streaming" was even a thing). it is behind a modest paywall, but there is a free discussion guide (by yours truly), so it can be used by parish groups or organizations.the essential books are:man and woman he created them: a theology of the body, translated by dr. michael waldstein: a critical edition of the pope's series of biblical reflections. the introductions alone are valuable, content-wise. the role of the christian family in the modern world, anniversary edition, by pope john paul ii with commentary and discussion questions by john and claire grabowski. this is a "post-synodal apostolic exhortation," a kind of papal document that sums up in an authoritative way the results of a synod. in this case, it was the 1980 synod of bishops, which met to discuss "the christian family." pope john paul timed the start of his theology of the body talks to coincide with the opening work of the synod. as you might imagine, there are many convergences between the two.love and responsibility, by karol wojtyla (written while the future pope was still basically a campus minister, doing marriage prep in his own inimitable way; as he wrote them, the chapters would be discussed by the students with a view to editorial fine-tuning). this is the philosophical-ethical study of human love.understanding love and responsibility, by richard a. spinello: because not too many of us are up to reading a philosophical treatment of human love, even one that is so spot-on in terms of its personalist approach.the human person according to john paul ii, by j. brian bransfield: an introduction to theology of the body.humanae vitae, 50th anniversary edition, by pope paul vi: an annotated edition of the landmark encyclical that dealt with contraception. karol wojtla was a member of pope paul vi's expanded "birth control commission," though he could not get a his passport approved from communist poland to attend commission meetings. the crowning sessions of the theology of the body talks are an application of the scriptural principles to issues raised in humanae vitae.not theology of the body, but a kind of catechism in the light of theology of the body: the one thing is three: how the most holy trinity explains everything, by father michael gaitley. i highly recommend this presentation of the faith which draws inspiration from theology of the body and the divine mercy devotion.

sharing the news about the nine first fridays



two weeks ago we were running a weekend book fair at a local parish. one of the parish priests recommended my book from the pulpit, urging people to make the "seven fridays." (more than a few voices from the pews shouted out the correct number!). then yesterday, waiting for church to open for confession, a woman walked by, looked at me and asked, "are you the sister who wrote the book about the nine fridays?" i nodded, and she said, "i just love it!" (so glad! and she got the number right, too!)nine first fridays is quite a challenge, as you know if you have tried to make them. but so worth the effort. and for this first friday of october, there's now a poster you can download, print or share online to help others learn about (and make) the nine first fridays! ask your parish if a poster can be put on the parish bulletin board, and included in the parish bulletin.the qr code links to the pauline webstore, where hardcover copies of the book can be ordered. we are waiting for the reprint stock to arrive, so orders will go out as soon as we ourselves get the books!

texas, here i come!



registration is now open for the women's retreat at our lady of lourdes parish in mineral wells, tx (in the dallas/ft. worth area). a day-long event with two talks, an art meditation, confession, and a guided hour of eucharistic adoration! lunch is included (and there's no charge; donations are welcome).god willing, i'll be doing book signings there, as well. i say, "god willing," because my book is already being reprinted, but there was a delay at the printer's, so i'm not sure it will be in stock by mid-october. (i am trying to arrange for a free shipping code for orders, and will sign book plates for all those who place an order that day.) get your girlfriends together and spend the day with the lord! download and print the registration form and mail it in today!

it's a win-win (for the nine first fridays)!



this past weekend brought a double dose of good news. well, the first dose actually came at the beginning of the month, when i learned that my book for the nine first fridays had won first place in the category of prayer in the association of catholic publishers' "excellence in publishing" awards. then this weekend, the catholic media association (formerly the catholic press association), the largest of the professional organizations for catholic writers, journalists, and publishing houses, gave my book the first place award in the prayer category as well!add to that pope francis' announcement in the first week of june that he was preparing a document on the sacred heart of jesus (to coincide with this 350th anniversary of the apparitions to st. margaret mary alacoque), and it comes to a perfect trifecta of recognition. so if you haven't gotten your copy yet, all the signs say now is the time to get one, and begin making the nine first fridays!

month's mind and signs of the hundredfold



today marks one month since we laid my sister mary to rest. in the five weeks since her death, there have been more masses offered for her soul than we can count, and she has been enrolled in many more through the various associations offered by religious congregations (including my own!). every day brings a new grief, but there have also been many consolations. there is even a consolation in the grief itself: it is showing me that i love my sister far more than i ever realized.a lot can happen in a month.the hospital is setting up some kind of education program or fund in mary's name. in the o.r. she ran for so many years, there is now a picture of mary kay on the wall. someone told me it was going to be placed near the image of st. ignatius (which someone photoshopped so that he is holding a liver). years ago i mentioned to mary that an autopsy found that ignatius had a pitifully desiccated liver; she took that information and ran with it. only the lord how many people on the liver team have tiny saints of st. ignatius from mary's "tiny saint" ministry at the hospital.and a little over a week ago, i received a big, lumpy package from our convent in alexandria, va. it contained a hand-made rosary from sister julia (who had been a guest at mary's house during our last christmas concert, and on account of illness ended up being nursed by her an extra three days). the rosary was made with red beads, to represent mary's birthstone, and six large freshwater pearls for the our father beads represented our mom and her five daughters. the centerpiece was a marian monogram with the miraculous medal within, since mary died on the first saturday of may, and attached to the chain were significant medals: divine mercy, since mary died during the hour of mercy; blessed francis x. seelos, whose intercession she especially sought in her illness; st. joseph. (recently i added another one: st. ignatius of loyola, the unofficial patron of the liver transplant team mary worked with.) but there was more than a rosary in the package. there was also a hand-made card, its pages decorated with pictures, beads, and colored paper, with a two-page spread from each of the sisters who made vows the same year i did (except for one sister stationed in italy).in that same postal delivery, i received a smaller envelope, from a poor clare monastery. it was a sympathy card from a sister who had made first vows with us, in 1978, but then had gone on to the cloister. one of my co-novices in boston had informed her as soon as she got the news of mary's death. (the u.s. mail functioned admirably in this regard!)all of the messages promised prayer; all assured me of being loved as a sister by these women whom i have known for almost 50 years. receiving all those sisterly messages (seven of them!) upon the death of my sister struck me as a sign of the "hundredfold" promised by the lord to those who "leave father, mother, brothers, sisters, children and lands" for his sake. this race through the cancer journey has also put me in a position of being able to sympathize much more with people whose loved ones are being diagnosed with advanced or aggressive cancers. i can be more of a "sister" to them because of what i saw my sister suffer in her very brief, but intense fight.one of the people in surgery sent us a copy of the letter from mary in which she informed her team about her diagnosis, and let them know that she was stepping away from work to focus on "fighting the good fight" (we put that passage from st. paul on the memorial cards). it is possible that some of these words will end up framed or documented (can you spot the john henry newman quote in mary's final message to her co-workers?):i recently received a rather concerning diagnosis.... we have a good plan in place. i have a ton of support. i have utmost confidence and my faith is strong.this certainly wasn't 'on my bingo card'! i do appreciate prayers. to the catholics, please invoke blessed francis xavier seelos.i have enjoyed my career over the last 45 years and working with each of you. i have few regrets, but chief of these is if i ever spoke harshly or behaved in an 'unbecoming' manner.i will leave you with these thoughts. please indulge me.know that god made you and placed you here for a reason. be open to learning. listen to understand. walk the talk. and strive to be a person of integrity and credibility.it has been my privilege.

rest in peace, mary kay



i've spent a lot of time lately in the hospital. first in the oncology ward, and then, for the past week and a half, in an icu unit. not for my own health reasons, but to accompany my sister mary as she dealt with a cancer that only showed up on anyone's radar after she went to work on monday, march 18, feeling a little off her usual bouncy stride.it was already far advanced and far more aggressive than the oncologist even guessed. although surgery was just two weeks after the diagnosis, she was already weak. chemo was hastened, but it was more than her previously robust system could handle. just eleven days later, on the first saturday of may, we surrounded her with love and prayer to accompany her passage to the father.
as we surrounded her hospital bed in that final hour, her husband of 43 years put his hand tenderly on her brow while tears streamed down his face (and ours). please pray for him. he had (and has) so many health issues, it was a given that mary would be taking care of him. life sure does not go according to plan, does it?i was the firstborn in my family; mary came right after me, so she was the person i knew the longest on this earth. after my mother's death, i would spend my vacation time at mary's house, and once transferred to new orleans, i would go there on my free sundays to sit at the kitchen table with her, talking about which recipe to try out next. that's what i did the day before her diagnosis: we prepared sourdough cinnamon rolls together from her amazing starter. (i have her sourdough starter and will attempt to keep it alive.)mary was an operating room nurse who started out as a 19 year old surgical tech and worked her way up to r.n. first assistant (boss of the or) for the transplant team. she mentored untold numbers of nurses and doctors in the ways of the or. while she was in the icu we learned that she had been nominated for the hospital's "nurse of the year" commendation. (evidently, a decision has already been made, and we have no idea if it was for mary, though you know who i think utterly deserved it.)
mary (right) with an anatomically correct liver cake.red velvet, of course. when not saving lives in the operating room, she was baking fancy cakes for coworkers' events, healthcare charities, or birthdays; running a monthly "salad club" (with her signature balsamic dressing (25-year aged balsamic vinegar and dried shallots) to encourage healthy eating (her own, first of all!) or giving fun cooking classes in her home. 
having just turned 65, mary was looking forward to retiring at the end of summer so she could do more such things, as well as putter in her garden, where the fig tree is already loaded with baby figs, and the pomegranate tree downed by hurricane ida has come back from the roots and is loaded with new fruits. instead, she has been granted a better retirement, though one that leaves the rest of us out for the time being. if you have followed this blog for any number of years, you might recall that my sisters and i usually made a road trip together every summer; we started doing this with mom, and often included mary's granddaughter (until she became a teenager, and her grandmother and great-aunts became unbelievable fuddy-duddies). this year's trip was to have been to austin in april, to share the experience of the eclipse. instead, mary's surgery was that week, and the sisters' trip ended up being an intense shared experience of seeing one of our number off on the ultimate journey, to the destination we all aim for. mary kept in her locker a printout of the famous prayer (or meditation) of st. john henry newman, whose "tiny saint" image she kept on her key ring; when someone was in need of encouragement or hope, she would share it with them, and pass along a copy. she was a remarkable woman with a zest for life and a gift for communicating her faith. please pray for the eternal repose of the soul of mary kay harvey, and for the consolation of her husband, children, grandchildren, siblings, and scores of co-workers and friends. mary's favorite reflection from cardinal-saint john henry newman:god has created me to do him some definite service; he has committed some work to me which he has not committed to another. i have my mission—i never may know it in this life, but i shall be told it in the next. somehow i am necessary for his purposes, as necessary in my place as an archangel in his—if, indeed, i fail, he can raise another, as he could make the stones children of abraham. yet i have a part in this great work; i am a link in a chain, a bond of connexion between persons. he has not created me for naught. i shall do good, i shall do his work;i shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place, while not intending it, if i do but keep his commandments and serve him in my calling.therefore i will trust him.whatever, wherever i am, i can never be thrown away.if i am in sickness, my sickness may serve him; in perplexity, my perplexity may serve him;if i am in sorrow, my sorrow may serve him.my sickness, or perplexity, or sorrow may be necessary causes of some great end, which is quite beyond us.he does nothing in vain;he may prolong my life, he may shorten it;he knows what he is about.he may take away my friends, he may throw me among strangers,he may make me feel desolate, make my spirits sink, hide the future from mestill he knows what he is about.
