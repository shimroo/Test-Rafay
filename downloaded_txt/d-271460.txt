as missionaries ourselves, we understand the complexities of what it takes to equip and send laborers to the nations and the physical, social, economic, and systemic barriers that can hinder the gospel. without adequate preparation and support, missionaries can struggle, get burned out, feel discouraged, and quit.
as a 43-year organization led by veteran missionaries, we are committed to a generational strategy to take what we have learned and reproduce ourselves in those we serve to see them flourish and the kingdom of god expanded globally. 
through transformational training that mobilizes both senders and sent ones, we have seen over 2.1 million documented salvations in 117 nations with thousands equipped and mobilized to spread the gospel among the least reached and unengaged nations–and we can help you find your place in the great commission where you can make the greatest impact for christ.
