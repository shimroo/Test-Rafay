landscape photography focused on the midwest










    kirkwood, mo



 

in a crazy world, my vision is to recognize and photograph the beauty god provides. the rural, midwest landscape is full of barns, bales, fences, ponds, farmland and woodlands; an endless array of photographic opportunity unique to country life. living in macoupin county, illinois, my goal is to photograph everyday subjects from the rural landscape and reproduce them into one-of-a-kind art prints.quincy university exhibit virtual gallery link: https://www.quincy.edu/graygallerystarr/
