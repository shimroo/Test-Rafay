hi, my name is christopher rappold

and i'm the founder of personal best karate. when i was a child, i had the great fortune of beginning my martial arts journey.  through overcoming challenges and reaching my goals the positive impact it had on my life was remarkable. it has been my life's work to refine and share what i have learned so others may experience the joy of reaching their personal best. our environment is special.  it is not a one size fits all approach.   our teaching style meets every new student with a personal approach that takes into account their age, experience level and learning style and adapts our lessons so they are able to get the very most benefit from our classes. it's a joy to see how fast they progress using our unique blending of martial arts, physical fitness and real world character education.  the environment is enjoyable, challenging and builds confidence through earned achievement.   students develop lifelong friendships, improve their self discipline, focus and desire to excel.    they carry these improvements into their everyday lives. 
we have made it as easy as possible for you to give personal best a try with our no risk amazing web specials... it just may be the best decision you will ever make. we would love to have you join our team and be our next success story.

                                       the discipline from day one has taught my kids the value of listening and improving. it’s a treat to watch the kids work in class. one of the best youth classes i’ve seen.

                                       i thoroughly enjoy the 90-day challenge. it truly makes me happy. this is a beautiful group of people who are serious about their individual health-related goals. everyone makes progress at their own pace and there is no ignominy from peers or from the instructor. everyone encourages each other as well as the instructor. the culture makes one feel comfortable.

it is a commitment on the part of the instructor, ms. tracy as well. she is there for every class and even the bonus class. though intense, i enjoyed this bonus class on a sunday. i am a 60-year-old female with an active lifestyle but have never been an "exercise buff" but can truly identify myself as someone who "enjoys" kickboxing. not only do i look forward to going there and workout but i can't stop talking about it with work peers every time i get a chance.

                                       my wife and i have been very impressed with personal best karate. my son has attention deficit issues, which affects his ability to maintain focus and attention for long periods of time. the pbk staff have served as great role models to my son by providing a mixture of patients, understanding and discipline, which is helpful to our son’s personal growth and understanding of not only martial arts, but life itself. 

recently, my son had some behavior issues at school of which i disclosed to his instructor.  they offered to speak to my son privately, which was not only kind of them, but extremely helpful to me, my wife and our son. for it is important for our son to hear the voice of reason from another man other than his own father.  this is exactly the type of atmosphere we want our son to grow up in. this is exactly the type of people we want him to learn from. karate is teaching him discipline, respect, understanding and a life skill of self-defense that will be carried forth well into his adult years. 

we are thankful to personal best karate. please keep up the good work! 
respectfully,

todd & sarah castro

                                       pbk is where my son gained his confidence in the last two years! thank you so much for the structure, positive energy, and training!

                                       i would like to take a moment and give you & my wife’s sincerest gratitude. 

the program that our son jayden is involved in at the foxboro location under the direction of master sakula and ultimately over seen by master rappold is truly second to none. pbk while exceptional at teaching martial arts is absolutely so much more than karate. 

the tutelage jayden is receiving is helping in the development of him becoming a hard working, goal oriented, self-conscious, morally sound and confident young adult. his focus on school work and his development is at the forefront of his priorities even at the age of 8 years old.
watching master sakula sit and discuss “setting and accomplishing goals, the importance of helping at home, academic achievement, choosing role models in life or simply the concept of bullying” reassures us that these topics are not just being discussed but also being managed at home and thru your school. 
we are watching our son’s behavioral growth develop in ways a parent hopes for, strives for and prays for and pbk has been a critical part of this transformation. again, the pbk organization is much more than martial arts and we are genuinely grateful for the foxboro team!
warm regards,
dean, palm & jayden

                                       our 6-year-old daughter has been enrolled since october 2021 and i've seen a significant change in not only her attitude but how she sees herself. she has more confidence, and it shows in her day-to-day activities and school work.
i've also started the boot camp and have more energy and feel great about myself. all the staff are welcoming and encouraging to all the students.

                                       pbk has been a second home to my kids. they have always been treated with dignity, respect and care. while the staff at the raynham facility has changed over the years, consistent messaging and guidance has always been there. pbk has been instrumental in helping my children improve in discipline, physical fitness, confidence and establishing self worth. thanks pbk

                                       the afterschool program at personal best karate was a game-changer for our family.  my son was in the 5th grade and looking for a new experience after school.  both my husband and i work full-time and needed him to be in a safe and supportive environment.  he had never done karate but he was interested in giving it a try.  the culture at pbk is consistently delightful as the staff is friendly, invested and supportive.  my son has thrived in this environment and is very motivated to continue his training. i would recommend this program to any parents seeking an active, supportive place for their child after school.

                                       truly the best place in new england for the full martial arts experience: body, mind, soul. character development that is not only taught in every class, children to adult, but is also demonstrated by each and every instructor. the martial arts experience cannot be compared to any around. you are always learning something new and training what you already know to solidify and reinforce the skills. first class program in every aspect.

                                       i started kickboxing a year and a half ago and i can honestly say it has changed my life. kickboxing has given me the motivation i needed to lose the weight i wanted in order to feel better about myself and to get back to where i used to be. not only have i lost a lot of weight, but i have gained muscle tone and confidence in myself.

kickboxing has been a great energy source and stress reliever. i know when i take a class it will end with me feeling absolutely great. the instructor is phenomenal! he has a great way of getting you to excel and achieve your goals. he has an enthusiastic teaching style that helps to motivate you to push forward and feel the “burn”. the people are wonderful. we are all able to get together, have fun, and help to push each other to the limit. if you want to achieve all of your fitness goals, kickboxing is the way to go!
