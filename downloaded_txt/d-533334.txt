        are you wondering if you can learn something by looking at
        someone's handwriting?



        lets take a look at a couple of writing samples from an old
        autograph book dating from the 1860's. it belonged to
        lawrence, who was attending bloomfield academy.
        

        the following entry was written by bessie, a classmate of
        laurence. it is reflective of the more elaborate formal
        writing of the time.
        the
             last page of the book is autographed by laurence's
             wife, ann.


does
        looking at ann's handwriting raise questions in you mind?
        what is it about her handwriting that you notice? what
        picture of ann is coming into your mind?
         

        let's see if we can agree on some things.
        

        1. in 1868 ann was probably either very young or had very
        little education
        
        2. bessie was probably older and had some formal education,
        as did lawrence
        
        3. you already do pay some attention to handwriting.
        


        even after people are departed from this world, their
        handwriting - 
        their movement on paper 
        - tells us about them.
