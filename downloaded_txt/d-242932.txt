jump 
        in! 

the poetry free-for-all 
        is a non-stop online poetry workshop for beginners and experts alike. 
        critical commentary is expected, embraced, and all participants are expected 
        to have the improvement of their craft as a primary goal.
three important things to think about before you jump in:



offer at least three critiques of others' work for each poem you 
              post




 thank those who critique your work, even if they trash it - which 
              can and will happen




 don't mess with the moderators, who work extremely hard to make 
              this a constructive environment for those who wish to improve their 
              writing



click here 
        to jump in and start reading, writing, commenting, chuckling, and likely 
        moaning in grave distress.
