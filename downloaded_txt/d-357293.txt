helping families help themselves 



for more than four decades, echo has been equipping and empowering hungry families with knowledge and the life-giving grace of god. we’ve impacted millions of lives by teaching small-scale, sustainable farming methods so families can provide for themselves and their communities. by tackling hunger at the source, we’re growing hope from the ground up.

spreading the love of god in word & seed 



sidiki ouedraogo lives in the small village of boulwando and was struggling to provide food for his family. he was able to take part in an echo training and learn techniques for composting, fertilizing, and livestock management with hands-on demonstrations on how to apply these farming principles. he saw a 100% increase in volume from his two fields.“since i started farming, i had never produced so well,” exclaims sidiki. “today, my orchard has become a subject of fascination. many inhabitants of the neighboring villages, who see the orchard as they are passing by, actively seek to find out the owner of the orchard in an effort to discover my ‘secret.’ as a result, i have had an opportunity to share and teach many of them.”
