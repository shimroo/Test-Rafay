sweet dessert wine, although i have tasted it with real food also and i must say, to say it is a dessert wine only will not do it justice! this is the kind of muscat that when you have tasted it once you want to find any excuse to drink it again...it is that good. and if it wasn’t enough, on top of that is its packaging, the bottle is completely gorgeous with a luxous perfume bottle feel. technical data:  100% white muscat fortified with château mukhrani chacha spirit. 18% vol.description:  bright honey gold color. exuberant nose expressing dried fruits and floral aromas. rich and luscious palate for a full bodied sweet wine. honey and dried apricot are mingled with figs, and spicy flavors backed up by soft oak notes. extremely well balanced for a wine of such intensity. long lasting unforgettable finish. food pairing & service:  although it is a sweet wine, château mukhrani muscat is very versatile, consume by itself as an aperitif, with spicy asian dishes, or fruity salads. it is exquisite with dark chocolate and figs. it will also accompany extremely well foie gras. drink preferably chilled (best at 12-14 degree celsius), but can also be served at room temperature to suit individual taste.score:  9.5/10. ageing potential:  enjoy anytimeprice as seen on dc shelf:  not available at the moment.
