most parents and teachers would agree that academics are important.
 
but how can you make students excited to learn?
 
we believe that a truly excellent education integrates opportunities to explore a variety of interests while developing a strong academic base. it is this combination of passion and purpose that creates children who are eager to learn.

learn how our graduates are prepared for what's ahead!







choosing fcds
when we came down here, the people my husband works with raved about fcds. we scheduled a visit and my son loved it. the curriculum was stronger and broader than others we’d seen. – marnie, parent




happy parent
fcds is a wonderful environment for the kids. teachers are great, helpful, committed, accessible. academics are topnotch. great social environment for the kids to develop and grow. that the kids have adapted quickly and absolutely love everything about being furies makes us even happier about the move to fcds! – adam, lower and middle school parent




kindergarten
when we toured, we were impressed by the teachers who spoke with enthusiasm about their subjects, conveyed a true desire to inspire learning in our children, and described how they would do this in their classroom. we saw conflict resolution and discipline with nurturing kindness. we left the tour, tearing up, excited for our son to be exposed to the diversity of languages, music, art, sports, field trips, and more. – amy, kindergarten parent




known
i love that i am known here. i'm not just an artist or a member of a sports team. my teachers know who i am and celebrate me. – upper school student




leadership
i found many ways to develop my leadership skills at fcds whether it was being a leader in the classroom, on the field, or in student organizations. my leadership opportunities allowed me to deepen my relationships with my peers, teachers, and administrators. – ben '17, alumnus




ms
the teacher/student ratio in the classroom, all the positive comments from current students and parents, and the communication throughout the entire admissions process. i knew from the first meeting fcds would be the right school for my daughter. - new middle school parent




new family
for the last six years, my son has loved the experience of attending camp at fcds. at one point i switched him to another camp for my own convenience. he came home bored so i switched him back. since my son started as a student at fcds, he comes home talking about school. he is inspired and eager to learn every day. i am very happy. – kathy, new middle school parent




new family 2
our family has been impressed with fcds. our daughter loves her teachers and appreciates that the assigned lessons are intentional and have value instead of just being busywork. as an educator, i appreciate this as well. - new upper school parent




new ls
we have been eyeing this school for a couple of years and love the program (two recesses, science, and spanish daily, pe twice a week). all of these things help the kids learn better and develop social skills and a healthy lifestyle. we knew our daughter needed in-person learning to excel and further develop her love of learning. - new lower school parent




started sooner
i have been continually impressed at the level of encouragement my children have received at forsyth. they have been given the opportunity to try new things and learn in ways that are best for them! i wish we had started here sooner. - fcds parent




well prepared
my college english professor told me that i was the best writer in my class and obviously received ‘quality high school english instruction.’ i am so well prepared for college and have my teachers at fcds to thank. – alex ‘16, alumnus 




well prepared 2
when i first came to fcds i was a little unsure of what to expect. my concerns were quickly alleviated by being accepted by the other students and receiving individual guidance from teachers. fcds set me up for success at morehouse college. i am prepared for the rigorous courses, and now i know how to manage my time, and i am a confident student. – grant, ’16, alumnus




well prepared 3
i think forsyth has prepared me exceptionally well for the next chapter in my life and has brought out the best in my abilities. i truly believe there is something for everyone and a unique opportunity to thrive thanks to exceptional faculty and an excellent selection of classes. – senior




small classes
my students tell me that there are several benefits to smaller english classes: 1) they feel safer speaking up in class; 2) we get to the heart of the material faster so that we can go in-depth faster; and 3) i get to know them as individuals so i can strengthen their individual skills. – meredith harvey, upper school english teacher




active role
i love that i play an active role in my children’s education. i know their teachers and they know me. the regular communication and conferences keep me connected. and i appreciate spending time in their classrooms. – andrea, lower school parent




college counseling
what makes the college counselors so special is that during the stressful application process, they take care of all of the tough parts and we get to participate in the fun parts. they really get to know our children so they guide them better than anyone. without a doubt, our college counseling program is worth the price of admission!  – jennifer, alumni parent '17




engineering
my sons thrived in the engineering program. they had the advantage of knowing that engineering was the right major for them – before applying to college. my oldest son is now an engineer at bmw and loves it. – marla, alumni parent ’11 and ’15




master concept
when students teach other students what they’ve learned, they begin to really master the concept. by simply explaining something complex in simple terms, their confidence and understanding greatly increase. it’s often an ‘aha’ moment. – mike martin, middle school science teacher




real world experience
i was excited to gain real world experience in my business & entrepreneurship class. we helped real businesses with real problems, presented solutions to these businesses, and learned to work in teams. i'm looking forward to using those skills in college and beyond. – brandon '17, alumnus
