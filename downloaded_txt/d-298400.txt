does confocal microscopy help detect acanthamoeba keratitis?





confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm or lscm) is a valuable tool for obtaining high resolution images and 3-d reconstructions. the key feature of confocal microscopy is its ability to produce blur-free images of thick specimens at various depths. according to an article in healthy for life on eye infection detectioneye infection detectionif you wear contacts, your risk of getting a blinding eye infection goes up. until recently there has been no easy way to diagnose the infection, but, a new technique is helping patients keep their eyesight.lori mcrae used to live in darkness.lori mcrae had eye parasite infection"we put black plastic over all the windows, and basically tried to shut out all light in the house."she was in extreme pain and losing sight in one eye. she went to six different doctors before getting the correct diagnosis - a parasite called acanthamoebawilliam mathers, m.d.ophthalmologistoregon health & science universityportland, or"it's extremely common. there's amoeba everywhere. it's in our drinking water. it's all in the soil, and in all water."lori doesn't know how she got the infection. the amoeba could have been in the water when she washed her hands before putting in her contacts.whatever the cause, she was lucky to find doctor mathers. he uses a special microscope to look for the infection.william mathers, m.d."we can actually see the organisms in the eye, living in the eye without hurting the person at all.the more common way to diagnose the infection is to culture the amoeba. many doctors don't go to the trouble because the symptoms are similar to other eye infections.lori was treated for pink eye and herpes first. she was finally given the right medications, but it was too late for them to work.she needed a cornea transplant to restore her sight. she says she hopes the new microscope will prevent others from having to go through what she has.lori mcrae"i'm very lucky to have come from that point to be where i am."even if she could, lori says she'll never go back to contacts.if you're going to wear contacts, doctor mathers suggests disposable or daily wear lenses. he says people who wear their contacts overnight are ten times more likely to get infections.bagolie friedman amo contact lens solution recall injury lawyersthe five corners building660 newark avenuejersey city, new jersey 07306201-656-8500 phone201-656-4702 faxe-mail: ricky@bagoliefriedman.come-mail: rickybags@aol.comvisit our website now at: www.bagoliefriedman.comblog with us at: www.bagoliefriedman.com or www.jerseycity.injuryboard.comaffiliate offices: clifton, new jersey - hollywood, florida - brisbane, australianote: the above information is an opinion and does not constitute legal advice. unless a retainer agreement has been signed, rcky e. bagolie and/or the law offices of bagolie friedman, llc is not your legal representative. the information contained in this electronic communication is confidential and may be a privileged attorney-client communication. it is intended only for the use of the recipient named above. if the reader of this message is not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any dissemination, distribution, or copying of this communication, or any of its contents, is strictly prohibited. if you have received this communication in error, please reply to the sender and delete the original message and any copy of it from your computer or facsimile system. thank you.

moisture plus contact lens solution recall lawsuits





advanced medical optics voluntarily recalls complete moistureplus contact lens solutionthe u.s. food and drug administration is alerting health care professionals and their patients who wear soft contact lenses about a voluntary recall of complete moistureplus multi purpose solution manufactured by advanced medical optics of santa ana, ca. the company is taking this action as a precaution because of reports of a rare, but serious, eye infection, acanthamoeba keratitis, caused by a parasite. the link between the solution and the infection was identified as a result of an investigation by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc).consumers who wear soft contact lenses should stop using the solution, discard all partially-used or unopened bottles and replace their lenses and storage container. "we believe the company acted responsibly in taking this voluntary action and support their decision to be proactive in the interest of public health," said daniel schultz, m.d., director of fda's center for devices and radiological health. "fda and cdc are working closely with the company to collect additional information and we will continue to alert consumers and advise them as more information becomes available."acanthamoeba keratitis may lead to vision loss with some patients requiring a corneal transplant. the infection primarily affects otherwise healthy people who wear contact lenses. consumers should ask their doctor about choosing an appropriate alternative cleaning/disinfecting product and seek immediate treatment if they have symptoms of eye infection as early diagnosis is important for effective treatment. the symptoms of acanthamoeba keratitis can be very similar to those of other more common eye infections and may include eye pain or redness, blurred vision, light sensitivity, sensation of something in the eye or excessive tearing but acanthamoeba is more difficult to treat.it is estimated that acanthamoeba keratitis infections occur in approximately 2 out of every 1 million contact lens users in the united states each year. however, in a multi-state investigation to evaluate a recent increase in acanthamoeba keratitis cases, cdc determined that the risk of developing ak was at least seven times greater for those consumers who used complete moistureplus solution versus those who did not. additional information regarding the cdc results is available at the cdc website http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm56d526a1.htm."the ongoing cdc investigation is a collaborative effort," said michael beach, m.d., a division of parasitic diseases team leader with cdc. "we are working with fda, state, territory, university, and clinical partners in an effort to further understand whether usage or contamination of this solution led to these acanthamoeba infections."all contact lens users should closely adhere to the following measures to help prevent eye infections:remove contact lenses before any activity involving contact with water, including showering, using a hot tub, or swimming. wash hands with soap and water and dry them before handling contact lenses. clean contact lenses according to manufacturer guidelines and instructions from an eye care professional.  use fresh cleaning or disinfecting solution each time lenses are cleaned and stored. never reuse or top off old solution. never use saline solution and rewetting drops to disinfect lenses. neither solution is an effective or approved disinfectant.  schedule regular eye exams with your eye care professional wear and replace contact lenses according to the schedule prescribed by your eye care professional. store lenses in a proper storage case.  storage cases should be irrigated with sterile contact lens solution (never use tap water) and left open to dry after each use.  replace storage cases at least once every three months. fda and cdc want to gather information related to acanthamoeba keratitis in contact lens users. report adverse events related to these products to medwatch, the fda's voluntary reporting program: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm; phone: (800) 332-1088; fax: (800) 332-0178; mail: medwatch, food and drug administration, 5600 fishers lane, rockville, md, 20852-9787.consumers who believe they are in possession of the recalled product may call the company at 1-888-899-9183.additional information about acanthamoeba infection is available from the cdc website at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/acanthamoeba/index.htm.have you or someone you love been suffering from a severe eye infection or have been diagnosed with acanthamoeba keratitis, cornea damage or blindness? trust bagolie friedman injury lawyers to fight for your rights and obtain the justice you deserve. we offer aggressive representation and free consultations.we are personal injury and workers' compensation trial lawyers. contact us now for a free, confidential and no risk consultation if you have questions about any type of accident, injury, disability, workers' compensation or disease claim. whatever legal problem you have, our personal injury attorneys want to help. this resource offers information on a wide variety of personal injury case types and is intended to help injury victims find the information they need to understand their legal rights and make informed decisions. if you would like to discuss a potential case please feel free to call toll free 1-866-333-3law (1-866-333-3529)or submit a free online case review.####

more problems for charite artificail disc - lawsuits mounting





the following story chronicals the problems that recipients of the charite artificial lumbar disc are having.  beware if your spine surgeon wants to put one in your back.  bagolie friedman injury lawyers are investigating failed charite disc back surgery claims and offer free consultations and aggressive representation.  call toll free 1-866-333-3529 or visit our website now.problems following total disc replacement03-jan-07 - the journal of bone and joint surgery (american). 2007;89:82-88.doi:10.2106/jbjs.f.00432© 2007 the journal of bone and joint surgery, inc. prevalence of heterotopic ossification following total disc replacement a prospective, randomized study of two hundred and seventy-six patients p. justin tortolani, md1, bryan w. cunningham2, mmech eng2, paul c. mcafee, md1, gwen a. holsapple, bs2 and karen a. adams, bs2 1 scoliosis and spine center of maryland, o'dea medical arts building, 7506 osler drive, suite 104, baltimore, md 212042 orthopaedic research laboratory, union memorial hospital, 201 east university parkway, suite 781, baltimore, md 21218 investigation performed at scoliosis and spine center of maryland, st. joseph medical center, and the orthopaedic research laboratory, union memorial hospital, baltimore, maryland --------------------------------------------------------------------------------background: despite reports of good clinical outcomes in patients treated with lumbar and cervical disc replacements, varying degrees of heterotopic bone have been observed around these devices. the purposes of the present study were to determine the prevalence of heterotopic ossification following lumbar disc replacement and to investigate whether heterotopic ossification results in loss of motion or negatively affects clinical outcome. methods: all preoperative and postoperative radiographs from a completed prospective, randomized, united states food and drug administration-regulated trial comparing replacement with the charité artificial disc with anterior interbody arthrodesis were analyzed. in each of 276 patients treated with disc replacement, heterotopic ossification was categorized with use of a validated 5-point radiographic classification system both preoperatively and at all protocol-specified follow-up intervals to two years. the range of motion on flexion and extension radiographs made preoperatively was compared with that on radiographs made two years postoperatively, and the motion was correlated with the presence or absence of heterotopic ossification. similarly, validated clinical outcome measures were correlated with the presence or absence of heterotopic ossification at two years. results: the prevalence of heterotopic ossification in the 276 consecutive patients treated with lumbar disc replacement with the charité artificial disc was 4.3%. there were four cases of class-i heterotopic ossification and eight cases of class-ii heterotopic ossification. in five of the twelve patients, heterotopic bone was visible as early as six weeks postoperatively, and eleven of the twelve patients had evidence of heterotopic ossification by three months postoperatively. the postoperative range of motion exceeded the preoperative range in all of the patients with heterotopic ossification. with the numbers available, no difference in either the range of motion or the clinical outcome at twenty-four months postoperatively was found between the patients who had and those who did not have heterotopic ossification. conclusions: heterotopic ossification is infrequent in patients treated with the charité artificial disc, and it does not impact the range of motion or clinical outcome. level of evidence: prognostic level ii. see instructions to authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
