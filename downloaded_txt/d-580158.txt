come see for yourself!
 
we perform mohs surgery for skin cancer at our state-of-the-art princeton office.
your skin cancer is removed and then, if needed, the area is stitched all in one day.
other offices may perform mohs on one day and then bring you back for the stitches the next day, which is understandably more inconvenient for you. 






thank you to everyone who voted for me. i very much appreciate it!
