just been looking through the blogging world and you people really are entertaining and full of interesting little facts! inspired me to make a come back for real this time to the blogging community.so just to kick things off i found out an interesting fact at work tonight, or maybe i was just stupid for not knowing, but i'll throw it out there.q, why don't train stations have any bin's to dump those annoying bit's of rubbish you always end up wondering around with?

	 return of the blog!
	 
    

hellooooo people, it’s been a while since the last real blog, but i do have a good excuse, it’s the world cup!! i’ve been far too busy drinking and recovering to blog, sorry! so today as there’s no footy on now till saturday i’m catching up!what’s new?not a lot really just plodding along as usually working out of hours rocks!! steady away for work and still time to have a laugh.been training a few of the new starters at work too haha for those of you who know me u'll understand why that’s so funny!bought a lot of new clothes from leeds, so if you see some hip sexy trendy guy walking down the street look just behind him and you'll see me in my new jeans!!i don't blog about my looove life yeah baby! but all is good there!apart from that there's not much been happening, it’s dangerous having 3 live footy games on a day and now down to 2 it don't leave much time for anything else!which brings us full circle, as to what first made me think of blogging? this may be old news for some people, but i’ve just discovered family guy. i do remember watching series one of this in uni but i’ve struggled to remember what it was like. so went into wakey yesterday and got series 1 and 2 (£20 bargain). it's a truly devastating series, especially the randomness! my new fav cartoon character is now stewie!! (don't worry homer your still number 1 too)ok people take it easy, hope you all enjoying the sun and footy or gaming if thats your bag!!

	 33 days to go !
	 
    

the world cup is almost here! the football season is coming to an end, but fear not. the newspaper's are filling up, england tops are appearing everywhere and cars fly past pasted with everything england! thats right, its time for the nation to hold its breath again as we watch our boys fly out to germany to do us proud. and what can we expect? like in every tournament england play in.........drama! i'm sure where going to see the usual diving, play acting and moaning for all over the world. the italians have been left out because there far too many pictures of them on the floor.i did say there's always drama with england.but what the world cup does give us is moments like these......................steven gerrard, frank lampard, michael owen, joe cole, john terry, paul robinson what moments will these players give us? do i think england will win the world cup?yes..............hopefully againts germany in the final.
