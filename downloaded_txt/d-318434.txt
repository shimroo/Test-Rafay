 rak technical management consultancy
i would like to place on record that the time i got introduced to jobs in dubai (jid) till date, i feel like it is my own business family working for raktmc. the quality of service and timely responses are exemplary. the dubai office staff are very professional, polite, friendly and understand their client's temperament.

i have been in constant touch with jid officials giving my advices to enhance their system to be more user friendly and it's my pleasure that jid has accepted them and as i understand working on developments in their canada office.

i am sure, their approach and the development of nexus between the employer and job seekers will give them edge over other competitors.

i will have no hesitation in using jid again and again in the future and will always recommend jid to job seekers."
