what we believe
the bible is the inspired, inerrant, and sufficient word of god is our final authority in all matters of faith and practice. the bible reveals god’s holy and glorious character; his amazing plan for saving repentant sinners through his son, the lord jesus christ; his precious instructions and promises for his church; and his plan for the coming kingdom at the return of christ.
