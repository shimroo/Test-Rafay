the science behind the intuition
the department of cognitive science is committed to transcending theoretical boundaries rooted in traditional disciplines in pursuit of a scientific account of cognition. we promote the study of learning, perception, action, and interaction in the physical, social, and cultural world. our inter-disciplinary vision draws from a number of disciplines, including anthropology, computer science, ethology, electrical engineering, linguistics, neurology, neurosciences, philosophy, psychology, and sociology in order to contribute to theory and apply what we learn to design.
