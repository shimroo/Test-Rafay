what our customers are saying

doug and crew were awesomely entertaining. this was the first time balloon ride for us and was super enjoyable. all details were explained to us as the flight progressed from inflating the balloon through ascent, soaring, descent, and a super smooth landing. afterwards the wine tasting at sanders family winery was a great bonus and then finishing with breakfast.
