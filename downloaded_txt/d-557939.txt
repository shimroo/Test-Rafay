italy schools 








this is the online directory with the main international schools in italy 
        that offer an education in english. the programmes vary from the international 
        baccalaureate (i.b.) programme, which includes pyp, myp and diploma to 
        the british gcse and gce examination systems. all schools are required 
        to satisfy the requirements of the italian national system. 








international baccalaureate in international schools 
the international baccalaureate organization’s diploma programme 
        was created in 1968. it is a demanding 
pre-university course of study that leads to examinations. it is designed 
        for highly motivated secondary and international school students aged 
        16 to 19. the programme has earned a reputation for rigorous assessment, 
        giving ib diploma holders from international schools access to the world’s 
        leading universities. the diploma programme’s grading system is criterion-referenced, 
        which means that each student’s performance is measured against well-defined 
        levels of achievement. these are consistent from one examination session 
        to the next and are applied equally to all schools.the ibo has shown, 
        over the course of 30 years, that students are well prepared for university 
        work. they are accepted by universities in more than 110 countries.
since 1971, italian and non-italian students who have taken their ib 
        diploma at ib and international schools outside italy have regularly been 
        accepted by italian universities according to a regulation set by the 
        direzione generale per l'istruzione universitaria, ministero della pubblica 
        istruzione (mpi). 
        on 30 october 1986, the italian parliament approved a law of recognition, 
        no. 738, granting full recognition for the purposes of university entry 
        to the ib diploma provided the following conditions are fulfilled: 
international school students taking the ib diploma at any national or 
        international school which appears on a list published by the decree of 
        the mpi, enjoy the full legal rights granted to the holder of the italian 
        maturita, e.g. university recognition, the right to postpone military 
        service or apply for appointment to the italian civil service. for inclusion 
        on the list, schools must apply on an individual basis to the ministry 
        of education, providing documents which prove their competence to award 
        the ib diploma. 
since 1993 the law has become fully operational. schools that wish to 
        guarantee full recognition for ib students in italy should apply for inclusion 
        on the list of recognised schools established by the ministry to: 
direzione generale / scambi culturali div. iii
        ministero della pubblica istruzione
        viale trastevere
        it - roma
        italy
        ib diplomas must be legalised at the italian consulate in geneva, after 
        which students can register directly at the university. 
1994 - no notification of any changes since 1994.
