safesubscribe protection






















































the fern factory is a family owned and operated business established in 1990, and located in anaheim hills, california. like many plant lovers, our fern growing hobby became our family business. acquiring exotic plants proved to be a challenge, prompting us to grow our own ferns from spores and seeds. this proved to be a successful venture, enabling us to expand to the current greenhouses pictured on this web site. our rarest fern species are still grown in our own backyard.the fern factory offers a wide variety of staghorn ferns, as well as other types of rare  ferns.
