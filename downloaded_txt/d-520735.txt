mississippi department of mental health
the mississippi department of mental health is committed to making available a comprehensive system of services and supports so all mississippians have access to the least restrictive and most appropriate level of services and supports that will meet their needs. our system is person-centered and is built on the strengths of individuals and families while meeting their needs for special services. services should be provided on a continuum of where the person is at that time and what their needs are.
inspiring hope, helping individuals on their road to recovery, and improving resiliency are key factors to the success of the people we serve.



mississippi’s mental health service delivery system is comprised of three major components:


state-operated programs and community service programs
regional community mental health centers
other nonprofit/profit service agencies/organizations.











where to go
a variety of services for mental health, intellectual/developmental disabilities, and alcohol and drug addiction is available across the state. please contact the certified provider directly regarding availability of services.
