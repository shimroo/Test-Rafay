as museums and their collections change


september 16, 2023

vintage photo of the british museum







when public museums came to be in the late 19th and early 20th centuries they were primarily formed to be a repository for items and artifacts that people had collected on travels or through organized expeditions. the intention was to gather these artifacts for further study. eventually these institutions morphed into places for the display of the collections that not only scholars, but also the public could come to see. that brings us to the large museums we know today with their dynamic programing and money generating entertainment.










a section of the display of parthenon statuary at the british museum





the methods for storage, reckoning with the histories and acquisition of objects, and our present world have not kept pace with each other. i visited the british museum as part of a summer program through my university and of course, we were there to se the parthenon statues (which were already controversial in the 80’s). however, what i was shocked by was a trip to a small storage room on the lower level of the museum. there our professor was excited to show us was row upon row of ancient pieces of greek statuary fragments just laying around on shelves. there was no visible organization of the items or any identifying information. this all came to mind this morning as i read this new york times article about the recent discovery of the long time theft of pieces from the collection by a curator. my point is that security and the organization and maintenance of many museum’s collections are sorely in need of examination and updating. in some cases, they have more in common with your kitchen’s junk drawer than not. also, if you have so much in the collection that you cannot secure or maintain it, perhaps dispersing (or returning) some of it is not a bad idea - maybe take a look at the konmari  method?

homage to bleroit by robert delaunay, 1914.in 1909  bleroit was the first person to cross the english channel in an airplane. delaunay wanted to capture this moment that he saw as the dawning of a new age of modern man. he uses a modern method of   painting the scene (notice the eiffel tower in the background) because to use a more straightforward or realistic representation would not have done justice to the new technology.

the hydra of madison avenue by todd schorr, 2001this work is a trip down memory lane with a message about mass consumerism and madison avenue advertising. how many logos do you recognize? schorr's detailed and beautifully colorful paintings have been  aptly called neosurrealist

dawn by odd nerdrum.when i was working at the joslyn art museum in the 1991 i saw the work of odd nerdrum for the first time and was struck at how it seemed old and new at the same time. i recognized references to artists of the northern school and caravaggio, but it was also so contemporary as art seemed to be moving toward a return to realism.

maurice prendergast, landscape with figures, 1921.originally posted in 2010.i am currently getting ready to make a trip up to nova scotia and québec and in looking-up canadian artists i discovered that one of my favorites, maurice prendergast was born in st. john, newfoundland. his family eventually settled in boston and he was part of the ashcan school but usually with a lighter tone, a brighter palette, and a more abstract hand.

sailor's valentine.the story goes that 19th century sailors made these for their loved ones while they were out at sea, but in reality most of them were made by women on the islands that the sailors visited and they brought them back to their homes. regardless of who made them they became treasured items and many different examples have survived. they are still being created today using the traditional methods.

burn by kara walker, 1998.kara walker takes a close look at race in america and makes strong statements about what she sees. in this instance, her artwork is done as a silhouette and at first glance may not seem to be a harsh a look as it really is; her use of a traditional and mostly innocuous medium makes her message even stronger.
