we always have a great time at trinity lake. glad to see that the marina has new ownership, as everything already looks better compared to the last few years.

rented a boathouse for the day. loaded all our stuff, got instructions in driving it and we were off. the boathouse was clean and met all of our needs. would recommend and do it again.
