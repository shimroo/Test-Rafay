leave this field empty if you're human: 
















the venues that make up the boston area coffeehouse association are intimate, friendly, informal, smoke-free places to hear the best of contemporary and traditional folk music. each venue is non-profit and volunteer-run, with surprisingly reasonable ticket prices. most serve hot and cold beverages of the season and tempting home-baked desserts.
