hello, betty!



the indie rock trio betty is alyson palmer (vocals, bass, guitar), elizabeth ziff (vocals, guitar, electronic programming) and her sister, amy ziff (vocals and cello). together they create energetic live shows that mix music, performance art, politics and comedy. the trio has been performing together since 1986, after a fateful night at the legendary 9:30 club set them off on a wild, decades-long adventure.betty sings of joy, love, longing, lust, food, heartbreak, and the universal hilarity of human existence. more than a band, betty uses music to channel their unquenchable passion for representation, fairness and equality. from the start, they’ve blended their voices for causes they fight for, their talents in collaboration with other artists of every medium, and their time in support of women, girls, and marginalized communities, worldwide.
