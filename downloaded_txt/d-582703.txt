“amongst my favorites  of the emerging new american filmmakers is michael dennis.” — jonathan demme, oscar winner for the silence of the lambsstoryteller. historian. archivist. reelblack founder michael j. dennis is an award-winning filmmaker, curator, and media host based in philadelphia, pa. a graduate of both nyu’s tisch school of the arts and the american film institute conservatory, his short films and documentaries have screened globally. he has worked with chris rock, ava duvernay, oprah winfrey, bill cosby, and the hudlin brothers. the recipient of the cnn ireport film festival grand jury prize and two-time pew fellowship finalist, mike has curated film festivals since 1994, when he was hired by todd phillips (joker) and andrew gurland (the last exorcism) to bring rusty cundieff’s fear of a black hat to the new york underground film festival. his passion and knowledge of black film has opened many doors. the monthly screening series, reelblack presents (2003-2019), helped introduce local audiences to the work of chinonye chukwu, pete chatmon, and matthew a. cherry and showcased restorations of classics like wattstax and sidewalk stories. reelblack tv (2006 - now), captured interviews and music performances with artists like spike lee, janelle monae, issa rae, patrice o’neal, and dick gregory.  reelblack radio (co-hosted w/ stephanie renee on wurd-am/fm from 2014-2018) offered irreverent takes on current events and gave local listeners the opportunity to chat with legends like byron allen, bill duke, bruce w. smith, and julie dash. as president of the philadelphia film and video association and founding member of both councilman david oh’s black film advisory committee and ava duvernay’s array, he worked diligently to develop infrastructure for independent filmmakers. among mike’s favorite things are lindt chocolates, the spook who sat by the door (both the book and the movie), mr. t and anything james brown.  his favorite american filmmakers (in order) are spike lee, michael schultz, jonathan demme john hughes, george roy hill, billy wilder and preston sturges. he strives to deliver experiences that make it feel good to be black. every single day. 














 












“mike was a tremendous accomplice to my early efforts of disruptive film distribution. i salute him and reelblack on the spectacular work and the legacy of beautiful movies he delivered to us all.”— ava duvernay, emmy award winner for 13th














 












“reelblack is definitely the best channel on youtube.”— erictheyounggawd, celebrity interviewer/youtube personalityour youtube platform began in july 2006 as an extension of our popular phillycam show, reelblack tv. in addition to original short films, concert videos and documentaries, we curate and preserve film and video reflective of the black experience that would otherwise fall through the cracks of the digital divide. unapologetically black,  mike d. and film historian charles woods have collectively spent over nine decades studying and collecting black movies.














 












“honestly my brother, your channel is my favorite youtube channel! keep providing that true history and great content for our community.”— nick cannon, comedian, entrepreneur and activist














 












preserving legacy.history repeats when we don’t understand our past. despite the increase in representation of all voices in media, how often is there justice?  it is our belief that black audiences deserve the same catharsis through art as the dominant culture.  and while we are well on our way, too many of us have not had access to knowing the paths and obstacles others have taken on the road to success. we have been fortunate to catch many (now) well-known artists at the early stages of their careers (chris rock, john legend, alice smith), and done interviews with elders like dick gregory, ruby dee, ivan dixon, woodie king and paul mooney. we want to inspire, not simply project aspiration. to reach the mountaintop, we all must do more than dream. that’s why we share truth.
