modular homes: a smart way to build
for the quality minded and cost conscious house buyer, our modular home construction is without a doubt, the construction method of choice. our homes are better built than the vast majority of stick-built homes. since our modular homes must be transported on the highways, we go beyond the conventional construction requirements that are used to site build a house. we also use a stronger construction technique to build our homes and are very selective in the materials we use. our state-of-the-art production facilities, quality control personnel and our on going research and development technology allow us to offer a quality, energy efficient home without sacrificing amenities, at an affordable cost.
