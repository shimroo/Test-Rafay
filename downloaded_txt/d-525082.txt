public records


you would think that finding public records would be extremely easy now that we have the internet and mobile devices. hop online, search for the record you’re looking and presto! only that’s not how it works. unfortunately, most access to public records involves a government office or agency and the government does not have a very good track record when it comes to building websites. in all fairness though, public records are incredibly fragmented. there are literally thousands of different local offices that are tasked with storing, maintaining and providing access to all sorts of crazy different types of public records. this is why the process of getting the public record you want can be so difficult. prstore.com exists to try and help make that process a little easier. we discuss the current regulations and news involving public records. we also provide access to an online public records search service to help you find the information you’re looking for.
