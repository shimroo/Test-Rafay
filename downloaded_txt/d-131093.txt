report highlights rrc progress on designating critical energy infrastructure.





a new report from commission shift and texans for public justice finds
 that most facilities on the natural gas supply chain have been 
designated critical. poor agency record keeping procedures leave 
questions about which facilities have been granted or denied exceptions 
to critical infrastructure designation. confidentiality requirements leave the public 
in the dark about which facilities will actually be required to be 
weatherized, while a handful of private companies enjoy special access to 
regulators and the electricity supply chain map.access the new report at commission shift.
