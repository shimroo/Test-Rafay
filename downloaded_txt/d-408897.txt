the university of massachusetts 
        boston is partnering with three school districts to support and enrich 
        existing science curricula and help implement more advanced science instructional 
        systems. the neponset watershed will provide an experiential framework 
        to contextualize curriculum content. using a natural boundary (a watershed) 
        as an integrating theme will demonstrate to students that communities 
        of diverse socio-economic backgrounds have many commonalities and natural 
        connections.
