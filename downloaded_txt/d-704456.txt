rooted in northwest adventure since 1989as legend has it, explorers lewis and clark noticed a ridge resembling an overturned canoe on their historic 1805 columbia river journey. today, that landmark is known as canoe ridge vineyard, the namesake location of one of washington state's most recognized wine producers. first established in the horse heaven hills in 1989, our walla walla-based winery soon followed in 1994. today, we celebrate nearly four decades of crafting award-winning wines that embody the natural beauty and terroir of the pacific northwest.

bone-dry deserts, upriver winds, and long sunny days create the perfect conditions for growing wine grapes in the horse heaven hills. perched on a breathtaking ridge above the roaring columbia river, our own-rooted vines cover the landscape of eastern washington.
