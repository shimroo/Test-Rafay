statewide california earthquake centerour mission is to develop and share cutting-edge earthquake system science to enhance california’s resilience and to educate and inspire future scientists. 








 











scec is now statewidethe statewide california earthquake center builds on scec’s legacy of leveraging cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary collaborations, and a systems-level approach. scec now focuses on the entire san andreas fault system which allows us to:address key science questions in a broader tectonic context,strengthen partnerships across disciplines to improve earthquake science and hazard analysis, andengage a wider range of participants, from academia and government to the public.about scec | new branding 





 





our natural laboratoryscec’s study area now spans the entire pacific-north american plate boundary, from western nevada to the borderlands offshore, and from baja california to cape mendocino. the extensive regional geophysical networks and direct access to major faults of the san andreas fault system opens up new research avenues.

statewide california earthquake center (scec)with funding from the national science foundation, u.s. geological survey, and other sources, scec collaborates with academic, government, industry, and other organizations to: (1) gather and analyze data from field observations and laboratory experiments. (2) develop system-level models and simulations of earthquake processes to synthesize knowledge as a physics-based understanding of seismic hazard. (3) communicate that understanding to expand knowledge and reduce earthquake risk. 








 



earthquake system science and innovationscec integrates new research and technologies to enhance predictive system-level models and simulations to synthesize knowledge and quantify seismic hazards.
