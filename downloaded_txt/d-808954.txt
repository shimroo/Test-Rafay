 learn how you can help prisoners find transformation out of their sins.














helping turn chains to change through jesus.since 1973, arm prison outreach exists, to take the gospel of jesus behind prison bars, so prisoners find transformation out of their sins. believing every person is created in the image of god, that image is not erased because a crime was committed. the marred image of god in prisoners waits to hear of a god with a love strong enough to give freedom to them.they wait to hear about a savior with the power and the truth that can restore and repurpose lives burdened with guilt and shame from their past. each year, people like you help arm proclaim jesus to prisoners.    *  sending 17,000 bibles into 195 prisons.   *  providing over 18,000 bible studies to prisoners through the american bible academy correspondence courses.    *  sending 3.5 million dayspring christian greeting cards into prisons to help prisoners to stay connected with family back home.    *  nearly 45,000 prisoners were baptized into christ in one of arm's 1800 baptistries in prisons around the us. through the partnership of arm, prison outreach, and our generous ministry partners, we are growing the church behind prison bars.














how you help work for change
