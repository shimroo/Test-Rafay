testimonials



“there is a fallacy in which san antonio is not a film-friendly city. on the contrary, i've seen safilm challenge this head-on. safilm has worked diligently to demonstrate that not only does san antonio welcome the film industry, we want to earn our spot on a national & international scene. safilm works to bring "film awareness" in the public & private sectors, but also to children. safilm takes that to heart by sharing & teaching the gift of films & the arts.”— jr treviño//mayor of castle hills



“every festival that adapts to the world's climate no matter what should get highlighted. 2020 has been a year for change and adaptation. safilm was one of them. hopeful and enthusiastic, the safilm team made sure to give the filmmakers a home to screen their projects. great fest!”— alejandro montoya marin



“safilm provides opportunities for local filmmakers and inspires new filmmakers by providing them an annual venue to connect with industry professionals, visiting guests and to learn more about the film industry. safilm offers free workshops coordinated with the texas film commission. this event has been providing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for our local filmmakers, as well as delighting the general public who been attending the festival in growing numbers of the years.”— jackie earle haley // actor-director
