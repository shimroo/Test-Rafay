vacation & travel guide to playa 
			del carmen, 
tulum and the riviera maya, 
			mexico.

this website can act as your travel agent and tour guide. we can help you 
plan a wonderful vacation to the caribbean coast, 
the riviera maya, mexico.

			we 
live, work and play in beautiful 

			playa del
			carmen, mexico (the heart of the 
mayan riviera) and can share with you our first hand knowledge and opinions of 
some of its hidden treasures.

you can make 

			hotel reservations and book tours directly on the site. we have 
carefully selected accommodations:

			hotels,

			condos, 
			cabanas, as well as, highly recommended
			scuba diving centers,
			eco tours, 
			fishing and other 
			activities, 
			restaurants, 
			transportation and some general tips and advice.

the areas we cover are throughout the riviera maya corridor which includes the 
coastline starting south of cancun and ending in 
tulum 
(tulum is famous for their mayan ruins and their romantic secluded 
			beachfront 
cabanas). 
			in between this approximately 90 minute drive stretch of crystal blue 
water coast, you will find puerto morelos, 
			playa del carmen (where we live and 
love it!), puerto aventuras and akumal.
as we find special places and things during our own adventures, we add our 
favorites to the site. we are happy to give you all the information we can along 
with our personal opinions about anything we have experienced here.
