welcome to christ the king catholic church

we, the children of god, claimed in baptism and profession of faith, are members of the roman catholic church as the parish of christ the king.​we seek to realize the kingdom of god as the body of christ, spreading the gospel message, striving to live the paschal mystery through the sacramental life of his church.
