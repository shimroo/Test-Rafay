donate online,via text or ipad 



 



							not everyone carries cash, and fewer and fewer folks use checks. so, to respond to the needs of our parish members, the parish council approved three digital ways to make financial offerings.						



							1) ipad. transactions can be made very simply on the candle desk ipad (an attendant can assist you if needed). click the screen, then click the giving category you are interested in, swipe your credit card, make the approval, and youâre done. it is as easy as paying for gas for your car.						



							2) text giving. enter 707-701-5052 in to your text message app on your cell phone, indicate an amount you want to give (for example, $25). a prompt will open your browser and you indicate which giving category (tithes, icons, charity, etc.) you would like, enter your card info, and youâre done.						



							3) phone app. download the connectnow giving app on your cell phone.
