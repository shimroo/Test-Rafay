help stop fraud in state government
the maryland general assembly's office 
                            of legislative audits operates a toll-free 
                            fraud hotline to receive allegations of 
                            fraud and/or abuse of state government 
                            resources. information reported to the 
                            hotline in the past has helped to eliminate 
                            certain fraudulent activities and protect 
                            state resources.
