about netsmartz


since 1998, ncmec has operated the cybertipline, a place where the public and electronic service providers can report suspected online and offline child sexual exploitation. the millions of reports made each year uniquely situate ncmec to identify trends and create prevention resources to address the evolving needs of kids and teens online. 
netsmartz is ncmec's online safety education program. it provides age-appropriate videos and activities to help teach children be safer online with the goal of helping children to become more aware of potential online risks and empowering them to help prevent victimization by making safer choices on- and offline.
