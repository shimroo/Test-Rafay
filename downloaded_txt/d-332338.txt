the georgetown chorale celebrates the joy of singing, cultivates musical excellence, and supports positive transformation in the lives of our singers and the communities we serve. the georgetown chorale’s 2024-2025 season will feature all of these composers and more!  





































thanks for a great concert! our annual winter concert on december 7 at church of the epiphany was a huge success!  our thanks to all the supporters of the chorale who attended and luxuriated in the sounds we produced.  join us on may 4 for our spring benefit concert at national presbyterian church.the board of directors announced recently that the beneficiary for our season will be the genout youth chorus.  genout youth chorus is the dc area’s only vocal ensemble for lgbtq+ and allied youth, ages 13-18. genout’s mission is to give young lgbtq+ and allied youth a voice and to connect that voice to community. singers in genout are leaders in the movement to promote and protect the rights of lgbtq+ people. they offer themselves as symbols and spokespersons for the struggle against discrimination and for equality. they lend their voices to messages of acceptance, and affirmation, and love, and they offer their faces to the image of what the world can be.
