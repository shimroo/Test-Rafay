welcome to the dakota mailing list home page!  (est. fall 1995)  this page is (not surprisingly)
a part of the dakota mailing list, though it also contains other general info.  
any comments or suggestions would certainly
be appreciated!  please note that i cannot answer dakota questions, as i 
am really, really busy, and i probably wouldn't know the answer anyway.  :-)
if you have questions you'd like 
answered, i invite you to subscribe to the mailing list and ask the people
who really know what they're talking about.  its painless and free,
so why not take advantage of the resource?  enjoy!
