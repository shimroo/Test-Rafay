              the rescue
              but god in heaven looked down on earth, 
              and heard the maiden's prayer;
              the engine bell clanged loudly out;-
              a fireman's quickly there.

"i
        provide a faceless, nameless service 
        to a community that rarely knows
        how much they need me. 
        if i am called from a sound sleep to sacrifice my life,
        attempting to save the life or property 
        of someone i do not know ... i will
        do so without regret." (written by firefighter jon mcduffie,
        excerpted from "the heart behind the hero")
