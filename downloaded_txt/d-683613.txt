zen is finding our true nature and living it
zen island fellowship began in 2002 at the unitarian universalist fellowship in galveston.  in april 2014, we moved into our own dedicated meditation space, the healing furnace zendo. our mission is to come together to in silence to support each other’s practice and awakening.  our local teacher is cara junje geary.our guiding teacher is zen master dae gak who travels to galveston from the furnace mountain zen retreat center in kentucky to lead 3-day silent retreats every six months.  many students have taken the 16 precepts with him. all are welcome to join us for our weekly meditation sessions or our retreats.  sporadically, we host 'introduction to zen' or 'introduction to meditation' workshops.  please see our schedule for these opportunities.   there is no fee to come and join us at our weekly sessions, however, donations allow us to support activities such as retreat scholarships.zif contacts:to join our mailing list and receive announcements about zif activities, please click the email icon above.  please know that your email will not be distributed, and that our emails are relatively infrequent.for questions, comments or to register for an upcoming event, please also use the email icon above
