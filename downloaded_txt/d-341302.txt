      inman 
"dog paintings 
      that live and breathe" 


 collectors 
        around the world prize roger inman's originals and limited edition prints. 
        
roger's 
        paintings of dog breeds in their natural settings win persistent acclaim 
        in the uk and the usa. each breed's temperament or history is captivatingly 
        illustrated in roger's perceptive and absorbing works of art.  
born 
        in the west riding of yorkshire, england in 1948, roger began his lifetime 
        artistic career at huddersfield art school. leaving academia in 1969, 
        roger traveled to florence to study independently and further develop 
        his talent in the environment of the renaissance masters and their works.
roger 
        spent ten years traveling in europe and africa, creating his magnificent 
        landscapes and seascapes while exhibiting periodically in florence, barcelona 
        and valencia. during this time roger enhanced his striking use of light, 
        form, and composition to render truly splendid pastels and oils. 
today, 
        having returned to his native yorkshire, roger is creating his superb 
        landscapes as informative backgrounds for his exciting canine breed studies-dogs 
        that seem to live and breathe.
