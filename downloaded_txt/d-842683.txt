                    at dorsey family homes, building superior quality homes has been a family tradition for over 40 years.
during that time we have been more concerned with "how well" we build each of our homes rather than "how many" homes we build.

thanks mitch,the home has been great and we really appreciate your selling it to us. it is a great design and very comfortable, nice high ceilings, my wife loves the kitchen layout and the garage is nice and roomy and it is easy to get the groceries into the house. i personally love the carpet and the nice wide stairwells, high ceilings, the transoms and other woodworking details. the 10% down with no pmi made it all possible for us and owning this brand new home in howard county just up the street from main street has literally been a dream come true. everyone was so professional and because of the quality of the product, we do not have anything to complain about, it was very pleasant to work with you as well and we wish you all the best.
