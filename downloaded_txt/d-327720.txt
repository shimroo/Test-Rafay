the top new mexico ski resort
new mexico, a surprising contender as a top ski state in the us has been a best-kept secret. there are several mountains with elevations over 12,000 feet that receive impressive amounts of snow when a storm rolls through. plus, you’ll have great weather to ski or snowboard in with new mexico’s classic blue skies. neighboring states tend to steal the crowds of avid skiers and snowboarders while likely breaking their bank. affordability is just another perk you’ll find here. ski apache has 11 lifts and an annual snowfall of over 15 feet. come check out our beautiful new mexico ski resort with terrain for beginners to advanced.







the mountain is waiting

              as a year-round playground and premier new mexico ski resort, ski apache offers the best warm-weather powder skiing in the world and fun activities for the entire family. take in the breathtaking views of the sierra blanca mountains on new mexico’s only 8-passenger gondola, get your adrenaline pumping on the apache wind rider ziptour or take the scenic route through our network of hiking and mountain biking trails.
