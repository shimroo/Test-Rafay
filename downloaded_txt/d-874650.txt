episode 431- what tech gift would you get for yourself?





                this week on techtalkradiom justin, shawn, and andy discuss tech gifts, personal projects, and listener questions. justin shares his preference for buying tech gifts for himself, while shawn talks about his ongoing family photo archiving project using the epson ff680 photo scanner. the team also covers converting vhs tapes to digital, with shawn recommending a vhs-to-hard-drive converter and a time-based corrector and andy also recommending the diamond multimedia converter 




              justin updates the crew on project zomboid, mentioning his recent voiceover work for a game mod. andy expresses interest in the game, available on steam, and justin highlights its low system requirements and engaging gameplay.




              the team breaks down sony’s recent 24-hour outage and revisits the 2011 sony hack, which compromised 77 million playstation accounts. this leads to a discussion on data security, warning against free credit monitoring services that can waive legal rights. they also share tips on using multiple email addresses to track potential data breaches.




              a listener asks if a home-based business needs a website or if social media is enough. justin shares his experience with wix for an affordable, all-in-one solution. the team agrees that a website adds professionalism and stability, especially when paired with strong social media strategies.




              another listener wants to convert windows media files to other formats. shawn recommends handbrake, vlc player, and ffmpeg for free, reliable conversions, explaining the benefits of each. the team also touches on adobe media encoder and roxio creator, with mp4 suggested as the best format for compatibility.

justin and andy compare health tracking devices. justin prefers the oura ring over the pixel watch, noting its fsa eligibility for savings. andy highlights the new apple powerbeats pro 2, which monitor heart rate during workouts. the team also discusses sleep apnea detection and arrhythmia monitoring in both the oura ring and apple watch.

finally, they share their browser and extension preferences. justin dislikes chrome’s heavy resource usage and recommends firefox, edge, and opera instead. shawn agrees but acknowledges chrome’s work compatibility. andy shares his experience with internet connection monitor, while shawn mentions using adblock plus.
