					visitor remembers lalannes

					 

thank you for presenting this 
					interesting article on elaine lalanne.  to be frank, i 
					didnt know that much about jacks wife, but she is 
					certainly a model of the phrase, behind every great man is 
					a great woman.
my earliest memory of jack lalanne is 
					as a toddler watching him on a round picture tube zenith 
					television in the mid-1950s.  i remember the organ music 
					which accompanied his routines, often using chairs as 
					training aids . . . simple routines anyone could use.  im 
					sure he was the darling of housewives seeking to stay trim 
					in those days.
im pleased to hear shes produced a 
					book and about the documentary and i look forward to them.

					cheers from canada
happy new year to you 
					and your family, clarence. 
i hope that 2025 brings much 
					health and happiness to you all - and thank you for  
					your inspiration through the years.
i have followed your 
					work with admiration and applied many of your principles 
					to my fitness journey. 
at 61, i applaud everything you have 
					brought to so many and personally want to thank you for your 
					contribution to my life. 
its a long road and there are 
					hurdles but we continue onward.
cheers and happiness 
jeff todd, victoria, canada 

					 



					long time norway followers

					 

i have followed you about 30 
					years, the way you do what you do has always pointed in a 
					good direction.  it has meant a lot not just to me, but 
					my family and many friends.

					 

it's like that to this day. 
					

					 

you two are the best.

					 

jo andersen, norway

					 



					aussi love
i have been 
					reading your material since you wrote for muscle &  fitness 
					in the 1990s.
					 
i have a decent sized gym in my physiotherapy 
					practice here in australia. we train our patients 1-2 a week 
					using the high intensity method. 
					 
most of our patients who 
					are doing the strength training are over 40, with our eldest 
					being 91. i have seen amazing results with them. 
thank you for all the great work you 
					have done in promoting a healthy lifestyle. you are 
					inspirational. 
regards, 
mark 




					walk the walk

 

i want to 
					thank you for being an inspiration to a generation of people 
					seeking good health and fitness. 

 

you have 
					always gone above and beyond resistance training to include 
					lifestyle practices and encouragement to maximize our 
					potential.

 

more than 
					anything, you live what you propose, you walk the walk and 
					that is what i and so many other readers find most 
					inspiring.

 

i will be 70 
					years old in a few months and following your principles, i 
					continue to be fit, mentally sharp, and living a productive 
					life working for a high-tech company leading a team of 
					professionals. 

 

thank you 
					for everything you do.  in more ways than you will ever 
					know, you have made my life better. 

 

best wishes 
					always to you and carol.

mind & body benefit
i 
					want to let you know of my son's progress in resistance 
					training (age 28) and his interest in your lifes work.
					
long 
					story short, he dabbled in running in his late teens and 
					found it monotonous. 
he 
					then started following me to the ymca and got hooked on 
					resistance training. 
he 
					has read many of your commentaries and applied your 
					philosophy to his regular regimen, with great results.
					
it 
					is not just his realization of how good it feels physically, 
					he completely embraces the huge impact it has on his mental 
					health.

					thank you once again for your knowledge over the years that 
					has benefited me, and now my son.
regards, 
jeff


lawyer to lawyer


					i'm a lifetime lifter: weight training non stop since i was 
					19.  ill be 66 next month. 


					like you i'm a lawyer (still practicing). 


					i want to thank you for all your great work in fitness. i 
					have read several of your books and read your updates 
					religiously every month. 


					you are a treasure.  many thanks for disseminating 
					logical, easy to understand training and nutrition advice.


					sincerely,

fitness and father time

im 68 years old but 
					feel much younger, though sprinting and walking long distance 
					are no longer comfortable. 
thankfully, i can row, cycle, and 
					strength train, though squatting is a little uncomfortable.
for the first time in my life, im understanding that father 
					time is there to stay. 
					
still, except for the hip arthritis, worsened eyesight, and 
					prostate enlargement, i feel similar to when i was much 
					younger. 
im fit, mentally sharp, and spiritually 
					minded.  
ive spent countless hours over the 
					years exploring fitness sites. yours has always been one of 
					the best.
thank you!
steve



a way of life


it is with great 
					pleasure that i address you as the best natural athlete in 
					the history of bodybuilding.
youre a beacon in 
					todays world, full of fast fixes and shortcuts that 
					inevitably lead to frustration and failure.
ive been a follower of 
					your craft for many years - you taught me how to find a 
					path, a way of life, that develops more than muscle, rather 
					one that nourishes both the physical and the spiritual.
thank you for the new photos at 86.

respite from the storm



i want to thank you both for the 
					tremendous fitness insights and encouragement you have 
					provided over the years.  while the 
					fitness industry becomes louder and more 
					confusing, you have been a source of 
					consistent and sensible advice that centers around actual 
					experience rather than theoretical extrapolations.  

whenever i need a respite from the storm i turn to your 
					website and books--more  
					than ever at 70.

new perspective on aging



i have followed you for over 30 years 
					(i'm 73 now).  you shocked me at age 50 when i 
					saw a photo of you while 
					walking through a bookstore that completely reshaped my 
					perspective on the possibilities for healthy aging.  

david



evolutionary basis


i think you have 
					intuitively and experimentally created a modern version of 
					the hunter gatherer physical activity regimen in your 
					overall approach. there appears to be a valid evolutionary 
					basis for what you do!
wade


no bs
it is so great to see you guys still 
					sharing this life changing information!  and it 
					is beyond amazing to see clarence maintain such peak fitness 
					and health into his 80s!
since the late 80s when we first read 
					clarences columns in muscle & fitness, we have been 
					huge fans of the common sense, no bs approach to nutrition, 
					resistance training, and cardiovascular conditioning.
keep up the great work.  
some of your 
					biggest fans,
keats and franz



help with depression
hope you are ok and 
					training good still.  i'm 62 today and just thought i'd say 
					thank you for all your help with my depression.  
who knows maybe i 
					wouldnt be here if it wasn't for your help.  
david

					 


more inspired
clarence has been 
					an inspiration for me going back to my early teenage years 
					and even more so now.  thank you both.
frank


the message
totally agree 
					with your article (on alzheimer's). as an example in belgium 
					the actress alice toen who is 99 and still acting.  so 
					staying physically and mentally active is the message.
robert


wellspring of wisdom


your articles and books have given me a wellspring of  
					cold refreshing water over the years. (i'm 38)     
					 


it's always a 
					pleasure to read your thoughts, insights, and, most notably:
					wisdom.  


between you and leonard schwartz, i'm always in good 
					company:  


i keep your books beside my platos, aristotles, and 
					aquinases.  


i've always admired the greek ideal of mind-body 
					and maintained the crossroad of beauty, proportions, and the 
					good as strands in a great web of gossamer; you pluck one 
					strand, and the whole substance jiggles.
andrew 


the real deal


clarence, you are informative and 
					inspirational.  


the real deal!  


you have persevered and been 
					genuine.  


i appreciate you and your wife. not a flash in the 
					pan but an example of growth and progress.  


you learn and 
					share. those who want to advance will read, discern and 
					apply appropriately.  


im grateful you research, publish and 
					pass it on.  


keep it up till the finish line!  


brian


engaged in life


i  
					have contradictory thoughts on aging.  


i think 
					about death a lot, but i'm fully engaged 
					in life.  


i remain 
					stronger than most men,


i remain 
					intellectually involved in what's happening in the world (as 
					grim as that is much of the time).  


my reading comprehension is as good as it ever has been.  


my 
					sense of humor remains strong.  


and 
					i'm again focusing on my previously published writings. 
					 

what more could i ask for!


jerry


walking for life
thank you for 
					all that you and clarence do.  i 
					am a senior coming back from a bad accident resulting in a 
					long icu stay.  
you introduced me to walking, which is life 
					changing.  before i thought i had to run.  now 
					that i cant 
					run walking has really helped me.
rick


website a treasure trove
thank you for 
					your disciplined dedication as well as publicly documented 
					fitness journey.  the website alone is a treasure trove for 
					the novice to the advanced practitioner.

customer for life
i just want to touch base and let 
					you know the package arrived as scheduled and to thank you 
					and the team for providing such outstanding customer 
					service.  i really appreciated the personalized email you 
					sent and for providing the tracking information; but i was 
					even more blown away to see the bonus gift and personalize, 
					hand-written, messages in the books!  you and the team are 
					first-class all the way and i want you to know how grateful 
					i am for that.  you got a customer for life!

a wellness doctor
thank you so much for 
				signing my book and for including another book for free! i have 
				already devoured both books, and receiving them made my week! 
i also want to share that i am currently a medical student 
				planning to pursue a career as a preventative medicine 
				physician. 
i attribute my decision to pursue this path to my 
				early exposure to clarence's writing back when i was in high 
				school. 
it is from reading about clarence's experience at the 
				cooper clinic and learning about dr. arno jensen that i learned 
				that this is even a possible field to go into within medicine.
thank you again,
j w


the ripped literary formula
thank you so much for the 
				august 1 column. as is always the case the composition is such a 
				hopeful, accessible motivation. 
im taken with clarity of 
				your writing. state the need with evidence, link the supporting 
				literature, state the footnoted remedy filtered with your 
				current experience and show the photographic proof of your 
				results with a positive update on how you both live the message.
				
i dont know if its the 
				legal education, writing for weider or carols editing that does 
				it but the world of journalism would be a better place if theyd 
				follow your recipe.
anyway, im wishing you a 
				peaceful sunday and my deepest appreciation for all you do.
bart gallant

				 


reasoned, fact based approach


				i have always 
				used clarence as my north star. 


				for these many years you and clarence have 
				both not only talked the talk but you have walked the walk. you 
				both are wonderful examples of lives well lived and have served 
				as wonderful role models.  


				especially in these times of fake 
				news, i am especially appreciative of clarences reasoned, fact 
				based approach to life. 


				thank you both.

legendary strength coach speaks out

i am flying out to a

				i read them years ago and i am still convinced that these are 
				the best of the best. there is a new thing i see a lot:

				n=1

				clarence's story is one person but the honesty, so rare in this 
				industry, is illuminating.

the benchmark

having read your 
				latest article on ablation i thought id drop you a line to say 
				how uplifting that read was.  ive been following you for over 
				20 years and in that time have read  and continue to read  
				many, many articles on other sites about health and fitness, but 
				your site is the benchmark and the one i always return to..!  i 
				felt a real personal connection to you this time and am so happy 
				things have worked out well for you. 

all the best wishes from 
				the uk.

omg, he's still doing it



i will be turning 56 this year

and i find clarence bass, a name i

							back when i read muscle magazines. 
omg he is still

awesome!


							wow good job to both basses, inspiring! 


							thank you.

how & why


				i'm in the camp that appreciates your style: intelligence guided 
				by exercise focused research, and experience.  a good coach can 
				tell you what and how, and a great one can tell you why. 


				you help us educate and convince ourselves. 


				dave walsh


inspires and informs


				my own health situation is not dire but being born with one 
				kidney gives me motivation to protect it. 


				your approach saved me a lot of grief in my early 20s. my friends mostly 
				resided on nearby cattle farms. we were all eager to get bigger. some started 
				taking anabolic steroids they had access to for their cattle, 
				just guessing at dosages.


				i resisted my ego and the temptation to join my friends in 
				their experimentation, while reading about how clarence was the 
				leanest man in bodybuilding. 


				all it would have taken at that time is likely for me to pick up 
				the wrong magazine and peer pressure may have won the day. 
				clarence has followed science and keen observation to his credit 
				in pursuits of achievement of his potential. many lessons to be 
				taken from clarence that extend well beyond bodybuilding and 
				nutrition. what a great role model, more a healthy lifestyle!


				clarences contribution to bodybuilding, fitness and diet will 
				be welcomed reference materials in my home and a terrific 
				keepsake from a man who in many ways helped to construct a very 
				important body of work that i am sure has inspired and informed 
				many people. 


				that is not a small legacy.

thank you

 

i was on your website today reading 
				a few articles and want to thank you for your site and the knowledge you 
				provide.

 

you are a true gentleman and a 
				great credit to the physical culture and 
				health lifestyle.  long may you train and 
				enjoy

your life.  

				 

much respect,

ps:. challenge yourself is still my favorite book of yours. i 
				re-read it often. 


transformation
i stumbled upon your 
				name, mulling over a history of nutrition and bodybuilding. i'm 
				grateful for the wealth of knowledge and documentation that you 
				have amassed in one place. i've come to appreciate physical 
				fitness and autonomy on a deep personal level, moving from 350+ 
				pound morbid obesity to a fit young man with a passion for 
				movement. 
i've had to address 
				so many habits, coping mechanisms, and behaviors around food and 
				my body image, and your personal story was a breath of fresh 
				air. i'd like to personally thank you for being an advocate. for 
				advocating rest. for advocating doing what brings you joy, 
				enjoying food, enjoying life. i feel safer taking more rest and 
				less physical and emotional punishment in the name of an unreal 
				struggle for "never good enough." you are an inspiration and 
				pretty swell human. thank you for speaking your truth to the 
				world.

aging well

in 
				dec. 2019, i collapsed with blood clots in my lungs.  5 
				days in intensive care and i was back up, running and training 
				with weights in the gym.  drs. were amazed at how fit i was 
				for a 71 year old and barring the blood clots, my lungs and 
				heart were great.  i just told them that an even older 
				american gentleman who i have never met has been the inspiration 
				for me over many years.  they hadn't a clue what i was 
				talking about but, i thought this message would make you smile 
				and know that your lifetimes work is still helping people.

all the best - graham.


that's who i want to be like, then & now 

when i discovered your ripped 
				articles in the early 1980s as a young lifter, i remember 
				saying to myself, "that's who i want to look like when i'm 
				older."  well, now that i'm older (and bald), i've strived 
				for that health & look you always presented - for this, i am 
				forever grateful to you for your inspiration.
				thank you for your website, your eloquent writing and 
				keeping those of us in the "masters" generation updated on the 
				importance of health & strength as we age.  
				your writing on diet & weight 
				training all those decades ago in muscle & fitness 
				affected all of us who are now older - and we are better for it.  
				i do hope this finds you and your family safe during this trying 
				time in our nation's history.

				my best regards to you - joe daniels

hi clarence, just been browsing your site, 
				always loved your stuff, have your books, always read your

thanks for keeping honest bodybuilding

				thoughtful gesture

i am writing to thank you.  

i 
				got involved with some very bad people and 
				ended up in prison.  i followed the wrong guys and lost my 
				career. while in jail, i wrote to you  
				and you were kind enough to write back and include a 
				complimentary copy of one of your books.  

i found it to be 
				such a kind, thoughtful gesture and want to thank you for  
				it.  

i first saw you back in the early 80's in muscle magazines and followed you ever since. you are the jack lalanne of my generation. truly a gentleman, a 
				scholar, and an inspiration!


				appreciate openness

i 
				have been a fan of clarence and carol for almost 30 years now.  
				i like how open and real you are with your photos and even your 
				doctor & cooper clinic results.  you have been the #1 
				influence on how i train.  in fact, i was talking to a 
				friend at dinner tonight about some of the things you have 
				taught me over the years.  

thank you again for all you do.

np 
				in ohio


				happy birthday clarence!


				i really appreciate you 
				taking the time to share the results of your cooper  clinic 
				checkup.  of course, your "ageless" pictures speak for 
				themselves.  as a result, your life reflects solid 
				confirmation that your fitness and diet philosophy is right on!


				the best part of your sharing is that you tell it like it is 
				without altering the results.  your sincerity on the aging 
				process demonstrates your character makeup.  plus, your 
				writing style makes for a great narrative of who you are...a 
				super healthy individual.  thanks for your information 
				which encourages us all to keep focusing on our long term 
				health!

you definitely are an inspiration and motivator.

				thank you from english instructor

i'm now over 70 years young, been 
				training since 12 years old including army and police service as 
				an instructor; found out about your methods of training in the 
				1980s and have been an enthusiast for your methods ever since.

				i have received and delivered training all over europe working 
				with and for police and special forces.

all these organization's fitness 
				training programs are condensed in your core philosophy of 
				cardio, strength through resistance training, diet ,and above 
				all, keep at it and cycle the training program up and down to 
				allow recovery.

i like the way you embrace age and 
				training methods to suit real life. hence i believe your programs are 
				spot on and your acknowledgement of aging keeps my spirits high 
				and myself on the way to the gym. 

thank you for inspiring another 
				human being to live well.

all the best from england,
				graham lawrence

				international treasure

				clarence, let me just start out by saying i think you are one of 
				the most important human beings we have on the planet at the 
				moment. you have truly proven that what everyone thinks is not 
				possible, quite surely is. you are more muscular than most 
				people in their 20s. i know, that alone is freaking insane. 


				what is your secret, to that amazing lifetime of muscularity and 
				leanness? 


				you are truly incredible!!

hi matheus:
				

careful or i might start 
				believing it; carol warns against getting a big head.

to answer your query, my secret, 
				if there is one, is always looking for ways to improve; building 
				on success one step at a time. see outlook matters--my story:

gift of inspiration
hello mr. bass!  

i just wanted to tell you  i 
				used to fumble through the muscle magazines at least 25-30 years 
				ago and i'd see your face all the time. i was fascinated to see 
				you so ripped and healthy looking. you were the original of the 
				ripped guys and you inspired me tremendously to stay lean. 

 i'm 47 years young now and will 
				continue on with the legacy that you shared with the world. 

thank you sir for the gift of 
				"inspiration."

love from 
				denmark

hello clarence:
you are really an idol for me...
				i am sure it is true that lifestyle (eating whole foods 
				minimally processed and exercising regularly) has kept you at a 
				low body fat your whole life.  i mean, i would be 
				overjoyed, if i could stay at the 10-12 range for my life by 
				following your lifestyle tips.  
lots of love and support 
				from denmark!

				hey! from uk

just been looking through your website 
				while having my coffee on my night shift here in the uk. it's a 
				little after 0240hrs and i've been reading some articles on 
				vince gironda and looking through yours and frank zane's old 
				photos from back in the day!  i've gotta say bodybuilding 
				and physique has really lost  its way over the years. the 
				anabolics have completely ruined the physique. your conditioning 
				was insane clarence!  i mean you really came into your top 
				form in your 40's. you gotta love the fact you've held your 
				condition all these years. phenomenal physique and really 
				inspiring.  i think a lean athletic physique is the way to 
				go for sure! i'm 38 and seeing the levels of conditioning you 
				achieved after the age of 40 is something to behold.  
				thanks for the inspiration, and thanks for the great content on 
				your site also! 

good day to you sir!

 pharmacist thank you
i just want to drop you a short note of 
				thanks.  i'm a recently retired 70 year old pharmacist.  
				i first started reading your work way back in my old drugstore 
				days when i could steal a few minutes and goof off.  thanks 
				to you i'm still working out with high intensity and strength 
				training a few times a week as you recommend.  and i have 
				read all of your books.  i cannot tell you how valuable 
				your writing have been to me during my career as a working 
				pharmacist.  i knew i could always count on your 
				recommendations as being well researched and up to date.  i 
				hope i (we) have helped some patients along the way.  so i 
				just wanted to thank you and wish you continued health and a 
				long life.  i am sure there are many more people just like 
				me that feel the same way that i do.
with respect,
				bill neunder

perspective of a minimalist

				clarence:  at 59, i have spent my life making things 
				simple.  i have maintained a 5'10" 160 lb physique for 40 
				years.  i take no medicine, supplements or vitamins and 
				have a simple diet of fruit, vegetables, oats, rice, peanut 
				butter, yogurt and chicken.
my 
				workouts are just under 40 minutes 5 days a week and i use a 
				minimal of equipment along with bodyweight exercises (sit-ups, 
				ab wheel roll outs, pull ups, push ups and dips).  i have 
				good muscularity and flexibility along with a resting pulse of 
				50 and average bp of 120/65.
i 
				have been inspired by jack lalanne and clarence bass.  my 
				success in marriage, family and business is in many ways 
				attributable to my fitness and i can credit my fitness to my 
				spartan home gym and simple exercise regime.

				thanks for being an inspiration and like jack lalanne before you 
				a national treasure.

				good afternoon.  nice to meet you via e-mail.  i have 
				followed your career in bodybuilding and bought one of your 
				books, challenge yourself.  the book was very well 
				written and informative.  


				you truly provide superb scientific information and wonderful 
				practical knowledge to us the readers and followers.  at 58 
				and heading toward the "golden years," it is very reassuring to 
				have all the information you provide.  it is also inspiring 
				to see that with hard work and sensible eating patterns you can 
				be healthy and strong later in life.

				i am incorporating many of the principles you discuss, such as 
				walking.  i have two medium sized dogs and except for 
				lightning, i walk them every day for two to three miles, do one 
				intense cardiovascular sessions a week and two full body 
				sessions of weightlifting a week, with one being traditional 
				lifting and the other being more circuit training.  


				i am very grateful for all your advice on training, nutrition 
				and a healthy lifestyle. i hope our paths cross one day so i can 
				personally thank you for your excellent work.

thanks for sharing the article on how 
				exercise slows down muscle aging and strengthens the immune 
				system.  i've just turned 55 and having read this has 
				motivated me more than ever to exercise hard and eat well.  
				i really look forward to reading the informative articles you 
				put up on your website each month and i particularly like your 
				take on each article.  you will always be my go to man for 
				health and fitness.  keep up the awesome work!
				andrew jewell

				england
i just want to say thank you for the 
				fabulous information and site you have put together. i saw you 
				in the magazines i read as a kid. i've just turned 30, strong 
				but fat after getting married, having kids, getting lazy, etc.  
				you have motivated me to be my best self again and reduce my 
				weight. i always wanted abs like yours and seeing what you have 
				accomplished way down the line i have no excuses in my 30s.
you are a true representative of 
				physical culture, longevity and wisdom.  a far cry from the 
				chemical frankenstein bodies of today's bodybuilding.  you 
				show balance, health and provide a positive role model to may 
				young and old.  thank you.

				health markers 
excellent health marker tests clarence, 
				most people bury their heads and would rather not know at any 
				age.  this attitude also allows one to continue along a 
				destructive health/lifestyle regime as in "if i am not aware of 
				any problems i do not have to solve them."
     regarding the testosterone reading of 788 at 80 years 
				of age without trt - incredible.
     during the early 80s i used to see your advertisements 
				and articles in muscle & fitness and bypass them for more 
				heavily built stars of the day (arnold and sergio) but having 
				gotten older (51) i realize how much wisdom your methods hold 
				and can aid a person to attain good health and well-being for 
				life.
     good health to you and yours.
best wishes from england.

				 better 
				than amazon prime!!
hello carol,

				thank you very much for the very fast delivery of your book 
				lean for life. and it was autographed to boot!! also, many 
				thanks for the bonus book the lean advantage 3. that was 
				unexpected and much appreciated.

				but i have a confession to make. i have known about clarence 
				bass for many years. i am a lifelong fitness exerciser using 
				just barbells and a stationary bicycles at home (69 years old, 
				64, 190). i have been very impressed by clarence in the muscle 
				magazines over the years, but unfortunately never went to your 
				website.

				well, several weeks ago i was linked to your website through 
				another article i was reading on the internet. boy, was i 
				shocked!! i actually think i lost consciousness for several 
				minutes. it was just too much for my aging, feeble brain to 
				absorb all at once.

				i immediately went to my amazon prime account and ordered brand 
				new copies of take charge, great expectations, challenge 
				yourself and ripped 1 (i have the receipts to prove it!!). i 
				noticed your website ordering section, but of course i thought 
				it will take weeks for the books to arrive. now i know better. 
				and to think i could have probably had those books autographed 
				really hurts!! (i generally jump around a book looking for 
				relevant sections of most interest to me - i eventually read the 
				entire book). i have also been on your website every single day 
				since i discovered it.

				clarence looks beyond comprehension. he looks better at 80 
				than anyone else at 20. i feel like crying when i look at his 
				pictures. it hurts that bad!!

				by the way, you should not let clarence bask in all the glory. 
				you look very hot!! yourself. i know there are millions of men 
				all over the world just waiting for your bikini photos to appear 
				on this website, young lady!!!!

				thanks again,

				jim lee, alexandria, va

 recently 
				i was giving a public lecture on the beneficial health effects 
				of high intensity training. when addressing the "anti-aging 
				effect" i showed the audience the pictures of you from your 
				homepage (that show you at 30, 40 etc.). the people simply could 
				not believe their eyes. even when i continued talking about the 
				next aspect of my lecture, someone asked me to switch back to 
				the slide with your photos and asked if such a condition was 
				really possible. how is that for a compliment! 

				all the best and many greetings from germany 

				prof. dr. jürgen giessing, university of koblenz-landau,
				germany, author of high intensity training (hit), 2016
 [your 
				expanded training pictorial] is incredible! you have 
				likely done something with your life that no one else in the 
				world has ever done or probably ever will. through unfailing 
				life-long consistency and careful documentation you have shown 
				what high intensity exercise, endurance, and excellent nutrition 
				can contribute to the maintenance of maximum human physical 
				function throughout the life span. your life is a superb case 
				study that will be probably be referred to forever. 
				congratulations, and thanks!
 waneen spirduso, professor emeritus, 
				the university of texas at austin, co-author of physical 
				dimensions of aging 
 [your 
				expanded training pictorial] is a dramatic example of 
				what exercise and nutrition and healthy living can accomplish 
				over a life span. thank you for including me. i look forward to 
				sharing this with my students.

				professor and director of the human performance laboratory, 
				department of kinesiology & health education, university of 
				texas at austin
 the 
				quote from [dr. 
				spirduso] is well deserved... she is the recognized world 
				renowned expert. besides your physical accomplishments, you are 
				the only one i know who has not seen their career diminish in 
				their late 60's and 70's. your latest book shows you are at an 
				even higher level than before.

precautionary advice
anyone with medical problems--of any nature--should see a doctor 
before starting a diet and exercise program. furthermore, even if you have no 
known health problems, it is advisable to consult your doctor before making 
major changes in your lifestyle. invariably, if you are out of shape and want to 
start training, follow the advice of the american medical association: "start 
slowly and increase the vigor and duration of the activity as your fitness 
improves."
