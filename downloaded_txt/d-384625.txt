“i started thinking this might be a surf-king version of frédéric malle.”

— luca turin, 2005





“shioya shares with the scent-architect frederic malle a woody allen-ish knack for convincing stars to work for him.”

— chandler burr, 2006



















































































a lab on fire® (2011-2018)with the spirit of experimentation and freedom as our guiding force for over twenty-four years, our fragrances have grown and changed through time and space. in our second decade of existence, our customers knew us under the banner a lab on fire®. debuting in april 2011 at the parisian concept store, colette (1997-2017), each fragrance sold in-store was made and designed exclusively for this iconic shop. after three years of creating scents just for colette where each bottle was made one by one, we expanded into other stores in europe and other countries.  



























what we do is secret®over time we started to feel stretched thin.  we missed those days of free-spirited experimenting, concocting wild and beautiful scents that could appeal to no one...or everyone. we picked up our scents and headed west to begin again.  our fragrances, both new and old, are coming directly from our hands to your noses, just like the old days.  this is where we belong. to celebrate our renewed sense of freedom, we have launched a new project titled what we do is secret® in the united states.  this banner allows for complete autonomy as we launch our fragrances in packaging exclusive to the us as well as more new scents we are currently dreaming up in the lab.
