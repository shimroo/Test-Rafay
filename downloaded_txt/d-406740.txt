tru-r geofoam
lightweight fill material
traditional earth materials are heavy and can cause settlement, instability or lateral pressures. other fill materials such as foamed concrete, waste tires, soil, woodchips, wood fiber, etc., have higher densities and are not engineered. tru-r geofoam solves all these problems.
