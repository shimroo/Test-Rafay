i had the pleasure of working with amber recently on a transaction.  she did an amazing job and was a big part of our success.  she handled everything seamlessly on the listing side and when any questions arose she was able to help get them answered and resolved.  we closed right on time and amber was instrumental in helping us get to the finish line as smoothly as we did. - mike morrison,  lender“amber was super helpful and responsive when it came to this real estate transaction. there was no way in which she could have made this process any easier. much thanks.”— jonathan miller, buyer"amber's experience, recommendations, and guidance made finding and closing on our home purchase a breeze. would work with amber again in an instant." - christopher c., buyer
