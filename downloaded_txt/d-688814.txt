features
online banking

moneydance can automatically download transactions and send payments online from hundreds of financial institutions. it learns how to automatically categorize and clean up downloaded transactions.






summary




this is an overview of your finances. the information shown includes account balances, upcoming and overdue transactions and reminders, and exchange rate information. clicking on an account or choosing an account from the drop-down account list will take you to the register for that account, where you can enter transactions or reconcile the account against a statement. clicking on a transaction reminder will display a window where you can automatically record the transaction.



graphs & reports

use the graphing tool to generate visual reports of your income and expenses. set the graph type, the date range, and any specific settings for the type of graph you desire. pop-up balloons display more information about the data being graphed as you move the mouse pointer over different regions of the screen. graphs can also be printed or saved to png image files.






account registers




the account register is used to enter, edit, and delete transactions in an account. it is visually similar to a paper checkbook register, but the calculation of balances and sorting of transactions is all done automatically. the payee auto-complete feature makes it easier to enter and categorize your transactions.

you can set up a payment schedule for single or recurring transactions so you'll never miss a payment.

reviews




"viable alternative to quicken"
4 stars
"moneydance is...fast, well-designed, regularly updated, 
					and well supported, and which seems to have a very satisfied user baseâsuperlatives 
					not often used in conjunction with quicken, the major player in the macintosh personal finance market.
					— macworld review



"a much more solid contender"
"moneydance...is a much more solid contender. this program manages to replicate much of quicken's 
					functionality -- but in some cases a bit more elegantly...on a windows pc with a moderately new processor 
					it was strikingly fast."
					— washington post - 
					challenging the finance software giants



"personal finance management made easier"
"moneydance remains privacy- and security-focused, with an architecture based on local storage and a business model that keeps user data away from marketers."
					— badcredit.org







"the one i'll be sticking with"
"the online banking type of person will love moneydance. it was the first one i reviewed, and 
					it's the one i'll be sticking with... the functionality and usefulness of it is just awesome." 
					— the apple blog



"has a lot going for it"
"moneydance...has a lot going for it: online banking and bill paying are as automatic 
					as they can be, investment information can be imported easily, budgets can be made and tracked, 
					checks can be written and printed, and the list goes on. to top it off, moneydance has numerous 
					extensions that bring even more functionality to bare, including stock price updaters, debt payoff 
					calculators, and more."
					— top ten reviews



"great, solid program"
"i've been using moneydance since release 2, maybe earlier. in any case, for the years that 
					i've been using it, i've never lost data, i've never found ads in the program, runs faster and 
					more reliably than quicken, easy to understand, support has always been there and is even better 
					now, with feature requests attended to almost on a same day basis. ...great, solid program, 
					performs as advertised, constantly improving."
					— bob crochelt, alaska usa 
					




"really makes my life easier"
"i have used moneydance for over two years and i can't imagine handling our finances without it. 
					the ability to look at our complete financial status in one window is awesome. having reminders so 
					that one never pays bills late is worth its price in gold...this app really makes my life easier 
					by saving me time and stress, and when it comes to money, that's a very good thing. i highly recommend moneydance."
					— abdon g. 
					


"infinitely better"
"this is a really great product. its been completely stable and absolutely intuitive... its by far the best mac finance package i've seen and infinitely better than all of the recent product 
					i've seen from intuit and microsoft on the pc side. thanks so much for making it such a great program; you saved 
					me in my migration from the pc to mac!"
					— mark slater
					


"graceful, simple interface"
"thank you for making a clean looking, simple interface to manage my finances and balance my checking account. 
					quicken has grown so bloated - moneydance is the graceful, simple interface i fell in love with when quicken first 
					came out for dos...awesome work!"
					— daniel juarez
