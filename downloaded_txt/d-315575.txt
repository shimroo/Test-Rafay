about the collectionexhibitionsthe berger prizeart storiesbrowse the collection



the berger collection comprises 65 british artworks in total gifted to the museum in 2018 by the bcet, owner of the collection since 1999. the paintings are part of the collection formed in the mid-1990s by the late william m. b. berger and his wife bernadette joan johnson berger and now owned by the dam. the bcet gift is the largest gift of european old masters to the dam since the museum received the kress collection in the 1950s. it enriches the museum's painting and sculpture collection, currently strong in artwork from the early italian renaissance and 19th century france.


featured works in the berger collection gift include a 14th century crucifixion, a rare survivor of the destruction of religious paintings during the reign of henry viii; portraits by 17th century masters sir anthony van dyck and sir peter lely; a neoclassical work referencing roman history by royal academy founder angelica kauffman; landscapes by the british school’s preeminent artists, among them thomas gainsborough and john constable; and superb paintings by sir thomas lawrence, george stubbs, and the americans benjamin west and john singer sargent.


about the founders 

 

william merriam bart berger (1925-1999) was born in denver, a fourth-generation coloradan. following family tradition, he built a career in finance, for which he was nationally recognized. bernadette joan johnson berger (1940-2015), also a denver native, grew up in western colorado and owned farms in kansas she raised three daughters and worked as a securities trader and stockbroker.


long-time collectors and art patrons, they chose to collect british art because of a shared love of british culture nurtured through ancestral and professional connections. the bergers were passionate about art's potential to educate and saw their collection as a resource for adults and children alike. as they observed, "we have always believed that art, as well as music, poetry, and literature, refreshes and enriches our lives." by making their collection accessible, the bergers hoped to foster a deeper understanding of art and history and to provide viewers with new insights into the world and themselves.
