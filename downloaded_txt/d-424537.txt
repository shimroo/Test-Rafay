forging ahead with tradition in our sails

thanks to monique soltani and wine oh! tv for this amazing segment that aired on local cbs stations in december 2024.  we are proud to be part of the local community, one that blends old time settlers and relatively new ones that fell in love with this special place.  take a look and enjoy a fun segment showcasing the colorful past and present of healdsburg.

wine oh tv episode















 



in winemaking, as in surfing, one learns to happily surrender to nature. control is an illusion, just remain humble and aware and react to what is given to you by the season.
