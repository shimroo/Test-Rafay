 math reimagined looking for participants & volunteers! shubha gautam is a co-founder of the local teen-led 501(c)(3) math reimagined.  she is a senior at rock bridge high school in columbia, mo, and started this program after seeing a lack of girls in math competitions in our state. 
sign up to attend their game night (oct. 21) or their middle/high school contest on november 18!  
this organization was founded to encourage girls and non-binary people affected by (trans)misogyny in missouri to participate in stem, and more specifically math contests. currently, they offer classes on zoom for elementary school students on the basics of math not typically taught in schools. in the future, they are hoping to host math days, math camps, and other mathematical events. at the moment, they focus on creating interactive lesson plans and activities to keep students engaged. their lesson plan structure has been created with the help of missouri math educators, and more information about them can be found in the attached flyers and our site, www.mathreim.org. 
if you know someone who may be interested in participating, click below.  spots are limited!
 
if you are a parent, teacher, administrator, high school student, etc. interested in helping out with our efforts, click below.  shubha is the only instructor at the moment and over 200 students have signed up in the past, so help is needed!
