custom lighting companyâ has been the chosen provider of museum quality and fully custom hand crafted, vintage antique style lighting for the usâ capitol, blockbuster a-list movie sets, historic preservations, 5 star hotels, celebrity homes and more.







the usâ capitol, our nation's most significant historic building, trusted us to create a line of antique style lighting fixtures for their hallowed halls and cloak rooms. it was our honor to have worked hand in hand with the architect of the capitol and to have been selected for this incredibly delicate project.






our newest notable project for paramount's "yellowstone"â spinoff called "1923" featuring the amazing harrison ford and helen mirren. these custom sconces are for an upcoming rail car scene so keep your eyes peeled!â 






working with blockbuster movies featuring hollywood elite means getting it right!â working with the set designers â clcâ designed a full line of custom antique lighting "the last samurai" feature film with tom cruise by warner brothers films.






to have been tasked to create custom antique fxtures for the usâ army is a true honor for all of us here at custom lighting company. we are grateful to have been trusted again by the talented historic preservation professionals tending to historic buildings.






working with the amazing bob vila was no small task, being the amazing perfectionist that he is, but it was still our honor to have been selected to work on several projects with him and the hgtv producers on "this old house".â






another big budget blockbuster movie featuring a group of our hand crafted custom antique light fixture designs is "the assassination of jesse james" featuring brad pitt by paramount pictures.






as fate would have it, we were tagged to create the lighting for another feature film with brad pitt that had sets requiring period accurate lighting fixtures. "the curious case of benjamin buttons" by paramount pictures.






hbo's "the gilded age" is one of our more recent projects that is set in the 1800's. we worked with the amazing set directors at hbo to create a group of wall sconces very specific to the victorian period with more in the works. it's pretty cool to see our fixtures on tvâ and in movies.
