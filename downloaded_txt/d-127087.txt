	 open letter to congress
	 
    


i would like to express that i read in the ny times today that the government is negotiating a housing crisis bail out. this is completely irresponsible.  it is not the responsibility of prudent, frugal tax paying citizens to pay for people’s lifestyles who want to live way beyond their means. while this bubble has inflated, i have rented for five years, with a wife and two kids, because i knew people were acting irresponsibility. now, to have to ask me to subsidize people’s lavish lifestyle, while i live frugally and responsibility is an outrage. i never vote again for your party if there is a government bail out.  i will not donate and i will stop all my fundraising. we have entered the age of a junk government.  a government that is so irresponsible that they want fannie mae, a company in financial distress, to guarantee even bigger junk mortgages, even while fannie mae is reporting huge losses!  furthermore, congress is calling for the capital requirements to be decreased!  people claim government doesn’t work. well, here is a prime example!

	 piggyback loans leading to foreclosures
	 



as home prices peaked in the first half of this decade, roughly 40 percent of buyers took out two loans -- often from two lenders -- to cover the purchase.these loans, known as piggyback mortgages, enabled home buyers to put little or no money down and avoid paying private mortgage insurance, which is why their popularity surged in high-cost areas such as washington.but while piggybacks made it easy to buy a home when prices were rising, they are making it difficult, if not impossible, to sell now that prices are falling. many people under pressure to sell find they must do so for less than they owe on their mortgages, creating friction between their two lenders, one of which will likely be left empty handed.

	 otc bb short interest now available
	 



the nasd made short interest available for otc bulletin board stocks this month. link on the article header to access the link. i believe some naked shorting is true, but it has been a phony spacegoat for a lot of scamy microcap companies to point their fingers at when their stock price is down, when in reality, it is the corrupt management flooding the market with shares trying to create a smoke screen.

i just have to say that the stock markets stinks. the so called "experts" say we are still in a bull market. just not true. the media is very biased, like bloomberg etc., because they are interviewing people who make fees off your money. not intentionally biased, just embedded entrenched biased.

	 hoping for best in home sales, 2 sides sit tight
	 



but many houses in the northeast, florida and california are, in fact, selling for less than they would have six months ago. in parts of the northeast, the drop has been about 5 percent, estimated robert i. toll, chief executive of toll brothers, the biggest luxury home builder in the country. other sellers have cut their price and still not found a buyer.
