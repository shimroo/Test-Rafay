civility. respect. solutions.
in 2021, our board of directors decided to make restoring civility an ongoing top priority for the organization. since then, we have been working to offer our elected officials the resources, workshops and other tools that will help them listen, learn and de-escalate heated situations. we want our cities and towns to exemplify good governance and civil behavior.

welcome!
the municipal association of south carolina, representing the state’s 271 incorporated cities and towns, remains dedicated to the principles of its founding in 1930 — to pursue initiatives that cities and towns can carry out more efficiently and effectively together through the association than they can individually.
