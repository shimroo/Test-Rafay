 fine art of the bahamas




    shop the collection
  





















“imagine 'the bahamas' and what do you see?”
“... elegant, swaying palm trees; blazing orange and scarlet poincianas; luxuriant, green and purple seagrapes; and of course, the beach – white or coral sands and turquoise seas.you have in fact, just imagined a painting by mr. eddie minnis, whose gem-like canvases ... have become the iconic images of our nation.his daughters, nicole and roshanne, learned to draw at their father's knee, yet found their own voices and styles, which can be described as photorealism... both create carefully studied portraits of regular folk, going about their daily tasks.ritchie eyma is roshanne's soul-mate and a part of the minnis family and its artistic heritage. eyma's approach is complementary but also noticeably different.all four artists focus on similar, but slightly different aspects of bahamian life … we are thus confronted with a totality of the traditional everyday bahamian experience.”‍amanda coulsondirector/curatornational art gallery of the bahamas








c.e. huggins, the nassau guardian newspaper -


"one artist, possibly two in the family is considered rare, but four in the same family and in the same generation is phenomenal."





















eddie minnis
“paintings should delight the eye like music excites the ear.”















nicole s minnis
“i endeavor to capture and preserve the beauty of the bahamas.”















roshanne minnis-eyma
“art is a gift from god that we have to express and share.”















ritchie eyma
“what compels me to paint is the desire to create.”
