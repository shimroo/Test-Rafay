past rks club knives
shown below are the first four club knives (with variations). club knives are only available for purchase to current society members. unfortunately all these issues are sold out.
rksa1 - first club knife (sold out)


 
at the issue time of the first club knife, the rks was called, the randall knife society of america, therefore the reason for the rksa1 designation for this first knife.
a note of interest: the first time i saw a randall knife and learned about the rksa was while helping a neighbor move her piano. in a display case were number of gorgeous knives that were really works of art. this woman who collects knives has a very unusual job, working for a medical waste disposal service. they pick up bio-hazardous waste generated by doctors - think sharps disposal - that's what they call syringes. and she works on the company website as a webmaster and designer. but her main interest was in the randall knife society and her collection of some special blades. i learned the history of the products and the influence of bo randall on both the knives and the business. btw: it turned out to be a fascinating piano move. 
564 stag handle knives made, 436 black micarta knives made: total = 1,000 knives made. first knives delivered in 1991.
description of the knife is as follows: rksa special fighter 5 inch blade of 01 swedish tool steel, brass and blue spacers with brass double hilt, black micarta concave handle or stag handle. smooth brass "coolie-cap" cap butt or on stag a thin brass plate for butt. a black model a sheath or brown model a sheath for stag knife. etched on reverse side: rksa serial #/member # price: $290 (sold out as of 1/1/1992)
 
rks2 - second club knife (sold out)


 
this knife was first offered to the membership in 1995. 338 micarta handle knives and 298 stag handle knives were made.
each knife has a 4-1/2 inch blade of 3/16 inch 440b stainless. each knife will be etched on the back of the blade with "rks knife number / member number".

rks3 - third club knife (sold out)
 

 
this knife was first offered to the membership in 1997. 860 knives were made.
 
the 5-3/4 inch blade is a slightly smaller version of the 1988 issue of the randall 50th anniversary commemorative knife, which had a 7-1/2 inch blade. very similar in shape, blade wise, you will once again, see and feel, the strong influence of bill scagel on bo randall's early knives.
the 5-3/4 inch blade is of imported swedish .01 tool steel and shows vividly the late 1930's shape of the early randall blade. the brass guard is much smaller than what you would see, say on a model 3, again showing an early randall look.
there are a total of seventeen spacers on this knife. the spacers go from the hilt: 6 regular spacers in a combination of black, brass, red and white; a thick 1/4 inch black micarta spacer; 3 spacers red, aluminum and red; another thick 1/4 inch black micarta spacer; and finally 6 spacers in a combination of black, brass, red and white again. then comes the stag handle with a 9/16 inch (compass size) randall knife society club medallion in the butt. the knife comes with a natural leather sullivan sheath.
the price was $320.00 (sold out)
 
rks3 special (sold out)
 

during the rks3 club knife, production run by the randall shop, there were fourteen (14) knives that had a different spacer arrangement than the standard rks3 club knife. prototypes, one of a kinds, or just plain shop mistakes in the spacer arrangement.
as previously mentioned, the main difference between this knife and a standard rks3 club knife is the spacer arrangement. you have to examine one beside of the other to see the difference.
each knife is etched rks3 special plus the serial number one through fourteen, i.e., "rks3 special #001" thru "rks3 special #014".
each knife has two sheaths. the standard rks3 model b, no stone pocket sheath, and a model a sheath with stone pocket.
the price was $375.00 plus shipping. the 1997 price for the rks3 club knife was $320.00 but that was with one sheath. all of the applicants for this knife were chosen by a drawing at the blade show meeting in june, 1999
