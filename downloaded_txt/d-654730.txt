        words you are having problems with.

        and bees is an educational board game based on snakes and
        ladders.  snakes, trains and
        bees comes with ten enjoyable board games plus the option
of making them into a marvelous learning aid by switching on the spelling bee!

my
        safety pin is aimed at anyone who has a poor memory for numbers
        or is unable to remember their pin numbers no matter how hard they try. my safety pin is
        simple but effective. it allows you, at your own
        risk,  to create a print out of a table of random numbers and within
        that table place your pin number. 
never forget your pin
        number again!
