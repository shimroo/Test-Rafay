happy 20th anniversary evandando.co.uk

one quiet evening in 2003 i wondered if this domain name was available, and it was, so i started out on building my first ever website. it’s been through lots of different looks and some really fun times when the forum was thriving. i couldn't have imagined i’d end up meeting evan and so many of the band members from across the years, and that this little site would even get listed on an official release or two!thanks to everyone who has ever stopped by.
