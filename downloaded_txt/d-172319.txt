sandy williams


i would recommend sandy williams to anyone. she was very professional, knowledgeable, detail orientated, and available to help us whenever we had a question or concern.  sandy is very personable and makes sure you understand every step in the process of buying and selling our home.  we needed to size down and sandy helped us find the perfect single level home.  we are extremely satisfied and so happy with our new home in hillsboro.

lisa jane hanson


lisa is an incredible realtor. she is thorough and detailed, extremely knowledgeable, and very supportive throughout the process. she removes all stress from the buying and selling procedures, and always had my back. i had complete confidence in her guidance. i greatly enjoyed working with lisa and would recommend her without hesitation.








kyle bach


we first met with kyle to purchase our first home about nine years ago, and we are pleased to be working with him again. he’s crazy knowledgeable, obviously loves creating true lasting relationships with his clients, and is everything we could have wanted in an agent. we couldn’t imagine working with anyone else!

marty weil


marty, your knowledge of residential real estate, it’s timing, consumer patterns and home construction has made a dramatic positive impact on our recent home sale and new purchase. thanks so much for the time and attention you put into our recent home transactions. 
we’ve bought and sold many homes over the years, but you made it all so easy! the little things you suggested for the home we were selling made such a difference in its appeal to its new owners. your knowledge of the market timing made all the difference in the speed with which the home sold and the price we were able to get.
as for our new purchase, you were on top of our new home the moment it hit the listings. your attention to what we were looking for clearly paid off. it was only the 2nd home you had us look at — and, again, your awareness of the market and attention to the details of what we wanted made all the difference. 
your participation in all our real estate transactions has become essential.

michael wolfington


michael wolfington is an elite and experienced realtor that will make you feel like family throughout your home buying or selling journey. he has diligently helped us buy and sell both our homes with great communication and a tireless work ethic. michael is the guy you want on your team as he will always go to bat for you and our family cannot thank him enough.

andan rempel


andan listed our house for sale and helped us find and purchase our new home. the selling process went seamlessly and he made it as stress free as possible. house hunting was actually fun with andan. he’s a great guy who’s easy to work with, he always made himself available day or night for showings and to answer questions. he’s hard working and will get you the house you want in this challenging market for buyers. i recommend him to my friends and family with full confidence in my referral.

terry zaddack


terry was the perfect agent for us as first-time home buyers. he is extremely knowledge, professional, reliable, kind, and great at what he does. he was always there for all of our needs and made us feel like his only client. he supported us from the beginning of our search to even after closing and moving into our home. additionally, we would not have had just our second offer accepted in such a competitive market for first-time home buyers if it weren't for terry's professional connections and prowess. 100% recommended!

jules williamson


jules is our rockstar! we spoke with her briefly at an open house we visited and left knowing that we wanted her as our agent. not only does she know her stuff, she is just all around the best! we ultimately ended up buying the house we have rented for 15+ years and she represented us. we could not have done it without her in the very short timeframe the owner/landlord was requiring - she took care of everything! because we do not see our house as our "forever" home, we will be using jules again!

edward petrossian


ed is the absolute best in the business. i run a commercial real estate business but have also used ed for the purchase of my personal home. he has already been recommended to all of my friends and family. ed has more experience with the local portland market than any agent in town and always finished negotiations with a win.

marty weil


marty is a very helpful and kind and observant realtor. he always goes the extra mile to make things happen! we have known marty for over 10 years and used him for all four of our moves. we wholeheartedly recommend marty as one of the best realtors in beaverton, oregon.

samantha garcia
