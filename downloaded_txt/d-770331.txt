tell me the stories of jesus i
love to
hear;
things i would ask him to tell me if he were here: 
scenes by the wayside, tales of the sea,
stories of jesus, tell them to me.

first let me hear how the
children stood round his knee,
and i shall fancy his blessing resting on me;
words full of kindness, deeds full of grace,
all in the lovelight of jesus' face.   -  william h.
