we uploaded new video “turning sea shells into gold” to our "video gallery". it's about processing whole shells into shell blanks. click here to watch it. 
 




international shipping rates




we have now been able to get back to the normal $12.00 flat rate since most of the countries have stopped using covid as an excuse to raise the cost.
