the once and forever mighty clc productions was formed in the early 1970s by bruce cooley, tom lewis and me.  we all attended woodside high school, and combined our initials to form the company name.  the three of us supplied lighting and sound equipment services to various school and non-school functions.  today, i play guitar, flutes, and whistles with the katie jane band.
