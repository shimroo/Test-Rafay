where i am now




been wondering where i am and what happened with this blog? well, i've moved on. my fascination with music continues, but this time it's about the intersection between music and the stories found in a book, not on the tv screen.

have you ever read a book that pulled you out of your life while you were reading it, one that gave you a glimpse of what else might be out there, or what you hoped might be out there? have you ever had a song take you back to the way you felt while you were reading that book?

music has power to pull us back to a moment. a feeling, a memory. it can transport us back to the strongest emotions of our lives with just a few notes. my new blog, the literary soundtrack, looks at those moments, at the songs and books that come together in our hearts to lift us out of our lives for second or two.

come share your opinions with us. what songs do you think of when you're reading your favorite book? what book do you think of when you hear your favorite song? what do you think of our choices?

knitting the backyardigans



when it takes just as long to recover from a vacation as you actually spent on the vacation, does that mean you had a lot of fun, or just that you made a 10 hour car trip with two small children?not to mention, the air conditioning broke down. it's very difficult to hear audiobooks in the back seat when all the windows are wide open. it's also very hard to color, read, or play with the toys that mommy so carefully packed for purposes of strategic distraction, when the wind is blowing everything out of your hands. experienced parents can imagine the horrifying consequences.it's going to take me a few more weeks to recover.however! here i am, back from vacation, with all sorts of backyardigans fun stuff to talk about. and the funnest (and cutest) backyardigans idea i've run across lately is the backyardiknits. do you love to knit? do you love the backyardigans? then run on over and meet up with this group of knitters who are sharing ideas for knitting projects inspired by the backyardigans. i don't even knit and i'm tempted to join up!

more backyardigans questions



where are these dolls from?dear backyardigans fan:i found these plush figures in walmart that had pablo dressed up like mickey mouse's "sorcerer's apprentice" (the wizard hat) and then a uniqua with a pink bag, and she sang about solving mysteries, or being a detective or something. on the wikipedia site they have a few unseen episodes listed, but neither of these would fit the bill.  i was wondering if you could post something out on your blog to folks to get a consensus on what we have seen out there, so we can guess about future episodes coming out. i would be interested to hear what others have seen, heard, or know.curiousdear curious:i'm assuming this is the wizard pablo you saw?i have no idea what episode this is from. so far we know 18 of the second season episodes. this might be from one the last two episodes, or it might be from season three. thanks for letting us know about this. now we can have fun speculating about it!i couldn't find anything like what you describe for uniqua. the closest i came was this lady pink figure, from the international super spy episodes (yes, the plural is deliberate - that story line will be our first two part backyardigans story!) does she look anything like what you saw?jenniferscurvy pirate lyrics, please!dear backyardigans fan:i would like to know if you can find out the lyrics to a song from the pirate treasure episode. they sing about a 'scurvy  pirate'.....can you help me?pirate fandear pirate fan:that's such a great song! i love it. unfortunately, i  don't have that song on the blog right now, but you can find the lyrics to it at the backyardigans guild site. it's about a quarter of the way down the page.jenniferquestions for the backyardigans fan? drop me a line at backyardigansfan at comcast dot net and i'll answer it here.

backyardigans birthday party decorations



  backyardigans, originally uploaded by diego cabral. 	i am continually amazed at the creativity some people have in putting together birthday parties! my kids feel spoiled if they have a few helium filled balloons bouncing around the ceiling.this backyardigans party is something else! (although, i'm wondering who the dog is?)

backyardigans questions answered here!



something i didn't expect when i put my address up here, was the number of letters i've started getting asking me questions about episodes, songs and trivia. i thought it might be fun to share some of those on here, kind of an irregular "ask the backyardigans fan" column.today we have two letters:what's this episode?dear backyardigans fan:i need help!!! i am looking for the name of the episode where the song is "make the world nice fill it up with ice" and i think tasha sings it.  i know there is snow in this episode and they make a bunch of ice cubes.  if you can help me with this......trying to rememberdear trying:that episode is "secret of snow". tasha plays the ice lady, the person responsible for making ice throughout the world. uniqua just wants it to snow, but tasha doesn't want to be bothered when she's so busy making ice!the ice song is titled "make the ice/fill it up with ice" and is sung to the tunes of both deck the halls and good king wenceslas.have fun watching it!jenniferdvd previewdear backyardigans fan:   i read your blog every few days or so.  my 2-year-old daughter is a die-hard backyardigans fan.  :-)   i was wondering if you knew what four episodes will be included in the upcoming dvd movers & shakers.   oh...i saw a counting book --deep sea countdown.  was there an episode related to this?  i know most, if not all, of their books and toys are related to backyardigans episodes, but this one isn't familiar to me.    thanks for any info.wonderingdear wondering:i haven't been able to find anything official about the dvd, yet. based on past experience, however, movers and shakers should have the episodes "movers of arabia", "cops and robots", and "save the day". it appears the next episode to be aired should be "sinbad sails alone", which should make that the fourth episode on the disc. they probably won't air that until around the release date, though, which is may 29, 2007. the only other future episodes we know of right now are "the best clowns in town" and "into the deep".deep sea countdown has provoked a certain amount of discussion. right now, (going by the cover) i would guess that its episode is "into the deep".jenniferquestions for the backyardigans fan? drop me a line at backyardigansfan at comcast dot net and i'll answer it here.
