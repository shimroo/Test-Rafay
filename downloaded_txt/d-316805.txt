top 6 benefits of enrolling your child in a preschool kindergarten

posted on july 17, 2024 by joel fields 


the decision to enrol your child in a preschool kindergarten can have a profound impact on their early development and future academic success. preschool kindergartens provide young learners a nurturing and stimulating environment where they can grow, learn, and thrive. from socialisation to academic readiness, the benefits of early childhood education are vast and long-lasting. here are the top seven advantages of enrolling your child in a preschool kindergarten
1. socialisation and emotional development
preschool kindergartens allow children to interact with peers in a structured setting, fostering social skills such as sharing, cooperation, and empathy. children learn to navigate social dynamics, resolve conflicts, and build meaningful relationships through play-based activities and group interactions. this early exposure to socialisation lays the groundwork for healthy emotional development and prepares children for success in future social settings.
2. academic readiness
a quality preschool kindergarten curriculum is designed to prepare children for the academic rigours of elementary school while fostering a love for learning. through age-appropriate activities and hands-on experiences, children develop foundational skills in language, literacy, mathematics, science, and more. early exposure to concepts such as letters, numbers, and shapes lays a solid academic foundation and enhances cognitive development, setting the stage for future academic success.
3. language and communication skills
preschool kindergartens provide a rich language-rich environment where children are exposed to various spoken and written languages. children develop vocabulary, language comprehension, and communication skills through storytelling, songs, rhymes, and conversations. this early exposure to language sets the stage for literacy development and lays the foundation for strong reading and writing skills in later years.
4. independence and self-confidence
preschool kindergartens allow children to develop independence and self-confidence while navigating new experiences and challenges. children learn to take initiative, make decisions, and problem-solve independently through age-appropriate tasks and responsibilities. this sense of autonomy and self-efficacy fosters a positive self-image and prepares children for the demands of elementary school and beyond.
5. holistic development
perhaps the most significant benefit of enrolling your child in a preschool kindergarten is the holistic development across all domains—cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and creative. a well-rounded curriculum integrates play-based learning experiences with academic instruction, simultaneously promoting development across multiple domains. by addressing children’s diverse needs and interests, preschool kindergartens lay the groundwork for lifelong learning and success.
6. promotes creativity and imagination
preschool kindergartens prioritise creative expression and imaginative play as essential components of the learning experience. children can explore their creativity, experiment with ideas, and express themselves freely through art, music, storytelling, and dramatic play. this emphasis on creativity fosters a love for the arts and enhances cognitive development, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking abilities.
7. encourages healthy habits and self-care 
preschool kindergartens teach children the importance of health and well-being through daily routines and activities. from practising proper hygiene and nutrition to learning about physical fitness and safety, children develop essential life skills that promote overall health and self-care. preschool kindergartens lay the foundation for a lifetime of well-being and self-care by instilling healthy habits from a young age.
in conclusion, enrolling your child in a preschool kindergarten offers many benefits beyond the early years. from socialisation and academic readiness to language development and holistic growth, the advantages of early childhood education are undeniable. by providing a nurturing and stimulating environment where children can learn, explore, and grow, preschool kindergartens set the stage for a lifetime of success and fulfilment.

your guide to the best kindergartens in singapore

posted on july 15, 2024 by joel fields 


choosing the right kindergarten for your child is a significant decision that can shape their early educational experiences and set the foundation for their future success. in singapore, where education is highly valued and diverse options abound, finding the best fit for your little one can feel daunting. but fear not! this comprehensive guide will help you navigate the landscape of kindergartens in singapore and discover the top-notch institutions prioritising your child’s holistic development and academic growth.
research and define your priorities
before diving into your search, take some time to reflect on your priorities and values as a family. consider location, curriculum philosophy, class size, teacher qualifications, facilities, and extracurricular activities. understanding your preferences will narrow your options and make your search more targeted.
explore accredited institutions
look for kindergartens that reputable educational organisations or government agencies accredit. accreditation ensures that the institution meets rigorous quality standards and adheres to best practices in early childhood education. some recognized accreditations in singapore include the early childhood development agency (ecda) accreditation and the association for early childhood educators (aeces) accreditation.
curriculum and approach
different kindergartens may adopt various educational philosophies and approaches. research and inquire about each kindergarten’s curriculum framework and teaching methods. for example, you may encounter montessori,waldorf, reggio emilia preschool programs, or maybe even some traditional academic-focused programs. choose a kindergarten whose curriculum aligns with your child’s learning style and preferences.
visit and observe
schedule visits to the shortlisted kindergartens to see the learning environment and interact with teachers and staff. pay attention to the classroom setup, quality of teaching materials, cleanliness, and safety measures in place. observe how teachers engage with children, encourage curiosity, and facilitate learning experiences.
teacher qualifications and experience
teachers’ qualifications and experience play a crucial role in providing quality education and nurturing young minds. inquire about the qualifications, certifications, and professional development opportunities available to teachers at the kindergarten. experienced and passionate educators can significantly impact your child’s educational journey.
parental involvement and communication
look for kindergartens that value and encourage parental involvement in their child’s education. establishing open communication channels between parents and teachers fosters a collaborative partnership that supports the child’s learning and development. inquire about parent-teacher meetings, workshops, and opportunities for involvement in school activities and events.
reviews and recommendations
seek recommendations from other parents, friends, or online forums to gather insights and feedback about different kindergartens. reading reviews and testimonials from current or former parents can provide valuable perspectives and help you make an informed decision.
consider your child’s needs 
ultimately, the best kindergarten for your child meets their needs, interests, and strengths. consider your child’s temperament, learning style, and specific learning or developmental needs. choose a kindergarten where your child feels comfortable, safe, and supported to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.
in conclusion, finding your child’s best kindergarten in singapore requires thoughtful research, careful consideration, and alignment with your family’s values and priorities. by following this guide and exploring your options, you can ensure that your child receives a high-quality early childhood education that lays the groundwork for a lifetime of learning and success.

reasons why college students go for tuition

posted on august 19, 2019 by joel fields 


the private tuition industry in singapore is rapidly growing. a survey conducted by straits times found that seven in ten parents enrolled their children in extra classes. despite the extra costs of education and with only a third of the parents agreeing to increased academic performance, many of them are still enrolling their kids. this could be attributed to fierce competition and peer pressure.
our education system follows a meritocracy system where students advance based on their ability and talents. therefore, good grades will give you a higher chance of entering the three autonomous universities (nus, ntu, and smu)
according to research in 2015, graduates from nus, ntu and smu varsities earned a starting salary of $3400 compared to $2770 from the rest.
tuition is regarded as a necessity for students to excel in all level of study and especially in college-level studies. here are the reasons why students need tuition.
students receive extra attention 
for a long time, tuition was the reserve for struggling students. today, for students to perform better, they need to go beyond the appointed course work to perform well. they can learn from their tutor and get corrections on the spot. tutors can address all concerns  as they possess the knowledge, and have the time to drill the essential concepts that are required.
teachers teach at the pace of the student
there is no rushing the syllabus as the teacher goes with the learning pace of the student. the teacher can assess the students’ strengths and weakness and tailor the study sessions accordingly. home tutoring enables the teacher to figure out the best way of teaching for improved performance because each students learning style is different.
students can actively participate in studying and can ask questions without fear of other students. this leads to a confidence boost in the kid.
home tuition supplements schoolwork 
tuition is usually done after school learning hours. students can do more than the school work to achieve good grades, simply put, students have to put more work and time in studies to better understand their subject matter.
doing more questions and doing more work helps with memory retention as the key concepts are enforced into their minds. home tuition can help students’ bridge learning gaps and achieve overall performance in examinations.
prepare for examination 
private tutorials can be very useful for students looking to enroll in a good university. sometime the syllabus may be rushed and teaching basic leaving the students equipped to tackle and pass entry examinations
tuition helps students aim for the highest performance because its more focused by offering more practices on exam questions. students can go over past papers and study autonomously. the teacher acts as a coach and helps students gain confidence.
conclusion
there are many reasons as to why tuition is important apart from getting the highest grade to get into the best university. parents who send their kids for tuition may not always be motivated by grades. tuition offers their children something extra, beyond what mainstream school offers and increase self-confidence.

awesome tips for getting the most from college

posted on august 1, 2018 by joel fields 

awesome tips for getting the most from college
there are many great things about college. unfortunately, the cost is not one of those great things. if you’re in college right now, then you know how costly it can be. paying for room and board, books, and more can really put a dent in your bank account. you might be able to spend less while in college by using the following tips.
one tip that can help you study in college is to make yourself flash cards when you have an exam coming up. flash cards are easy to make. your can buy inexpensive index cards and write questions on one side and answers on the other. you and a classmate can then use them to study together.
if you find yourself falling behind in a class, do not hesitate to consult your professor. check with your school’s faculty directory to find out his or her office hours. make time to stop by an express your concerns. your professor wants you to succeed and can direct you to the best resources.
avoid studying for big college exams the night before by taking in a lot of caffeine or other stimulants. while these things can keep you up and able to study for longer, they will make you very tired in the morning. after using chemical stimulants for a while, you will need more and more and that can be damaging to your overall physical and mental health.
do not choose a college or university because it is popular, because your friends or relatives went there or because you are a fan of their football team. there are other important factors you need to take into consideration such as your funding, the kind of career you want or the area where schools are located.
develop good study habits while in high school. college professors normally expect that students in their classes know the proper way to study for exams, write term papers and how to research information. by learning this while in high school you can ensure success in college. if you do not have good study habits, ask for help.
if you are concerned about your finances, keep track of everything you spend for two weeks. write it all down in a notebook and then look over it to determine what most of your money is being spent on. this can help you to prioritize if you need to. do this periodically to make sure you remain vigilant about your finances.
consider living in a dorm room during your first year at college. while it’s not as fashionable as having your own apartment, it’s a great way to become more involved in campus life. you’ll be close to other students, making you more likely to make new friends and avoid the loneliness of living alone.
when it comes to saving money, it is wise to always purchase your textbooks used. textbooks tend to be price, especially when you purchase them new. frequently, they can be purchased in used condition, saving you a lot of money.
set yourself up for success in college by taking your habits and ideas into consideration. for example, think about whether you are a morning person or an afternoon person. if you aren’t a morning person, don’t even think about signing up for an early class. schedule courses later in the day so you won’t be tempted to skip.
when you are deciding on where to sit in class, try to avoid your friends and stay near the front of the class. this can reduce your chances for unnecessary socializing and can help you to focus during the teachers lecture. also, this will show your professor that you mean business and are an active participant.
if you have any textbook’s leftover after a semester, decide what to do with them. your dorm room space is probably precious. some books are worth keeping for professional use. however, if you do sell, do so privately. you can find a better value for your textbooks if you sell it to an individual instead of selling it online or to your college bookstore. just make sure to sell soon, as new editions will outdate your texts quickly.
there are many costs associated with college. tuition, books, and living expenses are just a few of the things you’ll be spending money on while in college. don’t let this discourage you though, as you can spend less if you know know. just use the given tips and you’ll be saving money in no time.
