justice for all delawareans
in this extraordinary moment, our nation is unified in a loud and sustained call for justice. not justice postponed, as it has always been for black, indigenous, and people of color in america, nor justice for some, but fully and finally justice for all. we are also calling for the dismantling of the mechanisms of white supremacy that have prevented justice on this continent for over four centuries.
in delaware, we have yet to achieve an unbiased, equitable, and transformative vision of justice. the effects of slavery, jim crow, poverty, and discrimination are embedded in our state’s institutions and disproportionately impact those most vulnerable to structural injustice to this day. as recently as 2019, black delawareans accounted for 60% of the state’s prison population, while representing less than a quarter of its population overall.
in this environment, justice cannot exist.
there’s reason to hope, however. since the murder of george floyd, we’ve seen monuments to white supremacy toppled; we’ve witnessed the supreme court uphold the rights of lgbtq+ people and dreamers; and right here in delaware we’ve seen the beginning of much-needed policing reform.
building on this momentum, our new mission is simple but direct: we listen, we amplify, and we act to seek justice for all delawareans through advocacy and services.
