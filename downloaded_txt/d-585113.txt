your profile on the doula guild website



join the guild and have your profile listed on our “find doulas” page.benefit from this space, and have people find you — and circumvent the hurdle of building, funding and maintaining your own website.



















the doula guild’s doulas come from a range of backgrounds: business, health, social services, chaplaincy, teaching, homemaking, accountancy, law, journalism, heritage, the arts, … the list is almost endless.since the field of end-of-life doulas is relatively recent (in its current form), a number of doulas in our community may be just starting off in this path. many have recently certified, while other may still be considering what certificate fits them best. doulas with more experience love to share their knowledge and help other doulas along their way.we all share a passion for things related to end-of-life. like you, we are heart-driven individuals, companions, mediators, problem-solvers, doer and listeners, and passionate explorers committed to serving.














we’d love to hear from you!
