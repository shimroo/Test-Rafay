how we worship worship is at the heart of who we are as a church. every sunday we celebrate holy eucharist. the service includes music, readings from scripture, prayers, a sermon, and communion. all are welcome to receive communion.  there are also special services on holy days, such as christmas, ash wednesday, holy week and easter, and all saints day. every week, we offer various services and discussions, head to our weekly worship page for the schedule.

“i come to church because i like the community. being around friends who are close enough to be considered family is an amazing feeling. the church is where that happens. ”
