 where is verizon home internet available? and what home internet services are available to me?

it's all about the internet technology, how it's delivered to your home and where you live. fios home internet is widely available in metro and suburban areas of new england and the mid-atlantic. 5g home internet is now in more and more cities around the country. since lte home internet uses the wireless 4g lte network to deliver home broadband internet service, it is available in most parts of the country where fios and 5g home internet are not available.

*5g home/lte home internet services provided through cellular network; speeds vary due to factors affecting cellular networks




what is fios internet?

fios internet is a 100% fiber-optic network that delivers some of the fastest internet speeds to millions of homes in the mid-atlantic and new england. it uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices. verizon is one of the only internet service providers to offer matching download and upload speeds on most of our plans, which is a major advantage when you’re video chatting, gaming and sharing large files or images.




what is lte home internet?

lte home internet is home broadband internet service that brings the verizon 4g lte network to your residence. it is available in certain areas where there are no other verizon broadband options (fios, 5g home, etc.). with lte home internet, you can stream video at 1080p, plus you can enjoy no data limits.*
*consumer data usage is subject to the usage restrictions set forth in verizon's terms of service; visit: https://www.verizon.com/support/customer-agreement/ for more information about 5g home and lte home internet
