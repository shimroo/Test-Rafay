our creative team and expert production staff was amoong the first in the nation to adapt to printing many synthetic fabrics which most traditonal screenprinters would routinely turn down. we have successfully printed garments made from polyester, rayon, nylon, and other man made fibers in addition to more common special processes such as discharge printing, water based inks, distressed effects, metallic and glow in the dark inks and so on.
we have even printed custom competiton ping pong tables a few times!
