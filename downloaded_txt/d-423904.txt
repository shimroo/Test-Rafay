about ncrf






this site is dedicated to my sisterdiana mary gudemanher memories and motivation
mission statement
to help give an understanding of cancer with a different approach as
	an assistance to conventional methods.
it is common to treat pain to provide relief. it is research that
	finds the cause. the strategy of research is based on:

1. - define the problem
2. - determine the
	components of the problem 3.
	- develop a strategy to resolve the problem 4. - pursue that strategy to
	resolve the problem

currently, cancer has not been properly defined, therefore, the
	strategy of its resolution has yet to be properly determined.
currently, conventional cancer treatment involves treating symptoms
	rather than cause. although symptoms may no longer be detectable upon
	completion of conventional treatment, the cause has not been
	extinguished or corrected. therefore, the cause will continue to
	produce or affect a different area because the body as a whole
	continues to support the biochemistry that supports the environment for
	the cancerous conditions to continue.

	our research is based on the foundation that our body is a chemistry
	pool of action causing reaction.
	cancer is the body's response to an upset or change in the chemical
	environment in the body, an "eco
			system", thus a change in the cause
				and effect cycle, where the body develops a cancer
	cell acclimate to the incorrect environment. upon balancing the
	environment, the cancer cell can no longer survive, dies on its own,
	and the normal cells thrive once again.

because there are groups with false promises for their own financial
	gain, we have been determined to help cancer victims at no cost to them
	in an effort to make sure that they understand our goal is to keep them
	alive and well, and to prepare them to improve their life. there will
	be a few people that we will not be able to help reverse their cancer,
	however, our observations show that they gain a better quality,
	duration, and less painful period in their life, thus affording them to
	enjoy an improved life.
in the future, our website will include many links in effort to
	create an awareness center to include education, links to other cancer
	and health sites, chat line, humor, stories, motivation, financial
	advice and links, pharmacy advice and links, the list goes on. a
	wellness center is being created in effort to help educate, as doctors
	and other licensed experts of various fields are volunteering their
	time to strengthen our efforts.
there is never a fee to any person we help.
