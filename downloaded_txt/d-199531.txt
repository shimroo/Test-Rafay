tc2000 | best interactive charting stock screener
| 2024








dream it, test it, apply it




the condition wizard is the heart & soul of tc2000. if you can think it, you can build a condition for any indicator step-by-step. formula writing is not necessary, but certainly available. "flex" conditions  unfold over time making a whole new world of possibilities.



options charting




historical and streaming bid/ask data means you always know what the market is doing, even when no contracts are trading. plot intrinsic value, time value and more. once you see these charts, you'll never go back to anything else.



stock & option screener




in 1995, easyscan® could scan a thousand stocks in 2-seconds. imagine what it can do today. testing millions of data points for your conditions on-the-fly … will spoil you.



low latency data




whether you are changing symbols, sorting a list or plotting an intraday custom indicator, the speed from your fingertips to action is instant.






reinventing trading





place multiple exit strategies without worrying about going short. track which limit orders are closest to executing. we could have built just another trading platform. instead we innovated time-saving concepts to keep you efficient and focused.



unlimited practice for free




the fully functional trading simulator lets you practice and learn the platform. includes a basic layout with chart, positions, trades, option chain and personal journal. no credit card required. professors and students, please contact us to learn about the upgraded free program for high schools and universities.



dynamic charting




experience stunning graphics, smooth zooming & panning, indicators applied to anything, drawing palette, unmatched feel.






stay organized with watchlists




hundreds of market index lists, sectors, industries, and etf's are maintained and updated daily. use personal lists, favorites and flagged items to consolidate and organize.



option profit & loss zones




simple and brilliant. shaded zones on your chart show you where an option contract or strategy makes money, loses money and has maximum risk. patent-pending.



built-in options strategies




take the complex out of option strategies with one-click construction of multileg orders. mini-pictures make it quick to see the objective of each strategy… bullish, bearish or volatility.



alerts & reminders




whether you need to be reminded to come back and look at a chart again or you want to be notified when an indicator hits something, just click, set, done.



personal journal




millions of notes have been journaled by tc2000 traders. there's no better way to remember the exact charts you were studying and monitor your emotions over time. yes, trading can get emotional.



custom layouts




you may only need the 8 predesigned layouts, but they are so easy to customize that you'll end up building your own perfect workspace.
