can't do this anymore. it kills me that i don't write anymore, but it's just not in me. when i first cut down on the blog i had that typical (lame? unjustified?) fear of loosing "fans" but now it's something different. i just can't do it. maybe i will again in the future - maybe under this blog url and maybe not. i'll be sure to let you guys know where to find me if i change my location.i miss this, but, for some reason, can't do it right now.love,olivia

about me

name:  kat(i)e 
location:  decatur, ga, united states 
i'm a 30 year old self-proclaimed "traditional modernist woman" who lives with my husband, my son, two dogs and two cats in decatur, ga.
meaning: i am an odd, though probably not rare, mix of old and new values, ideas, styles and what-not. examples: i have 7 tattoos and a full set of fine china. i don't know what my natural hair color is and i send thank you notes. i swear like a sailor and i enjoy embroidery and crewel work.
are you a trad-mod too? email me! i'd love to start a cult a la l.ron hubbard.
no, not really. but it would be great to connect. (yes, boys are allowed but only nice boys.)
