											how do i create unique family traditions?
									 	

how to create unique family traditions
one of the easiest ways to provide your kids with a memorable childhood is through creating unique family traditions. here are three important things to remember.  1: don't create traditions for the sake of creating traditions. if it is a disaster or is not fun for all, forget it and try something different the next year.  2: keep things as lighthearted as you can. often, the most silly details are the ones that make the tradition the most fun.  3: also, do not feel stuck in the traditions your family kept when you were a child. as a parent with your own family, it is important to start creating memories specific to the life you are living now.  by keeping these three easy tips in mind, you will create memories your children will remember for a lifetime.

											what should you write on a office christmas party invitation?
									 	

office christmas party invitation
office christmas parties can be a lot of fun. when writing invitations, simply saying, "you are invited to (company name)'s christmas party" should be enough. 
always remember to list the following things on the invitation to avoid confusion: 
·who is hosting the party? the company or is it an individual in the company? ·do guests need to confirm they will be attending? ·date – write what day of the week (friday or saturday) and include the exact date (december 23rd 2006) ·time – include the time the party starts, when it may end and any details as to when dinner may be served and any other special events. ·if cocktails are provided, are they free or do people need to bring cash to purchase. may guests bring their own drinks? ·are gifts going to be exchanged? ·what should attendees wear? ·are the invited people allowed to be friends and family along, or is it exclusively for office workers. are children permitted to attend?

											how long do artificial christmas trees usually last?how much do they usually cost?
									 	

the economics of buying artificial christmas trees
artificial christmas trees are reported to last 10 to 20 years or more, depending on the quality of care that is taken for the tree through christmas and when stored. any of the artificial christmas trees purchased now may last just as long. 
the prelit artificial christmas trees may last a few years, but the prelit part of the tree may malfunction, depending on the quality. if one bulb goes out, all the others may go out too, making it nearly impossible to find the bulb to replace. 
a real christmas tree may cost $20 to $40. artificial christmas trees have come down in price, averaging $60 to $70 for most trees.

											i am trying to find a saftey cover for the cable outlet, not the wire or an electrical outlet, but something similar to cover the plate (with the cable cord in it.)plese help- (not any found at babies r us)
									 	

covering cable outlets
for safety, if the cable cord is still plugged in, use electrical table wrapped around the cord and the wall to prevent disconnection. 
for an unused cable outlet, you can remove the cable cover plate and removed the cable box if needed. you can also try using electrical tape to securely cover the plate and the outlet to keep children's fingers out of them. 
you can use a weatherproof plate, which covers an entire outlet.

											how do you dust off an artificial prelit christmas tree?
									 	

dusting and protecting an artificial prelit christmas tree
to dust, it is recommended you use some those new, dry dusters. do not use anything wet to dust. swiffer brand dry dusters are highly recommended. 
to prevent dust and bugs and other things from harming your christmas tree, be sure to store it in appropriate containers. thin plastic bags may melt and stick to the tree in hot summer weather. a large solid plastic storage bin may be better, or a heavy-duty plastic lined cardboard box may substitute. you can also just wrap the tree in heavy-duty trash bags. many of the artificial christmas tree can be taken apart for easier storage.
