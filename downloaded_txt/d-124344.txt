there is a
      widespread misconception on how to become a great cook. it is not simply
      the mere memorization of hundreds or thousands of cooking guides. neither
      is it the case of having access to special tools and ingredients as there
      are no special magic in the knives or spices. anyone who is serious about
      cooking must learn lessons of greater value and this is where this free
      newsletters come in.....
