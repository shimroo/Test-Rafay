	 how did someone get my email password?
	 
    


all your friends are saying you’ve been hacked because you emailed them malware.     in some circles i’m known best for my knowledge and experience with computer security. occasionally i find a topic that is so important yet easy to understand i want to share it with friends and neighbors in scotia. this is one of those topics.         interested in hacking into the email account of charlie sheen, rob lowe, sean penn or carson daly?  you’ll want to know they attended santa monica high school. want access to the ceo of a large retail corporation?  keep reading.      simple question used by yahoo to verify your identity.    truth is we’re all screwed but having good password habits will keep out the amateurs. it may save you from emailing people on your contact list to say, “i’ve been hacked, if you received email from me don’t click on the link.”  my security expert friends will advise you to use…  1) strong passwords        2) unique passwords for each of your password protected websites         3) two-step verification      important advice to share from billp my most important tip to family and friends is “use fake information when asked for answers to security questions.”    example of making up your own unique answers to security questions.  i had plenty of time this summer to research malware and identify the first step in the infection process.  the most common way to get hacked is someone using the small amount of public information needed too reset your email password. once they have one of your email addresses it’s not hard to receive a new password on other services.  i recommend creating easy to remember jokes to use when asked for answers to security questions.  some examples may be “what high school did you attend?” pick something like jefferson high school (happy days) or rydell high(grease). i won’t tell you what it is but people often laugh out loud when they see what i use for my mothers maiden name. yes, some company’s still use it.           target’s easy target using real data is dangerous. in less than 15 minutes i was able to find information about “former” target ceo gregg steinhafel. his mother’s maiden name was schreindl. he graduated from homestead high school. his first job was at steinhafel's furniture and he attends wayzata community church. born in milwaukee, steinhafel graduated from carroll university in 1977 and earned an mba from northwestern university two years later. i could say more but for the safety of his wife and three children i’ll stop here. when a high school kid gained access to sarah palin’s email he wasn’t a computer genius. he just looked up the answers to the security questions used by yahoo. even though that was way back in 2008 this method has continued to grow as the number one way to steal personal data.     i’ve also noticed a set of quizzes common on facebook specifically designed to collect personal data used in security questions.  i am currently investigating the background of the companies who spread these quizzes. most created their domain within the last 30 days. i will share any information in the future.   some security advice may be outdated complicated passwords:  some may recommend a complicated password like “hfy4df$dhew_!cvrh3h7d&d.” it’s safer than 123456 but isn’t very easy to remember. a complicated password may be useful to beat programs which try every possible combination but most systems will lock you out after a handful of incorrect attempts.        unique passwords:  using different passwords on different services is good advice but unless you’re using a program that remembers your passwords it’s too easy to forget unique passwords. if you’re like me you’ll just end up resetting your password using security questions.        two-step verification   the two step verification process is a step in the right direction for banking or any service where real harm could be done it’s worth the extra step. if someone gains access to your cell phone or one of your email accounts the benefit is lost. unfortunately, you’re trusting that the company is not going to take advantage of having more of your personal data like your cell phone number or alternate email address.   some advice will never change  as far as recent failures by home depot, lowes and other large companies the advice hasn’t changed much in 20 years. when your bill comes, check all your charges and make sure they’re legitimate. most likely you can access your credit card online and see charges as they come in. if you haven’t already, register an account connected to your credit card and review charges regularly.  reviewing your bills doesn’t just apply to credit or bank cards. keep an eye on any charges like your cable or phone bill. legitimate companies have been known to add bogus charges. verizon wireless added a monthly charge for ring tones on cindi’s phone. they claimed she agreed to the monthly charge by not responding to a text message. they removed the charge when i explained her cell phone at the time didn’t support test messaging.

	 sunnyside road bridge construction & detour
	 
    


 leaving the village of scotia via sunnyside rd. starting on tuesday, september 2nd the glenville section of sunnyside road will be closed to all but local traffic accessible from freemans bridge rd.  just inside the village of scotia the sunnyside road bridge will be resurfaced and closed to all traffic.      unlike recent construction on the western gateway bridge to schenectady, both lanes of the sunnyside rd bridge will be closed to traffic. the closest access to freemans bridge rd and routes to alpaus or schenectady will be via route 50 and dutch meadow lane.      indicated in green on the google map below are roads which will be open and provide a replacement route.  in red is the east end of sunnyside road which will be closed to all but local traffic. no vehicles will be able to cross where the bridge currently brings traffic over the railroad tracks used by amtrak.  no exceptions, including emergency vehicles.         the sunnyside road bridge as it currently appears when entering the village of scotia.  if your gps bring you here during september and october 2014 turn around!    the sunnyside road bridge has been around for many years and passed over a major train yard called “sandbank yard” which has been documented  by our friend and scotia-glenville alumni, steve myers with his photos and many provided by ed wittekind a union college student in the 40’s.     growing up in the 60’s i remember calling it “switcher bridge”.  we would pack a lunch, ride our string ray bikes down to the bridge and watch as the trains changed to different rails.  while i am not looking forward to the closure for two months, it closed for almost two years when i was in high school.  the bridge had deteriorated and for safety the bridge was closed around thanksgiving 1971.  it remained closed until august 29th, 2971.  the village had expected some help financing the replacement of the bridge but according to then rep samuel s stratton, the u.s. transportation department approved funding but it was held up by the state.. apparently new york state  transportation department officials were uncertain as to the  future of the sandbank yard or any train traffic.  the penn central railroad closed their sandbank yard in 1978. currently, the main rail activity is from amtrak passenger service. i can’t imagine what really held things up for two years. while, they weren’t the same tracks, one of the first railroads in the united states was nearby and used horses to pull the train cars across the bridge connecting scotia and schenectady washington’s avenues.

	 memorial day remembrance 2014
	 
    


every year the village of scotia has a memorial day parade on the wednesday evening before memorial day. it’s a popular event with families arriving early to pick a good spot or to enjoy a chicken barbecue, another tradition of the scotia fire department.    what many residents miss follows the parade and occurs next to the scotia library in collins park. each year many organizations take this time to pay tribute at our own veterans memorial.  scotia resident kurt von maucher picture here with grand marshal: commander vincent perry, jr. and co-honorary grand marshal: william a. wragg, jr.     kurt has been organizer of our memorial parade and remembrance more years than i can count. the event is now in the hands of john eaton pictured on the right below.      a new participant of the 2014 memorial day parade was the federation & new york state basketball champions. representing scotia-glenville schools the boys varsity team generated a great deal of excitement and community-wide pride.  excitement doesn’t come close to describing this scotia-glenville’s fan pleaser. the scotia-glenvilleperfectpitchprecisionpepband also made their first appearance at this years parade. this group of ambitious musicians doesn’t just rally fans at boys football or basketball games. you’ll find them at baseball, women's basketball and any athletic and/or school event when enough band members are available. it wasn’t hard to find members wanting to march in honor of the men and women who have died while serving in the united states armed forces. labels: basketball, library, parade, pep
