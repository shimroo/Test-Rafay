champions for family caregivers


how ur nursing research is improving caregiver health & wellness
individuals caring for a loved one with a chronic condition or disability likely have an ever-growing and changing to-do list. most times, "taking care of myself" is not added to that list. a growing body of research shows that family caregivers don't always receive the care they need to live longer, happier lives themselves. ur nursing researchers hope to change that. in this edition of rochester nursing, our experts discuss their insights on the caregiver role and current research projects that aim to improve caregivers' well-being and quality of life.

i served jails, nursing homes, and developed and ran an outpatient psycho-pharmacology clinic. i wouldn’t have been able to do that without my training at the school of nursing, which provided me with the confidence and experience to be autonomous.
