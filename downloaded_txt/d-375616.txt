be your own boss!
hamburger mary’s is not your typical franchise system. we aren’t looking for world domination, with a gazillion “cookie-cutter” locations all robotically moving to the same beat. we are a family of independently-owned joints with the common goal of serving good food in a fun, welcoming environment where everyone can “eat, drink and be… mary!”
we would love to bring mary’s sass and hospitality to your city. so if you are interested in starting or furthering your career in the exciting restaurant business (but fast food isn’t your thing), then hit us up!
