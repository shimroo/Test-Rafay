                                        this was by any definition, a hit! we sent the salt and pepper arrangement to my mother in law for mother’s day and we happened to be on the phone with her when it arrived. she was awed and gushed that it was the most beautiful bouquet she’d ever received. i love that we now have a local florist who provides such extraordinary artistry and quality. we’ll come back many times. you made us look like geniuses! cheers!

                                        the custom rose arrangement was perfect.  the roses are healthy and beautiful.  the next morning my living rooms smells like a rose garden...wonderful!  

also, the customer service is second to none...they will do exactly what you want, all you have to do is ask.
