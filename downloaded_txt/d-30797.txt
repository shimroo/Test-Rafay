joining god toincite love,reduce suffering,and increase joy




    more info
  


























you’re accepted here just as you are…god loves you. god doesn’t require you to get your life together first; he loves you now. we strive to reflect this radical acceptance by welcoming people wherever they may be on the journey of faith: regardless of how you currently think about god, faith, the bible, church, etc., you are accepted and welcome here.…and we hope you don’t stay the same.you were made for great things. you were made to grow. the hope for all of us is that by learning more about who god is and who we are through scripture, encountering christ’s love & grace through authentic expressions of worship, receiving and extending grace & forgiveness in relationships of vulnerability & trust, and putting our faith in action through radical generosity, we won’t stay the same but will grow more and more into the people god created us to be.
