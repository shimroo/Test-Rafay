once-a-month for an unprecedented 20 years (1993ï¿½2013), l.a.'s queer/mixed underground eagerly descended upon dragstrip 66 for an evening of messy drag and trashy rock ï¿½n roll. the club happened on the 2nd saturday (first in silver lake and then echo park) and each one had a different theme. we encouraged the crowd to dress in any drag or for the evening (not required, just more fun!) our loyal patrons frolicked and moshed in an all-inclusive environment that was transformed into a palace fit for a queen, as much by the arty decor as their own fierce revelry. supersonic djs paul v. and tom walker spun everything eclectic, (rock 'n roll, electro, funk, hip-hop, indie pop, mashups) while our gracious mc gina lotriman assured a fabulous comedic stage show, with live singing and no lip-synched performances! the atmosphere was both frenzied and comfortable, from the packed dance floor in the back to the placid tete a tete on the outdoor patio.


 any celebrities and famous faces were enamored by dragstrip 66's kitschy punk themes and uber-cool, pansexual crowd. celestial sightings included: nina hagen, jennifer coolidge, sir ian mckellan, perry farrell, drew barrymore, adam lambert, pedro almodovar, marilyn manson, anderson cooper, eric erlandson, heather graham, scott thompson, ann magnuson, anthony kiedis & flea, roseanne barr, lance loud, thrill kill kult, karen black, extra fancy, alan cumming, anna nicole smith, l7, claire danes, david lachapelle, james st. james, traci lords, bikini kill, phranc, roddy bottum, alexis arquette, susan tyrrell, and white zombie. the legendary julie brown, mink stole, and andy warhol superstar holly woodlawn all eventually performed on stage with us. what these celebs loved about dragstrip 66 was that they could hang out, dance, and socialize like regular folksï¿½there was no "brat-pack" scene going on, and the only ï¿½vip sectionï¿½ was backstage in the kitchen!

also note that many pre - ru paulï¿½s drag race queens attended and/or performed at dragstrip 66: alaska thunderfuck, kelly mantle, detox, raja, tammie brown, willam, and delta work.
 
verybody gets something different out of dragstrip 66. one thing that's constant, is that this club has one of the most friendly and diverse crowds in los angeles, where lgbtq+ patrons mixing with straight allies is a sight to behold. you never know what to expect when you walk through the door. and clearly, even 30 years later, our fabulous patrons are indeed the show, too!
