library and information services





 





through integrated services, library & information services (lbis) connects the kenyon community to comprehensive and reliable resources and expertise. we develop the skills in ourselves and others to effectively navigate and engage with those resources amidst an evolving technology and information environment. we value positive experiences and creating an inclusive culture of collaboration, innovation, and integrity.  
we are organized into four departments:
library services
provides library services, including the management of physical and electronic scholarly books, journals, and databases; supporting faculty in making available course readings; individual research assistance and library research instruction associated with courses; classroom, study and exhibit spaces in the chalmers library; archives and special collections.
institutional research
the office of institutional research collects, organizes, analyzes, interprets and disseminates institutional data and intelligence for the purpose of decision-making, policy formation, planning and assessment of programs and activities. 
information technology
support for accounts and security; classroom, meeting room, and personal computer technology; google workspace services (including email, calendars, and network storage); telephones; campus networking; printing; and major campus systems (including kenyon reservations, personal access pages, plan ahead, rave emergency alerts, student mobile id, and administrative systems like banner and advance), technology for kenyon and guest events; and digitization. services also include the helpline, the student-staffed technology help desk.
project management
the project management office provides support for new technology implementation and other campus-wide upgrades.
