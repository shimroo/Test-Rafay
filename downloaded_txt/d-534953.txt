more projection than the local odeon....





 looks like crime's so low in the people's republic of caledonia that the mcfilth have had to resort to policing hypothetical crime:police have been accused of targeting jk rowling in a parody by inventing a fictional trans-hating character called jo who believes 'they all belong in the gas chambers' in a hate crime scenario.yep, that would be the 'jo' who's a massive labour party donor and uber-karen, but now they're trying to claim she's totally some demented liberal caricature of a right-winger.honestly, it's like a mashup of taggart and the self-righteous brothers. still, i'm all about the equality me, so how about asking them what they would do if jonathan 'india' willoughby broke into porton down, stole anthrax spores and then hired an ice cream van and drove round south-east inverness giving anthrax-laden 99s to passing school children while dressed as amy winehouse? hey, you ever think about that one, pc mcwoke? no? will no one think of the imaginary children? apparently, 'jihad' doesn't necessarily mean 'holy war' but everything the right says totally does - even if the rightists in question are identikit guardian-reading bores like 'jo'. say, that sounds like something a bunch of creepy fanatics would use to try and bamboozle the public into supporting violent thuggery....i mean i can't help noticing that all the actual, non-hypothetical, crimes appear to come from one side of the debate. just who exactly is fantasising about herding their opponents into gas chambers, huh? they're not even hiding it anymore. a journalist for the bbc - of course - is openly fantasying about a 'final purge' - nudge, nudge, wink, wink - targeting people who [checks notes]... hate woke video games. seriously, that's all it takes for a leftist to start fantasising about mass murder: not liking their rubbish, preachy games. these people are all nuts.

that's not what 'random' means





 friends, i thought the day would never come but here it is - i finally feel some sympathy for civil servants. sometimes even i have to admit that their job can be impossible. take the report that's finally come out re: the guy who went on a knife rampage. you remember.... the guy who went on a knife rampage in the midlands.no, not that, the one in birmingham. anyway, they've done a report into this case and the answer is....can you guess?mcleod was known to be a violent offender and ms hunt said agencies had failed to communicate effectively and had not prepared properly for his release from prison.yep, moar meetings!of course, preparation is kind of difficult when you can't acknowledge what you're preparing for. the bbc shows us two of the victims but not the other five - they're victims of no appearance apparently. say, i wonder if they have anything in common with the two guys shown? nope, it's was all 'random' apparently - which is the line they were taking long before they even started on the report. hence my feelings of sympathy. it must be hard to do a threat assessment for fantastic mr fox when you're not allowed to use the words 'chickens' or 'hen house'.

death was by blunt language trauma





uh oh.... looks like lee anderson has fallen foul of people who'd never vote tory anyway. now they're going to not vote tory really hard. they're going to not vote tory to infinity plus one. after all, according to world-famous moderate sadiq khan, his language was inflammatory. also inflammatory: arson weirdly enough though, moderate sadiq khan hasn't mentioned this yet. i guess it's just part and parcel of living in a big city.... which was the exact phrase he used to describe the slaughter of innocent civilians by terrorists. say, i wonder if any of the hand-wringing cucks complaining about lee anderson's 'clumsy' language have anything to say about that? i don't recommend holding your breath waiting for them to even mention it. that's the whole reason normal people are so stoked about what lee anderson said - we're just sick of being asked to believe in obvious absurdities. the people who are outraged about anyone criticising islamism, but not people blowing up the no 52 bus are in no way moderates and what they support is in no way equality. more to the point though, a party that pretends there's something outrageous about pointing all this out  is in no meaningful sense  'conservative'.

new euphemism just dropped!





hey, i hate the lycra lice as much as anyone but i don't think the mode of transport is the key issue here: police have named the 16-year-old boy who was killed in a stabbing on wednesday 'by two cyclists wearing masks'.  the victim has been named as darrien williams, though formal identification is yet to take place, according to avon and somerset police.  he was attacked in rawnsley park in easton by two people wearing masks who left the scene on bikes, before running to stapleton road where he was assisted by a motorist.on the plus side, at least it's a change from 'talented footballer' or 'aspiring rapper'.

i shot a man in reno just to watch him die (and it's all stephen king's fault)





 liberals, true as ever to their motto 'being outraged about the wrong things since 1978', have decided that the real guilty party in the brianna ghey case is everyone who ever objected to a guy in a dress sharing a changing room with their six year old daughter. although to be fair, i did think j k rowling went a little too far in her book 'harry potter and the creepy tranny in a terrible wig'. meanwhile, non-insane people note that the actual killers will be eligible for release in their mid-thirties i.e. still prime murdering age. i'm sure they'll be totally rehabilitated by then though.....note that not only did the jury not find that the killers were motivated by transphobia, the prosecution didn't even allege this - the judge herself decided to introduce this after the verdict was in.you might say she decided to transition the case....but wait, where are all the people who usually sermonise about muh sacred due process now  that a judge has suddenly decided that the whole trial thing is just a warm up act to her telling us what really happened? as it is, her reasoning seems.... well, let's just say i think there's a reason why she chose to wait to  introduce this until after no one could answer back:'your messages about brianna were transphobic,' she told him. 'you consistently referred to her in a way that was dehumanising, calling her "it". you also described her as a "femboy thing".'wait... this guy sounds like me. or, come to think of it, anyone else who rolls their eyes at the whole 'i identify as a cat' thing. and if you think that's weak, there's this:while jenkinson did not use transphobic language, she said it was the prosecution case that she 'encouraged' ratcliffe to kill brianna in the knowledge that his 'attitude' would make it more likely that he would go ahead and stab herhuh? hanging out with bigots who use insensitive language makes you a bigot too. how about if they work under you in some kind of group? let's say there's some hypothetical guy - we'll call him sir keith stoller - and some of the people who work under him are a bunch of raving antisemitic nuts? is he responsible for any crimes they do too? still, we have to look on the bright side of all this: at least motivation is back in play as something we're allowed to talk about. hey, if we're allowed to trawl through some scumbag's text messages to work where he's coming from, we're surely free to do a deep dive into other cases... like, say, the nottingham horror. right, liberals? nope, guess not. the killer was sane enough to arm himself, conceal the weapon, travel into town, strike at the time of day when the police response was likely to be slowest, lie in wait for his victims and target only a specific demographic but too crazy for us to be able to ever understand why he targeted the people he did. could be literally anything, you guys!
