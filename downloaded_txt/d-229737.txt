		graphics & support
on this web site you will find 
    links to support documents and requested graphics.
the graphics will be presented 
    as zip files. you can download winzip 
here. 
    	i will post a small .gif thumbnail of the zipped file when possible.
      if you have a need for 
    an image that is not available in the
      clipart and 
      media site let me know.
