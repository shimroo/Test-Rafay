project highlightwildflower book bundle
we recently assembled and shipped out a custom book bundle for wildflower: a memoir by aurora james! for this project, we assembled each individually-addressed box with a hardcover copy of the book, a gift note, and a small burlap bag of wildflower seeds.
we love moving a lot of books at once, even if that means sending them individually to many hundreds or even thousands of different addresses. we excel at those kinds of all-hands-on-deck, high-touch, customized orders and mass book mailings!
