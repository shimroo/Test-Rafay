schoolwide enrichment model (sem)


the renzulli center for creativity, gifted education, and talent development is one of the leading centers in the world in the area of gifted education and talent development. our mission is to promote enjoyment, engagement, and enthusiasm for learning in teachers and students at all levels of education through high-quality research and outreach on innovative teaching approaches. our work in talent development and gifted education is based on practical applications of over four decades of research, as are the direct services we provide to teachers, administrators, researchers, and policy makers throughout the world.
our faculty and research teams are leading experts in giftedness, creativity, and talent development. in addition to other large research projects, the center houses the nation's only federally-funded research center in gifted education (national center for research on gifted education [ncrge]) and conducts confratute (conference/institute), an internationally renowned professional learning experience in talent development, now in its fifth decade. the renzulli center is also well-known for the schoolwide enrichment model (sem) and the resulting technology-based learning system. the schoolwide enrichment model is one of the best-known enrichment models in the world, and it is used in thousands of schools in the united states, mexico, south america, europe, and asia.
