our mission
the mission of the akron central school district, a learning-centered community dedicated to the dreams of our students, is to ensure that each student realizes his or her unique human potential and contributes positively to society, through a system characterized by: 

valuing the unique gifts and dreams of each person
developing all dimensions of each human being
advancing the knowledge, skills, and wisdom of each student
nurturing and respecting the dignity of each human being
cooperatively working to continuously create new realities



























akron central school district acknowledges that we gather on the traditional lands of the tonawanda seneca nation. we honor the contributions of the indigenous peoples past, present, and future with gratitude for the land as we continue to work together with a spirit of respect and understanding.
