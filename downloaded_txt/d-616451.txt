	about house of zion
the house of zion was formed in 1967 when ed rosen, an avid israel stamp collector, realized there were very few dealers specializing in israel, judaica and holy land stamps and covers. originally setup to attend local shows in the san francisco bay area, ed realized quickly, there was a huge need for mail auctions and want lists. their first auction was held in 1972, with just over 150 lots. today, house of zion, has probably the largest stock of holy land, palestine, wwi, 1948 interim/locals, doar ivri, israel, judaica, anti-semitic, and synagogue postcards in the world.
