customer reviews










"we had the team at the closet company provide a shelving system for the pantry in our new house - what they provided was amazing!  with so many options available, if you can think it, this company can do it!  we thought we knew what we wanted, but after checking out the showroom, changes were made that greatly improved what we had envisioned.  i highly suggest the team at the closet company.  give them a try - you will not be disappointed."matt b.






"we are so glad that we worked with closet company to do our closets (master and guest bedrooms, office ) and walk in pantry in our new home. it couldn't have been better. throughout the process, celia who helped us to finalize the design was very cooperative, flexible as we were making changes till last minute. all this was done in keeping eye on the budget and timeline. project was completed on time. the installation was done in most professional way, area was cleaned up; closets, pantry were cleaned and ready. we really appreciate celia and others at closet company who were part of this process. kudos to closet company team for excellent job done!"padmanabh g.






"we are extremely happy with our walk in closet, walk in pantry and coffee bar! the quality is a 10+ and it’s beautiful! working with their designer ali was delightful and she designed the perfect spaces for us! pricing was very reasonable compared to our local cabinet company. installation was 2 weeks earlier than planned. highly recommend the closet company!"ellen w.






"my closet system is beautiful as well as functional. i'm looking forward to working with the closet company on future projects."jessica






"we had a back closet made into a pantry for mostly small appliances and a few shelves with a hanging rod for the laundry room. we couldn't be more pleased. celia did such a good job creating a plan. everything turned out just as we had hoped for. the shelves are a perfect size to hold what we needed to store. the installer did a good job also. the materials are good quality."andrew m.
