  paulette and fred are wonderful guides to the world of hopi jewelry.   they know not only the jewelry, but the artists behind the jewelry and the cultural significance of the subjects and designs and motifs of the jewelry.  they are also two of the warmest people i have ever met.  they love what they sell and it shows in everything they do.  i have been learning from them for well over a decade.
