one-day seaweed wildcrafting seminar
 
we meet at a coastal seaweed wildcrafting location on the mendocino coast in the morning, in time to catch low tide.  
john and barbara personally conduct the walk, sharing the depth of their knowledge,
 information and lore from their many decades as harvesters, ocean protection activists, 
and students of nutrition immersed in the world of wild seaweed, while visiting the sacred habitat of mendocino nori, 
wakame, kombu, green goddess sea lettuce, bladderwrack, and other delectable seaweed beds that open up during the low tides 
giving us access to the seaweeds in the oceans food shed. 

we complete the seminar learning how to dry and preserve the seaweed.  barbara will demonstrate how to prepare a seaweed dish to share from our day�s harvest, 
either at our cottage business in philo, or at another convenient location.  exact timing of the one-day seminar is set by the time of the tide, but all will be 
completed by mid-afternoon. 

participants are invited to harvest up to ten wet pounds per person of delectable edible seaweed for personal use to preserve and enjoy.  
all are welcome to join john and barbara in making love offerings of beauty for the ocean spirit.

for harvesting equipment, bring a sharp knife to cut the seaweed, warm clothes, foot wear that helps you stay safe in tide pools, 
paper and pen for notes, dry footwear, water to drink, a natural offering of beauty for the spirit of the ocean, a backpack or such to carry your personal items.

the fee for the whole day seminar is $150 per adult person.  we are asking a $30. donation for young folks 12 to 21 attending with their family and 
participating in the seminar, harvesting and drying their own personal 10 wet pounds of seaweed.  there is no fee for children 12 yrs. and younger.

john and barbara practice and teach harmonious seaweed wildcrafting, attuned to the spirits of the elements and the human community.
 
barbara stephens lewallen, native to maine, had a deep experience in north atlantic edible seaweed and its nutritional healing properties 
long before a �calling� to mendocino seaweed led to her fateful meeting with john in 2002.  now co-owner and operator of the mendocino sea vegetable 
company with john, she is world-renowned for the quality of seaweed she brings to her individual customers and to the finest restaurants.
john is beginning his fortieth year of stroking seaweed from the same rocks on the mendocino coast.  now 75 he is rebounding, with barbara�s love and support, from a crippling disease to being able to do the seaweed walks he loves, sharing vision and politics with you as we meet the delightful edible seaweeds! 

 wishing you good health and happiness, creating peace living in harmony with nature, love barbara and john

"sea vegetables" are seaweed, marine algae, which are not only edible

but actually beautiful and delectable.  packed with nutritional and

healing properties needed now as never before, sea vegetables are rapidly

moving from asian cultures, where for centuries they have been regarded

as food for kings and gods, into the natural healing foods and even gourmet cuisine

markets of the western world.

tsukigase health green tea
tsukigase health green tea is a japanese green tea of unsurpassed quality

and taste.  probably you have never tasted green tea as good as these

tender young leaves from a family-tended tea garden in an ancient japanese

village.  lovingly grown by the iwata family without agricultural

chemicals, tsukigase health green tea is certified organic by the government

of nara prefecture, japan.



many americans are now aware that green tea is a health-giving, mildly

stimulating drink.  yet it is difficult to find green tea that is

both organic and good-tasting.  now, in limited quantity, we can bring

you the best from the japanese organic farming movement.  click

to visit the iwatas in their tsukigase health tea garden.
