fort myers, cape coral, naples and port charlotte, our car accident attorneys handle a wide variety of collision claims, including drunk driving collisions and distracted driving accidents, across the state of florida.unfortunately, florida joins california and texas as the three deadliest states in the nation for traffic collisions according to the national highway traffic safety administration. each year, more than 2,000 victims are killed on florida roads, or about six a day. drunk drivers continue to be responsible for roughly one-third of the stateâs traffic fatalities.fast-paced growth in southwest florida has increased the risks in recent years as the state struggles to accommodate the influx of new residents and seasonal visitors. our exclusive focus on representing victims of

courtroom defenders of the riding communityâs rights. for more than a decade we have provided sponsorship to cape coral bike night, fort myers bike night, bikers for babies and other family-friendly riding events and riding-safety awareness campaigns.nationwide, the popularity of motorcycle riding, combined with the carelessness of other motor vehicle drivers, has doubled the number of riders killed on the roads in recent years. floridaâs year-round great riding weather, poor road infrastructure, and influx of annual visitors make it the most dangerous state in the nation for motorcyclists, claiming more than 500 lives annually, according to the governors highway safety association.pedestrian injury lawyers â bicycle accident attorneyspedestrians face the brunt of the risks created by southwest floridaâs explosive growth, as cities continue to struggle to provide basic safety infrastructure, such as adequate sidewalks, lighting and crosswalks.the cape coral-fort myers area in particular has been identified as the most dangerous metro area in the nation for walkers, according to smart growth americaâs landmark 2016 report âdangerous by design,â which analyzes the impact of poor infrastructure and city planning on pedestrian safety. nine of the nationâs most dangerous walking cities are located in florida, according to the report.the pedestrian

field, in 1971. cape coral had just 10,000 full time residents. today more than 250,000 people call those two cities home, and the population of lee and collier counties has surpassed 1 million residents.bicyclists face similar risks. like pedestrians and motorcyclists, they are among our most vulnerable road users in florida. any collision with an automobile is likely to result in very serious or fatal injury. more than 100 riders a year are killed on florida roads; only california reports more riding deaths each year, according to the national highway traffic safety administration. factoring population, florida still holds the no. 1 spot.consulting with an experienced bicycle injury lawyer is best done as soon as possible following an injury accident.commercial vehicle accidents

bicyclists and pedestrians.our trucking accident lawyers in fort myers and naples know these are often complex cases resulting in very serious or fatal injuries. your chosen personal injury or wrongful death law firm must have significant experience investigating trucking collisions.in addition to a host of state and federal regulations, the truck accident lawyer you choose must understand
