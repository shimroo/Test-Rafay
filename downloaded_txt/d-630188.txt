state issues

illegal direct-to-consumer shippingenforcement efforts around the country have revealed that states grapple with the harmful impacts of non-compliance in the direct-to-consumer alcohol shipping market.  while many shippers respect state laws, there are bad actors that ship alcohol illegally to consumers by taking advantage of loopholes to evade compliance, which harms law-abiding businesses, undercuts state authority, and ultimately has negative impacts on the entire marketplace and consumers.
