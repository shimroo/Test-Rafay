welcome






i am out of this world excited and incredibly proud to have the opportunity to lead kings highway elementary school center for digital learning and steam. i envision our school to be a learning community that provides students and their families with a family-friendly environment that emphasizes rigor and relevance in ways that are exciting and engaging. students will be challenged to reach academic goals and to grow in ways that will teach them to take ownership of their learning. we will encourage them to develop skills that will equip them to be successful in life. i bring a diverse background in both exceptional student education and general education. i began my career as a classroom teacher, taught kindergarten thru sixth grade for eleven years, served as an assistant principal for five years, and served as a principal for fifteen years. i have been part of several educational initiatives, including studies, pilot programs and design of curriculum and instruction for both reading and mathematics that have paved the way for future generations of educators. i have trained and presented at both the district and state level. i am a huge proponent of professional growth, as well as growing others professionally. i wake up every day excited about the prospects of changing students’ lives and growing a school where every single child’s needs are articulated and addressed. i value the power of education—it’s embedded in everything we do. i find incredible joy helping people find their passion for learning and life. each day is a blessing, and i share that love of life with my two boys, my family and friends. i was raised in a military family that reinforced the values of love of family and country, loyalty, and a strong work ethic. i look forward to another year of growing and learning! come join us. you will not be disappointed!
 
from the heart, garyn boyd principal, kings highway elementary magnet school
