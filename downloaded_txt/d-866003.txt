“there’s just something about a teddy bear that’s impossible to explain. when you hold one in your arms, you get a feeling of love, comfort and security. it’s almost supernatural” 
-james ownby
































































vintage teddies
what makes each vintage teddy unique? it could partly be the color and texture of each one’s fur. or the sparkle of their expressions and shape of their faces. it might be their distinctly different personalities. one will eagerly reach their bear paws up as their new owner approaches to take them home, while another might simply grin and silently wonder what lies ahead. what happens inside a teddy, you see, is much more than we humans can comprehend. a vintage teddy learns the ways of the world through love, emotion and quite a bit of curiosity; taking in the surroundings of their life with the complete innocence of a child. maybe that’s why they seem to form a special connection with a child so naturally. for a vintage teddy, there is nothing that completes them more than finding a child to call their own. now they might end up on a shelf or left behind more often than not, but a simple glance of recognition and a smile from the child upon return is all they need to be happy. so to answer the question: what makes each vintage teddy unique? it’s the people, places and experiences that are offered to them throughout their bear life that shape a vintage teddy’s heart.
