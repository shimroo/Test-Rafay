it’s about the new adventure each day brings. after 4 years working as a youth development specialist, ms. julia is still as excited as she was on day one. her greatest joy comes from seeing her members grow in both confidence as well as character. interestingly, the kids aren’t the only ones growing.  one of the key things that julia has learned, is the importance of being solution oriented.  “there is always more than one way to approach a problem”. multi-faceted gem. we’ll take that. beaches boys & girls club is a place to become. click here for a full list of clubs
