“eden maxwell’s art is brilliant; he’s the real thing, a true creator.”—mary anne bartley, artist-in-residence: villanova university, whyy, pbs“i'm over the top at how your artwork reveals a master's touch that goes beyond day-to-day reality and puts my mind in an abstract anything goes happy place.“i just can't  look at your art and move along swiftly because i need to ‘study it.’  there's so much to be seen in each and every piece.“i'm just a country girl who can honestly say that i think you move to the beat of your soul.“i truly love your works.”—sandy stacy“eden maxwell’s art is among the most compelling i have ever seen. he is in the good company of picasso and kandinsky.”—oscar (oz) janiger, psychiatrist | art patron———————giving back in gratitude: the artist donates a portion of art acquisitions to support foundations protecting animal rights and abused children. over the years, eden had given many kite-making and art workshops for abused and inner-city kids. these workshops bolstered their much-needed self-worth and confidence.
