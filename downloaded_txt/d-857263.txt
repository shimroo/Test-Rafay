we offer a home base for more than 120 members, some of whom have lived here for over a quarter of a century, others who have just arrived. we are a diverse group.
our members are  both single and married, with and without children. some are homemakers and caregivers, some are retirees and some work in the community in a variety of fields. what we have in common is a desire to develop friendships, maintain traditions from home, and share experiences of living in switzerland.
if you live in or near bern and are an american citizen, a woman with close ties to the us, or maybe someone interested in getting to know americans, why not join the american women’s club of bern? check out our join us page for details.
