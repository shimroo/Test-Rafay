    florida legacy chamber unveils new look for  133rd anniversary


 by janet knauff
•
january 24, 2023

at the annual meeting & installation of the 2023 board of directors, the chamber unveiled a fresh new look that is designed to better represent the brand of this 133-year-old organization. outgoing president elizabeth godwin of duke energy said the plan for this rebrand began a year ago at the annual board of directors planning retreat. "we brought in a consultant to help us refine the chamber’s mission and vision," said godwin. "our board worked diligently through a process to better clarify our brand message of who we are and the geographic area we serve," the president stated. the final result was a new logo, a revised name, a new chamber online platform, and new and improved programming and events.                                                                                                              chamber ceo janet knauff says the new logo and name represent the strong foundational history of the chamber, now known as the deland & greater west volusia chamber of commerce, as well as the "business forward" innovative approach of this community organization and its leadership. "with the incredible growth west volusia is experiencing, we found ourselves answering the same questions on a daily basis about our former name of deland area chamber & orange city alliance. now businesses will be clear that we serve all of west volusia county," said knauff.                                                                                                              retaining deland in the new name was only natural as the chamber’s roots are woven deep into the economic development history of the volusia county seat. the organization is known for its legacy as a developer and accelerator of programs that have grown into independent or countywide organizations. the deland area chamber convened a “committee of 100” in the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s before there were countywide economic development organizations. this group was part of similar economic development organizations that were pulled together into the volusia county business development corp., a public/private organization. this organization then transitioned into enterprise volusia, which became the economic development set up with the public volusia county economic development division and the private team volusia economic development corp.                                                                                                 the mainstreet committee formed by deland area chamber, later spun off into the mainstreet deland association as the chamber had broadened its scope beyond the downtown corridor to a regional chamber for west volusia. still going strong, the chamber and msda have tight bonds and partner together to serve downtown deland. part of the chamber’s evolution over the past century has reflected a changing business world and resulted in a more strategic business focus. the chamber moved away from the old role of tourist or welcome center in 2006, with the formation of the separate west volusia tourism advertising authority, which continues to be a valued partner of the chamber.                                                                                                  in 2013, the city of orange city partnered with the deland area chamber of commerce to form the orange city alliance. this partnership positioned the chamber as the official voice of the orange city business community through the business retention & expansion (bre) program. the chamber began serving orange city, along with their established bre partnership with the city of deland, by visiting and surveying existing businesses with the goals of addressing issues and collecting informative feedback to strategically strengthen business retention and economic development.                                                                                                              included in the new chamber rebrand, the orange city alliance also debuted a fresh modern logo update at the annual meeting to match the deland & greater west volusia branding. the chamber maintains a separate website as a resource specifically for orange city businesses at                                              www.orangecityalliance.com                                  , along with an orange city alliance facebook page. "orange city is our retail-commercial capital of west volusia and a vital part of our regional economy," states chamber ceo janet knauff, "and our partnership with orange city is one of our top priorities."                                                      "every business community in the 6 municipalities and surrounding areas that we serve have their own unique needs and we strive to build our programming around their interests," says knauff. last year in 2022, the chamber expanded to 4 locations in west volusia with the deland main office and satellite offices in orange city, debary, and deltona, also adding 2 additional full-time staff members. business resource workshops on a variety of topics are offered at the new locations free of charge to members and nonmembers alike.                                                                                     this year in 2023, incoming president libby molesky of complete parachute solutions is expanding the chamber board of directors to include 4 divisional vice-presidents that will each serve as chair for the newly formed chamber councils representing deland, orange city, debary and deltona. the city of lake helen and town of pierson will also be represented within the councils. the divisional vps were sworn in at the annual meeting & installation on january 23                                  rd                                               , and it was announced that more information will be released soon on the mission and purpose of the councils and how chamber members may apply to serve on a council.                                                                                                 at 133 years strong, the chamber continues to build on its legacy of service to the west volusia region by facilitating connections, growth, opportunities, and resources for small to large businesses, corporate entities, and nonprofit organizations. now known as the deland & greater west volusia chamber of commerce, this well-respected organization continues traditions with long-standing events such as the west volusia state of the region and west volusia crystal apple awards as well as programs including school of excellence, school of government, and leadership west volusia now in its 38th year.                                                                   today, the chamber remains the largest business network in west volusia with a membership of almost 600 businesses representing thousands of employees across west volusia, and over 100 networking events per year including a weekly average attendance of 70 at the monday morning office octane meetup. the robust event lineup for 2023 includes 3 new mega events focused on supporting businesses in the areas most requested from recently collected feedback. vision 2023 – a growth, sustainability & economic vitality summit is slated for spring, followed by brand 2023 – a small business marketing & innovation convention scheduled for summer, and talent 2023 – a workforce solutions conference will round out the year in fall 2023. each mega event includes a variety of programming over a consecutive 3-day period.                                                                                                              following the annual meeting, members will receive a new "member menu" of benefits along with plaques and decals with the new logo. according to chamber ceo janet knauff, the chamber staff has worked diligently over the past 6 months to transition to a new platform that offers a radical upgrade to chamber membership. "now equipped with the latest technology in the chamber world, the deland & greater west volusia chamber of commerce is poised to meet the needs of businesses in this digital age," knauff says.                                                                                                 members will also see a continuation and enhancement of the 2 chamber initiatives this year, women empowered and west volusia wellness. founded in 2018 by the chamber and stetson university, the mission of women empowered is to engage and inspire women through leadership development. building on the successful storytelling series of 2019-2022, this year we will launch a ted-style talk event titled empower west volusia and host "the chamber goes pink" in october 2023 to promote breast cancer awareness and recognize our healthcare industry workforce in west volusia.                                                                                     the west volusia wellness initiative of the chamber and west volusia tourism will continue the mission of empowering west volusia to live a wellness lifestyle, leading business community wellness for employees, and uniting our local wellness professionals for a stronger and more cohesive network of care through referrals. with the new digital platform of the chamber, members and employees will be provided a texting keyword to access the app for a provider list and discounted offers on products and services. all 8 dimensions of wellness are represented in the w.i.n. (wellness initiative network), which also includes wellness destination tourism.                                                                   ﻿                                                                  chamber committees have been revitalized and 2023 committee chairs were announced at the chamber annual meeting. the government affairs committee, formerly legislative affairs, will host a new town hall series in 2023. and the newly launched chamber trustee program has so far brought together a total of 24 businesses and municipalities who have become legacy investors in the chamber mission and vision for west volusia. together, with their partners and investors, the deland & greater west volusia chamber of commerce is well-prepared to support and advocate on behalf of our business communities for the next 133 years!

marketing and psychology go hand in hand. you can’t have a strong marketing plan without                                                      understanding how your ideal client thinks. what makes one piece of marketing stand out –                                                      while another piece flops?                                                                                                            here are a 6 hacks when it comes to using psychology in your marketing:                                                                                                            fomo                                                      the human brain is wired to avoid losses and seek equivalent gains. we are always on the lookout                                                      for a better deal, and that includes online. modern studies show we prefer not to lose out when                                                      there’s an opportunity of gaining something else instead – just like in practice! one great example                                                      would be how amazon has these “deal of the day” offers where you can get savings by setting up                                                      timing so it happens automatically every day at specific times (and they make us buy faster too).                                                                                                            the zeigarnik effect                                                      the zeigarnik effect is the tendency for tasks which have been interrupted and uncompleted to be                                                      better remembered than tasks which have been completed. we all know that feeling of looking away                                                      from your desk and realizing you’ve been sitting there for 30 minutes without doing anything. you                                                      don’t want to forget about those unfinished tasks, but it’s hard when you constantly need reminders!                                                      e-commerce platforms use sms marketing as one way they remind their previous customers about                                                      left in cart items soakers get them completed–and this works because we humans treasure our time                                                      more than anything else.                                                                                                            cognitive dissonance                                                      cognitive dissonance is a term for the state of discomfort felt when two or more modes of thought                                                      contradict each other. the clashing cognitions may include ideas, beliefs, or the knowledge that one                                                      has behaved in a certain way.                                                                                     cognitive dissonance strategies that require a consumer to reconcile two conflicting views by buying                                                      a product can be effective in marketing, especially if the reconciliation of opposing views protects or                                                      enhances the consumer’s self-image.                                                                                     for instance, you consider yourself a savvy automotive enthusiast. in the course of a visit to a                                                      high-end auto dealership, the salesperson emphasizes that “a lot of americans aren’t sophisticated                                                      enough to understand why this car is actually a great buy.” on the one hand, if you resist the sales                                                      pitch for this very expensive car, you appear unsophisticated; on the other hand, if you agree, then                                                      you’re progressing down the marketing patch toward the purchase of a car you can’t afford.                                                      faced with this kind of cognitive dissonance, many consumers will go along with the sales pitch to                                                      avoid being viewed as an unsophisticated person without the real knowledge required to fully                                                      appreciate the car.                                                                                                            decoy effect                                                      this psychology hack is ruined now as its not just limited to marketers. viral videos have educated                                                      everyone about this but it still works.                                                                                     in decoy effect, you use a product with 3 tiers and the price of 2nd and 3rd product tier has a small                                                      difference which makes customer go for the 3rd and most expensive tier.                                                      a common example is starbucks pricing strategy a large coffee is $6.5, medium is $6 and the small                                                      is $5. this pricing makes you go for the large as the difference is small and you think you are                                                      actually saving on choosing the large coffee.                                                                                                            pricing protocol                                                      does the way you write a price make it seem higher or lower? of course! we already know that                                                      including a currency symbol can have a negative effect – that’s why you see some restaurants                                                      pricing a steak at “29” instead of “$29”. but new research shows that punctuation and decimals                                                      can make a difference in how people perceive prices.                                                                                     according to a new study published in the journal of consumer psychology, prices that have more                                                      syllables when spoken actually seem higher to consumers. commas (e.g., “$1,699”) and cents                                                      after the decimal (e.g., “1699.00”) add to the number of syllables and hence make the price seem to                                                      be of higher magnitude. this effect occurs even when the price is written and not spoken – our                                                      brains, they say, use the auditory representation in storing the magnitude of the price even when the                                                      price is only seen visually.                                                                                     the effect is due to the way one would express the number verbally: “one thousand six hundred                                                      ninety nine,” for the comma version, vs. “sixteen ninety nine” for the unpunctuated version. visual                                                      length may also be a factor.                                                                                                            social proof                                                      social proof is a psychological phenomenon, popularized by dr. robert cialdini, that describes our                                                      tendency to rely on the opinions or actions of others to inform our own. also known as informational                                                      social influence, it validates a shopper’s choice, saying that it’s worth their time, money, or interest by                                                      using other people as proof.                                                                                                            whether you’re familiar with social proof or not, chances are it has influenced decisions, both big                                                      and small, throughout your life. leveraging the appeal of following the “wisdom of the crowd,” social                                                      proof captures our attention because we’re naturally curious about what’s happening, why it’s                                                      happening, and what the correct behavior or response is.                                                      social proof makes people pause to pay attention to a brand because others are saying that it’s                                                      worth paying attention to.                                                                                                            marketing is a very tricky business. you have to be aware of your audience’s behavior, as well as the                                                      underlying motivation that would impact their buying decisions in order for your marketing campaign                                                      or plan to work effectively- which can sometimes seem almost too difficult!                                                      having that foundation in psychology can greatly improve your marketing strategy. i don’t believe                                                      there isn’t a marketer out there who doesn’t appreciate the psychology behind their marketing.                                                      to learn more about marketing your business, contact carbonsilk.digital today.
