faculty
 we at cula® understand that the quality of our services is strongly connected to the expertise of our service providers or faculty. cula is always looking for additional "independent contractors" with language and academic qualifications. send your curriculum vita to: dean of faculty, 4712 admiralty way #707, marina del rey, ca 90292. part time positions stress expertise as well as academic achievement. service providers are hired by students, but are approved by cula®.
in this relationship it is our duty and our passion to find the best available mentors worldwide for our tailored programs to match the diverse needs of retired and retiring adults. the members of our faculty are accredited by the cula® trustees advisory board and we are proud to have on our team highly successful people acknowledged in their own fields and businesses. only through higher standards in education can we best impact what our members believe and share as "truths." you will find ceos, presidents, consultants, trainers, and entrepreneurs among the cula® family of faculty mentors.
for reasons of privacy, cula® no longer publishes its changing list of faculty at the cula® website. qualified candidates at the master and doctoral levels - in fields offered by cula® - are invited to apply for adjunct faculty (professor/faculty mentor) positions by sending a letter of application via regular post, via the contact form provided at cula.edu/contact or simply email to dean-of-faculty@cula.edu. suggested accompanying documentation is as follows.
