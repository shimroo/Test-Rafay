 testimonials
 













“beautiful well maintained park with full amenities”
this park has new owners since summer 2020. they have maintained it well and provided clean bathrooms and reasonable laundry. the sites are wide and mostly level. there is a lake at the end of the park. wifi is excellent though cell service is spotty. it is right on the highway so some spots have highway noise, which doesn’t bother me at all. owners are friendly and helpful. if i’m ever in that area again i will stay here.
