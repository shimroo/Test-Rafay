our work



for sfchc, healing justice looks like practicing health care that is whole-person and expansive



if we are to truly address the structures and conditions that shape the health and wellness of our communities long before medical intervention, we must think of health care expansively. we believe that health care starts with healing justice and meeting the basic needs of our communities. our culturally informed services are designed by the very people we serve. 



socialservices health and well-being requires more than just medical care. health care should be expansive and must address the social and structural conditions that impact the health and wellness of our communities. 




movementbuilding we mobilize our communities, cultivate relationships with policy-makers and change-makers, and follow community leadership to move us towards a community-centered vision for health justice.




healthservices affirming and client-driven health services address the medical and mental health needs of historically marginalized communities that many conventional health care services fail to meet.
