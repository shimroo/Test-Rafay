            land acknowledgment 
          









as we gather on the quad at oneroof youth services, the board of directors, staff, and youth acknowledge that the land on which our  buildings are situated is the traditional home of the haudenosaunee (ho-deh-no-show-nee), anishinaabe (ah-nish-nah-bay) and neutral people. we recognize and deeply appreciate their historic connection to this place. we acknowledge the enduring presence of the indigenous people with whom we share this land today — their achievements, and their overwhelming contributions to our communities. we offer this acknowledgement as an act of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples of canada.
