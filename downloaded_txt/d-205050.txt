here are a few of our google reviews
robert steinbaueri recently had the pleasure of working with fibertec, and i cannot express enough how impressed i am with their outstanding service and attention to detail. from the initial inquiry to the pickup, every step of the process was characterized by professionalism, expertise, and efficiency.

one of the standout features of my experience was the exceptional guidance provided by roy. his expertise was evident from the start, as he took the time to understand my specific needs and preferences. unlike other companies i had considered, roy provided invaluable advice that went beyond mere product knowledge. he shared insights on design trends and energy efficiency and helped me make informed decisions about the perfect patio doors for my home.

i must also commend the exceptional service provided by the hardworking crew who assisted me in loading the patio doors onto my trailer. their dedication to ensuring the safe and secure transportation of my patio doors was truly impressive. it was a seamless collaboration from start to finish, and their commitment to excellence at every stage left a lasting positive impression on me. i am grateful for the outstanding efforts of the entire team at fibertec, making my experience with them truly exceptional from product selection to delivery.

in short, my experience with fibertec was truly exceptional. the combination of expert advice from the sales associate and the swift responses to inquiries, coupled with the unmatched craftsmanship of the product, makes them a standout choice in the window and door industry. i wholeheartedly recommend fibertec to anyone in search of high-quality products and unparalleled customer service. they have certainly earned my trust and appreciation.bruce kellyas part of an energy update of our georgian bay home i was pleased to work with roy p. replacement of 4 windows,  2 of which were very large and complex to design. already feeling the benefits with less radiant cooling with our new triple pane windows.daniel nahmiasafter fully renovating our home, and replacing all of our windows (16+ windows, some as large as 12ft wide, some curved and some straight), we couldn’t be happier with our fibertec windows. the service was amazing, the windows came out perfectly, and the custom paint was exactly what we hoped for. our builder was also very impressed with the product.
we have even had strangers come knock on our door to ask where we got our windows from.
also, compared to aluminum clad windows, we were able to save a significant amount of money.
10/10 would recommend fibertec.shanworking with roy was an absolute pleasure! from the initial consultation to the final installation, roy's expertise and genuine care made the entire process seamless.

roy's knowledge about their windows and his patient approach during the consultation were impressive. he took the time to explain the different options available and answered all my questions in detail. i appreciated that he never pressured me and guided me towards the perfect windows for my home.herb eppthank goodness we worked with roy p..  kudos to him for helping us. it has been a year ago that our new windows were installed. one triple pane slider window gave us an issue, the other windows which are casement did not. we noticed early in january 2023 that there was cold air and yes, we could see daylight along the bottom where the windows meet in the middle. we reached out directly to the company and after some time of back and forth, roy p., himself, came to our home recently and took to the task of taking out or window (right side) and installing the "fuzzy wuzzy" weather stripping. there was never an issue with our installers who did a great job. roy went above and beyond our expectations.   we recommend  that a final lookover/inspection before delivery occurs to the customer.
