paramhansa yogananda (left) and his disciple, swami kriyananda • our spiritual lineage





sunday services include comparative readings and talks from the bible and the bhagavad gita (one of india’s most beloved scriptures). the emphasis is on the underlying truths shared by the great religions. our service is based on the  teachings of paramhansa yogananda, author of the spiritual classic, autobiography of a yogi and his direct disciple, swami kriyananda. 













yogananda’s teachings are delightfully free of dogma; he encourages spiritual seekers to test the ideas he shares in the laboratory of their own lives. his god is “nearer than the near; dearer than the dear” — knowable as the closest friend. through meditation and uplifted consciousness in daily life (awareness, kindness, openness), we become more aware of ourselves as spiritual beings; less bound by our individual drives and ego tendencies. people of any faith are welcome, and may find the services are a place where they can take their own faith and understanding deeper.




““here, i am finding answers to questions i have asked for decades. thank you for shining your love like a lighthouse, guiding me home.””

— d. b. 



meaningful connections with others













one of the most frequent comments by visitors is, “i feel so much joy here!” the smiles you’ll meet are genuine. ananda is a place of music, laughter, deep spiritual fellowship, and a refreshing sense of humor.




“i felt at home the moment i heard the music. so much joy. i felt tears of gratitude to have found what i was seeking after a lifetime of searching.”

— karen k, mountain view



all are welcomeananda’s primary goal is to help people achieve self-realization. “self-realization is the eternal message of religion. whatever your beliefs and practices, the essential purpose of religion is to help you to fulfill your own highest potential, as a child of god.” —paramhansa yogananda.

what we believe

ananda offers classes, support, and inspiration to to all, regardless of race, religion, national origin, gender, orientation, age, or disability. we are committed to providing a supportive environment for everyone to deepen and enrich their spiritual lives.
