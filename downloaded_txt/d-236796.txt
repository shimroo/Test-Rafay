luxury minivan guided travel and vacations discover italy with your own privatechauffeur guide


	a la carte italy tours offers exclusively private
	driver-guide tours. all our tours are custom-made
	to suit your needs, tastes and dates, and are
	run on an exclusive basis. we never mix
	passengers who do not know each other.
	 

minivan tours

discover the beauty and history of italy with your private driver and
		guide. he will personally attend to your needs at all times. your tour in
		italy will be made for you exclusively, and excursions will be customized
		to match your exact dates, specific needs and special interests.
		we only offer custom escorted travel across italy with private
		air-conditioned minivan or limousine transport.
	 

private guides

your private driver-guide will be complemented by local specialist
		guides, and we will introduce you to real, everyday italy. there are no
		tours in italy better than our private tours in italy.
		


custom travel

we invite you to customize your private tour to suit your interests and
		needs. have a look at some of our pre-designed escorted itineraries
		that offer unique explorations of what italy has to offer. our designer
		tours follow that heritage. we will make you see the natural and
		architectural delights in every corner of italy; whether roman ruins,
		renaissance churches or timeless hilltop villages.
	 

heritage, food and wine

a scenic and comfortable package will be arranged for you to
		maximize your vacation. you will have the opportunity to visit and
		explore some of the beautiful and historical sights, and enjoy our
		informative commentary on your very own excursion in italy, avoiding
		large tour groups and getting out of the beaten path when possible.
		in addition, you will experience authentic italian cuisine, and sample
		some of the fine wines of the world.
	 

american clientele

we know our subject well, and we are based in italy. our clients are
		mostly americans from the usa and canada. without any exception,
		we run each tour especially adapted to your needs and interests. our
		itineraries are made for one couple of travelers; sometimes a small
		group that includes their children, family or friends. we are not able to
		cater for groups larger than six persons, or to supply arrangements
		for independent travelers. that gives you the guarantee of a
		privately guided italy trip tailored to your exact needs, and perfectly organized
		by on-site specialists.
	 



		listen to brian, one of our drivers / tour leaders, talking about the concept of our italian tours.
	 

the real italy

having a private driver and guide allows you to discover italy the
exact way you want to, and at a pace that corresponds to your
needs. the driver not only takes care of directions and getting
around, but also introduces you to friendly italians, little known
places, hidden treasures - a unique and genuine tourism
experience that group tours are unable to offer. your exclusive
custom italy tour will be worth every cent of it. italy has more
unesco world heritage sites than any other country.
