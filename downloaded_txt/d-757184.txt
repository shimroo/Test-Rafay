  local attractions
 the manchester view sits high up on a hill with magnificent sweeping views of the historic route 7a valley and the green and taconic mountain ranges, just over a mile and a half north of the center of town and two miles south of dorset village in southwestern vermont. 'the view' is close to so many local attractions, dining options, local shops and high-end outlet stores, galleries and museums, and natural sights that you'll be busy non-stop, or choose to relax in the comfort of your room or suite. some of vermont's best ski resorts (and warmer weather adventure parks) include bromley, stratton and magic mountains and are just a short drive from the hotel. a visit during any season will be memorable!click on the highlighted link to view our amazing aerial video of the manchester view.
