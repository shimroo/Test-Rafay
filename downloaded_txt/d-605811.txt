		dear cousins

this web site was created to publish the 
		genealogical research completed to date on the descendants of rev 
		william worcester who came to america between 1638 and 1639. this site 
		is "under construction" and will undoubtedly (and hopefully) be under 
		construction for years to come with the addition of new information 
		about individual family members. we all have an obligation 
to future generations to record our 
		history as once this knowledge is forgotten, it will be lost forever. 

please 
		use this opportunity to share your knowledge of your immediate family 
		members with future generations of worcesters. i hope you and your 
		family enjoy this site. i look forward to hearing from you. you can 
		

contact me by e-mail or snail mail.
