services
integration is at the heart of what we do. you can choose to work with one, all, or a combination of our services--whatever your project requires.
 



timber frame


design + build


high performance enclosures


fine woodworks


pioneer millworks





this is our genesis and our heart. we have spent three decades creating a balance of craft, efficiency, and engineering. we are focused on delivering the best timber frame in the industry. and deliver is the key word. the craftspeople who fabricate your posts and beams are those who raise them anywhere in the united states. click here to learn more about our timber frame services.
 
 



whether you are already working with a designer or architect or hire us to design your project, it all starts here. your project is too important, your program too unique to you. 
walking our talk is our dna. we have over 30 years of general contracting experience in selected projects. this is a joy, and more importantly, a continual education from new technologies, improved job management, and, you bet, smart and challenging clients. we incorporate all of this into our work, and you benefit at whatever level of build you need us for. click to learn more about design or read details about our build capabilities.
 



with our 30+ years of sustainable building & manufacturing history we have developed a unique insight into off-site fabrication that has inspired us to help others build to a high level of performance. we call this hpez™—high performance made easier™. we collaboratively adapt our enclosure systems to the design specifications of each project. we partner with architects to evaluate the schematic designs of a project so they can be optimized for panel fabrication, resulting in an accessible enclosure solution for high-performance and passive house construction. click here to learn more about our high performance enclosures.
 



we call this group newwoodworks, and for more than 20 years these craftspeople have fabbed the finest and most challenging cabinetry, doors, stairs, and furniture. it was a natural evolution, bringing this added skill and consistency to our projects and clients. click here to learn more about newwoodworks
 



for more than 30 years our sister company pioneer millworks has been inspired to develop creative reclaimed and sustainable wood flooring, paneling, decking, and siding from their east and west coast mills. they offer numerous species, grades, textures, and color options for architects and designers that are easy for builders to install and have a story homeowners and end-users can connect with. most importantly they provide natural building material options that are healthy for people and our planet. visit their website.

in 2018 we became an employee-owned company (esop) and though we’ve always run like our coworkers were our stock-holders, it feels right to be a reality. these are the faces behind our projects and the stories about where they come from.

postcard of the day



february 18, 2025


 the hilltop project is getting siding, metal roofing, and other exterior finishing details. the modern black with contrasting bright t&g porch, lack of overhangs, and tall slim windows really highlights the simplicity of the home's form. amplified by the black-on-white with the snow, and visually you get a sense of the forward-thinking and intention that went into the buildings high-performance details. project partners:river architectshilltop constructionsash and frametimber hpstudio a landscape architecture + engineering, dpc
