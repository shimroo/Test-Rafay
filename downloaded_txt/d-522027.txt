idea audit 



as you read the report, please note that it states that, “black board members who recently resigned from the afp toronto board were offered an opportunity to be interviewed but all declined”. in fact, múthoní karíukí, nneka allen and olumide akerewusi did not decline to be interviewed, but rather, when approached, requested clarification regarding the objectives and the outcomes of dr. massaquoi’s idea audit report. their request for clarification was in fact ignored.
