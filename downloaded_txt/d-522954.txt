											exceptional care										

“please accept this check in memory of our father. the care that he received was exceptional! the care and compassion that my father and the family received from your staff is beyond what words can express. every employee that we encountered was so friendly, warm and helpful.
your hospital is top notch!!! thank you!”


												- med foundation donor, mercer county community hospital 







											team reido										

“sending a quick thank you to everyone for all the gifts – we sincerely appreciate it all. a special thanks to some anonymous mercer health employees who left a gift in our mailbox this weekend. we may not know who you are but think all of mercer health employees are fantastic people! from the day reid was diagnosed the nurse (i think her name was megan) and dr. dues who quickly diagnosed him and comforted us, were both so great and kept things moving quickly. the girls working at the front desks are so sweet when they check us in to see the great workers in the lab. the lab girls all know reid by now and make him feel so comfortable. in fact last week when we went for a lab draw he commented on how fast and painless they were. we are all so lucky and blessed to have such a fantastic hospital with wonderful workers that care so much for their patients. thank you!!!”


												- sandy r., mercer county community hospital
