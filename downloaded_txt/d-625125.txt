welcome to town & county golf links





our expansive course features a distinctive layout for each nine. we host a traditional links-style front nine featuring generous fairways and wide greens, as well as a more challenging back nine favoring accuracy and geared towards shot makers.
have a relaxing round of golf on our front nine, or test yourself at any one of our signature back nine holes.
common to all 18 holes are rye grass fairways and bent grass greens lined with deep rough and tall fescue. the links-style layout also invites the elements – wind, water and sand – to present occasional obstacles. seven ponds and numerous bunkers are strategically placed throughout the course, providing both scenic splendor and considerable challenges.
we have an exceptional and courteous staff- both on the course and in the clubhouse – attending to our guests needs to ensure a private country club treatment at town & country golf links, a public daily fee course.
in the rare occasion that a customer feels they would prefer their own cart, a $25 surcharge will be added.
