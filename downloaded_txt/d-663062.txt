terrific tv toys: welcome back to my life, kotter!!





welcome back ... your dreams were your ticket out. welcome back ... to that same old place that you laughed about ...from the first "oooo! oooo! oooo!" of horshack to the last "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-barino" of vinnie, the mid-'70s sitcom "welcome back, kotter" was a smashing success. and it was rather smashing to rewatch the series on tubi a few months ago. in fact, this author was so smashed by it that i had to do an episode of terrific tv toys dedicated to it, so i went to ebay and bought something "kotter"! it's a patch that you can sew onto a piece of clothing -- remember when those were popular? it's evidently vintage, and i chose my favorite sweathog of the four to grace it. you'll find out which sweathog that was, and you'll see some great reading materials, in the latest t3 episode. as a kid i also had some "welcome back, kotter" comics, and i bought one of the novelizations of the show in later years.

we're off to a rousing start for the 12th big season of the series! see everything on the t3 playlist.

terrific non-tv toys: peanuts 50th anniversary kids' meal toys, wendy's, 2000





a spinning top, a jigsaw puzzle and a few other tricks -- none needing batteries, thankfully! in the first episode of the eighth season of terrific non-tv toys, you get a quick look at a couple toys from each of two sets released by wendy's in 2000 for their popular kids' meals. one is branded for the 50th anniversary of peanuts, which of course first hit our pop culture back in 1950. the other set is simply called "snoopy 2000." what kind of gizmos do these fast-food toys include? tune in and see this author whip them across the room (kinda) ...

just beneath the surface (episode 14) -- "the masks" episode of classic "twilight zone"





a new study of one of rod serling's magnificent studies of human nature, more specifically the classic "twilight zone" episode "the masks," one of the "tz" eps that this author has actually seen quite a few times. that's interesting, given the fact that every time i flip through the channels and see that syfy is having another "tz" marathon, like over a holiday weekend, an episode manages to appear that i have never seen! now how does that happen, when it's one of my all-time favorite shows??? that alone is a "twilight zone" thing. anyway, i do digress! in the latest episode of the just beneath the surface series hosts brian and bruce dive into  (yes!) the greed, the selfishness, the pretenses (hello, facebook!!!!!), the masks we all wear, the not-so-gentle allegory that serling was so well-known for, which shines in this "tz" story. as always, serling has something to say that transcends the decades.

those beloved gloria vanderbilt jeans show up again -- this time on "soap"





if you've ever seen this author's pinterest account, you know i'm a big fan of gloria vanderbilt jeans. since my very first pair in junior high school in the early 1980s, i've owned many, many over the years, along with shirts, shoes, purses, cologne, dishware and anything else gloria i can get my hands on. ms. vanderbilt, who passed away in her 90s in 2019, remains one of my personal heroes. so, as i've been making my way through rewatchings -- or first-time watchings -- of great classic tv shoes on tubi and other likeminded streaming apps, i've been very delighted to see gvs pop up on many of the characters of that late '70s, early '80s timeframe. i blogged before about janet and chrissy wearing them on "three's company." i blogged about the gals of "facts of life," particularly in the first season, wearing them in all colors. and now, for the past few weeks i've been watching the '70s comedy "soap" for the first time, and guess what i see on corinne in the second season:i'm tickled pink! or gray or whatever color they are, with white stitching! (truth be told, they look like they could be the lavender fine cords i got in junior high school, with white stitching. those came from the mail-order alden's catalog -- remember alden's?) anyway, the above shot is from s2e8 of the series. then, in episode 19 of the same season, corinne sported another pair of colored gvs, this time a forest green with white stitching (the image below captured them as a very similar color as the pair above, but they were more green):she wore that pair again in the following episode. this was in 1979, as gvs were riding high in our pop culture, helping lead the charge for the popularity of designer jeans.i'll keep watching for more!

six feet under hollywood: arnold horshack!





wow, we had almost forgotten that he illustrated wesley eure's children's book, and we didn't really know the details of his death (and even the rest of his life). but brbtv certainly enjoyed his performance as arnold horshack on "welcome back, kotter." this author just did a rewatch of the whole series on tubi -- the first time i've really watched the series since its original airing. so this time on brian's six feet under hollywood blog, it's ron paolillo's turn in the spotlight (and note the variance in the last name, which you can see on his grave) ...
six feet under hollywood: arnold horshack!:   ronald gabriel paolillo  was born in new haven, connecticut on april 2, 1949. he was the son of gabriel and carmel, the former of whom ...

a video tour through the former eloise asylum





in june on this very blog you saw some photos of this author's historical tour of the former eloise facility in westland, michigan, commonly called eloise psychiatric hospital or eloise asylum. the videos from that tour have been dropping weekly on my secondary youtube channel, and they're now complete. these clips go in order from the lobby of the kay beard building (once referred to as the "d" building) all the way up to the fifth (top) floor, where the most dangerous patients were once housed -- the criminally insane.

terrific tv toys: "dallas" trading cards, donruss, 1981





trading cards were really a thing back in the 1970s and '80s, and tv shows were popular subjects for them. the latest episode of the t3 series shows you a couple packs of trading cards celebrating the classic primetime soap "dallas." there's ole j.r. ewing, even daddy jock ewing and mom miss ellie, sue ellen, bobby, pam, lucy -- all the regular characters we know and love. they're featured in full-color still shots from episodes of the show. we'll open one pack on camera and keep the other sealed. (but don't worry -- the thoroughly petrified piece of bubble gum is long gone!) special shout-out to alex, our fellow "dallas" fan!

electrawow and dynamite: can you believe judy strangis owns her dynagirl costume?





it was a reunion of the two gals from classic saturday-morning tv's "electrawoman and dynagirl" over the weekend, and our buddy brian was there -- and he even filed a report with brbtv.at an autograph show in new jersey over the weekend, brian, shown above in his gilligan cosplay, got a chance to chat with deidre hall, left, and judy strangis, the stars of the iconic superhero series. they're looking great, he reported, first of all, but he also asked them about their amazing so-'70s costumes from the show, all awash in eye-catching oranges and yellows. what happened to the costumes? what were they like? how many costumes did each gal get for the filming? brbtv was guessing it was "one" for the latter question, given the short time frame that the series aired, along with the minimalist's budgets that shows produced by the kroffts were known for (admittedly, by brothers sid and marty). well, yeah, judy said, she just had one dynagirl costume for the filming -- and she owns it now! so fun!judy didn't always own the outfit, though, she told brian. a friend gifted her with it recently. she has the costume framed at her home (which lynda carter, by the way, has  done with her own screen-used wonder woman costume, though she had more than one for filming; heroes and icons recently reported that she actually owns two of the costumes). of judy, "her husband/handler told me he has yet to see her wear it," brian said. (perhaps that was a bit of a joke on the hub's part, but it's adorable.) deidre hall, who went on after the show to much fame on daytime soaps, does not have her own electrawoman costume, however, she said.two modern photos courtesy of brian lombard; please do not copy without permission.

terrific non-tv toys: "dceased" batgirl figure, dc direct, 2022-2023





since halloween is right around the corner, why don't we take a look at something nice and creepy for the latest episode of the terrific non-tv toys series? this is a batgirl figure from dc direct and dc essentials' "dceased" line, based on the 2019 comic book series of the same name. babsie is a bloody sight to behold, for sure, looking like she stepped off the pages of the walking dead comic series rather than the dc universe.

terrific tv toys: "star trek" fleece throw kit by eugene textiles, 2016; "picard" cap, 2019; vegas con bag, 2021





you ever jump into something that you think is going to take like five minutes and it ends up taking hours? well, my buddy brian gave me a wonderful goodie bag of "star trek" items the last time i saw him, and inside that bag was this "star trek" fleece throw blanket from eugene textiles that i thought i was going to feature nice and quick-like on an episode of the t3 series. yeah, right ... i missed that part that said some assembly was required. this was not a fleece throw -- this was a fleece throw kit. as in, put it together! ok, fine, so i paused the camera a few times and muddled through. you'll see the results in the latest episode of the collectibles series, and you'll even see the finished product! if you've never put together one of these fleece throw kits (am i saying that right? maybe it's throw fleece kits!), it actually is rather enjoyable, and it can be a group activity, like maybe a family activity. just make sure the kids are safe with scissors that are nice and sharp!another item in the goodie bag brian gave me is a cap bearing the insignia for the "star trek: picard" series, which i have not yet watched but will someday watch, i'm sure, being a hard-core "trek" fan who plans to view all "trek" ever produced. then there is the bag itself, which is a cool keepsake from a recent "star trek" las vegas con (no doubt the 2021 con, judging from the imprint on the bag).

thanks again, brian!!!!

an almost-forgotten appearance on the "fave five from fans" podcast





this author came across it almost accidentally, the youtube version of a podcast recorded nearly a couple years ago. but this one was a fun one to do, discussing the villains of the 1966 "batman" tv series with fellow fan jamie ray. jamie had done the "pop ninja" halloween episode with me, patrick and lisa in 2021, and that's when he invited me to do his own podcast, since i was wearing the yvonne craig batgirl costume at the time and was clearly quite the fan. so was joan collins channeling a very early alexis colby as she slithered around the "batman" set as the siren? you can decide -- it comes up for discussion here, along with a lot of discussion of julie newmar's portrayal of catwoman. thanks, jamie, for posting this!

terrific non-tv toys: tuesday taylor, super model walking version, ideal, 1978





if you're a kid of the 1970s and you've ever heard the names tuesday taylor and tiffany taylor -- and especially if you've heard them used interchangeably -- you might be a tad confused. who was tiffany? who was tuesday? were they related? cousins or something? sisters??? this author has to admit to some confusion around these brand names from ideal, because i remembered they were both fashion dolls much like barbie, and i remembered my mom bought me one of them when i was a kid, and i remembered there were other styles of that same doll out there that had a hair-color-changing trick they did with the turn of the top of the skull (yes, believe it), but i was unclear, after all these years, which was which. i started to think my version of the doll, which doesn't change hair color and which has a trick of her own -- walking -- was perhaps the tiffany taylor, then that would make the hair-color-changing version tuesday, right? or was it the other way around? turns out, neither one of those scenarios is correct. we'll solve the mystery, as well as take a nice up-close look at this beautiful 1978 doll from my childhood, in the latest episode of the terrific non-tv toys series ...

a view from marysville hot wheels weekend





special thanks to our roving reporter jason for these shots from this past weekend's car show in marysville, michigan, the marysville hot wheels weekend. special guests were catherine ("daisy duke") bach of "the dukes of hazzard" along with erik estrada and larry wilcox of "chips." brbtv enjoyed that show a few years back and wish we could have made it this time! jason certainly found a kindred spirit in this fellow "dukes" fan, tim, and his fab general lee.

just beneath the surface takes on "twilight zone" episode "the obsolete man"





our friend brian and his friend bruce have done it again -- after some time away, they've posted another discussion of a wonderful classic "twilight zone" episode as part of their "just beneath the surface" web series. this is one of the burgess meredith episodes, and in this one he's living his life in a way that does not suit the powers that be (government). he is planned to be liquidated. this story has remarkable parallels to the world we live in right now, particularly in the area of cancel culture. don't cancel these guys -- just listen in!

terrific tv toys: "dukes of hazzard" cooter's tow truck 1:18, greenlight, 2021





all those good folks rolling through the dusty backroads of hazzard county need a tow once in a while, now don't they? and when they need a tow, they call ole crazy cooter. and even when they just need a few gallons of hoggoco gasoline, they stop by cooter's garage. this nicely detailed toy car in 1:18 scale celebrates both those ideas. you've got the tow truck seen so often on "the dukes of hazzard," as well as a gas pump. so cool. https://youtu.be/riq5dzd2dec?si=vg9kp1-tja760ydy (who knows why youtube's embed code feature hasn't been working the past couple days????)this set was sold at cooter's place, and that's where our friend jason -- brbtv roving reporter -- snagged it. he walks us through this out-of-the-box experience. if you bought one of these limited-edition beauties and prefer to keep it all locked up, step vicariously with us for this unboxing.see what else is on the terrific tv toys playlist.

a look at cooter's 25th anniversary celebration





brbtv was not able to make it to luray, virginia, this past weekend for the 25th anniversary celebration of cooter's place -- 25 big years since the opening of the first store by ben ("cooter davenport") jones of "the dukes of hazzard" and his wife, alma. but our friend brian was there, and he offers these great photos from the event. as you can see, there were plenty of replicas of the show's cars in attendance -- not only the general lee (and at least one screen-used!) but also sheriff rosco's car, sheriff little's car, cooter's tow truck, daisy's road runner, and even a 00 mustang. so cool. and is that flash's cousin??? many thanks, brian!!!

terrific non-tv toys: "flash gordon" pop! album with freddie mercury, funko, 2022





how is it that these funko pop!s keep gravitating toward brbtv headquarters? they seem to come from far and wide, and we've featured quite a few of them on the two collectible series of the brbtv channel. for this one, we've got our longtime friend, whom we refer to as the mysterious claw game avenger who shall remain nameless, to thank. he knows when he sees something freddie mercury or queen, we've got to have it. so he snagged this one in august 2023 at a metro detroit store. this is part of funko's pop! album series, and there are some others out there that you can look up online. there's even another queen one that looks absolutely awesome, and you'll see a pic of it at the end of this episode.

created in 1998, brbtv is a series of fun fact books and shorter reference guides on classic television shows: primetime soaps "dynasty" and "dallas," the action-adventures "the dukes of hazzard," "wonder woman," "the secrets of isis" and "the green hornet," along with a host of fab animated series like "super friends" and "scooby-doo." founded with the mission of spreading "peace, love and useless information about television," brbtv seeks to inform, with a solid journalistic expertise, on these shows and their stars, as well as a sprinkling of the tv world in general. 

while this news blog takes a journalistic approach, with many posts delivered straight-on, you will see some attitude here. you will see an opinion or three (and unfortunately, you will see us attempt to crack jokes once in a while!). that's why a blog format was chosen. just sayin'.
