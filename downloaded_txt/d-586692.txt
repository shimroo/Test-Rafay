	 dear leader has a special guest blogger today.
	 
    


hi, karl rove here.  when dear leader asked me to "guest blog" for him because he was busy with a new video game, i had no damned idea what he was talking about.  i had to ask my son, who is pretty good with computers.  anyway when i saw this thing i hit the ceiling.  apparently he's been "blogging" since spring of '05.  nobody in opotus had a clue he was doing it.  after all the time we spend training him to stay on message, he was saying anything he wanted... the drinking, internal white house conversations, it's all on here.  i was ready to spring into full-on disaster mode when i checked the stats, and it turns out nobody reads this thing.which is good because we really don't need an eruption of bad news right now.  we do a great job keeping him sheltered from things that might upset him, but it's starting to get through that he really screwed the pooch on iraq.  just the other day he was asking me if baby jesus was still going to let him into heaven, and of course i told him it was all right, but it's really starting to become a problem politcally.  according to our internal polling the only demo that still believes in dear leader is white evangelicals who live in manufactured housing.  which is fine, we can maintain our grip on power with just those people.  we'll just do what we always do, which is smear the democrats as weak faggots who can't be trusted to keep us safe.  and we'll threaten more terrorists attacks if the dems win.  well, anyway, that's my "guest blog."  i guess it's a good outlet for him, we'll let him keep doing it.  p.s.  we have been assuming dear leader operates on a ninth-grade level, but i think we're going to have to dial it down a bit more.

hi... you no i have bin goin around the contry havin conversashinis about my plan for helth savins acouonts and it is my main domestic prioority rite now so i bet you are all talkin about it and want to no more... and why it is a real good idea.well... you see the helth problem that we have in this contry is... that people are gettin too much helth care... for stuff they dont really need and it is gettin to be real expensive for the system.so my plan is you pay for yoor own dam helth care with your own dam money... and that way you will quit buyin too much.  so if the doctor says you need an operashin... like if you have canser or somethin and it will cost 50 thousin dollers to fix... an you dont have the money you can say no way docter i will just have the canser.  so you see it is a real good plan.bye for nowps  this thing about the leak is some bull shit... we had to stop that god dam traiter wilson from attackin our war support.. and i tole dick cheney he can do what ever he wants to dis credit wilson... and that is all what is the god dam big deal.  bye

      hi... you no a lot of pepole are askin me about iraq... and they are wantin reashurince that things are goin real good over there... well... it is my job as dear leader to say wat i think and talk real resinable... and i say things is goin real good excsept... the dam media likes to talk about exploshins and stuff.like yestiday... about 60 terorists got real jelis of our fredom and attacked a polise station... well... that hapins every day over here too... but the news papers only get innerested when its over there.  and i disagree with that.an any way my aids are telin me it is too soon to juge if this is a sucess... if iraq gets a stable govermint... in like 50 or a hunnnert years.... then it will be a sucess... so shut up you juging people.
