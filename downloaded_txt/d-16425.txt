 when we learn why we do the things we do, we are able to focus on healing our wounds and changing our own behaviors. we will then begin to grow, mature, develop true character, and develop healthy relationships. life skills will give you the information and tools you need to reach your fullest potential in any area of your life, including personal relationships. we will help you break the cycle of family issues that go from generation to generation.

the founderspaul hegstrom lived the first forty years of his life not understanding the driving force that caused him to self-destruct again and again. he could not understand why his anger would never subside. he could not communicate or identify his feelings. his anger harmed his family, and nothing was ever resolved. he knew something was wrong, but lived his life in denial. over $20,000 was spent on counseling where he was given “labels,” however, it never got to the root of his problem. this only added to his anger and frustration. his 16-year marriage ended because he could not get the help he needed. the violence continued in subsequent relationships and finally, after being involved in a life-threatening situation that could have meant 15-20 years in prison, he asked for help. it was the hardest thing he ever had to do.read more...

our presidentpresident/ceo heidi (hegstrom) stupavsky is the daughter of dr. paul and judy hegstrom, founders of life skills international.heidi has worked for life skills, formerly dvp learning centers, inc. since 1985.  she is very familiar with all aspects of life skills since she has worked in every area of the company, including being the executive director of her own life skills affiliate where she taught women's and youth classes.  she was privileged to work with columbine students and their mothers.  heidi also traveled with her parents from 1985-1989, touring the u.s. presenting the program to women's shelters and churches.  as a result, she was interviewed along with her parents on programs such as:  focus on the family, 700 club, d. james kennedy, usa today, and other local television stations. in the spring of 2017 heidi was voted in as president after the passing of her father, dr. paul.  she believes in the "learning to live, learning to love" program because it was what brought their broken family back together.  she faced many issues of her own, and was able to become free of behaviors that caused her to react to the abuse she endured as a child.
