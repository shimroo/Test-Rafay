oil paintings by cincinnati 
        artist christopher brian. 
        commissioned landscape, still 
        life & portrait oil paintings 
        on canvas.
chris brian is an 
        impatient/patient artist, a man with a mission. he is, he maintains, still 
        looking for confidence-particularly as he seeks balance in his compositionswhile 
        attempting to find the essence of images. he is passionate in his study 
        of the old masters; caravaggio is, in a sense, his mentor. like him, brian 
        goes to canvas, skipping the preliminaries of drawing, loving the feel 
        of the art materials. while investigating the old masters, brian develops 
        visual narrative; he loves studying art history books, and the viewer 
        can see influences from millet and bouguereau. his still lives are beautifully 
        rendered, and he is particularly insightful when interpreting light. he 
        feels humbled by the classical works of the 15th through the 17th centuries, 
        including the renaissance and baroque periods.
a student of classical 
        realism, brian paints in oil because of the proven permanence and lasting 
        beauty of this medium; the paintings can last for 400 years. when coloration 
        is done well, its like candy for the eyes, he states. his prizewinning 
        still life, onions and garlics, is very effective, both in its depth 
        and lighting as well as in its minimal use of color. morning in deep 
        woods, is a moody, misty oil on canvas painted with astute understanding. 
        his penetrating eye sees interactions of color and light that we associate 
        with the old masters. brian has a great reverence for a well-executed 
        painting; he maintains that he would like to interview rembrandt. brian 
        is an artist to watch. this former businessman used to employ 50 people, 
        but states that making art is even more challenging.
chris brian is a refreshing 
        and intelligent painter, a thoughtful man on purpose. he, like other 
        mid-career artists, is investigating and reinterpreting the concepts of 
        art history, while also searching for beauty; qualities that i find coming 
        back into art these days. i recommend chris brians work enthusiastically.

artist's 
        statement:
"i believe 
          that in order to find your own style and purpose in painting, one must 
          pass through the works of the old masters and understand the original 
          foundations of this visual art."
