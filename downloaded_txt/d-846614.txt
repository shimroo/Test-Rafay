but look at ads for japanese menstrual clothing

                                              an interesting e-mailer
                                              sent the following:
i'm a
                                                bookworm and a history
                                                lover, and came across
                                                your website in the
                                                past while researching
                                                historical
                                                products/methods used
                                                for menstruation.
                                                this was quite some time
                                                ago, but today i was
                                                researching china, and
                                                it's
                                                relationship to giant
                                                pandas of all things,
                                                when i came across a
                                                blip that
                                                said women in
                                                  ancient china may have
                                                  used panda pelts as a
                                                  sort of sanitary
napkin.

                                                i tried to skim through
                                                the site to see if you'd
                                                mentioned this anywhere,
                                                but so far haven't seen
                                                it mentioned, so i
                                                thought i'd email you
                                                the info i
                                                found.

                                                the statement read:

                                                "the few known uses
                                                include the szechuan

                                                referring to, it might

                                                anyhow, i just thought
                                                it might be of some

                                          done so.

 "hi, just read your
                                        article about menstruating and
                                        devices used when menstruating
                                        in earlier times. my mother was
                                        from england and i know that
                                        going back to her great
                                        grandmothers they made pads with
                                        cotton or wool in them to absorb
                                        the blood. they attached them to
                                        their underwear with safety pins
                                        or straight pins that they
                                        blunted and bent under. she
                                        showed me a couple that she had
                                        saved when i started. they would
                                        boil them clean."

                                                the us navy. we had to
                                                do drills with fake
                                                rifles. most of us women
                                                did not have a lot of
                                                muscle and padding on

                                                the fake rifles. so we
                                                used stick-on mini pads
