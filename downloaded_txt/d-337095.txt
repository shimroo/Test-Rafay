new international vat and/or sales tax charges
as of 1/1/2021 i can't ship to great britain without
    you paying the vat. i do not have a vat
     number so if you have a vat number you must supply it to me when
    placing your order.
    this is also going to be happening with many other countries starting july
    1, 2021
for the sales i make on
    ebay this is not a problem since ebay will collect the vat
    norway has been charging a 20% sales tax on my ebay orders since july, 2020
since march 1st,
    2005, most of the orders i shipped that were over one pound went by usps

    priority mail instead of ups.
    there are two major reasons for this change in my shipping policy.

1. ups
    charges have become excessive for residential delivery addresses, especially for residential
    outlying
    areas. most of my customers are residential and over half are in the outlying areas.
    if ups
    shipping is required
    for a residential address, (even if operating a business at the address), there will be an additional shipping
    charge.

2.  usps
has added many new "flat rate",
    "regional rate" for boxes and envelopes since 2005.
     i can use  these boxes/envelopes
     to ship to all locations with a us zip code.
    this has made my usps
    shipping costs to the  western
    usa and outside the continental
     usa substantially less, plus it has improved
    this delivery time  dramatically , two to four days in the continental us, instead
    of three
     to seven days, a huge benefit for these customers.i
    ship  usps  orders 1st class or priority, if over 1 pound, to anywhere in the
    world that has
    us zip code.

 cod orders by e-mail
    or 
    phone are accepted from us customers* only. for usps
    (us post office) cod 
     i will charge
    a maximum of $12.00. this also insures the package. the maximum
    cod charge that  usps

    accepts is  $1,000.00, which also includes the $12.00 fee. the maximum
    i will charge for ups  cod is
    $15.00
     for any size order.
    (*this includes
    most customers with a us zip code that uses us dollars for payment)


    if usps cod is used
    to ship your order you can pay the post office with a personal check
    or money order made out to "david edwards"
    do not make out to "david edwards transmission parts"
also do not make it out to the postmaster.
    
you
    can also pay with cash at the post office. 
 if you pay with
    cash there will be a usps fee for a postal money order.


    for canadian customers: you can no
    longer pay with a green canadian postal money order
     in us funds as in has been discontinued, you must now use paypal, cod is not available.

for international customers:
you must use paypal
 if available to you.

     also if you can't or won't use paypal, you can use western union to
    send
    the payment. i understand
     that they charge 4% to 5% of the amount you are transferring for this service.  it is very quick and i
     get paid immediately. the parts would then normally ship one to two days after i receive the payment.

i am not setup to take credit cards directly, for
information
for paying by
 visa, mastercard, discover or american express click on
paypal
below.


you do not need to be a paypal member to pay by credit card

i accept paypal
    for any size order


    click here >>>paypal



(there is no additional cost to you for using
    paypal)



    an order for any rebuilding kit or
    that is $150.00 or over or any other
    order over $600.00 will be postpaid anywhere that has a us zip code.

for any usa orders under $600.00, except for a rebuilding kit,
    there
    would be a minimum of $4.00 to a maximum of $18.00 s & h charge.


massachusetts residents must add 6.25% sales tax
