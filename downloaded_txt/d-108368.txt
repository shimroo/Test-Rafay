visions | out now



9-time grammy winning singer, songwriter, and pianist norah jones has released her ninth solo studio album visions, a collaboration with producer and multi-instrumentalist leon michels, as well as the official video for the song “paradise” directed by joelle grace taylor which celebrates the rollercoaster of life. visions is a vibrant and joyful 12-song set that is the yang to the yin that was pick me up off the floor, jones’ last album of new original songs which was released early in the pandemic lockdown of 2020 and foreshadowed many of the dark emotions of that period.“don't try to second-guess norah jones. just when you think you've got her figured out, she'll reinvent herself... ‘visions’ [is] her most unpredictable yet, a fruitful collaboration with producer leon michels… jones has rediscovered her mojo… [the] multi-grammy-winning singer/songwriter finds joy in musical rebirth.”—mojo ★★★★“‘visions,’ a funky, gently psychedelic garage-soul record that puts her sultry vocals amid fuzzy guitars, off-kilter drums and crinkly vintage keyboards.”—los angeles times
