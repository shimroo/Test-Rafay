lost landmarks of upstate new york


 






someday the puzzle that is upstate new york will be insoluable because of its missing pieces. 
its days as the high road west are memorialized by its canalside towns' oversized hotels. its career as a manufactory is remembered in red brick factories and the mansions of carpet or celluloid collar or glove moguls.



click the thumbnail images to see these memorials before they disappear through demolition, fire, or even heavy snow.
