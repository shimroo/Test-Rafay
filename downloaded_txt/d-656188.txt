johnson’s beach is your oyster; we invite you to follow the feeling.just a stone’s throw from the eccentric happenings and eclectic culinary scene of main street guerneville, and yet nestled beneath towering redwoods, black walnut and sycamore trees, johnson’s beach is the stuff of legend.for over a hundred years, visitors and locals alike have flocked to our white pebble shores to float down the river, bask on our beach or explore the thorny flora and fauna of the old growth forests.


























“johnson’s beach isn’t like other places around here. it has a history. it has a spirit all its own.” chris abbott
