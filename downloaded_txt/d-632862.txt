where africa comes alive


for three decades, mabula game lodge has been a sanctuary where the heartbeat of the african bush whispers ancient tales, and luxury mingles with wilderness.
nestled in the untamed expanse of waterberg limpopo, our lodge offers more than a safari; it promises a journey of discovery, a place where every sunset feels like a personal performance painted across the african sky. as we celebrate 30 years of mabula, we reflect on a story steeped in adventure, growth, and renewal—a story that continues with you.
