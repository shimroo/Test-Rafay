putin´s words about the 9/11 terror and what effect they had in the world06/26/20209/11 victims are still getting sick but may not get compensation04/29/2019the most unbelievable conspiracy theories about 9/1106/28/20189/11 is a conspiracy, suggests recent revelations01/25/2018about our approachextensive research  01 
many theories and conspiracies stated that there were some internal reasons behind the attack. many experts proposed theories in support of their case. some of these conspiracy theorists were able to make their case, and some could not.02 
greed is a factor that can make any human do anything in this world. some of the theorists believe that money could be a factor that could have inspired the big players of the market. in the days leading up to the 9/11, there was an increase in the put-to-call ratio for united airlines and american airlines.03 
norad is the agency that deals with internal security of the airspace. they have the authority and power to destroy or tail any hijacked plane in the american airspace. on the morning of the attacks, norad told their planes to stand down even when they could have prevented the collision of the planes with the pentagon and twin towers.04 
many researchers believe that the fall of the twin towers of wtc was a planned demolition, if the facts are compared with the physics theories. the commercial planes that are used in the airlines are always made with lightweight aluminium. this is done so as to meet more speed and fuel efficiency.thorough verification  01
