what is the complete modern pool®?technology has come a long way, and so have pool sanitizers. when looking at chlorine and chemical-free options, the answer isn’t always either/or. by combining the best available technologies, every pool can be crystal clear and absolutely safe.


advanced sanitizerssome of the most dangerous pool contaminants are resistant to chlorine and other chemicals; requiring long term exposure to high chlorine levels to be destroyed. aop, ozone and uv-c oxidize or inactivate these types of contaminants for a safer pool.
residual sanitizerschlorine and other chemicals are good at keeping pool water actively safe even when the pump is off. working together, a residual sanitizer and an advanced sanitizer create a complete modern pool system that protects individuals, their families, and their pets.
 



 

reduce chemical demand
by allowing your advanced sanitizer system to quickly act on pool contaminants, chlorine is free to work better. this reduces chemical demand and greatly reduces the amount of chemicals that need to be added to the water. every pool can experience a reduction in chemicals and a reduction in annual chemical costs.






maintain a safe sanitizer residual
chlorine is excellent for maintaining an active residual in the water itself. that means the moment a contaminant enters the water, chlorine gets to work. chlorine is also just as effective when the pump is off when a residual level is maintained in the water.






destroy chemical resistant organisms
aop, ozone and uv can destroy or inactivate dangerous contaminants that can be present in a backyard pool. these advanced sanitizers are effective against certain microorganisms, viruses, bacteria and other pathogens.




del advanced sanitizersadvanced sanitizer systems from del use modern technology to enhance the quality and safety of swimming pool water. they can reduce chloramines, improve chlorine performance, clarify the water and destroy chemical-resistant microorganisms.
