innersoul 
    vibroacoustic   products
our original intention in the  construction of our first sound table was to enhance the transformative and  healing aspects of our personal sessions and for our own meditation practices. 
what we discovered was amazing. 
    the innersoul sound tables places the physical body in a deep state of  relaxation in minutes, allowing you to step out of the mind and enter the inner  realms of meditation with ease. synergetic with massage, energy and sound  modalities, the sound tables, mats and chairs allows the client to release the daily stresses and allow the energy work to flow within them freely. 
evidence quickly developed showing  the benefits were more numerous then we first thought. beyond the  physical relaxation and quieting of the mind, it became apparent the  vibroacoustic products could be used for pain management, reducing muscle  tension and other stress related conditions.
the true beauty of this  vibroacoustic technology is the ease in using it. simply play the music  or frequencies of your choosing to direct a desired outcome and then lie back,  close your eyes, take a couple of deep relaxing breaths.
within 20 to 30 minutes you are  transformed through effortless participation.â  the music and vibrations do all the work. your results can  include lowered blood pressure, increased circulation and deep states of  relaxation providing a calmer more joyful outlook on life, as well as, a  peaceful and energized you.

    liquid sound table


all innersoul vibroacoustic  tables, chairs and mats use advanced technology transducers  providing  incredibly accurate and smooth vibration. the transducers deliver a tactile  range from 10 hz to 1100 hz  so cleanly the brain  interprets the stimulus assound, not shaking. you become one  with the music and vibration in a way not possible before.

welcome to inner soulutions 
it has been an amazing culmination to the energies of the last few years. as with many, we here at inner soulutions have transitioned through a period of redefining and fine tuning our hearts desire. it is with much gratitude that we find ourselves happily relocated in western new york, close to family and the water energy of the horseshoe and niagara falls. after a decade of living in the crystal energy of hot springs, arkansas, we bring that connection here to merge with the amazing energetics of the waterfalls.
growth and change are an ongoing part of our existence. as we embrace the new year, we welcome the new opportunities to explore our journey and the path that unfolds before us. we invite you to check out our schedule of upcoming events listed below. we appreciate the patience many of you have afforded us while awaiting our workshops to begin again.  please check in with our site to keep abreast of the new opportunities we will be offering.

new book
transcending human  nature: exploring the human/spiritual journey of all that we areexplores the dynamics of human  behaviors and how those behaviors can influence our personal spiritual  evolution, as the author weaves her personal journey and experience throughout  the chapters. we are all endowed with certain human qualities that are influenced  and shaped by our external environment and our experiences as we grow up. this  book takes a look at the different behaviors with an alternative perspective  based on the author’s experience and spiritual evolution. 
“as the author i will  share how my journey has revealed that which was once hidden from me  and perhaps is still hidden from you at this moment. my hope is that  as i write this and continue with the unfolding of my personal spiritual  path, that i may once again inspire and engage people to remember and  explore more fully the incorporating of the human self with the spiritual  essence that we all are.”  deborah

creating innersoul sacred healing  instruments


    “at inner soulutions  we consider the innersoul sound  tables, mats and chairs as sacred healing  instruments and they are created with love and intent. as the creator, my  intention is that each of my ‘babies’ will raise the consciousness of all who partake of their sonic embrace.â  perhaps only  one individual will use it, perhaps thousands â¦ this is one of my contributions to  helping the world’s inhabitants to evolve into higher states of consciousness.
each table, mat and chair (several hundred so far) is completed in our healing and ascension  room, within the vortex created by the pyramid hanging over our sound water table,  with  master crystals, minerals and harmonizers.  the energies  that permeate the vortex chamber are absorbed by each sound table, chair and  sound mat. 
our intent is to hold the specific person and their purpose  in thoughts as the product is completed. we have had musicians, sound healers  as well as grammy award winners send us their cds to play during this process  to enhance our ‘tuning in’ to them  and their energies. providing these products to the world is what brings joy  and purpose to our hearts.” stephen deuel
