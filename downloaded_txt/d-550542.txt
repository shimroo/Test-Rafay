 chili's fire pit co-owner don pesta has turned his lifelong love of hot foods into his own mentor retail store.... chili's fire pit.
don pesta, whose nickname is "chili", built his reputation as a lover of all things hot early in his life, his wife and partner, beckie said.  don and beckie's small shop features over 700 hot sauces, 50 salsas and 100 barbecue sauces, as well as gourmet olives, cheeseball mixes, clothing and other "hot" items.  chili's fire pit even has the hard to find items and items only found in ohio and only at chili's fire pit.

				for some, the ability to eat an outrageously hot pepper or serve up the spiciest chili is a bragging point, a badge of honor.  for others, spicy food simply tastes better, and it's not only men who scour the shelves of creatively named sauces, according to the pestas'.  women and some children can be just as likely to have a taste for heat.

				come into chili's fire pit today and experience all the burning sensations don and beckie have to offer.  check out such temptations as "the sauce that killed kenny" from the comedy central show south park, or just come in to see what's new. either way you'll enjoy visiting chili's fire pit and we are sure you'll be back for more!
