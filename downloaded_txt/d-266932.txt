my skin is so hydrated
    
iâve been using facelite for 6 weeks and i can already see a massive difference to my skin. as iâve got a little older, i could really see my skin changing, it looked dry and tired, i didnât even feel good when i put make up on. since using facelite i can honestly say that it has completely changed my skin. it looks fresh, plumper and more hydrated and my makeup seems to sit so much better now my skin is so hydrated. i have never written a review for anything but facelite has made me feel so much more confident again.

my eyes looked firmer
    
really enjoyed my first experience of the mask! i could see results pretty much instantly. my skin felt rejuvenated and the area around my eyes looked firmer. the next day my skin looked great and it seemed to have really calmed the breakout of spots on my chin, i canât wait to use it again.

people are commenting on how well i look
    
iâve been using facelite for over 4 weeks now and there is definitely something happening to my skin. i donât look so tired or drained and other people are commenting on how well i look. i am using it in combination with some medik8 products and i think possibly this is one of the best skin care regimes iâve ever had.

long lasting results
    
i was a regular spar and beauty treatment addict and had regular facials. then i saw facelite and decided to give it a go, as it has good results, oh my god, i am converted. the results after a facelite last longer than a facial treatment and my skin is looking so much healthier and brighter. i love it

its affordable, relaxing and most of all, it works.
    
iâm a smoker and have been for over 20 years, itâs taken its toll on my skin. a while back i went and had a visia skin analysis at a clinic, they said my skin age was 63!! i knew i needed to do something quickly! when i reviewed light therapy there were so many choices but one of my clinics had been trialling it and had great results so i gave it a go. its affordable, relaxing and most of all, it works. now i just need to give up smoking!

i suffer from seborrheic dermatitis
    
iâve suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for about 15 years. creams work, but temporarily, my wife found facelite for me and suggested we give it a bash. i think it bothers her more than me!! anyway, it worked. hence me leaving a review. i do about 2 treatments a week and it keeps it at bay, i donât think iâve ever gone so long without a red nose!!!
