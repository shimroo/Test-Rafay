kindred





watching the kidnap thriller kindred, i realize that the hallucinations are not as mysterious as they appear. this film has an unfortunate ending.

in the heights





 happy and hopeful, in the heights is a journey of joy. the lives of the community in washington heights in new york city is presented with song and dance. the colors are vibrant. i explored the neighborhood, and the film depicts it well. this is a wonderful film that holds up to multiple views. it was my first visit to the theater since lockdown and i'm pleased with my choice. well worth seeing.

sneakers





 the cast of sneakers alone makes this film worth watching. a hacker film where everything they do adds up. this is a smart caper film with great performances. well done
