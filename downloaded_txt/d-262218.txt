the isscr’s open access peer-reviewed scientific journalstem cell reports is an open access forum communicating basic discoveries in stem cell research, in addition to translational and clinical studies. stem cell reports focuses on manuscripts that report original research with conceptual or practical advances that are of broad interest to stem cell biologists and clinicians."stem cell reports serves as a vital platform for scientists, clinicians, and industry professionals to disseminate their findings on stem cell research, regenerative medicine, and cellular therapies. its values reflect those of its host society, isscr: trustworthy and rigorous science as judged by scientific editors and reviewers who respect the standards laid down by isscr."  — janet rossant, editor-in-chief
