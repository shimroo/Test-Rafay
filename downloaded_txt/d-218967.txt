the wrong button


aug. 3rd, 2008 at 1:22 am



 

next to the elevator in one of the deepest subway stations in new york city - on roosevelt island - there is a panel....needless to say, as is pretty obvious from the picture, i was by far not the first to press the "push for help" button when trying to call the elevator.there's no way to cancel the call, so while waiting for the elevator to take its time to arrive from the depths, i was wallowing in shame during the short interaction with an irritated voice of italian-american new yorker accent on the other side of the little holes cut in brushed metal."what's the problem?""sorry, i pressed the wrong button.""why the hell do you always have to press the wrong button?! what's wrong with you?! stop pressing the wrong button!"clang....the other day i realized just how much i actually miss new york.  absolutely no sarcasm here: for real.
