 i messaged roberts cycle on yelp about an issue with my breaks and they messaged back right away. they told me about their free bike check-up and their special deal on bike tune-ups.

richard and his staff were very friendly and had very fair prices. he called us on a sunday when they were closed and expedited the work on our bikes and let us know they were ready.

as a newer rogers park resident, but an oldie in age, as well as my 1997 trek 730 model, that i recently had roberts cycle “wield” their hand to “liven up” the old gal . . .  i must say, how impressive the long-standing, reputable history, years of love, sweat and hard labor make roberts cycle “zing” with ongoing, satisfied old and new customers, alike.
