		all the details here, kids!



i have removed all photos from my instagram account
due to instagram's recent announcement that they are going to be accessing their own users' content for training ai systems, 
		i've decided that i can no longer in good conscience participate in instagram. the account is still active so that i can follow a few friends who still
		participate, but i won't be posting anything myself.


photo galleries on flickr
after discovering flickr's usefulness for my photography students' work i've been trying it out for a few photo galleries of my own. 
		here are the first few i've put online:
• general portfolio
• cambridge, uk
• oxford, uk
• b&w nature photography
• collection of all albums
i'll be adding to these and putting up new galleries as time permits.
