fast formulas - interactive spreadsheets configured with textbook formulas










































 



fast formulas
we offer ms excel spreadsheets configured with the major 
      formulas used in many different textbook subjects, 
      including finance, accounting, operations management, economics, and engineering.
and what's better?  you can download the spreadsheets right from the website.
interactive spreadsheets
each formula is pre-configured so that you can enter values for each of the 
      variables in the formula and see the results immediately. you can also copy and 
      paste the formulas into your other spreadsheets and documents.
click on the image to the right to see a screen shot (in a 
      new window), or better yet - try our free demo 
      spreadsheet!
another great thing about fast formulas spreadsheets is 
      that after a class is over, you still have your text book 
      formulas, even if you sell your book back. plus, the formulas are right 
      where you need them - on your computer, not hidden somewhere in a 
book.
easy to use
since the formulas are created using ms excel spreadsheets 
      (rather than some sort of custom software), you already know how to use them. 
      and you dont have to install another application on your computer.
why wait?
