the 45th cat’s hill bicycle race, sponsored by los gatos bicycle racing club, a 501c3 charity, and mikes bikes, will be held saturday april  28 in the almond grove neighborhood of   los gatos. the mile-long course starts at tait and nicholson avenues   near mikes bikes, rounds to bean, massol, then features a 23% grade up   nicholson avenue, goes around bachman park, followed  by a fast downhill (~50 mph!) on newly-refinished bachman and right   turn, back to the start/finish on tait avenue. races for various levels   and ages start at approximately 9:00 am and finish after 6:00 pm. pro racers climb up nicholson as many as 40 times during  their race, other categories climb as few as 8 times. the cat’s hill   classic was started in 1974 by 1960 us olympic competitor and los gatos   teacher bob tetzlaff with his wife lorine who dubbed nicholson avenue   “cat’s hill”, a designation that remains till  this day.

about the los gatos bicycle racing  club (lgbrc)
founders, us  olympians bob tetzlaff and jack hartman, created the los gatos bicycle racing  club (lgbrc) in 1960. over the following 56 years, ten lgbrc members have raced  in the olympics, four have become world champions, many have become state and  national champions and several have joined the professional ranks of cycling.  bob “king of the road” tetzlaff was inducted into the us bicycling hall of fame  in 2003.
     today  the los gatos bicycle racing club has approximately 100 members from los gatos  and surrounding areas who predominately live and work in silicon valley.  membership includes students, physicians, engineers, educators, entrepreneurs  and other professionals and non-professionals. members are highly motivated  amateur cyclists and have a common bond in passion for cycling. the  lgbrc is dedicated to success in all areas of the sport: racing, promoting sponsors  and serving the local community. 
non-members are welcome to join the scheduled rides that occur weekly. the  saturday ride assembles in los gatos at 7:30 am, finishes up around 1:00 pm and  covers approximately 50-60 miles.  you may sign up for notification of  upcoming saturday routes by emailing wvonkaenel@gmail.com. the sunday ride starts in los altos and is  intended for anyone who is interested in checking the club out.  go to www.lgbrc.org  for more information.
