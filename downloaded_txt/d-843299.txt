kavan l-39 skyfox



6.1.2025

	the semi-scale model of a successor to the legendary albatros has a 1088mm wingspan and is powered by an 80mm brushless edf. it has excellent flight characteristics that even the most demanding "scale-er" pilots will appreciate. the model is surprisingly stable, docile and has excellent control authority. the carefully tuned position of the suspended undercarriage considerably reduces the take-off speed and is perfect for smooth scale landings on both tarmac and groomed grass surfaces. this also makes the skyfox viable as a first fan-powered model.

kavan cumul 100



8.11.2024
