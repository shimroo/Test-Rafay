special note:
the primary impediment to residential real estate recovery and home building is the restrictive financing guidelines fannie mae and freddie mac are continually imposing on mortgage lending operations and the american public. the demand for both new homes and existing real estate purchases is actually quite high. however, these gse’s are making it an extraordinary challenge for the self-employed and retired to purchase housing despite assets while mandating two consecutive years of qualifying income regardless of loan to value, creditworthiness or ability to repay which discriminates against these two groups. residential real estate and the american economy will not sustain a healthy recovery until these aggressive mortgage guideline policies are reversed. furthermore, industry-wide complaints regarding unfair appraisals are making it very difficult to refinance and/or qualify for purchase hindering real estate appreciation potential while impeding discretionary income growth. in consequence, a growing portion of the population is forced to rent which escalates apartment demand and pricing thereby diminishing per capita home ownership and economic prosperity in the united states.
