meet tara, a teachervision teacher
"i'm tara, i create resources and write blog posts for teachervision. i love using the teachervision resources in my
    own classroom, especially the choice boards and holiday activities. when i don't have a lot of time for planning or
    a last-minute change to my schedule has me scrambling for an activity, teachervision always saves the day. i just
    search for what i need, and i'm always able to find something fun and easy to implement."
