welcome!camp living water is a non-profit, non-denominational christian youth camp and retreat center located in the great smoky mountains of western north carolina.hurricane helene updategod miraculously sheltered us from the high winds and flooding experienced throughout our region. the staff, structures, and grounds here are fine. we are now supporting local churches in providing lodging, showers, meals, and laundry facilities in jesus’ name! (james 2:15-17; matthew 25:40; matthew 10:42)thank you, it’s only your prayer and support that enable these practical efforts. “so which of these three do you think was neighbor to him…and he said, he who showed mercy on him. then jesus said to him, go and do likewise.” luke 10:36a-37)
