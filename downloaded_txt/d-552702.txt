  loving christ, loving others
 
motivated by the promptings of the holy spirit and driven by our encounters with the lord jesus the parishioners of holy family church seek to build the kingdom of god through our faithful and reverent worship in the sacred liturgy and our dedicated service to the poor and the little ones of the world. thank you for visiting our home on the web and please consider learning more about who we are, where we are and how we love the lord.holy family was established in 1877 just west of downtown columbus ohio in the historic area known as franklinton. holy family thrives because of the many good people who have come to know the lord, love the lord and serve the lord here in our parish. our parish offers a great number of opportunities to grow in holiness through our many apostolates of charity and communities of love.
