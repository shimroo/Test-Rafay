welcome










 












welcome to my site. there were technical issues that have forced me to rebuild it, so it’s a work-in-progress. 

this is author kit tunstall’s website. i also write as aurelia skye, kit kyndall, and kristina saxon. i even occasionally write as t.k. reilley, but that’s mostly horror and not something i feel like dabbling with often.

if you would like to receive kit’s newsletter, visit this page.
