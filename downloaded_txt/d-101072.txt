join our team the flood control district was formed 60 years ago to address flooding throughout the county. even though we live in a desert, floods occur because of its unique characteristics - especially during summer monsoon and winter rainstorms. to keep maricopa county flood safe, the district relies on a diverse group of professionals to keep pace with development in one of the fastest growing counties in the united states. we have historically focused on building and maintaining dams, basins and channels, but we also embrace new tools and education strategies to accomplish our mission. the flood control district is always looking for people who are passionate about protecting our neighborhoods, businesses and families from floods.learn more about us.
