	 park city center mall kiosk
	 
    


lancaster, pennsylvania - circa 1970shere's a fun postcard shot taken inside the ever-moody park city center mall in the 1970s (back when it was still dark and moody). in this photo we see  a small kiosk store in the middle of the mall proper, but i need a little help with this one's name.it obviously sells nuts, but it's a store i'm not familiar with at all, and the back of the postcard is no help. it appears the name is "ah! nuts", but i'm not positive (maybe that's reversed?). any fellow mallrats (particularly those familiar with either park city center back in the day or this shop itself) know for sure what this store was called?either way, it's a neat shot, where you can also see the very colorful fifth avenue card shop as well in the background.mall history: 1972 - presentcurrent website: hereinfo from wikipediacurrent aerial viewprevious entries: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6labels: '70s, 1970s, lancaster, park city center, pennsylvania

	 southcenter mall
	 
    


tukwila, washington - circa 1960shere's an old southcenter mall interior image dating to the '60s (not the best quality but you get the idea). the store on the left is called bernie's (which appears to be a men's clothing store), and you can also just barely make out the mall's jcpenney anchor way down at the far end (see the beginning of the penneys sign?). speaking of which, here's the caption off another southcenter postcard:"the distinctive architecture of southcenter is highlighted by the beautiful j.c. penney store, largest in the penney chain. penneys is one of the four major department stores in southcenter which along with 110 other stores makes it the largest shopping center in the northwest and one of the largest in the world.the main building covers 30 acres of the total 116 acre site. the center is 8 minutes south of seattle at tukwila and the junction of interstates 5 and 405."mall history: 1968 - presentcurrent website: herecurrent aerial viewprevious entries: 1, 2, 3, 4labels: '60s, 1960s, southcenter mall, tukwila, washington

	 mystery mall (columbia mall?)
	 
    


columbia, maryland - circa early '80si recently received the following e-mail (with the above photo attached) from moa reader, jeanine long:"found this photo while going through old pictures. it is a lovely shot of an indoor fountain in a two story mall. the whole family tried to remember what mall it was but we are coming up short. we live in northern ohio in the cleveland area but it may have been taken on a vacation to baltimore or to washington dc. would love to know if any of your readers can remember where it came from. we know the photo was taken in either 1980 or 1981."well, i think i may have this mystery solved for you already. i believe it was taken inside columbia mall (aka the mall in columbia) in columbia, maryland. pretty sure that's it, but if anyone out there thinks differently please comment or e-mail me your opinion. when/if i ever know the answer definitively, i'll update this post. thanks for the great photo, janine! :)mall history: 1971 - presentdeveloper: james w. rousecurrent website: herecurrent aerial viewinfo from wikipediaprevious entries: 1labels: '80s, columbia, columbia mall, fountain, maryland

	 the daily mall reader: shopping malls grow with suburbs
	 
    


a daily dose of mall-related reading..."flight to the suburbs"business must follow the dollartime magazine - monday, mar. 22, 1954(excerpt) the enormous growth of the u.s. population has meant vast new markets in everything from baby carriages to washing machines and wrist watches. will every retailer cash in on the bonanza? not at all. the reason is that since 1940, almost half of the 28 million national population increase has taken place in residential suburban areas, anywhere from ten to 40 miles away from traditional big-city shopping centers. thus, to win the new customers' dollars, merchants will have to follow the flight to the suburbs.in the ten years from 1940 to 1950, st. louis' suburbs grew 48% while the city itself added only 6% to its population. in the same period, philadelphia's suburbs expanded twice as fast, boston's eight times as fast, as their already-crowded metropolitan districts. the numbers tell only part of the story. suburbia offers not only more new customers but better customers.read the full article here.labels: '50s, 1954, daily mall reader, suburbia

houston, texas - july, 1967interior photo of sharpstown center (or sharpstown mall), taken in july of 1967. here's some past and more recent history from its wikipedia entry:"this is the second mall to be built in houston after gulfgate mall opened in 1956. sharpstown center was the first air-conditioned, enclosed shopping mall in the houston area. because it was houston's first air conditioned mall, many houston residents residing in the central part of the city wanted to experience the 'mall of the future.'in the early-1980s, a second floor was added and the mall extensively renovated from its original 1950s appearance. in the mid-1990s, the mall was branded as the 'sharpstown center.' in 1998, neighboring westwood mall with the area's dillard's and sears stores closed. national tenants have left sharpstown center in droves since the opening of first colony mall in nearby sugar land, and the mall is now nearly 25 percent vacant."mall history: 1961 - presentdeveloper: frank sharpcurrent website: herecurrent aerial viewinfo from wikipediaprevious entries: none(study image courtesy of the university of wisconsin-milwaukee libraries)labels: '60s, 1967, houston, sharpstown, texas

a daily dose of mall-related reading..."strength in variety"time magazine - friday, nov. 20, 1964(excerpt) s.s. kresge is a man as well as a variety store, and, at 97, he was recently called out of retirement to address the annual meeting of the chain that he forged. while stockholders applauded, old s.s. (for sebastian spering) got up and exhorted them to make kresge "an outstanding five-and-ten-cent syndicate."that did not jibe with president harry b. cunningham's idea of his job, and he rose to his feet and said so. smilingly, he reminded everyone that the nation's third largest variety chain (after f.w. woolworth and w.t. grant) has expanded far beyond its old dime-store stage and is, in fact, quite a different creature. this small semantic difference highlights a new philosophy that has set all the variety chains off on their biggest spree of change and expansion.read the full article here.labels: daily mall reader, kmart, kresge, w.t. grant, woolco, woolworth

ft. lauderdale, florida - 1960shere's a vibrant color postcard photo of the jordan marsh store looming high in the distance, above and anchoring a portion of the venerable sunrise shopping center (as it was originally known) complex, along with a sweeping view of the beautiful surrounding areas. this shot looks west towards the shopping center, from the intracoastal waterway seen in the foreground.in 1980 the sunrise shopping center was fully enclosed, redeveloped and renamed the galleria at fort lauderdale. i still prefer "sunrise shopping center" myself, though.mall history: 1959 - presentcurrent aerial viewcurrent website: hereprevious entries: 1labels: '60s, 1960s, florida, fort lauderdale, sunrise shopping center, the galleria
