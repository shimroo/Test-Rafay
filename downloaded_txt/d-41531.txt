regency gown epatternthis is my original regency gown pattern, modeled after the styles of the middle regency and particularly appropriate for 1810s impressions. if you’re new to this time period, this is the pattern i recommend starting with, as it goes together very easily.

girls’ 1780s portrait dress epatternthis pattern includes options for a smooth-bodice dress that fastens up the back and a gathered bodice dress that slips over the head. it also offers elbow-length sleeves with optional ruffles and fitted long sleeves.

ladies’ classic 1950s wardrobe epatterni’ve pulled together my favorite design elements from this decade. you can mix and match to your heart’s content and create an entire closet full of flattering outfits that take you from relaxing on the patio in cool gingham to stepping out in sophisticated glamour with all the stops pulled out.

know how to thread your machine and stitch a straight seam? then you are ready to dive into vintage sewing! making a classic circle skirt is easy enough for a beginner, even if you want to add pockets like i did to this one on the left. pop on over to my free circle skirts tutorial for all the steps (with photos) for plain circle skirts and ones with pockets. intimidated by zippers? many circle skirts closed with hooks and bars or even snaps, so choose a closure that suits you and jump on in! this is a classic wardrobe staple that looks amazing paired with a dressy blouse or a plain turtleneck, and it’s a great way to get your feet wet and start creating a wardrobe you love.
