advent devotions from lutheran hour ministries
to spanish website
come, let us adore him
it is true that god deserves our worship and praise for all that he has done for us. and in the birth of jesus into our world, born to save us from our sins, born to give us eternal lifeâgod has given us his very best. to which we can only respond: âcome, let us adore him!â    

the events surrounding jesusâ birthâthe prophecies foretold and fulfilled, the birth of john to point to jesus, the divine way god guided mary and joseph, the preservation of jesusâ life from king herodâall speak to godâs intimate involvement in our salvation. this is the god we adoreâthe god who spared not his own son but gave him up for us all. 
daily devotions from lhm will help strengthen and encourage your faith as you do the same for others. have them delivered right to your inbox, podcast the audio devotional, access them on your mobile device through the free app, or listen with spotify, iheart radio, alexa, or google home.  seasonal devotions for  advent and  lent are available here in both english and spanish, as well as in french, and chinese, from our ministry center in canada.  perfect for personal reflection or to share with family, friends and congregations, these seasonal meditations will help prepare you to celebrate the true meaning of these seasons.

what is advent?
the church divides the year into different seasons that emphasize the life of christ and the life of the church. beginning on sunday, december 1, 2024, we will enter the season of the church year called advent. advent is the season of preparation and anticipation leading up to christmas, and continuing to epiphany january 6, 2025.

				   the focus of advent is two-fold. on the one hand, we prepare to celebrate the birth of jesus christ, the son of god, who came into the world as both god and man so that our sins might be forgiven. on the other hand, we anticipate the day when jesus will return to earth and bring an end to this world. those will be scary days, but we can look forward to the end of the world with hope because through faith in jesus, the end of this world will mean the beginning of a new life with christ for eternity.

advent, then, is a time for us to repent and believe. knowing that jesus was born to forgive our sins, we repent (admit our failures to god) and believe that we are forgiven because of the death and resurrection of jesus on our behalf. also, knowing that jesus is coming back, we repent and believe that when he returns, he will give us eternal life.
