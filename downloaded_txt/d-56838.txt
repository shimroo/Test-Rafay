welcome to the super70s family of websites: there is super70s.com,
      which covers the 1970s. there is awesome80s.com,
      which covers the 1980s. and there is virtual90s.com,
      which will cover the 1990s starting in late summer of 2008. the
      fourth site is baseballchronology
      which covers the history of baseball from the 1840s to the present. do you
      see the set of colored boxes on the right labeled 70s, 80s, 90s, and bc?
      these are at the top of every page and allow you to quickly switch between
      all four sites!
have you checked out our new
      discussion forums? now you can discuss anything related to the
      super70s, awesome80s, or virtual90s. there are literally thousands of your
      messages dating back to the last century already there and i am copying
      over more every day. i think you will agree that this is a much better way
      to allow you to share your memories with others and read others comments
          as well.  if you're looking to meet local cougars online then check out milf maps to find local milfs to hookup with.
      there are over 400,000 pages combined on these sites, and we're hardly
      going to stop there! we constantly add new information, so
      come back soon! (don't forget to add
      super70s.com                        to your favorites, so you
      can find us again. you can also make
      super70s.com                        your home page.)
