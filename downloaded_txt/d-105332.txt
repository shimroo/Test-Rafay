testimonials

 


“the best bike shop in town imho! they carry everything you could possibly need and treat your bike as if it were their own personal ride... really helpful and knowledgeable.”

— blanche d., google review




“mojo wheels is awesome. bought a santa cruz and got a great deal. can’t beat the customer service and the guys went the extra mile to get my bike done before the weekend. definitely will be back!”

— joseph p., google review




“i have received nothing short of exceptional service every single time i have been in. the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. good gear, good prices, and a good place to be”

— matthew b., facebook review




“mojo wheels exemplifies what a bike shop should be.  great, knowledgeable staff who talks to you, not at or down to you.  this is far from the closest shop to me, but well worth the additional time for their integrity and customer service that is oh so lacking in the corporate bike store a wee bit closer.”

— ian l., yelp review
