what customers are saying 



below are some of the testimonials from our customers who purchased and use our equipment! 









d. benton - fl  


						i received my dog walk today. wooohooo!
it is set up and pup approved! thanks for making such a good quality dog walk. i’ll be ordering an a-frame and teeter from you soon. replacing old equipment that i bought used when i first started. i bought used when i first started. wanted to make sure i was going to really like this “agility thing.”					






diane - thurmont, md  


						i called max 200 about sizing scent articles on 4-27-15, and the sales person who helped me was fabulous! she understood my questions and answered quickly, professionally and was exceptionally helpful and pleasant. she helped me with sizing and picked exactly the correct size for my standard poodle. further, i expected the two articles to take 30 days or longer but they arrived in only 3 weeks! i have already ordered a full set of articles. well done, max 200! 					






charlie mendota heights, mn  


						i just received my order and am thrilled with my custom dumbbells. thank you so much for the extra care you exercised in crafting these superb products. also love the miniature rally signs! so much so that i'm ordering two more sets for gifts! thank you!!					






v howard - oh  


						i called about scent articles this past week and spoke with a very informative gal. just got to say, customer service is a thing and what i received from max200 - incredible. and, i received the articles way quicker then i expected. the fit perfectly. it's like they were custom made for my boy. max 200 definitely knows what they are doing, definitely incredible workmanship, and definitely the best customer service i've experienced in dog sports. january 25, 2025
