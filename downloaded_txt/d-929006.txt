welcome!
the middle tennessee tourism council works through the greater nashville regional council (gnrc) to support tourist promotion and development activities in the middle tennessee region. gnrc serves as the lead regional tourism agency under annual contract with the tennessee department of tourist development.
the tourism council membership is made up of area chamber of commerce representatives, convention and visitors bureaus, other area business representatives, and local elected officials. through gnrc and the state department of tourist development, the council has annual funding of some $55,000 in grants and local matching funds.
