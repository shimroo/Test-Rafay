   design & fabrication - exceptional engineering stands at the heart of all that we do
we work collaboratively with our clients to create a
structure that meets their individual requirements, no matter the
location, industry or complexity of the project.we have designed and installed
industrial and commercial buildings, as well as critical
bridge infrastructure projects and complex
aircraft hangars, across the globe.the key to our success is that we design, manufacture and erect all the elements of our buildings; from the steel structure, the roof and the
cladding, to the
windows and
doors.

twin cantilever aircraft hangar we have the production capability to provide our clients with a complete package, from initial design and
detailing, through the manufacture and
fabrication of the entire structure, including steelwork, cladding, roofing, doors and glazing.we also have expertise in designing for the impact of extreme weather events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
our buildings are renowned for being some of the safest structures in some of the world's
toughest environments.

   global export
from constructing an aircraft hangar in mongolia to providing bridging solutions to rural communities in africa, over the last
100 years we have shipped our steel structures to over 140 countries across the globe.
almost any structure can be designed to fit within standard 40 foot
shipping containers and then shipped to the client's destination.we have also invested heavily in our container loading equipment to ensure that each item reaches its destination safely, securely, and in line with the project programme.
