in my dreams

every night, throughout my sleep 
i wander.  i search. 
walking, looking.
sometimes i find something, someone 
or some others to be with, 
to share with...
but, with the light of morn,
as sleep moves into wakefulness, 
my companion or companions of the night disappear.
or they simply dissolve into the aether 
of what appears to be reality.
once again, 
i become aware of my solitude.
i am alone; 
to try to start the day; 
always with the desire to 
do something of purpose on this new day.
but on most days, i just cannot.
this morning, at least, i tried to convey 
my situation.

too little.  too late.

too little, too late!
too little, too late!
too little, too late!

and, i thought she might be better than this, but---

carly lied.

and she lied convincingly.  
that's scary.
