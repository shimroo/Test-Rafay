“we loved our time spent at the beautiful resort. the climate, the scenery, the beauty is perfect in flagstaff. the condo was clean, well-equipped, and very comfortable. the king bed was beyond comfortable. before our arrival, we received a call from the staff to make sure to make certain that the steps, located in the condo, were ok. if steps had been a problem, they would have put us in a more level unit. they also advised us about the higher elevation; which is really a big deal.they also told us that additional items were also available (like a crock pot). perfect week for us!!!” – lea (nashville, tennessee)
