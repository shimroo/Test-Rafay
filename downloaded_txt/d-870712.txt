first steps


if you are new to lucee or the cfml language in general, check our first steps page in our docs. there you'll find a quick primer of the amazing and easy-to-learn cfml language. if you come from a deisgn-based background, cfml's tag-based language should make it easy to learn and use right away. if you're coming from another development language, the cfml script-based syntax may be more to your liking. either way, it's a great place to get started on your journey with lucee and cfml!
