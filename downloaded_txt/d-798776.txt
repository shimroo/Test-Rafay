a
              jamaica poor no more by


              michael irving phillips,

jamaica 
          is poor and will remain poor unless it follows the guidelines
          outlined in my new book. these guidelines will also reduce crime and  improve
          the quality of life. it will also serve as a model for the rest of the
          developing world..
              the book introduces jamaicanism, partnership with people and the
              goodwill revolution to make jamaica have, not just a high quality
              of life, but among the highest in the world.

a jamaica poor no more and united


			poor countries are getting poorer. the governments of some countries 
			like   sri lanka, lebanon, haiti and even the us 
			commonwealth of puerto rico cannot even pay to maintain services.
			

			yes, even puerto rico with its connection to the mighty united 
			states is bankrupt and is undergoing all sorts of financial crises. 
			i am sure other countries will follow. houston, we have a problem! 
			but, no one is really addressing it. there is no solution in sight 
			because no one acknowledges the cause of this dire financial 
			problem. these countries depend on taxation as their main source of 
			income but this is not enough. the poorest of these countries have 
			rich people. they became rich by going into business. these 
			struggling governments can overcome their poverty and even become 
			rich by also going into business.years to come, we will look back 
			and exclaim, what a stupid idea, limiting the income of a 
			government to taxes! how absurd! 


			the 
			proposal in my book, a jamaica poor no more, is for 
			the jamaica government  to go into business to make a profit, an 
			honest profit. and, the objective is to compete with other business 
			to become the biggest and best corporation in the country, in other 
			words become the 


			amazon.com 
			of jamaica. . if a country is to shed their alarming poverty, it is 
			essential they adopt my proposal. that is why i term this economic 
			system, essentialism. actually, in my book, a jamaica poor no 
			more, i called it jamaicanism but i consider essentialism more 
			appropriate. let me rush to emphasize that this is not socialism. 
			absolutely no business owner will have to turn over his business to 
			the government. america does not permit socialism. if it was 
			socialism, america would hit them with such repressive sanctions 
			their misery would increase tenfold. i consider essentialism to be 
			the evolution of the harmonious marriage of capitalism and 
			socialism. 


			this new government business corporation will organize along 
			corporation rules and completely different from the civil service. 
			it will include a variety of types of business organisations such 
			as: corporation, conglomerate, franchisor, franchisee, partnership, 
			and sole proprietorship. 


			to guarantee the success of essentialism i propose jamaica first for 
			our political parties.  jamaica first advocates that political 
			parties pledge their loyalty to jamaica above their loyalty to their 
			party. the two-party system always includes an opposition party. 
			all over the world, there is extreme polarization of people because 
			of political parties opposition. united we stand , divided we fall 
			and politically divided countries are falling all around the world. 
			i am proposing that instead of the knee-jerk opposition, both jlp 
			and pnp and any other political parties, put their heads together to 
			come up with the best jamaican government corporation possible. 
			lets have cooperation instead of opposition. let essentialism 
			be a political unifier. 


			the government corporation will operate all types of profit-making 
			businesses such as: 


			1. automobiles  importation, new and used car dealerships, repairs 
			(the general public and the government itself would be the biggest 
			customers) 


			2. real estate  construction, sales, rehab ( most millionaires made 
			their millions from real estate) 


			3. marijuana  recreational and medicinal. (instead of throwing 
			hard-working ganja farmers in jail, they will become important 
			business partners). the state of colorado is making millions from 
			marijuana. 


			4. agri-business  right now too many jamaicans toil over farming 
			the land to barely eke out a living but as partners with the 
			government corporation their life will improve.

hot calaloo serialization repeat
        of controversial
               7th  installment -chapter
              vii - goodness of man of: 
"boycott money and save your
          soul - 
          launching the goodwill revolution"
          by michael i. phillips (editor, hot calaloo)
           ......next chapter 7 goodness of man
about the book
          even though man is basically good and has made amazing technological
          advances, we continue to be mired in wars, poverty, crime and all
          sorts of social instability. why? because our society cherishes and
          promotes the love of money which is the root of all evil. . this book
          is an invitation to join the goodwill revolution against the
          addiction, worship and corrupting influence of money. through this
          addiction to money, a small rich ruling elite of money- pushers and
          money-lords have used faceless corporations to buy our democracy,
          corrupt our institutions, undermine the rights of our workforce,
          devalue people and manipulate our value system. do you want to
          be happy or rich? shed the brainwashing and seek true happiness of a
          meaningful life over the phony highs of materialism.
