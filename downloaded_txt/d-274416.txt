some reviews of our work







                                i had a will, power of attorney, and healthcare directive drawn up by ms. fogel and her staff using his website. they were all helpful, responsive, professional, and provided the documents in a timely fashion. they provided a service that was very cost effective to me.                            


nick






                                i found jo fogel's online legal services for a fixed fee to extremely reasonable, convenient and exactly what i needed. no job is too small or unimportant. his prompt service and attention to detail was greatly appreciated.
 
                            


frank s.






                                i am very pleased with the services provided by ms fogel and her staff.  i purchased the service to produce a marital separation agreement. recently purchased a quitclaim deed.  
her staff have been fantastic, and have always answered my questions and met the needs of my personal situation.
if your situation fits mine, using her services can save you a lot of work, money, anxiety and frustration.
