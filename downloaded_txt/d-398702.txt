a non-profit, volunteer rehabilitation, rescue and sanctuary for animalslive and let live farm's rescue and sanctuary is an animal shelter that rescues abused and unwanted animals, mainly horses, and pregnant dogs and cats, and provides them either a temporary or permanent safe place to interact with people.  when applicable, we will try to find appropriate homes for rehabilitated animals.those animals that are considered un-adoptable will be given lifetime care at our farm.


























we need your help!live and let live farm is currently in a legal battle with doa to restore our companion animal licenselive and let live farm has been stripped of its license by the n.h. department of agriculture, the result of which is causing animals to be held in limbo in the foster system or left in kill shelters in the south.live and let live farm rescue has won the first steps with the court which issued an injunction to fully operate both the large animal farm part of the rescue and the companion animal (dogs, cats, etc.) portion of the rescue with the court agreeing the merits were in our favor and we were done wrong by the department of agriculture. live and let live farm rescue is fully running under court issued injunctions with court dates now expected to be next year in 2025.  until such time, live and let life farm rescue and sanctuary continues to rescue and help animals like a locomotive; full speed ahead!the case is currently in court. for updates and additional information (including how you can help), please visit our page: speak for the voiceless
