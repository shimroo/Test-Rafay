the resilience, suffering, and triumph of the people who built the canal, traversed its length by barge, and created the communities along its corridor are the backbone of this significant 19th century industrial transportation enterprise. 

 

our mission is to highlight the importance of the d&h canal and preserve its stories, landscapes, and artifacts.


































follow the history of the canal.
the society’s blog, the snubbing post highlights the stories and people of the canal through videos, articles, and photo galleries.
