 the legend



        polkacide has hung up their polka boots and are no longer available to play clubs, festivals and octoberfests. but its wunderkind leader, ward abronski, has continued being active in the musical community, playing with flipper at their recent sf show, as well as with his own bands. ward's biggest venture to date is his music is medicine gofundme project, taking local san francisco musicians to play for detainees at an ice detention facility. click on this link to read more about music is medicine and to see how you can help. 
ward recently posted: "music is medicineâs mission to take music into ice immigration detention facility gets more possible thanks to all your generous support so far. we are very close to hitting target for expenses for the first and most crucial step of this attempt. that target was to raise expenses for travel and honoraria for up to six players, round trip to bakersfield twice, should that be necessary. it would please me no end to have that much and a small disaster cushion by the end of the week. i very much want to make our overall larger funding goal in hopes that i can spin this into a larger, more expansive thing, but it wonât mean a thing if we ainât got that swing into the first place. we are close, and iâm really grateful"
hello little polka pals and welcome!
founded in 1985, polkacide was originally organized to play a one-night stand for the  deaf club in san francisco, california. the deaf club (an actual club for deaf people) had been hiring punk bands to perform. when it was suggested that some   did not want a punk band, an inspired band leader and founder ward abronski, along with his long term girlfriend and polkacide's first drummer, hayok kay, formed a "really loud polka band" to play. when the gig was cancelled (ironically for noise abatement), ward realized it was too good of an idea with too many great musicians, to just let die. he booked the band for san francisco's punk club the mabuhay on february 8, 1985. unfortunately, the mab misspelled their names on the flyers but the rest, as they say, is history. since then, polkacide has played with such diverse groups as sun ra, primus (basa guest with his ocarina at the fillmore), brave combo, k.d. lang, the dead kennedys, and many, many more. press release for 25th anniversary
