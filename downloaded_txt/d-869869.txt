happy birthday brother!





happy birthday brother!i'm close to all my family but me & my brother michael have a special bond, always have. i think because he is the oldest boy and i'm the oldest girl. he's always been very protective of me and my younger sister. my mother once told me a story about my brother which just proves how smart and caring he has always been. i was just a toddler and i was really sick i wouldn't eat anything, so my brother, who was only 7, headed to the shop and came back with jelly pots for me which i actually ate! i'm so lucky to have such an amazing brother,thank you michael for all you do and who you are!

stolen videos, stolen memories. 





sorry for my lack of posting today, i had planned to do a haul post but instead this is what i have be doing - in the space of a week three channels have uploaded my videos and monetize them (which is placing ads on them to make money) mostly it's a minor annoyance. sure it's not nice when someone takes credit for your work and makes money from it but the worse part was when they steal personal videos.                                                                                                                                           i was on youtube a few days ago and saw my dog's face on someone elses channel. i felt sick. the video they stole and uploaded was this one - this was the hardest video to edit and when it was done i wanted to share it with my family and friends who loved sandy and the easiest way to do that is to upload on youtube. to have something so special to me stolen and uploaded for money by a stranger who never met sandy, who never knew her expressions, who didn't hold her while she was ill make me sick! i donated to my local animal shelter after sandy passed in memory of her and i plan to use the money i make from the video to donate regularly to them. sure, with a few clicks of a few buttons the videos are removed but i spend most of the day removing them. the form on youtube isn't the easiest to use and its time consuming.

happy birthday treena





today is my sister's birthday!i'm so lucky to have a sister, i thank my lucky stars i was given a sister to grow up with. when she was born she was so ill and could have died and i couldn't imagine what my life would have been without my little sister, she always been the cool smart one and even though i am older i do sometimes look up to her for support like i'm the little one (technically i am the little one as i'm shorter than her ha)she's one of the coolest people i know with awesome taste in music and fashion.(here she is singing black horse and a cherry tree)not only can she sing modern music but she can sing opera, we force her to sing high long notes because its just so so funny how she can do it! she also writes her own music even from the age of 9 she was writing and recording music, mostly about how annoying her sister was! "she's my sister" written about me was a famous song in our house the chorus was - she's my sister and sometimes i hate herand sometime is right nowbut sometimes she's okay but that doesn't mean i like her anywayoh oh my sister!it's actually extremely catchy when you hear it and we still sing it sometimes! here is an original by her, it's actually the first video i ever edited way before youtube even existed. she has also been in a few of my video too, i love working on her because it's always really funny she's never stop talking and knows so much about fashion and makeup - here is one of my favourite looks i did on her!here's to you sister sue! i love you!!

 babe, what's up with your face?





babe, what's up with your face??last week i broke out in a few blemishes on my cheek and laugh lines. it's pretty typical of me to break out here specially when i don't stick to my skincare routine (more on that tomorrow) but this break out took so long to heal and i was getting a little tired of it so i used my extra strong spot cream - avene triacneal cream. this stuff is serious, it does one of two things - brings the spot the surface to you can remove it carefully or reducing the size and allows it to fade over time with a peeling effect which removes the old layer of the skin to reduce scarring. but there is a problem - i am the most impatient person ever! i use it at night only and it usually works but me being impatient decided to use it morning and night and any time i felt like it really...to quote my favourite movie - big mistake, huge! woke up with this orange, peeling, red mess to which my bf says - babe, what's up with your face?my skin looks greasy in the picture due the cream i was wearing but you can see the orange staining, the cream turns orange on contact and the redness is a dry rash, the skin is so tight and on my chin you can just about see the flakey skin - horrible!i stopped using the spot treatment (obviously) and i keep the skin clean and to deal with the flakiness and dryness i am using elizabeth arden 8 hour cream. works a treat! best advice i can give anyone is be patient!hope that explains why you can only see half my face in my new video:i didn't want to miss an upload but i couldn't wear makeup on the other side. oh well! :/

makeup lesson





5 easy ways to add colour to your makeup1: blushfor some of us blush is the only colour we use on our faces and i got asked easier this week - "what is the point of blush"well as the name suggests blush is there to mimic blushing which gives us a healthy glowing look for those of us (like me) who can look very pale and tired without adding it.(not always a bad thing - i used to get sent home from school a lot because i looked "terrible pale")2: blush as eyeshadowwhen i trained with a runway model makeup artist years ago, she told me how she would always brush a little blush or lipstick into the crease of the eyes to match the cheeks and or lips, its a brilliant way to bring a look together and at the moment i love it! 3: lipsticklipstick is an easy way to add colour, and can make anyone look extra special! i love my reds or berry tones, they make me feel fancy but lipstick can also bring out your eye colour check out my video here if you don't know what i mean:4: smudged eyeshadowtake your favourite colour of eyeshadow something you never have the confidence to wear on your lid and smudge it under your eyes instead, its fun, easy and a great way to go from the office to a night out in seconds! 5: subtle eyeshadowif you find colourful eye makeup all too much but you are tired of your basic brown eye makeup just add a touch of colour on the center of your basic eye makeup and blend outwards. great way to match your dress or accessories!
