you were very patient with me in the first chapter of this book. with your cooperation and willingness, i evoked an emotion in you: question the status quo. let me portray this for you. you probably do the same things every day: wake up, wash your face, brush, shower, eat breakfast, go to work, work,lunch, work, return home, rest, watch tv or excise or socialize, sleep and the same cycle…

at one point in life i was lost. some can call it i was stuck. i was in a race with million and even billions of other people in this planet. i was luckier and ahead of at least 80% of these people by the standards of the society. from outside, i was in a perfect place. i was happily  married, i had two kids, i was healthy, everyone around…

as the rain is drumming on the windows, i am thinking about school and education system. today is the day. the day that my kids will not go to school because there is no education system in place: no teachers! i grew up in a so called third world country back then.yet, now that i think about it i realize how simple the education was and yet how effective. at…

why? you leave them with eyes wet and open wet with tears open with hope and you travel the distance between your hands and theirs never knowing when the wetness stops does it even ever stop? but you learn that eyes can close one cold morning or one hot summer night it does not matter when it matters that it does happen and it matters that so many people wonder…

a few weeks ago i picked up the phone and called the insurance company to dispute a charge. i told the customer service representative that i am upset but it is not geared towards her. i am upset at the insurance company and even though she is their employee, i am not in any way arguing with her. i am just asking her to look into the issue for me…

not so slowly, not so gently he stole my sleep he stole your sleep   locked them down in the basement of his white house   avoiding the cold gaze of his trophy wife sat behind the desk with his back to her   and tweeted on his phone with fingers smaller than normal about how trunch stole sleep but spelled “insomnia” wrong..

today, december 18 2016, i decided to reflect back on my year. it is not only the approach of 2017 that makes a good reason for this reflection but also, i am nearing the anniversary of my accident, december 2015. i have had strange experiences in life but this year by far was the most bizarre of all. it was like a movie that its story was unfolding as i…

never in my life or in my wildest dreams i could imagine that i will get so happy. i am simply overjoyed. looking at the moon glistening over the rocks of mount san jacinto, i do not feel that i am on the earth. i feel like i am on the moon. this moment is so surreal for me that i might as well be driving on the moon. i…

emotionally i have had a hard time adjusting to pinata. the hitting of a figure with a stick with all your might did not sit comfortably with me. as years went by, i have settled my emotions as best as i could. the joy of kids running for candy or toy or whatever comes out of pinata has outgrown my personal beliefs. and today, this pinata movie made me think:…
