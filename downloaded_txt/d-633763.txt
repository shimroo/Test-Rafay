testimonials


“ags nailed the design. and the (installation) crew on site was so professional…they were very accommodating. there were one or two things where we ran into some snags and they gave me choices to reconfigure a hole one way or the other and it all worked out…i can recommend them.”

sports bar & grill owner 



“arne was retained by our company to design and build two (36 hole) adventure golf courses in southwest florida in the late 1980’s. both projects were completed on time and within budget. . . .his industry knowledge and experience was helpful in creating attractions that have stood the test of time. both courses continue to operate profitably. i would recommend arne for future project design and construction.”





“i called for assistance with site planning. we changed sites three times. the folks at adventure golf services were very flexible and timely to meet my changing needs. i would recommend your services to anyone interested in design and construction of an exciting miniature golf course. it honestly was great to work with you, you were extremely responsive to our needs and concerns, and made sure things went as smoothly as possible.”
