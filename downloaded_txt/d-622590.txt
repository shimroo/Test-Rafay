new site! please excuse the dust while we finish up.















welcome,the pw crump company has recently entered its fourth decade in luthiery, with 20 years of specialization in fretted instruments of the mandolin family including cboms (citterns, bouzoukis, octave mandolins). i'm grateful to all the folks who took a chance on a name they didn't recognize when the instruments first came on the market back in 1998 and to all of the subsequent clients over the years. it has been an honor to work with some very well known artists as well as the many unsung heroes keeping traditional music alive in home town bands across the country and around the world.this latest version of the site reflects a couple of changes in the building process. after building to order for the last 20 years i’ll gradually phase out the wait list  in order  to build  instruments  with some new design features using special  woods i’ve been saving.  to that end i’ll be  regularly producing instruments which will be for sale on the available now page. these will mainly be examples of our most popular, affordable standard feature instruments  with a sprinkling of maxxed out, one of a kind show stoppers.
