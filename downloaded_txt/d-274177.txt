what our clients say about us


















jaz s.





























recently called this company out to investigate a scratching noise that another company could not get rid of in my attic. justin came out and assessed. a few days later josh came out to execute the plan. worked very hard in the blazing heat. 2 days later the noises in the attic stopped and was finally able to get uninterrupted sleep after about a month and a half. now 2 months later still no noise so i’m very happy with the service i got. i had exclusion work done.



















the joe cox home selling team office administrator





























justin was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. i’d highly recommend him and his company to anyone.



















candace thompson





























chad came out and gave me a reasonable estimate for my attic rodent issue. he explained everything in detail. he was very professional. the next day he came to my house to seal my openings.m and place traps. i feel confident that my future needs will be met with the warranty. highly recommend chad and his crew for any pest issues you may have.



















larry hayes





























chad came early today and did my installation in bad weather.

josh and adam did a thorough job in removing a squirrel and its baby from my attic. they were very professional.
i have used rid-a-critter before at another house to get rid of a large number of bats.
i highly endorse them for their services.

i used rid a critter for a dead animal removal. justin came out within an hour of my call. he quickly located the problem and removed it. he also deodorized the area and gave advice to avoid future issues. very friendly and professional! i would definitely use this company again.
