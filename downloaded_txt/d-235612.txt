        the harley hummer club
      










                  this is a virtual motorcycle club and requires no membership or dues.
                

                  we foster the preservation and restoration of the american-made harley-davidson lightweight motorcycle.
                







      welcome to the harley hummer club, your source for information about the 1948-1966 american-made lightweights.   if you're new to hummers, start with the history section, then click all the links above for a wealth of historical information.
    

      the hummer exchange provides a forum to ask questions, trade parts and information, and get to know other hummer owners. as you move around the site, please click on all the pictures - most of them will expand to larger pictures.   we hope you enjoy your visit!
    

      this website does not have any advertising or pop-ups — we never have, and we never will.  we're here just for the joy of these bikes.
