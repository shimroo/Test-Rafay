upload any funny or thought-provoking manga panel/quote that resonates with you. whether it's a scene that had you bursting into laughter or one that left a lasting impression, feel free to share it with the community.

here's how it works:

every week, one of our admins will kick-start the game by posting a manga panel to set the mood. it can be funny, intense, heartwarming, or anything that captures the essence of manga. we invite each and every one of you to participate by replying to the thread with your chosen manga.

this is your chance to showcase your favorites and discover hidden gems. moreover, if we receive a substantial number of submissions, we will organize a voting session where every member of the community can vote for the funniest manga quote.
feel free to share any additional thoughts or ideas you may have regarding this thread 
looking forward to seeing your manga picks!

best,
alicia
