 why join ngsic? community.

 

community is by far the greatest benefit of becoming a nsgic member. our online community forums offer year-long opportunities for networking and peer-to-peer mentoring.




 

 why join ngsic? leadership.

 

nsgic members are invited to develop their leadership skills by serving on one of our committees, working groups, or on the board of directors. members may also serve as a nsgic representative to partner organizations. leadership within the organization is encouraged and recognized each year at our annual conference awards ceremony and through featured digital content.




 

 why join ngsic? advocacy.

 

nsgic has been at the forefront of geospatial policy and resource development for more than 25 years, with advocacy work intended to help multiple levels of government implement the best possible policies. members serve as the foundational force behind nsgic’s national advocacy agenda.




 

 why join ngsic? resources.

 

members have access to a treasure trove of resources stored on the nsgic website. available resources include invitations to free webinars and access to recordings of past webinars, discussion forum archives, a member directory and library, job openings and funding opportunities.










as an advocate for gis industry standardization and interoperability, nsgic’s mission toward this goal is crucial in bringing together local, state, federal and private sector interests to one table.

nsgic initiative
geo-enabled elections

                        integrating gis in elections management ensures that voters are placed in the right voting district, receive the right ballot, and vote in the right electoral contests. it also saves time and work effort, facilitates audits, and makes redistricting easier. fewer errors, easy visualization, and greater transparency increase voters’ confidence that their voices are being heard.
