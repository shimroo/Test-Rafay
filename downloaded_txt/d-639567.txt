what our campers are saying 











"						


we loved our stay at mountain view!  clean campground and the cleanest and most well working washer and dryers we have ever had at a rv resort.  wish we could have stayed longer on our journey as the area is stunning.  highly recommend!

such a beautiful campground, the owners are working non stop to keep it pristine!
close to the lamoile bike trail, just a quick car ride to a parking area.
we will be back and will recommend to friends and family.

friendly staff, campsites were clean and well manicured. tubing along river was nice as well, a ten minute walk gets you about 20-30 minutes on the river depending on water level. camp store has anything you could want including ice cream and beer. very clean facilities.

go out of your way to stay here.  our rv spot was excellent.  we were steps from the river.  the rest rooms and shower facility were the nicest we've ever seen in a campground.  wifi strong, two pools, hot tub... it's like a resort!  changed our plans so we could stay a 2nd nite!
