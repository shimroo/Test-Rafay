                  talk at his high school alma mater, canisius, and his

                  fundraising luncheon at canisius and a day of classes
                  at buffalo state.

 
 during the strike, fontana
                  can still write but there are conditions. âi can write a play, i can write a short
                  story and i can write a tv script, but it cannot be
                  under contract. in other words, if i signed a contract
                  with showtime to write a pilot and then we went on
                  strike, i can't write that particular pilot.â

 
 he is writing a play.

the great oz


two decades on, itâs
                            clear that the 1997 premiere of oz was the
                            big bang of great tv.

"you know, itâs funny
                              because when you do something and then you
                              go and revisit it 20 years later, youâre
                              sort of terrified that itâs going to be
                              crap. and i just watched the pilot again
                              for the first time in 20 years and i was
                              happy to see, most of all, how incredible
                              the cast was and about the diversity in
                              the show. which i think 20 years ago was
                              fairly unheard of. "

 this
series



























                      premiered in the late â90s, featured an expansive
                      cast, and juggled humor and realism in a gritty
                      setting. there were capital-letter themes, lots of
                      nudity, and warring factions, not to mention edie
                      falco in a starring role.

when hbo
                      produced oz in 1997, american audiences had never
                      seen anything like it on television. the show was
                      ruthlessly violent â criticizing the penal justice
                      system, portraying both rape and homophobia,
                      interrogating race relations and pitting muslims
                      against christians. whatâs more, it was heavily
                      stylized, beginning each episode with a prelude
                      from wheelchair-bound prisoner augustus hill
                      (harold perrineau), who waxed poetic on larger
                      themes affecting the prisoners in oswald state
                      penitentiary.

after
                            22 years, the divorce didnât work out for
                            sagan lewis and tom fontana.


 
 they tried to maintain a severed
                          union. and for more than two decades, they
                          were successful. ms. lewis, a former actress,
                          lived in the verdant tangle of hawaii and then
                          arizona; he moved to the cobblestones of the
                          west village.
  she had a
                          child on her own; he wrote and produced some
                          of the most hard-edge, violent shows on
                          television. they saw each other on occasion
                          and still loved each other, but were not,
                          emphatically, a couple.
  and yet,
                          something kept bringing them together again.
                          finally, as if orchestrated by a hollywood

the
