the great war at
sea

 war in the trenches
 to all soldiers the word trenches meant sacrifices. trenches at gallipoli, turkey and hundreds of miles of trenches across belgium and france were world war 1's battlefields. histories of soldiers from all the countries who fought  have been kept alive by preserved diaries, wartime documents, memories, stories, maps and photos. 
 silent night in the trenches  world war one was 146 days old when many german, french and british ordinary soldiers in  trenches saw the futility of man against machine guns and  explosive shells. christmas eve 1914  guns in some areas fell silent replaced by christmas songs in french, german and english. soldiers peacefully met enemy soldiers in no-mans land.
