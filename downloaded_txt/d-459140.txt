so far so good
product: scott living otheri’ve only had the sl anniversary mattress for 2 weeks and so far, it’s good. needed a new mattress because i was waking up with back pains every morning and i needed something firmer but not too firm. mattress shopping is so distressing because it’s expensive and you don’t know if it’s going to end up being a piece of junk. i tried this mattress out in the store and was satisfied with how it felt. this particular one didn’t come in a box either, which was a plus for me. so i purchased it. this has helped my back tremendously. my upper body prefers soft because i’m a side sleeper but my back needs something with more support. medium is the way to go. time will tell if it continues to hold up, but as of now, i’m satisfied. hope this mattress lasts for years to come.

rated 5 out of 5product: comfortcare otherwe bought 1 king size restonic mattress 8-10 years ago. it was fenomenal. recently, we decided to replace it and started searching on the web about the best mattress on the market. it was overwhelming to say the least and not to mention the high cost as we have decided to go for 2 twin xl with adjustable bases. have been using for 2 weeks. after all the searching, we decided to replace our old mattress with another restronic and we are so pleased for various reasons. the comfort is outstanding, the prices are fenomenal, the quality of craftsmanship superb. whenever is time to change our mattresses again, we’ll get another restonic.

rated 3 out of 5product: biltmore level 1 mattressi bought my hybrid mattress from qvc a year ago.  although the mattress itself is comfortable, we are not totally satisfied.  i do not get a full night’s rest.  it was advertised that you will not feel the other person when they toss and turn or get out of the bed.  my husband gets up a few times in the middle of the night  and i feel and roll every time he turns to bed and vice versa. it does not do us well at all. would like to return.
