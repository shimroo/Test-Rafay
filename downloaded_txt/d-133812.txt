discharged army national guard veteran faces possible displacement 
this is your opportunity to provide assistance to this honorably discharged army national guard veteran who faces unexpected and urgent home repairs. this brave veteran has dedicated his life to serving our country, often at great personal sacrifice, and we believe that he deserves our support during this difficult time. unfortunately, the veteran's home has been hit with unexpected malfunctions, making it uninhabitable until significant repairs are completed. he is currently unable to afford the cost of these repairs, and as a result, he is facing the possibility of being forced out of his home. by contributing to this cause, you can help alleviate the financial burden that this veteran is facing and ensure that he has a safe and habitable living situation. your donation will make a significant impact, allowing him to focus on other aspects of his life without worrying about the condition of his home.
