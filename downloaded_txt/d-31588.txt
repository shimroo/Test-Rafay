here’s who we are










dry and refreshing. not too sweet.




made in small batches. family-owned since 2003, we take pride in making our product in small batches. this ensures that ingredients are fresher, batches are watched closely for quality, and inventory holding is minimized. we only produce what we’d be proud to serve in our own household! 
simple ingredients. our sodas contain simple ingredients without any diet sweeteners or artificial colors. we source only the highest quality juices, extracts, and cane sugar to provide a clean and sophisticated taste. available in resealable glass bottles, our sodas are heat pasteurized to maintain quality and shelf life.
a dry taste. gus sodas lack the cloying sweetness of mainstream sodas. instead of using off-tasting low-calorie sweeteners or filler juices, we simply cut back the sugar to achieve a “grown-up” taste profile. this dry taste makes them an ideal accompaniment to fine food and as a base for easy-to-make cocktails.
