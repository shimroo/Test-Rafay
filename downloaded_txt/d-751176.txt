what do people think of our boats? “in 2011 this company built us an absolutely outstanding 12 meter power cat for our resort diving operation in fiji (the namale resort & spa in savusavu fiji). we could not be happier with both the vessel itself, and, it's after-sale service. top shelf all the way. also thank you to scott robson for a fantastic vessel design.” namale “ramco is an iconic name in new zealand boating and fishing circles, with the recognition factor amongst the marine-oriented of, say, the edmonds cookbook to those flatting for the first time, or watties tomato sauce to aficionados of fish and chips.” sam mossmannew zealand fishing newsread more reviews
