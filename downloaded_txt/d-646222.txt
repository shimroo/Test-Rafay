what people are saying about people & stories/gente y cuentos



























“i never left dennelisse without feeling inspired. the participants were open, engaged, and appreciative... many of them said the program had deepened or reawakened their love of reading, and of writing their own stories. i felt privileged to have had this opportunity.“— jane scott











“people and stories/gente y cuentos is such a worthwhile and important organization to support because literature belongs to everyone. each person deserves to have his/her/their voice heard and experiences shared, and the programs offered by p&s/gyc provide the space for people to do so. further, as our digital world causes us to become increasingly isolated, p&s/gyc is doing the opposite by creating opportunities for diverse groups of people to find community, commonality, and connection. i am honored and excited to be a part of this organization as a future coordinator, and i encourage others to support its mission in any way possible.“— teresa leary

ellie fisher
executive director

we had our last session at dennelisse today. it was pretty fantastic. we filled out the surveys, read aunt cristina, and took pictures with a sheet cake i had brought them. it said, "to an awesome group" which they were. we combined both groups over three hours so i put them in smaller groups for part of our story discussion. it worked great. we read "still i rise" and from that, i gave them a writing prompt about finding their voice - as cristina and maya angelou had. their writings were so powerful. i concluded with a haiku one of them had written last week after reading abalone. i had asked them to write one. anthony wrote:
