ciao for now rabbit! good times.







san antonio - the white rabbit, a 
popular live music venue on the st. mary's strip north of downtown since
 the mid-1990s, is shutting down saturday.

the building was sold to new owners, who plan to renovate it and keep it as a new live music venue.

rhonda
 sciaraffa, the owner of the white rabbit, said the venue was special to
 her and is pleased the new owners will continue to operate the business
 as a live music venue.

"i didn't want the love of music here in 
san antonio to go away for these kids," sciaraffa said. "i'm going to 
tell you the number one thing for me has been under 21 kids."

about 50 bands will take the stage for the final weekend. among them is singer and songwriter julian gill.

"it's
 a really big deal to be able to play a final show amongst all of these 
awesome musicians," gill said. "i'm going to miss this place, honestly."

the new venue will reopen march 1, 2015.

alice cooper at the majestic theatre - tickets on sale this friday






an evening with

alice cooper

raise the dead tour






wednesday, february 11 * 8pm

majestic theatre



on sale halloween

this friday, october 31 at noon



san antonio, tx — alice cooper, pioneer of a grandly theatrical brand of hard rock designed to shock, brings his dark and horror-themed theatrics to the majestic theatre (224 e. houston st.) on wednesday, february 11 at 8pm.tickets go on sale this friday, october 31 at noon.

drawing equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock, the group created a stage show that featured electric chairs, guillotines, fake blood and boa constrictors. with a schedule that includes six months each year on the road, alice cooperbrings his own brand of rock psycho-drama to fans both old and new, enjoying it as much as the audience does. known as the architect of shock-rock, cooper (in both the original alice cooper band and as a solo artist) has rattled the cages and undermined the authority of generations of guardians of the status quo, continuing to surprise fans and exude danger at every turn, like a great horror movie.

the alice cooper band was discovered in 1969. their collaboration with young record producer bob ezrin led to the break-through third album love it to death which hit the charts in 1971, followed by killer, school’s out, billion dollar babies, andmuscle of love. in 1975, cooper released his first solo album, welcome to my nightmare that was accompanied by the legendary groundbreaking theatrical welcome to my nightmare concert tour.

alice's solo career skyrocketed in the late 1970's, with a succession of hit singles, including "you & me," and classic albums, including lace and whiskey and from the inside, and bigger and even more elaborate concert tours.

in the ‘80’s cooper explored different sounds, highlighted by the new wavish album flush the fashion, the heavy metalconstrictor and raise your fist and yell, and then 1989’s  melodic hard rock album trash, which featured the massive hit single “poison” and became his biggest selling album and single worldwide.

in the new millennium, cooper has been very productive and busy, writing, recording and releasing the new albums including 2011's welcome 2 my nightmare, plus old school 1964-1974, a box set celebrating the original band.

alice has been touring consistently, year in and year out, averaging over 80 concerts annually, both within the usa and internationally, with his band which features the three guitar attack of guitar stars nita strauss, ryan roxie and tommy henriksen, plus the rhythm section of drummer glen sobel and longtime bassist chuck garric.

alice was inducted into the rock n roll hall of fame in march 2011. with his influence on rock & roll long since acknowledged, there is little that alice cooper hasn't achieved in his remarkable career, including platinum albums, sold-out tours and any number of honors and career achievement awards.  

tickets for alice cooper ($37-$57) will be available at the majestic theatre box office, ticketmaster.com or by phone at 800.745.3000. all tickets subject to applicable service charge. for more information, visit majesticempire.com.

this performance is part of the bud light concert series at the majestic theatre.

una noche en la gloria - contemporary art in the cultural zone saturday, september 13, 2014 - 4:00pm to 11:30pm

una noche en la gloria is an ambitious economic development strategy converging visual art, fashion, and the performance art world.  volunteer organized by the creative affiliates of the contemporary art and literature organization (calo) and sponsored by the avenida guadalupe association with support from citibank, the westside development corporation, and the communication workers of america (cwa), “una noche en la gloria” is cultural evolution harnessed to promote san antonio’s underserved creative micro-entrepreneurs.  "una noche en la gloria" is a far reaching forum for generational and disciplinary exchange that enables aspiring young artists to participate alongside accomplished professionals bridging the generation gap and pro-actively passing down values that have economically sustained local artists for generations.  calo and our sponsors seek to help creative entrepreneurs sustain the connection between artists and the city.  we believe that together we can strengthen the bridge between our artists, our citizens, and our cultural tourism industry, encouraging continued self-sufficiency while simultaneously investing in a healthy and prosperous creative economy that strengthens all of san antonio.
