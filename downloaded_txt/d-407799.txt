 the ultimate icf system


the choice to use icf instead of wood frame, etc., is obviously based 
            on the perception that icf is better. which icf system provides the 
            best set of features and benefits that are considered to be valuable 
            for the project? there are only a few types of icf systems. each type 
            offers significantly different construction issues and completed results 
            to the owner. comparisons of the features and benefits of the three 
            types (solid monolithic concrete, waffle grid, and screen grid) are 
            readily available. the comparisons are rarely âapples to applesâ, 
            rather based on a variety of different test standards, criteria, and 
            calculations. the actual performance of the icfâs can be construed 
            as being adequate for constructing energy efficient, durable, disaster 
            resistant, sound concrete walls.there are significant differences 
            in the three types however. the manufacturers offer a myriad of different 
            sales pitches filled with technical information, facts and emotional 
            text. buyer beware.

 optimum tools


once you have committed to build with icf and you have your materials 
            on site or on order, you need to start considering your plan of action 
            on site. the best icf system can be turned around into one of the 
            worst installations simply by trying to build the walls without the 
            right tools.this list of tools and equipment is includes everything 
            from the basic tools to the optimum setup to handle virtually any 
            icf install project. the tools and equipment are broken down into 
            several categories. many of the tools needed for installing icfâs 
            are not specific to icf but some items such as a wall alignment scaffold 
            system are somewhat proprietary to icf. the category delineation has 
            some overlap so your interpretation is invited. supplies for specific 
            applications such as anchor tunnels etc. are not considered part of 
            the supply list.

 dispelling icf myths


the icf industry (term used loosely) is rampant with inaccurate information. 
            this is definitely a 'buyer beware' product. manufacturers, dealers 
            and distributors of the products, installers and builders alike tend 
            to disseminate information that is questionable at best. the toughest 
            part of researching icfâs is not the gathering of information but 
            the sorting of the information. what is true and factually correct 
            and what is myth or âi believe this to be true, so i will state it 
            as factâ to the customer? virtually every aspect of icf is affected 
            by misstated information, whether the discussion is about r-values, 
            structural specifications, cost issues, termites and bugs, application 
            of finishes or waterproofing, electrical, or general installation 
            conversations.

 water management


the first line of defense against mold is preventing the entry of 
            bulk water into building assemblies. if you donât win that battle, 
            youâll lose the war. yes, if you want a mold-free and durable building, 
            controlling indoor relative humidity requires attention as well. but 
            first things first: it all starts with draining water down and out 
            from all roofs, walls and foundations.

 features & benefits of icf


once a structure is built with icf there is no comparison to typical 
            frame or block construction. the icf industry falls into a trap of 
            comparing the benefits and features to typical frame construction, 
            there are no true comparisons between the two. both icf and traditional 
            methods of construction perform the same requirements for most structures, 
            but icf performance criteria are significantly greater than traditional 
            methods.

insulating concrete forms


why build with icf?

safety & health 
energy performance
flexibility in design
comfort

insulated concrete forms (or icfs) are forms or molds that have built-in 
        insulation for accepting reinforced concrete. the first patent application 
        for an icf was registered in the late 1960âs. since then, and particularly 
        in the last 4 years, icfs have been fast-becoming the mainstream preferred 
        building product worldwide for all of the right reasons. these large, 
        hollow blocks are stacked right off of the truck and filled with reinforcing 
        bar and concrete. the end result leaves you with a high-performing wall 
        that is structurally sound, insulated, strapped, has a vapor barrier and 
        is ready to accept final exterior and interior finishes.
