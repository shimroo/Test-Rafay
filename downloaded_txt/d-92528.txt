march, 2024, marked the 31-year anniversary of trestlewood's entry into the reclaimed wood arena.
                   there was nothing gradual about this entry - we kicked things off by acquiring the salvage rights to the
                   greater than 20 million board feet of timbers, lumber and logs in the great salt lake's lucin cutoff
                   railroad trestle (see the trestlewood story.) 31 years later, we still have some "salty fir" and other
                   wood from the trestle, along with millions of board feet of reclaimed wood from many other sources.
trestlewood also offers natureaged, harbor fir, and other product lines that are manufactured from
                   new lumber to provide a reclaimed wood look and many of the other advantages of antique wood
                   products. these manufactured products can provide attractive alternatives or supplements to
                   reclaimed lumber, siding, flooring, and timber products.
