this election season has revealed the plain truth: our nation is deeply divided on what it means to be human on the planet in relationship to our neighbors. is this a democracy? and what must people of faith do to build a more just society, no matter who is holding elected office? at this critical crossroads, people of moral courage and fierce love are called to rise to the challenge that just love demands. together, we must protect the vulnerable, fight for justice, and commit to healing our nation.
