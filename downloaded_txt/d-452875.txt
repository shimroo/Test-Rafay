that is the root of all evil. but wait a minute! if money didn't exist, then the love for money wouldn't exist, so i guess money is the root of all evil, after all! — wcs  navigation find more

name is william c. spaulding. i write all the articles and do most of the illustrations for this site. the only illustrations i have not done are graphs and photos downloaded from government websites. i present this section to illustrate the major features of this site, including types of content and other features, such as navigational aids. it also gives you a good sample of my content and my writing. but do remember that these excerpts do not have the context here that they would in their original pages. the purpose of this site is to teach the fundamental concepts of economics, personal finance, and investments. these topics were chosen because they are highly interrelated, so the concepts learned in economics, for instance, can be applied to personal finance and investments. indeed, economics makes it much easier to learn why things are how they are and how they behave over time. learning these subjects also improves your life. to facilitate learning these concepts, i use many pedagogical features that will enhance learning, listed below this section. there are over 850 articles on this site, grouped under the appropriate categories, which, on a desktop, you can see in the sidebar on the left or, on a smaller screen, such as a phone, at the bottom of any article. clicking on these links will display the list of topics in that category. i have included many of the pedagogical features on this page. although some are long, they provide a good preview of what my site offers. graphs and illustrations as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so where images make concepts clearer, i use them. most of the images also have extensive captions to clarify and expand the information conveyed by the image. here are 2 examples: from the deadweight loss of taxation:   to see why this deadweight loss occurs, look at the supply and demand curves in the graph below. when a market transaction is taxed, the buyer pays a higher price, and the seller receives a lower price. this lowers demand, which shifts the buyer's equilibrium from the market price (pm) to a higher price (pb) at lower quantities; likewise, because the seller receives a lower price (ps) for his product, less of it is supplied, which moves the seller's equilibrium down the supply curve, to a lower price and quantity. the amount the government receives equals the tax, which equals the buyer's price minus the seller's price, times the quantity of the transaction, whether for goods or services. tax revenue = tax × quantity   the area of the light purple rectangle in the graph = the tax revenue collected by the government. the area of the dark purple triangle = the economic welfare lost to taxation.  pb = price buyers pay. demand is reduced because buyers must pay a higher price because of the tax. pm = market price without taxes. ps = price sellers receive. qe = the quantity supplied without the tax. qt = the reduced quantity supplied because of the tax.    from duration and convexity, with illustrations and formulas   note that the price-yield curve is convex and that the modified duration is the slope of the tangent line to a particular market yield, and that the discrepancy between the price-yield curve and the modified duration increases with greater changes in the interest rate. it can easily be seen that modified duration changes as the yield changes because it is obvious that the slope of the line changes with different yields. the gap between the modified duration and the convex price-yield curve is the convexity adjustment, which — as can be easily seen — is greater on the upside than on the downside.   svg images many of the images use a format called scalable vector graphics, or svg, which are defined mathematically, so they are usually much smaller than raster graphics such as png, gif, or jpeg images. since they are constructed mathematically, they can be adjusted to any size without losing any resolution, from phones to high-resolution monitors. moreover, they look a lot better than the rasterized equivalent. the 2 images above are both svg images. however, svg is only suitable for simple graphics and illustrations, such as diagrams. more complex images, such as photographs, use the jpeg format. color-coded examples for more complex examples, i use color coding to show the interrelationship of different parts, making it easier to follow and faster to comprehend. from child tax credit:  example: calculating the child tax credit for incomes above the phaseout amount ava is a single parent with 2 dependent children who qualify for the child tax credit, and she earned $215,020 for the tax year. because her income is $15,020 more than the phaseout amount of $200,000 for a head of household, she must reduce the $4,000 child tax credit that she would otherwise be entitled to by:  $215,020 − $200,000  = $15,020, rounded up to $16,000 since the $20 portion is a fraction of $1,000. $16,000/$1,000 = 16 16 × $50 = $800 child tax credit = 2 × $2,000 − $800 = $3,200.   here's another example from bond pricing and accrued interest, illustrated with examples, where color coding facilitates following the example and also illustrates how to use certain tools, such as microsoft excel, in doing some of the examples:  examples — using microsoft excel for calculating bond prices and discounts these listed variables — where they apply — will be used for each of the example calculations that follow, for a 10-year bond originally issued on 1/1/2024 with a par value of $1,000:  settlement date = 1/2/2024 maturity date = 12/15/2033 issue date = 12/15/2023 coupon rate = 6% yield to maturity = 8% price (per $100 of face value) = 21.99 redemption = 100 frequency = 2 for most coupon bonds. basis = 1 (actual/actual)  price of a bond with a yield to maturity of 8%: bond price  =price(date(2024,1,2), date(2033,12,15), 0.06, 0.08, 100,2,1)    = 86.44858 = $864.49  the discount price of a zero coupon bond with a $1,000 par value yielding 8%: price discount  = pricedisc(date(2024,1,2), date(2033,12,15), 0.06, 0.08, 100,1)   = 20.39420 = $203.94  the interest rate of a discounted zero coupon bond paying $1,000 at maturity, but that is now selling for $219.90: interest rate of bond discount  = disc(date(2024,1,2), date(2033,12,15), 21.99, 100,1)    = 0.78396 = 7.84% note that the pricedisc function value has been rounded, with the results used in the disc function to verify the results. (21.99 = $219.90 for a bond with a $1,000 par value).  pricemat calculates the prices of securities that only pay interest at maturity: what is the price of a negotiable, 90-day cd originally issued for $100,000 on 3/1/2024 with a nominal yield of 8%, a yield to maturity of 6% and a settlement date of 4/1/2024? using the microsoft excel date function, with format date(year,month,day), to calculate the maturity date by adding 90 days to the issue date and choosing the banker's year of 360 days by omitting its value from the formula, yields this result:  market price of cd = pricemat(date(2024,4,1), date(2024,3,1) + 90, date(2024,3,1), 0.08,0.06)   = 99.65916 (per $100 of face value) × 1,000 = $99,659.16     other special types of content i use real-world examples to illustrate how the concepts are applied to the real world, to increase understanding, such as this example from will execution: the common law elements of the wills act formalities  real word examples: testamentary intent clauses of famous wills  last will and testament of elvis a. presley "i, elvis a. presley, a resident and citizen of shelby county, tennessee, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby make, publish and declare this instrument to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils by me at any time heretofore made."   last will and testament of leona m. helmsley "i, leona m. helmsley, a resident of the state, city and county of new york, declare this to be my last will and testament."     i also include alerts about special situations that readers should be particularly aware of, such as this one about credit ratings on bonds from credit rating agencies, from the complete introduction to bonds: investor alert! note that credit ratings are not foolproof. enron had an investment-grade rating right up until it declared bankruptcy, and worldcom up to 3 months before filing for bankruptcy! it's also a good idea to check all the credit-rating agencies for a particular issuer, because different agencies have different criteria, and different strengths and weaknesses in rating bond issuers. many articles also have notes and history to point out certain facts or to illustrate how things were or came to be, such as these 2 examples from credit scores: sometimes, payments are not made because they are disputed. if your dispute is unresolved, you have a right to add a statement in your credit report, limited to 100 words, explaining why you refuse to pay. note, however, that your statement will not protect your credit score since explanations cannot be quantified, so the credit-scoring algorithm cannot consider your statement. it will, however, account for a missed payment.  fannie mae is using trended credit data to underwrite consumers in mid-2016, fannie mae started using trended credit data from all 3 credit reporting agencies — equifax, experian, and transunion — for all mortgage applications. the trended credit data focuses on credit data from the past 30 months showing not only if payments were made on time, but whether the borrowers carried balances from month-to-month, paid off the balances in full, or at least paid more than the minimum. studies by transunion have shown that consumers who carry balances or only pay the minimum balance are a greater risk than those who pay in full. transunion estimates that trended credit data will put more consumers, from 12% to more than 21%, in the so-called super prime risk tier, who are offered the best credit terms. source:  a focus on credit history for mortgage approvals - the new york times  or this one from united states treasury securities: bills, notes, bonds, treasury-inflation protected securities (tips), and strips:  quick facts on the national debt the us debt is financed mostly by selling us treasury securities. the united states has carried debt since the american revolution. only during the presidency of andrew jackson has the united states been truly debt-free. as of 2024, the us debt exceeds $35 trillion, but $7 trillion of that debt is what the government owes to other government agencies, such as the social security trust fund.  the annual deficit is the amount the government takes in taxes minus the amount it spends during the year. a budget surplus occurs when tax collections exceed expenditures for the year. the only budget surplus that has occurred in recent times was during the presidency of bill clinton, when the government started to tax the rich more. since then, beginning with the bush presidency, taxes on the wealthy were greatly reduced, resulting in greatly increased annual deficits, exacerbated by the iraqi and afghanistan wars, by the great recession of 2007 to 2009, and by the covid-19 pandemic.  the debt limit is the amount that the treasury could borrow without asking congress. before 1917, the treasury had to ask congress every time it wanted to increase the debt. since then, the treasury must ask congress to authorize more debt only if the debt is expected to exceed the debt ceiling. an annual deficit increases the national debt, while a budget surplus decreases it. to see the latest statistics and how quickly the us debt is growing, check out  u.s. national debt clock : real time. in september, 2024, the us debt has reached $35 trillion mark and will continue to grow even more rapidly because of the tax cuts passed by donald trump and the republican congress at the end of 2017.  source:  national debt  while this site focuses on how things work, it also has many tips for using the information in real life, such as these tips from credit scores:  additional tips and resources for improving your credit score  get free credit reports at annualcreditreport.com periodically — a good, free way to monitor your credit report. stagger the requests from each agency over time to detect changes in your credit report sooner.  some credit cards offer free credit scores that are updated monthly. for instance, discover card provides a free fico score based on your credit information held by transunion. even if the credit card does not provide a fico score, any score can be used to monitor changes in your credit information by checking for monthly changes in your score. credit scores often change by 10 to 20 points during the month, but if you notice larger changes when there was no significant credit event, check your credit report from the agency on which the score is based for errors or for possible identity theft. as of november 2015, you can upload supporting documents, such as paid bills or canceled checks, to support your credit dispute. source:  fixing credit report errors online gets added heft -

 transunion, equifax and experian agree to overhaul credit reporting practices - nytimes.com believe it or not, i also have opinions, such as this one from payment systems:  bitcoins and cryptocurrencies will never be major currencies another form of payment receiving media attention recently is bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. some of the main advantages advanced for bitcoin are that:  the supply is strictly limited and not controlled by the government bitcoins can be subdivided indefinitely into smaller payments, allowing for micro-payments, and  however, some of these advantages touted for bitcoin result because it is an entirely electronic form of money. if the united states dollar or the euro was made entirely electronic, then those currencies could be subdivided indefinitely to allow for micro-payments. most fiat currencies have a lower limit for value because they are represented by coins and paper currency, which cost money to produce. indeed, the us penny and nickel cost more to produce than their fiat value. on the other hand, the value of electronic money can be reduced, virtually without limit, to form smaller payments. when money becomes entirely electronic and the government institutes reforms to exploit electronic payments — which i believe is inevitable — then all the advantages of electronic payment, such as enabling micro-payments and lowering transaction costs, will be realized for that currency. that the supply of bitcoin is limited is actually a major disadvantage since the value of bitcoin varies widely over short periods because supply cannot be increased or decreased to meet changing demand. so, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, or for that matter, any other means of payment, such as gold, where the supply cannot be controlled, cannot satisfy the primary functions of money as a unit of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. using cryptocurrencies as a unit of exchange is very risky. imagine if walmart or amazon accepted bitcoin for payment. what would happen to these companies — or any other company — if the value of bitcoin suddenly dropped to half its value or more, as it has already done? in december 2017, the price of 1 bitcoin reached almost $20,000. shortly afterward, near the start of 2018, the price of bitcoin was less than $9,000 (usd)! the pay rate for employees would have to change every week and prices paid to suppliers would have to change with every payment. this would be a managerial nightmare! it cannot serve as a unit of account because its varying value, even within a short time, makes its exchange value for goods and services unpredictable; price comparisons would be impossible because these cryptocurrencies vary in value by the minute, so any prices you would see may be stale, reflecting the value that bitcoin had at an earlier time. likewise, it cannot serve as a store of value since it can lose value very quickly, as has already occurred several times with bitcoin and many times with gold. additionally, using methods common in business and investments, such as calculating the present value or future value of projects or investments or even calculating financial risk, becomes impossible. calculating present or future value is only meaningful if the currency's value is stable. even though most currencies decrease in value because of inflation, inflation is usually low and predictable, so it is easier to account for inflation. hence, bitcoin or any other type of money where the supply cannot be controlled will never serve as a major currency or co-currency. instead, bitcoin will remain as it is, a novelty currency that can be used either as a medium of exchange for those businesses or individuals willing to assume the risk of a widely fluctuating currency or to profit from speculation, where profits are contingent on the greater fool theory. because the intrinsic value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is 0, that is the price that i believe it will eventually fall to, though it may take many years. (another factor propping up the prices of cryptocurrencies far beyond their intrinsic value is micro-demand. because cryptocurrencies can be subdivided into ever smaller amounts, i believe many people are getting these small amounts to experiment with these novel currencies. when the demand for these micro-amounts is totaled over the entire global population, the result is significant demand. eventually, people will realize that cryptocurrencies offer no added value over traditional forms of electronic payments, nor are they spendable at most places, so, it is still my prediction that all cryptocurrencies will drop to their intrinsic value of 0, though it may take years. blockchain, of course, has great promise, but this is used only to record transactions. although bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies depend on blockchain, blockchain does not depend on the cryptocurrencies.)  a few of my articles also have summaries, although most of my articles are already concise. from money growth, money velocity, and inflation:  money growth, money velocity, and inflation  low, stable inflation optimizes economic growth. inflation results when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply. aggregate demand is influenced both by the supply of money and the velocity of money. the classical theory of inflation states that money growth causes inflation. inflation depends on money growth and the velocity of money. the velocity of money equals the average number of times an average dollar is used to buy goods and services per unit of time. nominal gdp is the price of all final goods and services provided by an economy. therefore: nominal gdp = quantity of money × velocity of money nominal gdp = real gdp × prices which leads to the equation of exchange:  quantity of money (m) × velocity of money (v) = real gdp (y) × prices (p) or prices = quantity of money × velocity of money / real gdp so, prices increase when the product of the money supply and its velocity grows faster than real gdp. likewise, for changes in these economic variables:  δm + δv = δp + δy to simplify their models for the short run, economists treat the velocity of money and real gdp as constant. therefore: inflation = money growth or δp = δm   i also provide resources and links to additional information, such as:  resources    an overview of consumer data and credit reporting - contains extensive information about credit reporting agencies. according to this study by the federal reserve, more than 1/2 of accounts in collection involve unpaid medical bills. research looks at how mortgage delinquencies affect scores (note: the link that i had provided for this entry is no longer available.) - banking analytics blog - this blog entry, posted on fico's website, shows the impact of late payments on mortgages for 3 typical borrowers with initial credit score of 680, 720, and 780. it also points out that a short sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure or other settlement, or a foreclosure will have the same impact on one's credit score, lowering the credit score to around 605 to 675. however, if there is a deficiency balance, the credit score can drop as low as 570. the post also lists the time it will take to recover to the previous score, where an initial 680 score will take 9 months to recover after being either 30 days or 90 days late on a mortgage payment, whereas someone with an initial score of 780 will take 3 years to recover after a 30-day late payment and 7 years to recover after a 90-day late payment, which is the length of time that the credit event can be listed in the credit reports on which the score is based. bankruptcy lowers the credit score to about 525 to 560 for all borrowers. however, a 680 score can recover in about 5 years, while the 720 and 780 scores will take 7 years to recover, while a chapter 7 bankrupt will take 10 years to recover, which is how long the bankruptcy can be listed in the credit report. the time it takes to recover from a short sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or a foreclosure is the same as it is for a bankruptcy.   consumer data industry association -

mortgages - according to this article, a single mortgage payment that is 30 days late will impact the borrower's credit score. short sales and foreclosures are also very destructive, but a loan modification on a mortgage will be much less damaging, possibly causing only a 10- or 15-point drop. another tip pointed out by this article is that a homeowner need not become delinquent to apply for a loan modification.   unpaid medical bills can ruin a credit score   how mortgage modifications affect credit scores   most pages do not have all these features since many articles do not benefit from them, but they are used when they improve the article. (and, of course, when i think of it!) responsive website this website is designed to respond to different screen sizes so that the articles remain readable from phones to oversized high-resolution monitors. many of the articles contain equations, which i write using tables rather than images because tables are designed to be responsive for different screen sizes. using svg images also improves responsiveness to screen sizes and orientation. my website has style sheet sections for printing and viewing on mobile devices. if a page is printed, it will not include any advertising, navigational links, or any other content not useful on the printed page. on screens wider than 1,400 pixels, there is a fixed sidebar with a search box at the top, followed by navigational links to major sections of the site. on smaller screens, the pages have no sidebar so that all the screen space can be devoted to the article. in this case, the search box is located below the footer near the bottom of each page. update policy i continually update my articles with new information or to improve readability or comprehension. some information may be dated, but i continue to use it because it provides the same pedagogical value. because many of my examples take much work, i will not update the examples themselves while they reflect current understanding and procedure. for instance, in my article on butterfly and condor option spreads, i use real bid/ask prices for specific stocks, such as microsoft and facebook, to illustrate how these option strategies work. this takes time, but there is no advantage to using more recent prices since the principle of option spreads remains the same. but it does allow me to construct many graphs and show actual results of using different options strategies based on real bid/ask prices for a specific period. here is an example of a long-put butterfly for facebook, using prices from 2014:  example: long put butterfly  stock price $73.06    long put butterfly   october, 2014 puts strike price   1 long k1 70 -$3.10   2 short k2 72.5 $8.30   1 long k3 75 -$5.60      debit $0.40    maximum loss $0.40   maximum profit $2.10      line chart showing the potential profit/loss of a long put butterfly option spread at expiration for underlying stock prices ranging from $69.50 to $76.     the price of facebook, now meta, stock is much higher. i could update the above example and the many other examples in the article with higher prices, but it would make no difference in illustrating how option spreads work. on the other hand, continually updating these tables and graphs would take much work but would not add pedagogical value. a valuable resource for me is my readers. i have been writing articles for this website for 18 years, as of may 2024, so i often receive emails about mistakes in my articles or other problems with the article or website. this allows me to make corrections and improvements continually. it always helps to have a diversity of opinions. when i write, i often edit different parts of the document, editing here and there, striving for perfection. but in doing so, i often become blind even to obvious mistakes, so it helps to have fresh eyes reading the articles. you can find my email address in the sidebar or, at the bottom, in the footer section of every page, or right here: contact me! so, if you see any mistakes, or if you have suggestions, please email me. a note to the grammarian police originally, grammar was the study of how a language was constructed, how the individual words are put together to form meaning. then, in time, some people dubbed themselves to be the grammarian police — grammandos! — and have asserted that writing must follow the grammar rules rigorously, and, nowadays, we even have grammar software to ensure that our writing is so constructed. i disagree with maintaining a rigid grammatical structure. the main purpose of language is to communicate. if there is a better way to communicate, it should be done, even if it breaks the grammar rules. case in point: writing numbers as actual numbers rather than as words because numbers can be read faster when they are written as numbers rather than as words, including the numbers 1 through 10. (the only problem with 1 is that it looks like i, depending on the font family of the letters, and my voice recognition software seems to prefer "one" over 1.) however, i only use the number 1 when referring to the number, not when it is being used to refer to a person or thing, such as "any one of you". i also know that grammandos are not gonna like "gonna" nor the fact that i put the period after the apostrophe. (okay, i only used "gonna" here to make the grammandos cringe a little.) i also often write first as 1st and second as 2nd, and so on. i don't always write ordinal numbers this way since i must consider how people will search for certain topics. so in those cases where the ordinal number may be part of popular search terms, i will continue to write it out as a word. because nouns can also be used as adjectives, i have also chosen, in many cases, where there is no possibility of misinterpretation, to use the noun as an adjective rather than using possessive forms of the noun. so, i write  stockholders equity rather than stockholders' equity. this looks cleaner. i also put punctuation marks after quotation marks instead of before the end quotation mark. i think it looks better, and i sometimes do not want the punctuation marks to be within the quotation marks, such as quoting search terms. for instance, to get basic information about companies from general search engines, i may write to just search for the term stock + the ticker symbol, such as “stock msft”. this also makes it easier to select the search terms without selecting the punctuation mark, and the punctuation mark itself also stands out. i think language can be improved in many ways to speed comprehension. for instance, using mathematical symbols for some words, such as = for equals. i don't always do this on my site because i am not sure how people would react. but i believe that people would comprehend written documents faster if they were so written. it might be worthwhile to have some scientists measure the differences in comprehension speed between a document that used all words and a document that used other common symbols, especially mathematical symbols. in fact, a committee should be formed to seek ways to improve language in much the same way as the w3.org works to improve html and css. i would like to make 1 suggestion right now. in english, no word refers to either male or female in the 3rd person singular. hence, writers are reduced to saying he or she, his or her, or him or  her, or they are forced to alternate between the references to avoid being labeled sexist. sometimes this is useful when using 2 people in examples since this removes any ambiguity in pronoun referents, but usually it results in superfluous language. therefore, i propose this:  e to refer to the 3rd person singular for either sex and er to refer to the objective case, as her does for the pronoun she, and ers for the possessive case. maybe this new 3rd person singular should be capitalized as the pronoun i is, to distinguish it from the natural logarithm base e, although, usually, context should clarify the meaning. in any case, this is just a suggestion. i will also probably use   singular they more, if the meaning is clear. english also needs a 2nd person plural pronoun that differs from the singular pronoun. although context could often be used to distinguish between the 2 possibilities, there are too many times when the referent is ambiguous. a natural suggestion would be “yous.” i have also decided to cut back on my use of the words generally and usually, and other, often superfluous, words. although i use these terms a lot because most statements have exceptions, not modifying the statements with generally or usually doesn’t mean that the statement is categorical. but removing these terms often makes the reading better, i think. i will only use these words when necessary. i have only decided to do this on november 23, 2019, so most of my articles still use these terms liberally. this is not to say that this site has no unintended grammatical errors that impede comprehension. although i run the documents through a grammar checker for a 2nd opinion, even if i don't always follow that opinion, i am sure that errors slip through anyway. nonetheless, if you want to comment on this, please email me. i would be interested in your opinion. maybe i should set up a facebook page for this topic, but, alas, i do not have the time. since there are over 800 articles on this site written since 2005, my thoughts on grammar and my propensities have changed through the years, yielding some inconsistencies in the rules that i have used, something that grammandos the world over are definitely not gonna like, but considering that what is acceptable and not acceptable in grammar has changed throughout the years as evinced by the changing results of usage panel surveys and by literature itself, my main objectives are clarity and conciseness. you can at least be consoled that there is no beowulf here. my books      how to invest in bonds for maximum profit shows how you can invest in bonds to maximize your profits, especially

anyone can understand. i think this book is particularly pertinent for the upcoming 2020 elections since it not only describes the best tax policy, but it also explains why the current tax policy is both inadequate for generating sufficient revenue for the government, and how it increases inequality. this book also shows the problems with the several tax proposals being presented by the democratic candidates. so, if you want to argue intelligently about tax policy at your next party or family gathering, this is the book to get. :-)       an introductory textbook on economics,

from millersville university, located in lancaster county, pennsylvania, but most of my knowledge comes from constantly reading, writing, thinking, and doing examples. i continually read textbooks, magazine articles, and other news sources about economics, personal finance, and investments. unlike most other sites, i continually edit my articles to provide more updated and clearer information, especially when my readers alert me to mistakes or ambiguities. i also provide worked-out examples for many of the articles. writing is the best education because it forces you to think deeply about the topic, to research it thoroughly, and to ensure that it coheres with other principles and facts. i sometimes disagree with the consensus, and i will point out why i believe it is so, allowing you to decide if my argument has merit. i also get feedback from readers like yourself, pointing out mistakes i correct immediately — a major benefit of reading from a website rather than a book, even an ebook. i also provide many references to my topics, including individual facts, such as points of law, where you can review that information instantly by clicking on the link, which will open a new window. for instance, in my tax articles, i provide direct links to all the referenced irs forms, as well as many individual provisions of the tax code and to the many instructions and other publications by the irs. of course, another source of my knowledge, is from personal experience, though it is, by necessity, much more limited than the many topics that i cover. nonetheless, writing about many topics gives me a greater perspective and better insight into each topic since they are interrelated.               personal finance  bankruptcy chapter 7 chapter 13 chapter 11   credit and
