what to expectfind out





new covenant church exists to love god and man wholeheartedly through exaltation, evangelism, and edification (mark12:28-31;matt. 28;16-20)our corporate worship follows the gospel framework , summarized simply as: god is holy, we are sinners, jesus saves us, jesus sends us.we preach the word of god, most often through books of the bible verse by verse as well as thematic series based on the bible. check out previous sermons here.the lordâ€™s supper is observed every week with bread and wine.all children are welcome for the whole service, though nursery is available for infants to 3-years-old.we sing a variety of songs, old and new. check out our sunday set list here.specific attire is not expected. most congregants wear their normal weekday clothing, even our pastors.after service, there is a time for fellowship. this is an opportunity to connect with others, enjoy some coffee or juice, and find your discipleship classroom.
