you want antiques, vintage, & collectibles; we've got 'em



















den of antiquity is run by derek & deanna. we sell vintage, antiques, retro, & collectibles in the fargo-moorhead area. we were formerly known as fair oaks antiques, but as we’ve switched up our offerings, we felt a new name was more in order!what have we switched up?we’re focusing more on mid-century kitsch, vintage magazines, vintage vinyl records, old advertising & prints, vintage paperbacks and pulps, vintage sex history, and, with help from deanna’s lunatique boutique, vintage & antique religious items, medical items, and oddities. given the smut & the oddities, we thought we’d riff on “den of iniquity” and play up the age factor; so den of antiquity it is! den of antiquity appears at numerous shows & venues in the fm area – keep an eye on our blog & social media for event details. items are also for sale 7 days a week exclusively at first avenue market in downtown fargo. (directions & shop hours here.)questions? saw something at a vintage show and now you want it? reach out to us!
