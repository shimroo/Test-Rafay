the emergency response, powered by voicegate's 
                  dialing engine, scales from 2 ports to 128 ports allowing 
                  business, industry and government emergency and business continuity 
                  planners to communicate quickly and accurately with their 
                  primary and secondary response teams across all industry standard 
                  communication devices. planners can prepare for a crisis by 
                  pre-identifying response groups; or groups with specific skill 
                  setsand the message they would deliver to that particular 
                  group given a certain condition or emergency unfolds. if and 
                  when a specific emergency takes place, planners are ready 
                  to click a button on the emergency response to launch a dialing 
                  campaign to a specific group of responders - the system simply 
                  picks up all available lines, internet connections and dials 
                  to deliver the message to up to five different numbers per 
                  responder.

the emergency response comes with either a french 
                    or english gui (spanish is in development), complete with 
                    accompanying english, french canadian (and soon spanish) text 
                    to speech engines allowing planners to communicate with their 
                    responders in both of canada's official languages. planners 
                    can easily change messages by simply typing them into the 
                    system. pull down menus allow for quick changes of the dialing 
                    scenario the system will execute to deliver a specific message 
                    to a specific group or sub-group of responders. available 
                    scenarios are: message delivery (dial, deliver message); fit 
                    for duty (dial, identify responder, "are you fit for 
                    duty" deliver message); fit for duty - arrival (dial, 
                    identify responder, "are you fit for duty" deliver 
                    message, "enter when you will arrive"), voice casting 
                    (dial, identify responder, pull them back into a conference 
                    call); automated contact verification (dial, identify responder, 
                automatically update responder‚s contact information). 
campus alert
                  rapid notification = saved lives
on the rare occasions when an emergency or crisis occurs on campus, we want to be able to contact you quickly with information or instructions. our campus alert module  "the voicegate emergency e-response mass message notification and emergency planning system." has the ability to seize every desktop and digital display within any network and post and announce an alert will enable emergency planners to manage evacuations and disseminate emergency instructions faster than by calling or sending sms messages in campus, educational and business settings.
