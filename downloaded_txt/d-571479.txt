what is transcendental meditation?



the transcendental meditation® (tm) technique is a simple, natural, effortless mental technique which is easy to learn and practise.tm is practiced for just 15 to 20 minutes twice a day, while sitting comfortably with the eyes closed.during the practise of tm, the mind experiences a state of ‘pure consciousness’, an inner state of peace and calm. as the mind settles, the body gains a profound level of deep rest that research shows is deeper than sleep.as the most researched technique in the world, tm is an effective way to be more focused, calm, rested and healthy, allowing you to live your full potential in daily life.watch: this short tm introductory video by dr bob roth will give you a complete understanding of how tm works, how it's different and how it’s taught. 


















transcendental meditation is unique
transcendental meditation is unique in its effortlessness. it doesn’t involve any concentration or control of the mind. research shows relaxation one enjoys during tm is far deeper than other meditation or relaxation techniques.brain wave coherence (eeg) observed during the practice of tm can produce a range of benefits including improved memory, problem solving and decision making abilities, creativity, moral reasoning and academic performance.
