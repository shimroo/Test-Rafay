[tags|endtimes, evil, lj, sayonara]in case you missed it, our new cyrillic overlords have gone off the james-bond-villain-level deep end, and sadly, not the one filled with sharks.  so after this post i'm buggin' out.but that's okay.  you can always find new-ish content at the tumblr (yes, gdbm is behind, but there's a reason, and i'm lookin' ta fix it) or even at the twitter if you're somewhat familiar.  you can find an email address for me if you're halfway good at putting 2 and 2 together.  and peace out, my peeps.  we all need to not be here anymore.

gdbm: hard reset

[tags|gdbm, goddamnbatman] since  we last visited the goddamn batman, the cinematic batmen have (a) quit  being batman and (b) used guns to (c) kill people. comic readers might  see any of those three points as inherently antithetical to the  darknight detective’s ethos, but they are simply how the character has  been interpreted for a modern cinematic context.
in the spirit of  alternative interpretation, we present our own goddamn batman.  he is  creative, a foodie, and a dance machine.  he aspires to be a master  chef, and to have his own bakery, from which he will sell 40 cakes.

|exhausted]sorry, y'all.  i'm never on lj, much less dw, anymore.  i just needed to do a little housekeeping today.  can't make a promise to be more blee-blee-blee than usual.  maybe i should try.  sigh.  so very tired.  i am most active on twitter, then on tumblr, neither with the gab-tastic fury i used to bring to the blogging world, though.  the long game has become so very long, and my fire is burning low.  and if you really need to get a hold of me, try my username at google's email service and i might just get it (along with the mail for some dude from new delhi who really needs to stop sending me his taxi receipts for christ's sake).anyhow.  hope all are well, or as well as possible given our circumstances.

uhm, compared to certain sectors of my f-list, i've had an absolutely silent winter.  work is problematic in newly-catastrophic ways, but i'm working on an endgame.  been playing battlefield 4 on the 360 in addition to my usual steam-cooked yummies (fought my way to the end of besiege with some hysterically-unwieldy creations).  i beat far cry 4 and got the worst ending possible so i'm seriously pissed off at it to the point that i don't even want to go back for more achievements.  back to fc3, then.what else?  face is pretty much fixed.  heart has been cooperative.  i have a friend at work, finally.  keeping the migraines at bay with more or less constant hydration.  new car is awesome.  no financial or social or biological emergencies.  it's weird, but i ain't complainin', just noting.hope y'all's good out there.  peace out, kids.

[tags|nano14]i've been told that i'm required to do nano this year, if only to continue the story from the nano of many years past.  still contemplating.  might give my lj a reason to exist, at least.  pondering.edit: i think i'll try to get my private wiki back up and running so i can sort out not only what's come before but what has to come after (and a few dozen things that've changed between then and now).  if i can get a decent grasp on things, i may go ahead with it.  and if people want to be betas, i may do the f-locked entries again.  seems like the only viable method of publication.

(x-posted from tumblr because i'm bored)i have succumbed to peer pressure and tried ftl and am loving it, but for very small details.  this is the kind of thing i would’ve blown up a bus full of nuns for when i was in high school — tactical starship combat with systems being damaged/repaired. note that its terms are relative: “easy” means “you will die repeatedly until you learn how not to.”  “normal,” i suppose, means “you will die repeatedly despite any action on your part.”i think my favorite part of it is that it seems to create its own narrative, each runthrough being a unique little adventure.  once i finished the game (read: when my ship was torn to shreds) with an entirely different crew that started, due to space spiders and a few problems with the circulation.  once i got two sectors in before my crew was extinguished save one, and he bravely tromped through five more sectors solo before finding new friends with whom to die in flames.xcom: enemy within has that same feeling of each runthrough birthing its own unique adventure — doubly so if you’ve played through the original enemy unknown and are totally taken aback by the expansion/sequel’s twists, at least one of which is just cruel.  but if you never thought turn-based strategy could be frenetic, try escaping from newfoundland.  (i’ve had bad trips to newfoundland, but none quite that bad.)and being a fan of the classic hitman series, i’m intermittently poking through hitman: absolution.  my playthroughs are typically exercises in stealth fail, degenerating into long drawn-out shootouts and merciful restarts.  my first play of “the king of chinatown” involved me scoping out the scene thoroughly, making two cursory runs of the perimeter, and then deciding to finally take action when i found the level exit.  at that moment, the titular king (and my target) walked right up to me, right on past, and started urinating in the corner right next to the level exit, out of sight of everyone else.  easiest level ever: strangle, walk three feet, win.  but i still haven’t found a good substitute for the joy of throwing a pair of scissors twenty yards with lethal aim and force.  last time i tried something like that in real life i got tetanus shots.

i'm totally not checking lj anymore.  i tried to keep up, but i let it get outta hand, so...i'm not ignoring you, i'm just in lj bankruptcy.  sincere apologies if i missed anything.i'm typically on twitter (locked, poke me and i'll let you in) and tumblr, though.  you'd like tumblr.  it's like an iv of picspam, a daily drip straight into your veins.  and, of course, if'n you need anything, you can always drop me a line via email -- my user name at gmail.com.hope y'all're doin' well.
