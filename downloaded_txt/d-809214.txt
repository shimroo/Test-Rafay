about us




5th generation italian “pie slingers”



new york style mastery



















            la famiglia
          









our nonno, an italian immigrant, was a pizzaiolo using a coal burning oven in little italy-ny. when he relocated to colorado, he was frustrated because he was unable to replicate the dough he made daily in ny. he decided to make some additions  to his recipe that replicates the water in new york.  with this addition, and a few other tweaks, our nonno’s crust tasted just like the pies he made in ny. during our weekly sunday family gatherings he taught us how to make the perfect ny style pie.








            bruno's pizzeria

talent, dough making classes, research?? no! it is in our blood and our nonno’s instruction during our weekly sunday family gatherings-food, wine, & pizza making. 







our dough making process cannot be replicated, it is an artform that our family perfected.
