inventory

            at gary lang auto group, we specialize in quality pre-owned trucks that are reconditioned to meet a
higher standard of reliability and performance. every vehicle in our inventory undergoes a thorough
inspection process, and any necessary mechanical repairs or maintenance are completed before the
vehicle is offered for sale. our goal is to provide you with a dependable, work-ready vehicle from day
one.
          

			occasionally, we may offer vehicles that require additional work to reach their optimal condition.
these vehicles will be clearly represented with full transparency regarding any known defects, and
they will be priced accordingly to reflect their condition.
we believe in honest and upfront pricing. the price you see is the price you pay! while we are
required to collect applicable taxes, title, license, and registration fees, along with our state-permitted
documentation fee, you will never encounter unexpected add-ons or mandatory purchases of
unnecessary products or services.
