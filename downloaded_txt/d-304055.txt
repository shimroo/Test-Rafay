what does “air chill” mean?air-chill is a unique processing method where freshly harvested chickens are individually cooled with purified air, as opposed to water immersion. this process preserves the natural flavor and tenderness of the meat, minimizes water purge, and reduces the risk of contamination. air-chilled chicken is often favored for its superior taste and texture, making it a popular choice among consumers seeking high-quality poultry products.
