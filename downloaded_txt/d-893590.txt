"summer is (almost) here!!!"at least here in new england, the weather is starting to warm up and while we seem to see much more rain than sunshine, camping weather can't be too far off. i've been a bit lax about keeping this web site up to date, between running a business and working on other projects time seems to be at a premium. but i am glad that my visitors still take the time to check in. i try to be diligent about posting your campground reviews within a few days of submission, and that area i do keep things up to date, so keep sending them in. still working on the complete rebuild of my old pop up trailer. i am taking a 1988 sun lite camper and turning it into an a-frame popup trailer. if you want to see the progress visit the web site i set up to document this build visit me there at www.aframecamper.homestead.comnow open -Â  visit our campfire store today!!!click here to visit our new store
