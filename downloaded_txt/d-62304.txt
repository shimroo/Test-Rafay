what travel guides say about romania:
"what i like about romania is that you know you are in a different place, in a good way." (jayne clark, usa today)
"â¦ why should you go to romania? the straight answer is because it is one of the most beautiful countries of southeast europe." (the blue guide)
"considered by many the most beautiful country in eastern-europe, romania still claims regions that seem bastions of a medieval past long since lost elsewhere." (fodor's eastern and central europe)
"few regions offer a more dazzling display of cultural and artistic treasures than romania." (smithsonian journeys)
"no journey to eastern europe would be complete without paying a visit to romaniaâ¦ outstanding landscapes, a huge diversity of wildlifeâ¦" (the rough guide)
"i had no idea what to expect when i first visited romania.
            what i found on arrival was a budget-friendly destination brimming with hearty food, amazing natural landscapes,
            and a fraction of the tourists found elsewhere in europe." (nomadic matt)
romaniaâs mountain scenery, its great diversity of wildlife and cultures, 
            and a way of life that at times seems little changed since the middle ages, leave few who visit unaffected. (rough guides)
"romania has majestic castles, medieval towns, great hiking and wildlifeâ¦" (the lonely planet)
