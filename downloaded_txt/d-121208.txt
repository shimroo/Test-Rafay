welcomewelcome to the cornell laboratory for accelerator-based sciences and education (classe). classe studies our world and universe using x-rays and high energy electrons and proton beams. we develop organic solar cells and study the folding of long dna strands at classe's chess national x-ray user facility, study the higgs boson with the large hadron collider, and glimpse the early universe with the atacama cosmology telescope.




































our vision is to understand the behavior of matter and fields at all scales of distance and time to sustainably advance science and benefit society.about us
