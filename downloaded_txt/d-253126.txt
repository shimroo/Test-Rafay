what people are saying about us



tripadvisorwonderful seafood“such a great dining experience! the khushi oysters were plump and so tasty and was accompanied with a lovely mignonette. salt spring mussels were delicious and the broth was so amazing we brought the leftovers home. but the alaska king crab legs were the bomb. juicy, moist and a generous portion size.”



opentable dinerphenomenal service“outstanding evening with phenomenal service. they were great and we truly enjoyed ourselves and can not wait for restrictions to be lifted as we intend on going back in the very near future and repeat the experience once again, the evening was a 10.”



tripadvisoramazing view“we had an amazing dinner here. the calamari and crab cake appetizers were great. my husband had the ribs, which he loved. i had the seafood pasta, packed with seafood. the portions were huge. we left stuffed. our waiter craig was awesome. attentive, but never hovering, and very funny.
