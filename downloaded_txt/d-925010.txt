02/13/25-this here story is a goodn, and just about every word of it is true. its tempting to just jump to the part about where we seen them horrible things, and heads was pulled off and we was in a flying machine and such. but i aint gonna do it, cause jim says that aint the way to tell a proper yarn. that yarn, it's "dread island" and it's the totally free mojo story of the week! enjoy!

01/23/2025-hatchet girls, the new hap & leonard novel, has started to hit online retailers, meaning the book is available to pre-order -- and your pre-orders are vital. they determine how a publisher will promote a book. or not. will they spend the money to send an author around the country to meet their readers? only if they see an indication that there are readers. and champion joe has readers! you're one, right? or you wouldn't be here now. and joe's books wouldn't continue to stay in print. but that's the thing: they sell over time. and publishers tend to spend marketing dollars on big new releases. big, upfront pre-orders tend to translate to larger marketing budgets, which tends to determine the relative success of a new-release book. if you enjoy seeing what the boys are up to ... if you want to increase the chances of joe visiting your town ... if you want to do a kindness for an author you like, and know you'll get the book eventually anyway, please consider pre-ordering hatchet girls today. you can pre-order at indiebound, amazon, barnes & noble ... you can pre-order directly from the publisher ... or you can do a great kindness by pre-ordering from your local bookstore. those family-owned stores have been the lifeblood of champion joe's long career. it would be a great blessing to have this book succeed through the world's great small businesses. thanks!

01/23/2025-"favorites lists depend on the day and memory, but i love westerns, and i'm asked about my favorites. for a long time they didn't change much, but there have been some great ones over the last few years. i'm only including movies, not tv series or limited series. otherwise, lonesome dove would be on the list. i also avoided a lot of western-themed films that take place well after the 1900s, like little big man and ride the high country. i cheat with the wild bunch and the shootist, as they are on the margins. had i done that, it would have included hell and high water, and ... well, long list. but, for today, this moment..." to read champion joe's list of favorite western movies, click here!

07/25/24-minnie polson got burned to a crisp. her and her house and everything in it. way it was burned, the color of the smoke, you'd think that fire was carefully and expertly set. someone took their time. dispatched minnie first, maybe, then arranged it so her body and the house got blazed. it was all too perfect and too neat to have been an accident. poor woman was mostly just a smoky memory. sugar on the bones is the 13th novel in champion joe's hap & leonard series. in a starred review, publishers weekly calls it, "[s]avagely funny ... blood-splattered action and a welcome spoonful of irreverent humor make this a surefire hit. its a high-water mark for the series." over at the los angeles times, they included it among 20 new books you need to read this summer and declared, "lansdale makes a triumphant return to his hap & leonard novels with this scorcher." ap news says it "may be the best novel in this fine series. the quirky characters are well drawn, the prose is tight, the pace is furious, the surprises keep coming and the violent climax is nothing less than savage." jason bovberg calls it "a savory adventure among old friends." stephen graham jones says it's "some of the killerest, most hilarious writing ive read." parade says, "what a treat"! so treat yourself to sugar on the bones, from mulholland books. ain't no sugar like sugar on the bone.

06/13/24-champion joe says you should check out they dont dance much by james ross: "i just think its one of the greatest southern noir books ever written. i hadnt ever heard about it until years ago when daniel woodrell reviewed my book mucho mojo in the new york times. he said i was in a line with james ross, and i thought, 'whos james ross?' so i looked him up and read his book, and i realized that woodrell knew what he was talking about. the guy was a really good writer. this ended up being his only noveli think he had the ambition to write others, but for whatever reason, this one didnt sell well. raymond chandler gave it a quote. he thought it was great. but for the past sixty years, its been one of those underrated novels." to read the rest of what champion joe has to say about james ross, check out "the backlist" on crimereads.com!

04/04/24-a11 the blood and disaster began on a saturday morning when i thought everything was going just right. it was late october in east texas, and from my recliner i could see out the tall glass that makes up two of our livingroom walls, and it was beautiful outside. a little cool looking, leaves gone gold and red and brown and starting to fall. clouds white as angel's panties could be glimpsed through the tops of the tall pines and oaks that made up most of our two acres. a cat squirrel jumped from one oak limb to another, then leaped out of sight. i felt like i was in a disney movie. then i got the call. waltz of shadows is arguably one of lansdale's darkest books. bill and his friends witness a brutal homicide, and when the killers recognize this, everyone but bill is slaughtered. escaping by the skin of his teeth, bill runs to his uncle hank, who reluctantly gets involved. together, they begin a clandestine takedown of those killers that leads to something much darker, much more unspeakable than simple murder or revenge. waltz of shadows is available april 15, 2024. get yours here!

08/17/23-champion joe says, "the last voyage of the demeter is a film based on the chapter in dracula that is inspired by the captain's log concerning having dracula on board his ship as it travels from romania to england. this is not a spoiler. we know this from the start. it's been posted by reviewers. i saw it yesterday, and i quite loved it. it's simple, and for me creepy and unsettling in a good way. a kind of delcious horror made of bones and honey. i am the perfect audience for this one. i'm sick of the romantic dracula, and what we have here is not a fluffy version of the count. it really feels like the novel with its darkness and dread. so, i recommend."

06/22/2023-this episode of "the jeff word" is a damn fine bucket of content:


06/15/2023-"humor in fiction is not writing a story and having a few jokes inserted, or writing jokes and then writing a story around them. fact is, stories that are mostly jokes arent stories. the idea of inserting humor into crime fiction, or any kind of fiction, isnt the idea. the idea of blending humor into it naturally is the more workable and satisfying method. its a blend, not a fruit salad." to read the rest of champion joe's essay, "humour in fiction," published june 13, 2023, by crime fiction lover, click here!

02/16/23-champion joe says,
	writers these days run in fear. i get questions like: why do you have black people and gay people in your novels? answer, because there are black people and gay people. why do you have beautiful young women, and then have an older woman who is just described as older. answer, people can be ugly, beautiful or plain. sometimes older women in my novels are beautiful, brett sawyer for one. books and characters vary. characters perceptions vary. guys are ugly in my books  handsome, good, evil, likeable, unlikable, funny, and not so funny. same for women. like real life.
why do you have male characters notice attractive women and think sexual thoughts?
answer: biology. women also notice attractive men in my books and have sexual thoughts. we are not without sexual thoughts and attraction. the crime is when that's all a person notices, and makes people sex objects. sometimes, however, i'm writing about people who do just that. but people notice each other and biology is a factor. we are usually first attracted to someone due to appearance. not everyone is attracted to the same kind of appearance. and sometimes their appearance doesn't matter. you just click. but no sexual attraction doesn't seem likely for most people in the world. i had a woman say to me once that when she was younger she hated when men whistled at her, and believe me, i can understand that. but she said that now that she was older she hated that they didn't. i can see that too.
why do you have black characters in your books and gay characters since you are not black or gay?
because i don't believe in segregated fiction where one group only writes about their group and no one can make an appearance that isn't of your group. that's just stupid. we are all humans and we need to try and know one another. i can get it wrong, but i'm trying to get it right. write about white people if you like, black, gay, animals, what have you. writers shouldn't be subject to that kind of thinking, and the fact people want some form of segregated fiction isn't good for any of us. we should celebrate our connections, and not forget there are those who are less celebrated than they ought to be. but if you only want to write about one group, go for it. just don't tell me that i have to.
if you write about characters unlike you, not of your race or sexual persuasion, then you hear that you shouldn't. you don't write about them, then you hear, why aren't you including them in your work?
i get shit from those who think i'm woke, and from those who think i'm not. 
i'm not a fan of woke due to the bully aspect. i'm not a fan of the rabidly anti-woke for the same reason. neither group gets to tell me what i think or how i think. i think everyone deserves a fair shake.
why did you make a minority a villain?
answer, same reason i made a non-minority a villain. villains come in all colors, sexual orientation, and political persuasion.
it's real life, i choose my good people on the basis of good, and my bad people on the basis of bad. fiction reflects this.
you don't get a pass for being white, black, gay, or anything else.
why did you kill the dog in your book?
because dogs can die.
why did you let the dog live? that seems so sentimental.
sometimes in the course of a story i decide they don't need to die. maybe that is sentimentality, and maybe i pay more attention to story than opinion. i, by the way, am a fanatic lover of dogs, and right by me at this moment is roo-roo, our beautiful pit bull. whoa, is it alright to think pit bulls can be beautiful? or is that a discrimination against chihuahuas? who said anything about them? oh, me. 
cats may die in my novels because they are evil.
just messing with you. i like cats, too. mostly. some of them. i knew a cat once that was okay. i wouldn't turn my back on him, though, because like so many cats he had the soul of a serial killer.
guarantee you, that will set someone off, even if it is a joke. for some, everything is literal and superficial and there is no nuance. 
i can joke. you can joke. i can like your joke or hate it. same for mine. we don't need police telling writers how to write and what to write about. i like satire and irony, and sometimes people don't understand satire and irony. whatcha gonna do? send them to school? give them cliffsnotes on your work? send a cat over to stalk them?
so many complaints these days are more about gothcha moments and eat-my-self-righteous-dust than about common sense. and that comes from both directions.
look. i can stumble with my thoughts and characters, but i'm out here walking. you do you. i'll do me.

02/09/23-champion joe says, "i think hap and leonard are coming to town soon, in a new book. stay alert. they bring a lot of oddness and excitement when they arrive. just a warning. they're coming. not tomorrow, not this year, but not too far off in the future, along with jim bob luke and vanilla ride, and a few more surprises. that is all."
02/02/23-champion joe says, "'the next 60: where are my flying cars?' was written in 2014, and though i wouldn't call it an overly optimist piece, it seems more so after four years of trump, the orange turd, and a congress that in general is mainly about getting over on the other guy. still, i am hopeful. this is what i thought in a new years style piece i wrote for texas observer. ah, nostalgia, and learning that something can go off the rails in no time flat." to read the article, click here.

02/02/23-publishers look at a lot of things when they decide how to promote the books. a few things you can do to support authors that don't all cost money are: 
1. pre order their books. (okay, this one costs) but... if there are early orders, publishers interpret that as excitement and push the book more on the front end. it's a huge help for creators as there is a self fulfilling prophecy that can take place. 
2. you can add titles to your "want to read" bookshelf on goodreads. same as above. if people are interested in the book, publishers will do more to push it.
3. good reviews on all platforms are also very helpful. social proof is a big element for these companies to get behind you. 
4. posting on social media. publishers love to see tweets, posts, reels etc about the new book. whether you have read it or not, just knowing people want to gives the book a valuable boost. tagging the publisher in these posts is even better!!
5. letting your local library know you would like them to carry the books is another way to support the author. 
so that's the flash tutorial on how to support your favorite authors. i hope you will find the time to do one or more of these things. we spend months with the work, so it feels great to see the readers excited to read it. thank you to everyone who continues to support, discover, recommend and participate in the dialogue on social media.

[born for trouble] is an absolute blast and a gift to all of us devoted fans." ed brubaker says, "joe lansdales hap and leonard stories are right up there with richard starks parker books to me ... born for trouble is yet another masterclass in how its done." dave writes and draws says, "settling down with this collection is like getting together with old, cherished friends  the kind of friends who you just know are going to get you in trouble, and you just don't care." s.a. cosby says it's "a road map through 20th-century crime fiction, and your guides are two of the greatest, most intriguing characters ever created, hap and leonard. rambunctious, complex, and endlessly fascinating, these two best friends offer a clear yet sometimes painful view of america in general, and east texas in particular." michael langston says, "not since the late great elmore leonard has a writer so completely revamped the genre of crime-fiction  lansdale takes it to places it's never been before in ways you never imagined." ginger nuts of horror says, "this is binge-worthy stuff!" nonstop reader says it's "violent, outlandish, over the top, and hysterically funny (often at the same time and with a suddenness which leaves the reader with whiplash)." so ... what say you?
01/12/23-when you meet him, hap collins seems just like a good ol boy. but even in his misspent youth, his best pal was leonard pine: black, gay, and the ultimate outsider. together, they have mostly found their way as partners in crime-solving and, at least as often, as hired muscle.as hap wrestles with his new identity as a father, and leonard finds love in a long-term relationship, the boys continue their crime-solving shenanigans. they uncover the sordid secret of a missing bookmobile, compete in a warped version of the most dangerous game, regroup after haps visit to the psychologist goes terribly awry, and much more. so sit yourself back and settle in - born for trouble is east texas mayhem as only the master mojo storyteller lansdale could possibly tell. available now from tachyon press!

12/02/21-when you meet him, hap collins seems just like a good ol boy. but even in his misspent youth, his best pal was leonard pine: black, gay, and the ultimate outsider. together, they have mostly found their way as partners in crime-solving and, at least as often, as hired muscle.as hap wrestles with his new identity as a father, and leonard finds love in a long-term relationship, the boys continue their crime-solving shenanigans. they uncover the sordid secret of a missing bookmobile, compete in a warped version of the most dangerous game, regroup after haps visit to the psychologist goes terribly awry, and much more. so sit yourself back and settle in - born for trouble is east texas mayhem as only the master mojo storyteller lansdale could possibly tell. available march 2022 from tachyon press!
