the next generation of retaining wall systems

wall system lineup








the geostone retaining wall system consists of two lines, the original g12 lineup and the new g10.    there are two blocks for each line.  both lines consist of an 8 inch tall block and a 4 inch tall block.  the difference is the g12 lineup is 12 inches deep (face to tail) and the g10 is 10 inches deep.  both are structural wall units meaning that they have been professionally tested and can be used in a engineered wall design.
the geostone concept is to keep it simple.  click here for a short video on how the geostone system works.







g12






g12-4











g12-8












the geostone g12-4 block was originally created as modular retaining wall system to fill in the "gaps" between the larger wall modules and the mainly decorative small blocks found at the retail or "box stores".  this module is identical to its larger version with the only exception being height and weight (36 lbs).  its method of connection is identical as well, making it the strongest 4 inch retaining wall module on the market. this connection method which we call "rock interlock" allows the two modules to be mixed in to the same wall in either a true ashlar (random) pattern or banding.  the geostone g12-4 block can be easily maneuvered and handled.  it's lesser weight allows for 1 block to be carried in each hand.  it also makes placing and positioning much easier in radius and footing stages.  a very common argument we get is that it takes twice as many.  true, but walls are typically built much faster with this product than its heavier predecessor.  this has much to do with the stamina of person building the wall.  they do not wear out as quick.  the main reason however, is due to the building technique used to place this product which can be seen here.




the geostone g12-8 block was created prior to the g12-4.  it was created by a professional modular wall installer who had used and was familiar with all the segmental wall systems at the time.  all were heavy and cumbersome utilizing varying forms of connection, most of which have been proven unnecessary for significant  block to block/grid interlock.  it seemed so simple to eliminate material with a large core thus reducing material cost and weight.  this also played a factor with logistics.  at the time, this block was the least-heavy among the full-size modular retaining wall units at a relatively light weight of 72 lbs!  with no pins, lips, or lugs, the geostone block was the first of its kind and testing showed it to have "off the charts" connection strength.  the geostone g12-8 block is still the lightest and most competitively priced of the traditional 12" commercial units.  it has dominated in markets of availability as the number one choice for professional installers and manufacturers.











g10






g10-4











g10-8












the geostone g10-4 block is in a "conceptual" phase at this point.  it has not been produced but based on the way the g12-4 performed comparative to the g12-8 we can assume the same correlation based on the g10-8. upon production, we expect this block to weigh 25 lbs making it one of the lightest engineered wall systems on the market.  as with the g12-4, this block can be used on its own in in combination with the g12-8 in either banding or ashlar patterns.




the geostone g10-8 block is what we call a "game changer" in that it is still a square foot unit but weighs in at only 50 lbs!  in most cases this would allow for over 800 sq ft to be shipped on one truck.  that is more than 300 extra sq ft than what can be shipped with competitive wall systems.  the weight to sq ft ratio will make this the easiest and quickest system to install on the market.  the same flexibility can be expected as with the g12 lineup.
