russian music and dance - folk music














russian music and 
			dance - 
			nearby regions and former ussr states





  








as russia and the other
    former ussr states rushed to modernize themselves, regional traditional music
        is becoming an endangered species. richka maintains a tiny sample of a vast musical richness. e-mail

oh, mne
                  nevmogotu  - from kovanschina by mussorgsky

apotheosis
          2:22 this is an orchestral fusion of 19th century russian nationalism 
		with a french anthem from the late-1500s titled "vive le roi henri" 
		(henry iv of france) that was also later used in the french restoration 
		with "henri" changed to "louis".  this brief piece closes the 
		tchaikovsky "sleeping beauty" ballet. it's a clear example of 
		prior-centuries russians looking westward for learning and the arts.

soviet national
        anthem
-
        used 1944-1991; complete; with revised 1977 lyricsyou've all frequently heard this theme in earlier olympic
    telecasts as soviet athletes swept up the gold medals, so for old time's sake here it is
    complete with singing. this is the "clean" version from which references to
    stalin were removed in 1977.  its original 
	  lyrics
embody a nationalistic style now very
    out of step with the march of time. for one look at why stalin was erased from the anthem,
    go to the mines of

kolyma
in siberia.

            check it out!

romanian 
			national anthem - most national anthems are
            terrible - surely chosen by commitees. however, the romanians have
            managed to choose a nice anthem - one of the world's best - for
            their country. 
orchestra only version.
