together i can
a guide to attaining peace, joy, and serenity in this lifetime
by michael w. mccright
together (i) can is a guide to overcoming personal life complications. the small (i) indicates humility. individuals with a large âegoâ and a lot of pride live as large (i) persons and typically have unresolved issues. pride usually leads to a chaotic life.

a song "a bump in the road" for those who are struggling.

written and composed by michael mccright

















 renewed you

the #1 reason for dis-ease:
overworking our internal organs / functions leading to excess inflammation
without knowing it, you are probably overworking your pancreas and other internal organs by the way you eat (see article: foods as drugs).
 
 

your blood sugar (glucose) levels spike when you eat excess carbohydrates and/or high glycemic foods.
          your pancreas pumps out insulin to compensate.
maintaining high levels of insulin (over baseline) leads to fat storage, inflammation, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and other health issues!
this up/down surge of chemicals is harming your body and making you feel tired and worn out!
 
 

maintaining balanced levels of glucose and insulin restores hormonal balance to the body, reducing inflammation and assists in creating optimal health.
to lose weight, we recommend lowering the insulin levels to baseline levels. we use medifast's medically-formulated, portion-controlled meal replacements until your goal weight is established.
optimize your health, establish new energy levels, reduce inflammation, lose weight, gain mobility, and decrease your risks of many obesity related dis-eases.
the path is there... are you ready to follow it to optimal health?
