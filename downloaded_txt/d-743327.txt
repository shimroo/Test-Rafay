the work that dr. melese has helped my family achieve with our adopted terrier mix has been tremendous. i cannot stress how worth it is to just get at least 1 consultation with dr. melese so that you can start on the right track towards progress. dr. melese is extremely professional and provides great explanations so that you can feel confident in tackling working with your dog. i'd highly recommend his service to anyone interested.

dear dr. melese:
this is my two-week follow up email about indy. she seems to be doing much better about the light and is much calmer. thanks again, and i will schedule a follow-up appointment for a few weeks from now.

yesterday we taught him (our cat) to "sit" and "come" on command. he learned quite quickly. pretty cool. i also appreciate your other advice.

hi dr. melese,
i always like to keep you updated on buddy's progress. he has been doing extremely well since our move and i think all your advice worked so well.
