yes, it's that synergy.â â electronic music, moog synthesizers, mellotrons, computer music.this is the official site for information about larry fast and the synergy projects.
since 1975, synergy has been my outlet for exploring electronic music, its technology and creative uses. beyond my synergy projects i have spent a lot of my time recording and touring with other artists. my non-synergy work started with nektar in the mid-1970s, ran about a decade with peter gabriel and has continued with many other talented performers and groups right up to the present day. aside from my synergy work, in the last decades i've recorded and toured with the grammy-nominated tony levin band.
thanks for visiting .











the larry fast/synergy website is undergoing a major overhaul and rebuild, its first since the mid-1990s.â â many more pages will be added and updated in the coming weeks and months.









the original larry fast/synergy website is temporarily linked here.â â some information at the old site is out of date or no longer accurate.â â that site will be retired after the updates are completed.
