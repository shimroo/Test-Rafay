serving suggestion: serve the turkey parmesan over a bed of fettuccine noodles



turkey parmesan recipeby: nick ray (biscuits n briskets) ingredients1 pack plainville farms turkey cutlets3 large eggs2 cup panko breadcrumbs1 cup grated parmesan cheese2 tablespoons all-purpose flour½ cup olive oil for frying ½ cup marinara sauce1 cup fresh mozzarella shredded¼ cup chopped fresh basil2 teaspoons olive oilsalt and freshly ground black pepper to tasteinstructions preheat the oven to 450 degreesopen up the plainville farms turkey cutlets and place them on a sheet pan.  wipe any excess moisture off of them.season both sides of the cutlets with salt and pepper.cover both sides of the cutlets with the flour.  i like using the strainer to dust them instead of dredging them in the flour but do whatever method is easiest for you.  we just want a good coating of flour on both sides.beat the 3 eggs in a bowl and set aside.  combine the breadcrumbs and grated parmesan in another bowl.  dip the floured cutlets in the egg making sure to cover both sides.  take the turkey and place it in the bread crumb/parmesan cheese mixture.  press the mixture into the cutlet making sure you have a good coating on each side.  place the cutlet onto a pan.heat up the 1/2 cup of olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat.  place the breaded turkey cutlets in the pan and cook for about 2 minutes on each side.  the cutlets should have a nice golden color on both sides.  place the cooked cutlets on a pan or baking dish.top each cutlet with your marinara, just enough to cover to the edges.  place some of the fresh basil on the cutlets and then top that with your fresh shredded mozzarella.  sprinkle just a little olive oil on top of each cutlet.  place the dish in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  the cheese should be a little brown and bubbly.  you can check the temperature with a thermometer.  you’re looking for an internal temperature of 165 or higher.
