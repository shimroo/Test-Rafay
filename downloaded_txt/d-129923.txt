the_violet_fire  okay.... how 2 start.  me and sammy broke up in july.  not a big deal really as the relationship was goin nowhere.  i was more or less just a momma figure for the baby... not so much a baby as she is 7 but u kno wat i mean.  in june i met the most amazin man ever.  he is off at basic training rite now until jan.  i miss him so much. we have been together since the 3rd day we met.  i just knew he was the one... he said i had no chance of not bein his one...  we get along perfectly and i love him wit all my heart.  he is also sexi as hell.  he has been living here wit me since july.  him not bein here sucks.  i cant sleep wit out him beside me.  i started school again... wit his motivation... and it is goin well.  i never had a man in my life that wanted me 2 go 2 school. not to mention any names the dumbass was somehow insulted that i was goin 2 go to school when all his lazy ass needed 2 do 2 go as well was get a ged.  ne way onto the lameness that is my ex...well cant even legally say ex.  he is still avoidin sendin me his half of the divorce money so i tried callin.  amazingly no not really....im bein ficecious... he will not answer my calls. guess i gotta sue him. oh well.  ne how... here is a pic of my baby... my boo. my heart.heh...did i mention i told my boo  i wanted this for christmas....but he insists that it has to be from tiffanys.

my little world...


may. 14th, 2009 at 2:05 am



 


the_violet_firethis rite here is the only place that i really have that not a whole lot of people know about.  i can write wat i want in it, and not the whole town is gonna know.  idk that seems so silly 2 say, but here lately it's not so far fetched.  myspace, everyone can find me... even just sittin at my man's sisters house... everyone can find me... and when people can find me... drama finds me.  i am a pretty drama free  person, but the people that are causin it thrive on it.  oh well... if they are talkin shit bout me...they are savin someone else the problems i guess.  i am really happy rite now...and that is a plus.  i actually found the perfect man to be a father... maybe cuz he is already a daddy... he has a 7 yr old girl.  i think she is the greatest...  and he talks about "when we have our son" all the time... bout how when we have our son that he won't be out fuckin off wit the rest of the crowd he will be sittin at home watchin sportscenter... lol.  it has takin me a long time to find a real man.  but boy was it worth the wait.  we get along good.  never argue cause he thinks arguin is pointless... which it really is.  the sex...well is amazingly perfect every time.  and he makes me feel good bout myself.  i didn't ever have that b4.  but knock on wood... cause i dont wanna fuck things up but sayin how great shit is... i think that i will post a pic for every one of us.  this was way back in jan.  i have lost tons of wieght since... dropped 4 pant sizes... yay... so i am lookin lil different...but he is soo sexi... :d so this is a pic of me and owen.

the_violet_firei know that most of the people that get on here are just trying to spy on people just like myspace... just to see wat the hell people are doin... or to see wat kind of shit can be started bcuz someone saw somethin on someone else's page/blog/ etc.  so that is why i really havent updating in a long time. myspace or here.   i have found out who my tru friends are, and who really cares.  i have been through so much in the last i dunno year and wat three months.  the seperation of me and my ex-husband...which i cannot legally even say ex bcuz i refuse to pay for the divorce in full, bcuz i am not the one that just up and left like marriage was a joke.  if u fall out of luv wit someone u dont just up an leave.  im not bitter and in fact me and him speak on occasion and it's ok.  i am thankful in a way that he was a coward it proved to me that life will and can go on.  let's see ... i also lost the best lady in my life... my granma rosemary fern powell.  she was my heart... i love her and i know that she is up there lookin over me... an i am sure that she is shakin her head at some of the shit that i have done in the past three months.  i have met some really amazing people... and i also have started datin someone that i can see myself wit for a long time... just so long as everyone in this town can just shut the fuck up.  i went to jail... yea... me jail.  i was bonded out by my father... $200 bux in switzerland county indiana... im due bak to court on the 13th of april, and i am not sure how that is going to go.  i am hoping that since i have a job now that the judge will let me pay my fines...and be on probation. i have a clean record.   the same day that my ass got bailed out my dude was bein bailed out as well...  his charges slightly more crazy.  i went for a bad check...he went because he was trapin and got stupid for a min, and when we got pulled over, he had a lot of shit on him.  we wont talk bout that anymore tho.  ne ways... i just wanted to write a little bit... and tell everyone that i am good... really happy rite now.  my new job is decent... not makin as much as at lowes but ya know wat...  life isn't always bout money.  happiness is more important.

the_violet_fireso i know you all have heard me say that i think i found the perfect man.  and i have been so unbelievably wrong in so many ways....soooo many times.  but i feel it.  i mean i really fucking feel it.  i just dont know what i am supposed to do to make him realize that the reason that he is still always around is because it's real.  i sit here silent, watching him sleeping...  it makes me want to cry.  it is a horrible feeling to know something so strong in your heart,and you can't do anything about it, because the other person doesn't get it.  i honestly can say i have never felt like this before.  i would do absolutely anything for him.  i would give my left arm if it was to make him happy and that i fear is not healthy for me.  something about this boy though makes me happy.  but all in the same breath i feel like i could just break down and cry.  i love him so much that if i could crawl up into his chest i would.  it hurts so bad how you can fall in love with someone and not realize what's happening until it's too damn late.  his mom and step dad kicked him out of the house... so he is living here, i see him more than just everyday now... and in a way it's nice.  but on the other hand it is like torture.  torture in a way that... i fall deeper and deeper, and he doesn't mean to make me fall any more than i already have.  everyone says that he is just playing a game... that he will come around...but what if he doesnt?  what if he really does mean it this time...what if he really means that he just needs my friendship...none of the other stuff.  our friendship for the last three months...has been a relationship, we just never actually said it was.  it was like a break up when he said that he was going to start talking to this sheena girl.   three months of "friends" with benefits going on, and then he meets so bitch on myspace... and bam...  trish's happy world is fucked.  idk... still to this day, they haven't hung out... and we are together everyday...  we make plans to do things... and our things are our things.  we buy us movies, we come home, and ginger is our baby... make sense?  idk who still reads this shit...but whomever does...tell me what you think okay.

if you take the time to....


jul. 29th, 2008 at 11:43 pm



 


the_violet_firereally think about life... it will freak you out.  okay... i felt the need to scream that for some reason.  things are going decent.  life has been strange, and i cannot say that all of it has been expected.  i spoke to wayne like a real conversation for the first time in almost what 8 months the other day.  it went well...  i had really no emotion about it.  i figured that it would be different, but it wasn't it was like talking to an old friend from school or something.  he admitted that he looked up josh on my myspace though.. haha.   josh is so damn sexy.  the only thing he could say was that he was a lil dude, and that he has horrible taste in music...but little does he know that the reason that his page has the rap on it, is because of stevie, that is his best friends shit.  steven king... he owns earhustle records.  and is going to be the real fucking deal!! he normally listens to bands like cradle of filth, slipknot, atreyu, system of a down,  etc.  some of the same shit that i like.  anyways... let's see... i update so infrequently that i get sidetracked on what i want to say.   i bought josh a puppy...:]  mom and dad said it is fine for me to keep her here since ron his step father will not allow it.  :]  my parents adore josh...  think he is an angel. she is a full blood red nose pit bull.  :] 6 weeks old.  her name is ginger.  cause she is brown.  freaking adorable.  josh calls himself daddy.  it is so freaking cute.  he is all like... go to momma... or come to daddy.  :]  i feel good about this one.   btw... my parents felt bad cause they got rid of my baby gunnar... so i think that is why mom didn't throw a hissy.  but you know what she wasn't okay with it until i said that she was josh's.  how is that fair? hahai need to find a place to rent soon though that allows dogs.  :]oh well i should sleep warped tour is tomorrow.
