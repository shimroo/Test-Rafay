	 bradley defends, scores clear decision over marquez
	 
    



it was a clear victory for timothy bradley over juan manuel marquez in las vegas last night. the crowd, which was overwhelmingly backing marquez, of course saw the decision a different way as did one of the judges.

bradley threw and landed more punches. he was also effective throughout in pulling marquez out of position. just as importantly, he displayed defensive skills that he abandoned in recent fights.

all things considered, bradley is now top level fighter and if floyd mayweather intends to return to welterweight, he now has a logical opponent.
