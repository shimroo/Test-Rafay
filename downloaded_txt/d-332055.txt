captivebred.co.uk
        is your window into my passion and hobby and to provide some back up for existing
        reptile keepers via the  reptile
        forum. i have been keeping and breeding reptiles
        for over 25 years, with experience ranging from corn snakes to cobras -
        sand boas to burmese pythons. as with any hobby it's easy for it to get 
		out of control, so a few years ago i decided to reduce the variety of 
		reptiles i kept and instead specialise on species that are 100% suited 
		to a captive environment. currently our main focus is on ball python 
		morphs and crested geckos both of these species are many generations captive bred. the purpose of this website
        is to provide a platform to showcase my hobby and a place to display my 
		surplus animals and also to provide a service to all
        reptile hobbyists, through the free  reptile
        classifieds, reptile 
		help forum and care sheet
        sections. 
don't
      forget to check out our updated 
		free reptile classifieds service, 
		which has 1000's of reptiles for sale.
people 
		often ask if we do this for a living, the answer is no, this is our 
		hobby, i have the same passion & dedication for this as others may have 
		for their football team or keeping showing horses/dogs.
we 
		also have a new phone number 
0843 2899284 
		this number redirects to us no matter where we are, so you may 
		experience a short delay in answering.
hope
  you find this site both useful and interesting,
 best
  regards, scott
