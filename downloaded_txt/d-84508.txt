certain programs have different policies regarding discounts and refunds. such programs include online courses. 
for all other programs, a 90% refund will be issued if a request is received four (4) business days before the class begins (please see exceptions above). as many of our classes have handout materials, books, etc., no refund will be issued after the four-day business rule. once the class starts, there are no refunds issued. 
lsus reserves the right to cancel a class due to insufficient enrollment. if such a cancellation occurs, a 100% refund will be issued. 
testing center refund policy: no refunds will be issued for any reason once a test has been started. no refunds made for missed appointments. testing fees are non-refundable. testing appointments must be scheduled in advance and can be rescheduled only once. payment is required when scheduling an appointment. 
if you have any questions, please contact us via phone at 318-798-4177 or via email continuing.education@lsus.edu.
