this is a very classy place. everything was well thought out. the owner of this accommodation was meticulous in providing everything you would need to feel right at home. 5 stars i can’t wait to return. i can’t say enough about kyle our host. the focus he has on making sure your requests and inquiries are a priority makes you feel like your vacation matters as much to him as it does to your own family. this guy is on top of his game.

the grand strand brewery loft's is located @ a private & peaceful location. it has a wonderful view! a bar & restaurant is right downstairs (making it convenient). it's a five minute walk to the beach from the grand strand brewery loft's. any guest would love their stay, b/c kyle's place was spotless making you feel right @ home. kyle was responsive to any questions/concerns that we'd. thanks kyle for everything! we enjoyed our stay.

the unit was very well appointed and the location was fantastic. it is an awesome option for those looking for a cosmopolitan/urban experience in myrtle beach, very walkable to major points of interest such as the boardwalk and things along 9th ave and n. ocean boulevard.
