since its founding in 1958, professional instructors have maintained the high standards originally incorporated in the landscape design study program. students acquire the tools for making their own gardens more beautiful and easier to maintain. students have been motivated to serve in political decision-making areas where awareness of the impact of a well-designed landscape can enhance the beauty and enjoyment of life in the public arena.
