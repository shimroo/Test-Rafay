on 
                    this site you will find lots of useful and interesting information 
                    about the pawpaw, asimina triloba. 
                    



how about a pawpaw in your patch?
 







four
 years after ron planted little pawpaw trees from my nursery, they were 
already 12 feet tall and loaded with  fruit. he planted them on the 
north side of a building in usda zone 6, and gave them optimal care: 
drip irrigation and top dressings of manure.


  



these 
            very small pawpaw treelings on the left were from my nursery.
            they were planted in the fall of 2020 in western north carolina.
            one year later they were over five feet tall and on their way to bearing 
            fruit.
 

here we are collecting pawpaw fruit along the kings river.
            those buckets are full of fruit.

why 
                      blossom nursery?



we 
                        have specialized in pawpaws, asimina triloba, since 
                        1988. 


we 
                        are a really small business, just a backyard 
                        operation.


the 
                        nursery is part of our path towards small farm self-sufficiency.


a 
                        packet of soil from a wild pawpaw patch is included with 
                        each order, for innoculating your soil with species-specific 
                        mycorrhizae.


we 
                        send a copy of our pawpaw growing instructions with each 
                        order.


we 
                        only use omri-approved (organic) pesticides, if occasionally 
                        needed.


when 
                        we have used up our last few made in china pots, 
                        we will use only american.


we 
                        do not use paypal because they cancel groups opposed to 
                        medical tyrrany.
