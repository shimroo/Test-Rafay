what people are saying




“we have been at living word family church for over 16 years. it is a place where we have grown in our faith and become part of a strong loving community! the teaching is powerful, worship is fantastic and the people are amazing. this is a church home to our family!”

— susan dial




“we have attended lwfc for about 15 years now and we are proud to call it our church home. we love the teaching, the fellowship, and the worship service. i am also glad to be a part of a church whose leadership doesn’t ignore the difficult issues regarding race, but rather embraces the issue and works to educate and unite. if you’re looking for a place to belong, give lwfc  a try, we did, and it has been a true blessing.”

— dennis and ann wilson




“we visited several churches in the raleigh area.  we feel strongly that lwfc is the place for us.  as a multi-racial couple, we felt welcomed from the start.  the pastors are very genuine and really care about all who attend.  the worship and church messages are fulfilling and really apply to our daily lives.”

— ting & dynice ting




“i cannot say enough about our church! our family was originally drawn here because of the community outreach activities, then the love from the people made it so easy to stay. the senior pastors are true shepherds with genuine, evident love for the people, and the staff pastors, volunteer leaders, and administrative staff work tirelessly to provide an amazing experience. if you are looking for an awesome place to experience god’s love - this is it!”

— joyce allen
