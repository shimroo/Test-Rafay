american family-owned business bringing innovation to you since 1872!
first we built our reputation: founded as smith & hemenway company, inc. in 1872 in hill, new hampshire, our place in hardware history was established over 150 years ago with the production of several types of glass cutters, one of which, the "woodward wizard", was patented. this unique tool, with its tiny wheel for scoring glass, was among the first in the industry and could be used as a glass breaker, can opener, corkscrew, knife/scissor sharpener, and tack hammer.
