science shows food tracking is the biggest predictor of success—the more you track, the more weight you’ll lose! but we’re all about consistency over perfection: it’s better to track some food most days of the week than every single thing you eat only some days of the week. in other words, perfection is not required. you’ll quickly decide how to approach tracking in a way that works for you. here are some of our best tracking tips. what are zeropoint™ foods?they are nutritional powerhouses that serve as the foundation of healthy eating and support your overall health. zeropoint foods also add bulk and flavour to meals, without costing points® from your budget, so you don’t have to weigh, measure, or track these foods—no matter how many you eat in a day! those 350-plus foods include  non-starchy veggies, fruit, eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, fish, shellfish, chicken and turkey breast, and more.who are weightwatchers experts?our team includes nutrition and behavioral scientists, registered dieticians, clinical researchers, and more. together they help you overcome common weight-loss hurdles—like stress-eating or late-night snacking—while our exclusive points system makes nutrition easier—so easy that healthier eating will feel like second nature. after you sign up, you’ll answer a few questions to get a plan customized for you, and build healthy habits with proven behavior change techniques.what are workshops?
