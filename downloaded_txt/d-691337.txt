about us



located right off of university avenue in palo alto in the historic ramona corridor, the restaurant occupies the historic pedro de lemos building which dates back to 1908. our restaurant features one the largest collections of southern folk in the country. the two-story restaurant features 8 different dining rooms, an open-air courtyard, an oyster bar, and a streetside parklet. our cuisine and craft cocktails lean to the south with a fusion of the many diverse cultures that have inhabited the great city of new orleans. after a couple of hurricanes, you will swear you are in new orleans.all tables in our dining room are first-come, first-serve with the exception of contracted parties.
