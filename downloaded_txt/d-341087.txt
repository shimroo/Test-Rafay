national geographic magazine named lake lure
              "one of the ten most beautiful man-made lakes in the world." 
surrounded by towering cliffs and softly forested
              mountains, lake lure is at the east end of the hickory nut gorge, through which boldly flows the
            rocky broad river. chimney rock village hugs the river and mountains and is filled with charming, locally
            owned restaurants and quaint shops offering antiques, pottery and crafts â just right for spending a lazy
            afternoon.
if you enjoy a more active pastime, you'll
            love all the water activities on lake lure and the rocky broad river, hiking in chimney rock state park, and
            on several new, more challenging trails outside the park. we also have zip lining, gem mining, two
            championship golf courses, horseback riding, two tennis courts and a playground for the kids. our vacation
            rentals are convenient to all of these activities and more.


be sure to visit our 'fun
                things to do' page for more info about activities in the area.
rock springs retreat
            is pet friendly!
this is one of north carolina's most scenic vacation
              destinations. and it's all at your doorstep when you stay at one of our chimney rock, bat
            cave or lake lure nc vacation rentals.
southern living has once again named lake lure
              the #1 lake town in the south. 
lake lure will be undergoing a drawdown starting jan. 1, 2025 and lasting through march 15, 2025.
            the town of lake lure will begin lowering the lake by approximately 1 foot per day until 20 feet
            has been reached. infrastructure maintenance, dredging, and dam projects will be expedited during this time
            frame. these efforts by the town of lake lure will affect access to the lake and restrict any lake usage
            during this time. refilling of the lake will begin march 16, and will depend upon rainfall to completely
            refill.
