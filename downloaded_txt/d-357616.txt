what is google translate?

                    google translate is a third-party service provided by google that performs all translations directly and dynamically. by detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators, google
                    translate can make intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should be. this process of seeking patterns in large amounts of text is called “statistical machine translation”. since the translations are
                    generated by machines, not all translation will be perfect. the more human-translated documents that google translate can analyze in a specific language, the better the translation quality will be. this is why
                    translation accuracy will vary across languages.
