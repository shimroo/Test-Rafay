saint michael the archangel triumphant over satan by mexican luis juárez

i would not have been surprised to find splendor and passion: baroque spain and its empire, a 57-piece spanish baroque exhibition in spain of course; and in the united states new york city and miami would readily spring to mind as likely host cities. it was a pleasant surprise to come across it somewhat hidden as a visiting exhibit at the boca raton museum of art (boca raton museum of art, 501 plaza real, boca raton, florida 33432, https://bocamuseum.org/) in palm beach county, florida.

virgin of the immaculate conception by spanish painter fray alonso lópez de herrera
boca raton is an easy drive from miami-dade and broward counties, where, according to one of the staff the day of my visit, many attendees drove to see the exhibition and have lunch at mizner park, the high end shopping and residential development where the museum is located. it is a tempting idea as the exhibit opens at 11 a.m. most days, except mondays and tuesdays when it is closed.

the presentation of christ in the temple, anonymous

saint cecilia by spanish painter pedro núñez
i appreciated the availability of metered parking within easy reach of the museum entrance as well as complimentary parking a bit further in a covered garage. i liked the serenity within the well lit museum and intimate experience. each painting was accompanied by signage in english and spanish listing the painter’s name and biography, the title of the artwork and medium.
described as the world premiere of spain’s golden age exhibit, part of the renaissance and baroque collection of the hispanic society museum & library (broadway between 155th and 156th streets new york, new york 10032, https://hispanicsociety.org/) in promotional materials the exhibition is scheduled to remain open until march 30, 2025. according to spainculture.us it is due to be displayed at two additional venues. el greco (doménikos theotokópoulos), bartolomé esteban murillo, and diego velázquez are some of the 16th and 17th century artists represented in the exhibition.

tito, margot and me
image: indiepix films
tito, margot and me, a 92-minute 2021 documentary, in spanish and english with english subtitles (the screener version provided was in spanish and english without subtitles), is panama’s official oscar submission for best international film. it attempts to paint a picture behind the romance between margot fonteyn, a well known ballerina, and roberto “tito” arias, a panamanian diplomat, who was married and had three children at the time he approached her to propose marriage. according to a public relations spokesperson no one was available to be interviewed. the film “will be available exclusively on indiepix unlimited on amazon channels” starting november 15, 2024.
narrated by mercedes arias, the couple’s niece who only met them once, the film is made up of family album photos, archival and current videos, interviews and current day images as well as ballet segments performed for the film. while fonteyn continued to dance until her retirement a shooter left arias quadriplegic. the film interviews appear to have taken place in panama, united kingdom and united states. two of the interviewees have passed away since they were interviewed. tito, margot and me was winner of the ibermedia fund 2019 and the panama film fund.
the documentary was co-directed by arias and delfina vidal, the founder of betesda films who works as a director and producer of independent documentaries. she has received two grants from the panamanian film authority to carry out these projects. an example is case in point: box 25, a documentary about the construction of the panama canal, told through first-person accounts from the men who excavated the canal in the early 20th century.
vidal is a director and screenwriter with more than 20 years of experience in film and television production specialized in documentary filmmaking. she directed and produced, with her partner arias, the documentaries case in point: box 25, a different day, and out, la salida está en tu mente. as a university professor, she has taught at the university of panama, santa maria la antigua university, and the university of the isthmus.
