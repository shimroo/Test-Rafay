    why guests love sand dollar bonaire:
 



     


we felt like our condominium was home for the week we were here. the staff were very polite and the amenities were great. when we return to bonaire we know where we will be staying. our stay was above and beyond our expectations, while still feeling like home.

really enjoyed our studio at sand dollar. this was my 5th trip to bonaire and my first sand dollar stay. ðŸ’¯ will book again. spacious studio apartments with separate back and front entry. back patio is enclosed and screened off which was perfect for rinsing and storing our scuba equipment. what set this place apart from others we have stayed other than the inclosed back patio was the more frequent housekeeping/cleaning services and the option to exchange our beach towels every day for clean towels! the staff is very friendly and there is also a gated entrance that requires a fob provided to gain access. if the gate is left up there was always a security guard or two providing security. canâ€™t wait to book our 2024 trip!

completely enjoyed the 3 bedroom, 3 bath apartment at sand dollar. we were a one minute walk from climbing into the ocean. the dive site out front is one of the best on the island. the gal in the office was very helpful and allowed us to have a late checkout since we had a late afternoon flight!
