our country, our economy, our pride, and your driving pleasure need you to bring chrysler corporation home again. chrysler engineered our nation’s path through problems thought unsolvable during times of great crisis: world war ii, the cold war and the space race. chrysler built the nation’s tanks, missiles and guidance systems, and more. all the while, chrysler built the finest cars in the world, introducing automotive innovations that other makes either could not or would not do. then came the energy crisis, unrelenting regulations, and the consequent faltering of the us economy. foreign interests carried away the great chrysler corporation, and they plundered it. walter p. chrysler’s great grandson is calling us to save our american brands chrysler, dodge, ram and jeep, and to bring them home under american ownership. here is the emblematic restoration of the united states we need. here is the pride we lost. here are the jobs we lost. here is the national security we want back. make chrysler american again. make america great again. follow the link. repatriate chrysler!

44 out of 50 pilots agree. they’d rather drive a 1973 mercury marquis brougham than fly the boeing max 9.

what does this site meme? “a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men.” — roald dahl by way of the roman poet horace.
have you wondered what people in old car ads are really saying? duricy’s motor memes is a transformative review and educational critique that puts words into the mouths of automotive advertisements. the purpose of these memes is for you, the jaded car enthusiast/historian, to chuckle while accidentally on purpose learning about the best and worst of our american dreams on wheels. there is, of course, a healthy juxtaposition of old verses new cultural values for a lovingly malevolent take on our modern society as well as our newest automobiles.
