with temperatures set to be 0° c or below, our severe weather emergency protocol (swep) has been triggered in adur and worthing due to a met office weather warning.
all rough sleepers in adur and worthing who have no alternative option for these nights can access accommodation if they need to. our outreach teams are out advising rough sleepers and working with our housing needs team to assist them into accommodation, as well as checking on their welfare.
if you are worried about someone who is sleeping rough, please use the streetlink website or app to report your concerns. your messages will be sent direct to our outreach services who will try to find individuals and notify them of their options.
