i went to kauai








vacation!!!
i rode on a plane!
and got motion sick.
then
i rode on a boat!!
and got motion sick.

as you can guess i get motion sick easily. seriously though, both the plane and boat rides were 5 star in every aspect.

photos courtesy of my girlfriend woooo!

definitely gonna print one of these onto a metal canvas and display it at home :d

* please ask for permission if you want to use any of these pictures. i have the originals with 4000x6000 pixel resolution*

wahhh?!?!?!







been wondering
i haven't been on this in a while and i noticed i actually have a tiny bit of views. how do people even come across my blog?!?!?!

anyway, i'm thinking of converting my current pc from a full size storm stryker case to the brand new fractal define nano s.here's the review by my favorite case review youtube'r. dimitri is the man!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avtuzyj1wzo


i newb at stock

anyone have good portfolio ideas for the coming year as oil tanks and the whole market shakes?



reits?

currently looking at buying a chunk of stwd. it's trading near it's 52 week low and has been increasing it's profits year after year. the dividend is near 11% at the moment and it will probably continue growing at a slow rate. the performance based on funds from operations consistent increases year after year, while the price continues to slowly decline(eps and p/e don't apply well to reits). maybe people are scared of reits. maybe i'm an idiot. either way, i'm gonna buy a bunch and stick it in a roth and hope for the best. worst case scenario i can imagine is the stock either remains at the same price or drops 5% or so, but i still come away with a hefty untaxed 10.9% dividend, which will probably continue to grow over the years. bleh.
