mr. lester, thank you for all the help, your office did so much for me. i have been telling all of my friends. i hope they never need an attorney, but if they do they know who to call. i am now riding my new springer softail. thanks for all you do.

we have nothing but praise for all the support and guidance your office gave during a very difficult time. i would not hesitate to advise anyone to contact aim should the need arise.

 why choose us over the other guys? we're motorcycle rights advocates at heartwhen we win a case, we take a portion of our attorney fees and reinvest it into our national coalition of motorcyclists (ncom) and aid to injured motorcyclists (aim) programs. 
ncom is our legal and legislative program. it's where we promote biker-friendly laws and challenge the laws that threaten the freedom of the road on both local and national levels. each year we host the ncom convention which brings together clubs, organizations and motorcycle rights lobbyists in order to get together, exchange information and work together to keep the lifestyle alive and free from intrusive laws.

aim is our biker information and assistance program. our aim card has saved countless lives by providing vital medical information to first responders. think of our card like a backup plan, we hope you never need it, but it's always there for you in case of an emergency.free legal advice for all motorcycle-related issueswe offer free legal advice on everything related to motorcycling.  whether it's about discrimination, profiling, new technology or changing laws, we have an extensive network of attorneys, lobbyists, clubs, organizations and motorcycle rights advocates that spans across the united states. even if we are unable to answer your question, we can point you toward someone who can.you can find us at confederation of clubs meetingsan aim team attorney is often present and available to chat at your local confederation of clubs meeting. our attorneys give legal and legislative updates as well as hold seminars to help riders understand and protect their rights even better.
