james prosek is an artist, writer, and naturalist whose work pays homage to the history of art and natural sciences while addressing contemporary environmental concerns. his diverse body of work is the result of extensive travel and field observation. prosek creates paintings, drawings, and sculptures that evoke the immense biodiversity of our planet and its imaginative potential. the interconnectedness of nature, the ephemerality of boundaries, and the loss of cultural and biological diversity are major themes of prosek’s work. he has published over a dozen books and exhibited his art globally from the yale university art gallery and the philadelphia museum of art to the asia society hong kong center, the royal academy of arts in london and nouveau musée national de monaco.read more  >
