our company
welcome to naanovo, a global renewable energy development company. our focus is on clean, renewable energy. we believe much of the world's growing demand for energy can be met with renewable energy technology. not only do the technologies exist today that can produce clean, renewable energy, but naanovo has the people and know how to put it all together and make it all work. with our strategic partners and friends around the globe, we are capable of designing, engineering, financing, constructing and operating renewable energy projects anywhere in the world. today, naanovo is active on four continents with well over a dozen subsidiaries and numerous renewable energy projects under development. our projects range in size from 1 mw to over 100 mw, and involve waste to energy (wte), solar, biomass and tyre derived fuel (tdf) technologies.






our goal
the goal of naanovo is to integrate technology and humanity by introducing affordable renewable energy projects to underdeveloped nations and emerging markets. each project we undertake must have a positive impact on the environment and the health and economic well-being of the people we serve.




our values

family is highly valued in all things that we do as a company, whether that be represented through individual employees that have their own families to consider, or whether that be through the business dealings we have within the broader community in which we operate, recognizing that all communities large and small are made up of families of all types, races, religions and creeds, that may be affected in various ways by the work we do. at naanovo, family comes first.

excellence

excellence is the gold standard in any successful business, the benchmark to which we at naanovo purposely strive to achieve every day. we have already proven in our short history that by applying certain gold standard principles, such as cani (constant and never-ending improvement), we can compete very effectively in the global marketplace. with excellence as a core value, not only will we succeed as a company, but we will succeed as people.

integrity

integrity is an important part of our character as a company and as individuals. it is something that we cannot take for granted and must be maintained at all cost, particularly in terms of how we represent ourselves to our clients, our suppliers, our employees, our partners and our friends. at all times we must behave responsibly, morally and ethically, in our business dealings and never knowingly create false promises or expectations that could damage the reputation of the company.

stewardship

stewardship reflects our sense of purpose as a company in that our reason for being is not simply to make money, but to contribute to the broader well-being of the global community, through the establishment of safe and responsible clean energy projects that protect and positively impact the planet's fragile environment. our intentions are to put in place today the necessary clean energy technologies that will replace the need to consume fossil fuels for energy production in the future, resulting in a cleaner and greener planet for generations to come.

transformation

transformation is the process of moving from one state to another. through the use of best available clean energy technologies our goal is to move the world away from a dependency on fossil fuels to a dependency on renewable energy. we see this transformation as absolutely necessary considering fossil fuels are a finite resource and it is our responsibility to demonstrate to the world that there are viable alternatives. as a core value, everything we do reflects this understanding and our urgent need to be proactive in making this transformation happen as quickly as possible.

entrepreneuring

entrepreneuring is at the heart of our core values as a company, implying that everything we do must not only contribute to the prosperity of the company, its shareholders and its employees, but also to the ideal of a free enterprise system which rewards hard work, innovation and adherence to basic values similar to our core values. naanovo prides itself on being an entrepreneurial company and we look for the entrepreneurial spirit in our employees, contractors and suppliers, believing that spirit will transcend to the people and communities around us.

a message from our founder
as our company enters its twentieth year of operation, i am reminded of just how awesome our journey has been and how awesome the future looks for our company. i am also reminded of those who have devoted themselves to getting us here. i am grateful to our many supporters, investors, technical partners and suppliers who have stood by us through the difficult and lean years. yes, there have been many obstacles to overcome and many challenges still ahead, but we have managed to stay focused and committed to our purpose, goals and to our core values. our pipeline of projects is quite impressive and now stands at over $19 billion usd, and it continues to expand. i look forward to each and every project being built knowing that the people we serve will soon have an abundant source of clean energy, clean water and clean air. i look forward to providing meaningful, long-term employment for thousands of people, especially in areas where jobs are badly needed. i invite you to read our corporate profile and to learn about our people and our technologies. remember the name ânaanovoâ as you will soon see this name in every corner of our planet, bringing renewable energy to those who need it most.
