any person kindling a fire without a permit is liable to the  town for all expenses incurred in attending or extinguishing such fire.
no residential trash, treated wood, construction/demolition  debris, tires, mattresses, etc. or brush/trees greater than 5" diameter  can be burned at any time. if you burn any impermissible material, you will be  subject to state fines of up to $2000.00 as well as all costs for the  department to respond and extinguish the illegal fire and for proper disposal  of the illegal material.
