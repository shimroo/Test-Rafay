work hard in silence, let success make the noise 








we can’t say enough good things about tina and are pleased to recommend her. you will be hard-pressed to find a more knowledgeable, dedicated agent for properties in northwest montana. 








we were instantly impressed, not only of her knowledge of sanders county, but how quickly she understood our needs and found us a property that we fell in love with. little did we know we were only beginning to see how truly awesome she really was…she provided so much help and guidance that was incredible and she went way above and beyond anyone’s possible expectations. 












bonnie is an amazing realtor. she helped me to sell two houses for my father in under 6 months. she was able to help with every aspect of the sales and getting both houses ready to sell. she has an incredible knowledge of the area and her professional contacts are invaluable. i could not have done this without her. i would recommend her to anybody looking to sell or buy in the area. 








 gail enger helped me get the house ready for the walk through. she worked with me every step of the way from listing, taking excellent pictures and through the closing. she is an outstanding realtor that really know the market. i was extremely pleased with the sale. 








sharon was our purchasing agent. she did an outstanding job with negotiation and working out all details of the purchase. i would highly recommend sharon as your next agent whether you’re purchasing a home or selling a home. i look forward to working with sharon again. 















let's work together
