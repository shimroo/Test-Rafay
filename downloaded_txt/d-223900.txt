	 the best stew for winter
	 
    

it's really cold. the coldest winter in a couple of years, at least. certainly the coldest i've felt for  a while, and i'm loving it...most of the time i'm loving it. the times when i'm walking from the station to work and my feet have turned numb and my nose is aching are not the times i love it so much. but generally i've always been a cold-weather person, and i think it's partly because of the food; i love anything slow-cooked, casseroled, stewed or germanic and over the past weeks i've been cooking up a huge pot of something meaty and wet (uhhh...) to have in the fridge for when we come home  and it's dark and cold, and we're tired, hungry and perhaps prone to grabbing the first edible thing that springs to hand, which may or may not be a packet of twisties...this week i made coq au vin, in honour of bastille day, but i've also been dabbling in a spicy, paprika-laden beef & chickpea stew dolloped with yoghurt (gutsy) and an irish stew made with pearl barley and topped with sliced potatoes that my mum thought was nice, but wasn't what she considered irish stew (and fair enough -it did seem more of a lancashire hot pot). but the best stew i've ever made and which gets my juices going just when i look at the photo was one i made for a few friends last winter; the greek lamb stew from nigella's how to eat. truly, i dreamt about it for weeks afterwards, and i'm going to have to give it another run this winter, especially as my brother is currently living the party life in the greek islands and the greek theme is running strong.it calls for 2.5kg of lamb shoulder cooked in a bottle of white wine (yes, white), the standard stew veggies, tinned tomatoes, oregano and small pasta shapes. i love stews with pasta cooked in them; they go soft and slurpy and absorb all the tasty liquid. but for me, the crowning glory of this dish is the mix of crumbled feta and dried oregano you scatter over your plate before serving. i love feta cheese anyway, but this was outstanding. don't skip it. in fact, i'd double the amount - it makes the dish a bit richer, but the sharp saltiness works so well. it's also fabulous with a dribble of chilli oil over the top.this one gets a really strong recommendation from me, but note, if you have trouble finding lamb shoulder - as we did, even at the preston market, or are charged a what-the-f*%#?! price - as we were - an alternative one butcher suggested might be to use lamb shoulder chops, which are cheaper and much easier to find.tagged with stew labels: feta, lamb, savoury foods

	 fenix restaurant offer to readers!
	 
    

i recently started a new job at a newspaper, along with my other part-time position, so i've been a bit distracted recently, but an email yesterday from ray capaldi, co-proprietor and chef at fenix in richmond spurred me into action. ray's been checking out the melbourne food blogging community and discovered the review i wrote about the desserts of the future dinner at fenix during the melbourne food & wine festival. he left a comment on the site and emailed me to say he enjoyed reading the views of somebody on the dining floor.  he's very interested in what the public who come to fenix really think of the restaurant, the food and the hospitality and he was concerned when a few readers indicated that the prices at the restaurant were beyond their means. he wants everybody to experience the fenix hospitality and food, so he's come up with an idea:for all esurientes readers he would like to offer them an exclusive offer of a 5 course degustation with wines for $85 dollars per person any night of the week except friday or saturday.  the offer stands for all 2007 except december. readers need to mention this offer on the phone when they book.(nb. for those who've asked: pronunciation of the blog is eh-zoo-ri-en-tez. ;-) or niki is easy to pronounce )the 5 course tasting menu with wine is usually around $135, so this is a very generous offer from somebody genuinely interested in getting more people to experience his hospitality,you can view some of the menus on the website. if you haven't been to fenix before, you're in for a treat. i think it's the most adventurous and interesting food happening in melbourne, and the venue, right on the yarra, is stunning.in other news, i'm going up to woodend this weekend to perform, and next week to sydney to check out a few restaurants: aria, balzac and billy kwongs are definites. ray mentioned at that first fenix dinner that the sydney restaurant scene is firing right now, so i'm looking forward to trying it.also, this blog has been nominated (along with many others) for a bloggers choice award, in the food blog category. you can cast your votes here!labels: restaurant reviews

	 homemade peanut butter cups
	 
    

these should come with a health warning. there is truly nothing nutritious contained inside, just peanut butter, sugar, butter & chocolate, but f%*@$ they're so damn good!!!like many people i'd eyed off the chocolate peanut butter squares in nigella's domestic goddess for years, savouring the idea of making homespun reese's peanut butter cups, but when i saw her christmas special last year, and noted she'd changed the idea slightly so they were served in individual mini-muffin cases, i was hooked. when planning food for my 30th drinks party, these were high on the list. they're as simple to make as chocolate crackles, and don't involve any cooking except for heating up some chocolate, which in typical fashion, i stuffed up. i usually ignore calls for melting chocolate over a double boiler because it's annoying and i don't have a double boiler. i find my heavy le creuset pot on low heat works fine. this time, the cooking fairies had their revenge, and the chocolate seized within 30 seconds. it could have been because i chose to use eating chocolate rather than cooking chocolate, and it's more temperamental anyway. but i learnt my lesson, and although i persevered with dumping the chocolate on top of the peanut butter mixture, they looked disgustingly like wombat turds, so i melted another block in the microwave (duh!!) and poured that on top. hence, these peanut butter cups had a pretty thick layer of chocolate to bite through...all good!you can have fun making these while gossiping with a friend, because it's slightly tedious work; you need to press peanut butter filling into each cup with your fingers, and then pour chocolate over each one. it's perfect friendship cooking, or something you could enjoy making with kids.but phwoaaaarrr they're rich. i know of somebody who tried one and dreamt about them all week. i think she succumbed and made a batch of her own. they're worth it.i found my recipe here:labels: peanut butter, sweet foods + baking

	 autumnal birthday cake for the autumn of my life....
	 
    

on the 30th march it was my 30th birthday, and so far it's been an extended one starting with this birthday cake at a rehearsal 4 days beforehand, and a ending with an afternoon drinks party for friends at my house on easter monday. in between i've had dinners with family and a very luxurious weekend away in daylesford, with a lunch at the lake house and spa treatments daahling! in hepburn springs. still to come is another birthday weekend away with more friends. i like special birthdays! they almost make up for the slight panic you may feel at turning an age where you thought you would be all grown-up, and realising you have a long way to go before that happens.i didn't want to make another chocolate cake to take for rehearsing friends, so i turned to this one in nigella's domestic goddess: the autumnal birthday cake. appropriate as my birthday falls in the first real flush of melbourne autumn, which is my favourite time of year. the days are warm, clear and sunny, the leaves are turning, the afternoon light is golden and the nights are crisp and i can curl  under my doona for the first time in months. do you like my pseudo-artistic cake decorating efforts with the leaves from our front yard? hey, i brushed the dirt off first!the cake is an adaptation of a maple & pecan layer cake cake from the magnolia bakery in new york, and it uses 2 full bottles of maple syrup. you know how much that stuff costs? hell! i might as well make it from gold! i nearly reached for the imitation maple-flavoured slop, but slapped myself around the head and reminded myself that i'll only turn 30 once, and if i couldn't buy the good stuff for my good friends then i was a horrible person. at least buy the good stuff for me! despite the amount of syrup in the cake and the frosting, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, although the smell convinced many otherwise. this cake would be a great wasp attractor.it's a simple, sponge-like cake batter, flavoured with maple, that is best eaten on the day it's made as it tends towards dryness. it was already heading that way that evening. the frosting is a cooked meringue, with the texture of marshmallow fluff, again flavoured with maple syrup, and quite sticky to touch. the pecans provided a textural contrast that was needed, although i was confused by the amount in the recipe, because the picture in nigella's book definitely doesn't show it covered in as many as specified! the recipe doesn't instruct this, but i toasted the pecans before chopping them in salted butter, and based on my new knowledge from ray capaldi at fenix about the need for salt in nut-based desserts, i added a hefty pinch of my pink murray river salt flakes. i liked the taste of salt cutting through the sticky meringue.a note for next time: it calls for a lot of flour - 1/2 kilo of it, and self-raising flour at that. i don't like the squeaky, chalky mouthfeel of sr flour, especially in those quantities, and again armed with my new knowledge from ray capaldi about how flour is a cheap filler, next time i would cut down the amount. hopefully it would still set, but it's worth a try. it might stop the tendency towards dryness too.it's rich and filling, and we could only manage small slices, although my brother who really doesn't have a sweet tooth came in late at night and found the large wedge leftover. heating it up in the microwave (dryness factor) he ate the entire chunk, which frankly astounds me. i know he likes maple syrup, but....whoa!no recipe on my site this time, but i found it on another blog. enjoy!tagged with cake labels: cake, maple, nuts, pecan, sweet foods + baking

	 desserts of the future
	 
    

on monday night i turned up at fenix demanding my just desserts. my friend had emailed me soon after the melbourne food & wine festival program came out asking if i'd be interested in going along to a dessert dinner at fenix. it was expensive, so i hesitated, but then remembered i've been wanting to eat there for ages, ever since raymond capaldi really embraced the whole molecular gastronomy thing. i ate at reserve when george calombaris had just started there, and remember my mum's reaction to her blue cheese and dark chocolate crab-meat patty creation when it appeared in front of her (i seem to recall it all worked together??), and i caught a few episodes of heston blumenthal's latest series when i was in the uk last year. so, i figured we'd get to sample some pretty interesting flavours and combinations. plus, who doesn't think the idea of a dinner which includes 1 main and 4 desserts matched with wines doesn't sound like a very good thing?!raymond capaldi came out and set us all straight immediately. he's got some presence, that man, plus an accent straight out of billy connolly:"right, so desserts are not meant to be sweet."huh? confusion all 'round. hell, we're not going to get desserts made of savoury stuff, are we??yes, and no. his belief (and i think it's a sound one) is that the overwhelming sensation of a dessert should not be only sugar and sweetness. there should be a mix of flavours and taste sensations, and a good dessert should make use of all 5 tastes our tongues can sense. he's big on unami as one of them, so seaweed takes a starring role in many.  salt is important in desserts too, especially when using nuts or chocolate.he went on to explain that recipes found in popular foodie magazines are created for the lowest common denominator and are full of unnecessary extenders. flour is one such nasty extender, and his own example was the fenix basic chocolate souffle, which has all the flour removed, hence creating a much more intense flavour and delicate texture. once a customer requested a sticky date pudding, which isn't on their menu, so he googled a recipe and told the staff to remove 1/2 the flour and double the sauce. they argued it wouldn't set, and told him his reputation would be on the line when it flopped, but it turned out to be the best sticky date pudding they'd ever tasted; just set and wobbling on the plate. as somebody who tends to bake more often than your basic joe, and who shouldn't be eating vast quantities of flour, this idea interests me.enough of the theories: onto the food.so we wouldn't only be eating desserts, we started with a main course of 36 hour cooked lamb. sorry about the crap photo; i hadn't worked out my manual settings yet!this was exquisite. the lamb neck meat was cooked at 58 degrees c for 1.5 days, which meant that the meat never got so hot that the fat escaped into the pan. instead, the meat cooked extremely slowly, with the fat remaining inside keeping it lubricated.  after 36 hours, the lamb was still pink inside and so tender we didn't need to use knives. we had a velvety sauce made of pureed char-grilled eggplants, almonds, garlic etc.  and a bit of roasted capsicum (not a turd, despite the photo). i'd be really keen to replicate this at home. it'd be one of the only things from the night i'd be capable of doing!a special guest on the night was will goldfarb from room 4 dessert; a high-end dessert bar in new york. he gave us a talk (very lovely guy, but slightly pointless talk) before the meal began, and this first dessert,  was one of his creations. i knew when i saw something as mundane as ice-cream sandwich on the menu, that it would actually be something pretty special. hey, probably something with foams and liquid nitrogen?! actually, it was pretty simple; a sweet-dough biscuit topped with vanilla icecream and a scoop of epoisses cheese topped with smoked salt.  will said it plays on peoples' love for things sweet, fatty and salty and, sure, i could have eaten at least 5 of these, but maybe it was just 'cos i was hungry; because if i'm being completely honest what it tasted like was a bit of soft camembert and icecream on a shortbread biscuit! great icecream and amazing cheese, but still.... we couldn't taste the smoked salt. each part was lovely, but it was definitely a head-spin to eat icecream and salty, creamy cheese together. the simplest dessert on the night, but i remember the taste and texture intensely.tahitian vanilla mousse with cucumber sorbet was one that didn't grab my attention on the menu but ended up being our favourite of the night. a advantage of events like this is that they challenge your preconceived ideas about what you like. this is not the sort of thing i'd order on a dessert menu, but it was incredible. the vanilla mousse made with tahitian vanilla seeds is the long, white sausage. the cucumber sorbet is topped with a mango gel, and a coconut tapioca mixture is down the other end. along the way is a square of lime jelly, a few bean shoots and cubes of cucumber. what i enjoyed was that each component tasted good on its own, but even better when combined with others. we had fun mixing and matching. fresh and light and citrussy, this was a winner. particularly the cucumber sorbet: wow, star of the plate.now, what i said before about challenging preconceptions? this "coffee & potato" is the type of thing i would have ordered from a menu. the description struck the right notes of interest in me: coffee icecream, hazelnut custard and potato puree, but just didn't do it for us. all of us (we'd made friends by this stage).ray described this dish beforehand, pointing out that it wasn't dreamt up in the middle of the night by a crazy person. he said the ratte potato has a hazelnut taste to it, and hazelnut pairs well with coffee, so he figured they'd work well together. great idea, in theory. but in reality the puree was not  and the texture was all wrong. coffee icecream: great. hazelnut custard: gorgeous. but the potato was too dry and powdery, and got caught in your throat. if it had been lubricated just a little more, it might have been more successful, but who knows if adding milk or butter to it would have thrown the taste balance out with the other components? i just couldn't get past the fact that i was eating a lump of dry mashed potato with my icecream and custard! a friend who heard about it said it sounded like something made up by a toddler playing in the kitchen. :-)  not awful, in the realm of all the food in the world, just not the best of what we experienced that night.this green apple sorbet, with parsnip puree, blackberries and cashew nut jam is another thing i might have overlooked on a menu, but again, i've had my preconceptions challenged. along with our new friends  we decided this was a real winner. ray had already explained to us that in old-english useage, 'nip' meant something sweet, and parsnips were generally used in cakes and desserts. sometime in the last 200 years this changed and parsnips are just known for their use in the sunday roast and veggie soup. i can't say i enjoyed the parsnip puree on its own, but i don't think that was the point. combined with the tangy apple sorbet and the salty cashew nuts it was a incredible combination. we felt this dessert in particular was made for playing with taste combinations. cubes of apple combined with salted blackberries and the amazing cashew nut 'jam' is something i remember enjoying.by the last course we were feeling pretty lightheaded; a different wine had been served with each course, and after our first enthusiastic sparkling we realised that if we were going to drive home, we were going to have to be a bit more careful. at the end of the night you can see how sensible we were, dammit:the wines were really incredible; i've never had a meal where each course was so perfectly matched with the wine. there was one particular choice all of us disliked intensely when we tasted it (smelled like iodine!) but when combined with the coffee & potato dessertit suddenly worked.you'll notice that in a dinner of 4 desserts chocolate didn't make an appearance, but that omission was rectified with the petit fours. we had a red fruit 'popsicle': kind of frozen air on a stick; a blackcurrant jelly (like the best jube you've ever tasted) and a salt & vinegar chocolate stick. uh-huh. salt & vinegar chocolate! and it was so amazing we were stealing extras from other peoples' plates (how could they possibly leave them??!). adding salt to chocolate is already widely known to heighten the flavour of chocolate, but the addition of a sweet (possibly balsamic) vinegar was a revelation. outstanding!i'm glad i made the decision to go along. it was a real eye-opener of an evening, and enjoyable on many levels. my friend and i were so impressed with raymond capaldi's views on food, the service, and the look of the regular menu that we're planning to return for a degustation dinner; and hang the cost!!tagged with dessert labels: desserts, events, restaurant reviews

	 lemon chicken...italian style
	 
    

how many times have you looked at that bottle of limoncello in the freezer and thought "my god, that must have been there for at least two years. what are we going to do with it?!"  i know we're not the only people to be lured in by the romance of this italian lemon liqueur: remembering warm summer evenings on a loggia, with a warm breeze tickling the leaves of trees in the olive grove and flowing through your hair, and sweet lemon flavour slipping down your throat. admittedly, i've only experienced that scenario in my winter-in-melbourne dreams, and in my life limoncello tends to burn all the way down and makes me cough.  somehow the dream just isn't quite recreated that way you intend, is it?so, we've had this bottle of liqueur in the freezer for a long time, and i can't remember where or when i found this recipe, but it's just the thing if you find yourself in a similar perplexed state when cleaning out the freezer. i know it was from a food blog, so do let me know if it is yours.chicken baked in limoncello...what an idea! it sounds a bit outrageous, and i wasn't sure how it would work out, but the best way to describe it is lemon chicken, italian style. it really does work well; the sweetness of the limoncello is balanced by fresh lemon juice and summery herbs. i didn't have quite enough limoncello, so made up the difference with vodka....hey, it's all alcohol, and i know people who'd be pretty excited at the idea of chicken baked in vodka.the ingredients listed are not set in stone; i didn't have lemon thyme, so used fresh rosemary and sage instead. i also added a touch of spanish paprika to the sauce, which gave a hint of smokiness. also, my chicken breasts didn't have skin, and in fact 2 of them were actually thighs, as i discovered as i started eating them! i have to admit i preferred the texture of the thighs to the breasts, but i'm a thigh girl after all....  it's a perfect meal for a warm summer's evening, even if it doesn't take place on a tuscan hillside.read on for the recipe:chicken baked in limoncello4 x 180g chicken breasts with skin on8 garlic clovespared rind & juice of 2 large lemons6 sprigs lemon thyme1 cup (250ml) limoncello50g unsalted butter2 tbs olive oil-place chicken in a non-metallic dish with garlic, rind & juice, thyme & limoncello. cover & chill for one hour.-preheat oven to 180c. heat butter & oil in a large heavy based frypan over high heat.-remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) & brown for 2-3 minutes each side.-place skin side up in a baking tray & roast for 10 minuts or until cooked through.-return frypan to medium heat, ad reserved marinade (including garlic & herbs) & stir for 5 minutes to reduce.-remove chicken from oven & rest for 5 minutes. place on a serving plate, pour over sauce.-serve with rice or mashed potatoes and green veg. tagged with chicken labels: chicken, savoury foods

shrove tuesday today, and for breakfast another batch of those excellent wholemeal buttermilk pancakes i made last year.  mmm - crispy edges from being fried in real butter.  :-)this year my brother splashed out and bought a bottle of real maple syrup ($$$!), but after a scientific taste test with one of each on the plate, i still prefer golden syrup. it's thicker, and stays near the food instead of running far away from it, and it's got that slight bitterness i love.wholemeal pancakes...who'da thunk they'd be so good?!labels: pancake, shrove tuesday, sweet foods + baking

	 too damn hot chicken salad
	 
    

this weekend it's damn hot...too hot! 3 days at the upper end of the 30s is not great incentive for doing much. flicking half-heartedly through nigella's forever summer a few weeks ago, when it was also too damn hot, revealed this chicken salad that looked pretty good for the weather. her show of the same name happened to be on that night, and she was making this dish, so with that double whammy i figured it was telling me something!i've never had coronation chicken, the dish she rejigged to make this, but it seemed to contain cooked chicken, mayonnaise, mango chutney, curry powder and apricot puree, which to me sounds like a combination thrown together by a deranged person home from the gym who just needs to eat right now and doesn't care what they find in the fridge. i don't want to say "eugh" because i know many people of my grandmother's age who seemed to enjoy this....effort, but.....hmmm. nigella's version also contains cooked chicken, but is much more sensible!i mixed up a cooked chicken breast with a cubed mango, spring onion, chopped fresh chillies and lime juice and tossed it about with a torn up cos lettuce, a big handful of fresh coriander and a few drops of sesame oil. it's very evidently asian-inspired, and was perfect for a hot sticky night. the lime juice and chilli kick was perfect, and although i'm really not a fan of fruit with meat, the mango and chicken was great together. for a hot night after a damn hot day, it's about all we could cope with - and afterwards i realised it had virtually negligible fat content - bonus!labels: chicken, mango, salad, savoury foods, summer

	 bern & luzern
	 
    

the bern bear city symbol on a ginger cakei've been completely pathetic putting up the photos of what-we-ate-in-europe, and i'm annoyed with myself. i'm not going to abandon this project halfway (or 1/4 way in because there's about another 6 weeks to go!) so i'm resuming it. even if i only post photos without text, at least i'm finishing something i started!after payerne in western-french-speaking switzerland we stopped for lunch in bern, only 30 minutes away. even though it's so close, suddenly everything was in german! in payerne german was seen as something very foreign, and english even more so, but a few miles down the road it was a different story. switzerland is fascinating; i love the place.we were let loose for an hour or so to look around and grab something to eat. i soon discovered in the local market that i was able to communicate in french; in this area where the linguistic borders are so close, most people are at least bi-lingual. and as bern is the swiss capital, all the official languages are spoken and understood, even if the signs are in german. i didn't have as much success communicating in italian, though!i really liked bern - it feels more like a small bustling market town than a national capital, and i guess that's because of the unique nature of the swiss government, with 7 premiers of the cantons sharing the leadership position, and the function of the annual president mainly limited to greeting people at airports.miniature vegetables were all over the marketplaces of europe this time of year. we couldn't figure out the allure of the miniature vegetable. i suspected they were used as autumn table decorations, but does anybody have a more detailed explanation?the people of bern have a violent history of eating small babies!we spent too long wandering around the market and decided to get things to eat on the bus. there were about 10 cheese stalls, so we choose one at random and bought some vacherin and some truffle infused brie. hoooeyy! truffle infused brie! my friend who shared this with me is still sending messages raving about it, from her new home in the uk!you just can't buy brie this ripe in australia. look at it - it's oozing! in the centre was another layer of cheese mixed with chopped truffles.  this stuff nearly sent us falling to the floor in ecstasy...not a safe thing when driving on windy swiss roads!i bought a few day-old crusty rolls and we actually managed to get through that entire hunk of cheese, plus the vacherin. we also bought some local green apples to cut through the richness, and that simple lunch on the bus was a definite food highlight of the whole trip.we had 2 nights in luzern, compared to the one hour in bern, but there are hardly any foodie photos we took. the weather turned rainy and cool for the first time in the trip there, and we were feeling a bit tired, so it was a quiet few days. i was billeted on my own with a student, in a typical student-hovel apartment. i lugged by bags on 3 local buses, hoiked them up 6 flights of stairs in the rain, was shown to my mattress on the floor and was told there wasn't any food in the house for dinner; would i like packet soup or a bowl of cereal? at 4am the housemate came home, newly broken up with his girlfriend, rolling drunk and surrounded by girls and decided to play german heavy-metal and cook spaghetti!! he didn't know there was a visiting australian in the next room who had to get up in 3 hours to sing at church. many people might have cried at this stage - i started to laugh and knew i'd look back on this with a smile. the next night i came home to find a pot-smoking party going on around my bed! fabulous.  but actually i had a great time staying with the students, experiencing real swiss life, and learning a lot about swiss culture and politics.  i didn't have to worry about keeping the bathroom fanatically clean, either! plus i got to try a variety of flavoured yoghurts, which was all they had in the fridge. yoghurt in switzerland isn't considered solely a health food, like here, so you can get choc chip cookie dough yoghurt, chestnut puree yoghurt, butterscotch etc.etc. yum!after our evening concert we were taken out for dinner to a swiss restaurant. above is the winner of the biggest-sausage-on-tour competition. i shared the fondue with belinda but looking at that sausage and crispy roesti, i wish i'd chosen that instead.here's our fondue for two. it was exciting for the first 5 minutes in that "i'm really in switzerland and eating cheese fondue" kind of way, and then it lost its spark. the only thing we had to dip in it was soft brown bread. romance aside, a meal of bread and a bloody great pot of melted cheese is actually a bit dull! when i've had fondue here, we've had a variety of vegetables to dip in alongside the bread, which livens up the event. if our bread was toasted it would have at least provided a textural contrast, but the soft bread and soft cheese were a bit too similar. after about 10 minutes belinda said "this isn't exciting any more".i would never say to anybody not to have fondue in switzerland; it's something you definitely have to do, but once is probably enough (i've done it twice now, and am happy to expand into the repertoire of enormous sausages and potato pancakes now!)here's a very early morning photo of gorgeous luzern; lake, totentanz bridge, tower, mountains surrounding the whole place... hence the constant daily rain!!labels: bern, berne, foodie europe 2006, lucerne, luzern, swiss food

i haven't yet mentioned that i received a shiny red kitchen aid for christmas, just like the one plum received and i've been getting stuck into playing around with it. last week i decided to make a chocolate pavlova for no other reason than the fact that i hadn't yet tried out the whisk attachment. how sad is that? then i needed to get it out of the house before i ate it all, because it was good.i was going down to a friend's beachhouse on the great ocean road, so i thought that was a good enough excuse to use the kitchen aid again. surely everyone wants biscuits! i tried out two recipes: one for a choc chip cookie, and another for a peanut butter truffle biscuit that i admit was purely inspired by gluttony, peanut butter truffle - hello?! and the picture in the book was the sort that always made me stop and stare in longing.but first, the choc chip cookies: these are courtesy of wrestler/movie star the rock in the wwf cookbook! i read about them on a few different blogs and as so many of you know, i have a quest to find the best choc chip cookie recipe. this one is pretty damn good: i like cccs with oatmeal in them; it gives heft and chew. but you need pretty damn strong muscles to stir the mixture - hence why you love your kitchen aid at a time like this! you can find the recipe here near the bottom of the page, which i halved and still ended up with about 80 cookies. evidently the rock enjoys things a little larger than i do...! i used a combination of a chunk of valrhona dark chocolate and the leftovers of a choc-almond christmas tree - you know those things made of chopped almonds mixed with chocolate and made into lots of branches in a tree shape - which was tasty but meant they ended up far too nutty. hours later we were still picking nuts out of our teeth, so next time i'm sticking with normal chocolate. nb - these kept for ages without going manky, too.the peanut butter truffle cookies come from a random english baking book,  the type that includes photos of each step, and the photo shows the things warm from the oven with the truffle filling oozing out and looking delish. as you can see above, there was no oozement going on, but that disappointment aside, these were incredible - but a little tedious to make. you make up a peanut butter & golden syrup dough which is pretty soft and pasty. combine that with our summer heat and i had to put it in the fridge for a few hours because there was no way i could roll that stuff out. when i could, i flattened a ball into a circle and added a spoonful of the truffle mixture and tried to fold the dough around it, with very varying success. usually the dough was not dough-like enough to do it without cracking or falling apart, so lots of my cookies had cracked tops where the truffle mixture bubbled out. the taste was fabulous, anyway and i'd definitely make these again when i'm feeling domestic and have a bit of time and patience on my hands.read on for the recipe:peanut butter truffle cookiesmakes ~20125 g/4 oz dark chocolate150ml/1/4 pint double cream*125g/4oz softened butter125g/4oz caster sugar125g/4oz crunchy or smooth peanut butter4 tbsp golden syrup1 tbsp milk225g/8oz plain flour1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda1: preheat oven to 180c/350f 10 minutes before baking. make the chocolate filling by breaking the chocolate into small pieces and placing in a heatproof bowl.2: put the cream into a saucepan and heat for boiling point. immediately pour over the chocolate3: leave to stand for 1-2 minutes, then stir until smooth. se aside to cool until firm enough to scoop. do not refrigerate (i needed to. i'm in an australian summer!)4: lightly oil a baking sheet. cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. blend in the peanut butter, followed the golden syrup and milk.5: sift together the flour and bicarb. add to the peanut butter mixture, mix well and knead until smooth.6: flatten 1-2 tablespoons of the cookie mixture on a chopping board6: put a spoonful of the chocolate mixture into the centre of the cookie dough, then fold the dough around the chocolate to enclose completely.8: put the balls on to the baking sheet and flatten slightly (be careful not to split them open!). bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes until golden**9: remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely and serve.*i actually used yoghurt as it's what i had in the fridge. the filling had a slight tang which i liked against the sweet dough.** i found this time wasn't long enough, as my biscuits became *extremely* soft the next day, and i needed to re-bake them for another 10 minutes so they didn't crumble when i picked them up. labels: baking, chocolate, cookie, sweet foods + baking

the best stew for winter


ohh, thanks for reminding me about this one! i adore this stew, and you are right: it's the feta that really makes it sublime.


this makes me miss winter!


what more could you want on a wintery day? sounds like the perfect rich comforting stew that you can devour by the bowlful.


dear nikithis is not a comment about your post, i couldn't find another way to contact you.i have tagged for you a meme about yourself. please visit my blog to view the rules.http://appleandspice.blogspot.com/2007/07/all-about-meme.htmlif you have already been tagged by someone else then you do not need to answer again (unless of course you want to)many thanks,katie from apple & spice.


heeeey. omg, i want to visit the preston market. i always go by it on the train to epping!


mmm.. looks good!


a lovely dish. i really should hunt for the  lamb shoulder after this post...


i'll be pulling nigella off my shelves tonight!


omg...  just reading about that stew makes me drool.  i adore slow-cooked lamb and i adore feta cheese - what's not to like.  this one's a keeper & i'll have to get nigella's book.


niki, you'll never know what cold weather really is like until it is -30c outside. but your lamb stew sounds heart-warming indeed. thanks.


spice-rack information that you need


funny, just getting around to catching your blog and it is good timimg.  we are just getting ready for the fall here.  i shall be paying closer attention now!tomhilton head popcorn co.www.hiltonheadpopcorn.com


hi niki, that dish sound really lovely. can you please give me more details how you actually made this dish? did you cook the lamb first and than added the vegies or did you put everything together? and what kind of white wine did you use - dry or sweet? is the wine the only liquid you added or did you also added some other liquid. which vegies would you recommend. and i assume that you cook the stew with the bones. how long do you cook it? i would be really greatfull if you could give me more details, so i can spoil my dear husband :)thanks a lot, have a nice daykind regardscarina


nikki, i do hope you come back soon - this has always been my favourite blog, and i have so missed your writing.  hope you are just too busy, and nothing nasty...


come back!your blog has been really helpful in the past for booting me out of my quarterly cooking ruts.  also - your entries on your switzerland trip were great.  you helped a lot in the planning for our trip last spring - thanks!

hi therei have just stumbled upon your blog. i love the clean design and fantastic photos. i am a blogger myself and always thought that design was key and you have certainly captured that! there are so many food blogs out there these days and being different to all the others is key. i have just started www.ifoods.tv which is a website for chefs, foodies and food bloggers to hand out, share recipes, photos and videos. when i was blogging i always thought i should be getting more traffic as my blog was getting lost in the masses of stuff out there so my new site is aimed at giving food bloggers and chefs a bigger platform! hope you enjoy it and keep up the good writing and design here! i have now bookmarked you so will be regular reader, cheers!

fenix restaurant offer to readers!


woooo! i might try to make a booking for a special anniversary in a few months.


that's not the response i got from him. it was quite threatening because i didn't like one of his dishes!


that's a terrific offer, great work.


that's so great - makes me yearn to be living in oz instead of mud island!!  ray certainly is grabbing the blogging bull by the horns - after i commented on your fenix review he actually sen't me an e-mail commenting on my comment!and well done on the newspaper job - i'm well envious... ;-)


omg, where have you gone! you were missing for so long...


oh i am definitely going at some point.  jamie and i have been to fenix before when tony hired it out for his daughter's 21st, and we were blown away.  we've wanted to go back for a long time, so we're there!and congrats about the award nomination! i'm going to tell everyone to vote for you!("we are the winners...etc etc etc...vote! vote! vote! vote!"hayley :)


i would never give mr. capaldi my money as he treats his staff very poorly. he is not good for the industry. he lost another chef last week as pointed out "the age epicure" tuesday the 3rd july.


"woooo! i might try to make a booking for a special anniversary in a few months."the same as you!


an yummy foods... this are cool..


great job.. it's awesome.. i love the foods.. yummy!


thank you

homemade peanut butter cups


yummo! that'll be getting a work out next weekend!


they look heavenly. gotta love peanut butter mmmmmmmm


they look nice but your description of them has got me wanting some right now.congratulation on your 30th !


delicious - and they seem easy to make!


i share your sentiments. that combination sounds lethal yet so delicious. it sounds too good to pass up.


wombat turds!! oh how you make me laugh (and what interesting google hits you must be getting...!) i am rather a fan of peanut butter cups so i fear i might have to try these.  last year i also discovered the unadulterated joy of hershey's peanut butter kisses.  oh boy!


dear god, you have found my one true weakness.  peanut butter and chocolate cups?  dying!my mom used to make little pb cups, in milk, dark and white chocolate, when i was younger.  she'd make dozens of them, and store them in the freezer for christmas.  i'd sneak one out, on the way to school, every so often...by christmas time, she had considerably fewer cups to put out!i'm definitely giving these a try...despite my efforts to lose weight.


right, that's it. i can't wait to cook these!


three comments in one, actually...1. the chocolate crackles link doesn't work.2. i'm moving to sale in a few months, wondered if you had an reccomendations for romantic, not-too-pricey dinners for two in melbourne and/or the sale area?3. those look delicious and i will be force feeding them to my housemates this weekend!


you've hit my weak spot with chocolate. life will never be the same again until i make these peanut butter treats.


i'm distressed that you actually know what wombat turds look like!


this sounds x rated.  i do love that in a recipe!

wow! those peanut butter cups look awesome. i'm drooling all over my screen!


autumnal birthday cake for the autumn of my life....


happy birthday nikki!this sounds like a great cake... im a big fan of maple syrup... although i wonder what made it dry out so quickly...?love the leaves too... i have a whole pile of them in a bowl on my dining table :)


happy birthday...although now that 40 is the new 30 you've got a while to go before you get to the autumn of your lifelucky you getting to go to the lake house..love the last pic with the leaves too


happy birthday niki!! but "autumn of your life"??  please - you're still in the summer!!  the cake is gorgeous and beautifully styled and photographed.  hope your 30th year is filled with happiness!


what a pretty cake!! really nice!i am not a fan of maple, but your cake looks wonderful!!ana


happy birthday!i stumbled upon your site two days ago while googling for a good old breakfast museli recipe...and this morning i made your adopted apple museli!  wow.  i'm in love.  thanks for sharing this great recipe..i'll be visting your site regularly for inspiration!


fantabulous! i totally freaked out on my 30th. i don't want to get any older.


happy birthday!!!  sounds like you had some great celebrations...good!  30 was by far my most fantastic birthday ever!  it was as if all other birthdays before that were just practice :)  i remember waking up and feeling like i was the queen of the world!  enjoy 30 -- it rocks!i love the sound of that cake...but i have to probably wait til i'm 50...if you think real maple syrup is expensive there, you should try buying it here (manila)!  boy oh boy!


the autumn of your life - lol!!  only if you plan on eating badly-prepared fugu sometime soon!  30 is still a spring chicken.  in fact i liked it so much, i stopped counting after that ;-)the cake looks awesome - and it seems we have birthdays within a week of each other - go aries go!  hope you had a fabulous day and enjoyed eating this gorgeous cake.


happy birthday!!! :) i thought this would be a good time to wish you well and tell you how much i appreciate your site--i realise now that i've been reading it for about 6 months atleast, it must be closer to a year now i think but i  think your pictures and your description and you care and passion for food are divine :) so here's a warm hug and wishing you all the very very very best for the next year.  i agree with many  on this board: 30 is spring chicken!! :)  love from vancouver, bc, canada :)


happy belated birthday niki! your birthday cake sounds and looks delicious!  i live in quebec, canada where from the months of february through apil we produce the most delicious maple syrup and enjoy it all year round. i definitely will have to make that cake.ah...to be 30 again!ciao...liliana

desserts of the future


what an educational evening for you & all attendees, niki!! i'm surprised that you could remember everything that you were told. great photos! i hope that fenix is still open the next time i get to melbourne.


this, along with my own recent experience at fenix (i had an express lunch there last friday), has convinced me that it's more than worth a return visit.


hi niki - really interesting post!  this is not the kind of thing i'm not likely to ever experience myself, but i felt like i had a front seat, so thanks!! it's interesting that the lamb was cooked at such a low temperature.  i remember my mom used to cook our thanksgiving turkey overnight at a low temp (but not nearly so low as that lamb), but times changed it was widely thought to be unsafe to cook it that way and she stopped.  i guess turkey might be more of a problem than lamb and stuffed turkey even moreso, but wouldn't there still be some concern with lamb that bacteria (or whatever bad bugs they worry about in food) would thrive under those conditions?


(speechless)


sounds like a great experience! with reference to cathy's concerns about the safety of the lamb, there are a few things which would probably limit the danger: (1) as a solid piece of meat, the inside should be sterile, so any danger would be on the surface, (2) the prolonged cooking process might(?) be sufficient to dry the surface and kill serious concentrations of bacteria, (3) was the piece of meat browned before/after cooking? (looks like it from the pic), (4) unlikely but possible: surface treatment prior to cooking, (5) something else:p


hi niki thank you for the great reveiw and the feedback we are now working more on the potato dish and value the feedback ,for the girl who said about the bacteria for the lamb the lamb is cooked so long the bacteria dies and this has been tested thank you again for a great insight to your blog


hi - well i was set to offer my views on the lamb/bacteria issue, but ray capaldi, head chef himself wrote the last comment, and it seems the issue is settled! i'm stoked he found and read my review, and took the time to not only write a comment, but send me a private email as well. apparently the recipe of the mashed potato has been changed, so i'd been keen to experience it again.


wow, some of those sounded incredibly interesting. will have to venture over to that place at some point.


oh wow - what an outstanding account of your meal!  it's interesting what you say about enjoying having your preconceptions challenged because that was my exact verdict on the fat duck.  you read the description and think "never!", but then you suspend your disbelief and taste and more often than not, it makes perfect sense.  the thing that the naysayers forget is that in the hands of such experienced chefs, you are unlikely to be given food that is actively unpleasant, no matter how unusual it sounds.  i mean, they want you to come back! and how cool that the restaurant found and responded to your post :)


this sounds so interesting! not sure i'd pick cucumber sorbet myself, but as you say, if it's done well, it's althemore satisfying to have tried something new and be overwhelmed by it.slow (really slow) cooking is all the rage in germany now, i even see recipes in the food magazines i buy... but apart from the fact that noone can afford to spend days waiting for a lamb to cook, i also wonder how you're supposed to control the temperature in a regular oven... 58c? i have troubles finding 180 on my dial (which consists of spots in 25c increments). it's always delicious when i have it at a restaurant, but i wonder if i'll ever try my hand at it at home!


cant find anyway of emailing you so im using the comment facility to ask you if you have ever come across this site of artisan italian foods- i think you of all people will adore it if you are not already a fan:http://www.esperya.com


its me - i found how to post a comment properly - so that last post was from me the one about the italian arisan food site - bia blasta which in irish means tasty food! (in county cork ireland)


i really enjoyed this read, as i *hate* dessert, and it's hard to explain to people 'no, i'm not watching my weight, i just enjoy salt'.no-on belives me.  i'm a girl, right ?so anyway, this was a nice detour from what i know.  i normally prefer a cheeseboard or a dessert wine to anything fancy, sweet, or cloying ( why would i want to wash any of those great entree and mains tastes with sugar - bah ! )apparently, i'm mad.;)


my 5th grade daughter is writing a report on the, "how technology will impact and influence cakes in the future". any advice where to find material ? thanks!


wow huh, it's for the future...it looks good, thanks for sharing...


this blogs is really cool, thanks for sharing it.


wow crazy blog... i don't like to diet .... i want to try all this watering mouth food....


i loved deserts! which one will i try first? all? lol... lack of budget!


lemon chicken...italian style


sounds interesting nikki. i wonder if it would work with other liqeuers.


this recipe sounds really good, and i happen to have some homemade limoncello in the freezer, i think this might be the recipe to use some up!


i should probably make this recipe, my limmonicello has been in the freezer for almost two years as well. yikes.


sounds tasty!


it is pretty good, and i don't really like sweet sauces with savoury food - but this isn't too sweet, and works well.nb - i should have mentioned that i baked the garlic cloves in the oven with the chicken, which took about 20 minutes, rather than 10. meant we could eat the garlic afterwards.


wow, that sounds really interesting!  lemon and chicken = good; chicken cooked in alcohol = good.  so chicken cooked in lemony alcohol must be doubly good?!  must give this a try...  now all i need is some limoncello which is probably the only type of alcohols i don't currently have in my booze cupboard!btw, if you haven't already been tagged, you are now:http://cooksister.typepad.com/cook_sister/2007/03/5_things_you_do.html


ooooh that looks really delicious. i'm having your limoncello problem with that jar of preserved lemons that's been sitting in the back of our fridge for far too long!


that sounds so cool! i don't have a bottle of limoncello laying around but that looks good enough to warrant buying one!


oh that is brilliant! it is a sin to throw away liquor in our house, even if it does suck. i'll try this recipe tonight.


i almost wish now i had some limoncello in my fridge - the chicken sounds delicious!


just to follow up... i tried this recipe and it was fabulous. thanks a million.


i made this last night - too gorgeous! a definite keeper!thanks heaps


i am difinately going to try that. looks sensational.


looks great...the food, as well as the blog. stumbled across your site trawling through local (melbourne) foodie blogs. slowly trying to get my own started...currently a mix between personal, reviews, recipes etc. thanks for the inspiration...again, for the food, as well as the blog :)


if you were going to buy a golf club, you wouldn't walk into a store and buy the first one you see, would you? of course not; especially if you want to improve your golf game! you'll want to hold the club, take some practice swings, hit some balls if the store has a practice spot, and look at the price, of course. if you are considering buying running shoes, you need to go through a similar process and take the time to find the perfect shoe.


i succumbed to buying a bottle of limoncello after reading a rather seductive recipe for a trifle from nigella lawson.  haven't touched the stuff since, but i might have to try this chicken!


thank you maswex

mmmm...syrup


shrove tuesday already??  i can't believe it, it seems like just yesterday i was shocked that i'd missed it last year.  where does the time go?


as a vermont native (part of america where maple syrup is harvested) i say blasphemy! nothing is better then the real deal! of course it all depends on what you are used to.and all this talk makes me wonder about where aussies would import maple syrup. do you have to get it all the way from canada/new england?


plum - hope you got into the kitchen!jessica - australia doesn't have maple trees so, yes, we import it from the other side of the world (hence the $$! remark. our bottle which held only 1 cup of syrup cost $8). i've always enjoyed maple syrup, but recently my tastes have changed and my sweet tooth has modified a lot, so i now find maple syrup a bit too sweet. that's rich, because golden syrup (aka light treacle) is even sweeter but it has a bitter, burnt edge to offset it a bit.nb - my brother agrees with you!


i recently discovered that lyle's sells golden syrup in bottles with a lip for pouring, & there is a maple flavoured golden syrup. if you find it, try some.


here in the us, we have  syrup that is thick and delicious called king syrup (it has a picture of a lion on the front) and i agree that thicker is better!


after reading your donut post i rushed over to north fitzroy. you must have started something because they were sold out by 11am on a wednesday! now i want one even more!


i brought home a bottle of maple syrup from the us and a bottle from canada. to me there is no comparison. the us one is alot weaker in flavour. the canadian one is well worth the money if you can afford it. i find the cottees one in australian a good cheaper alternative.


woops, that was suppose to be australia, sorry people. doh


i'm with you on the golden syrup vs maple syrup debate.  i'd always read about maple syrup as a kid and though it would be the ultimate taste experience... but as you say, it seemed rather runny and just too sweet when i finally tasted it.  i *adore* tate & lyle's golden syrup, but i also wonder if it doesn't have a lot to do with what you remember from childhood.  not a lot of maple trees in south africa, but lots of sugar cane!

i happened on your site while looking for golden syrup. i took a weekend away to the bershires (massachusetts) and found this great little country store. next to all the teas, was golden syrup. i was curious, and loved the tin, so i bought it. oh my!being born and raised in new england, i really had no idea that there was maple syrup competition out there. i have never eaten maple syrup by itself from a spoon before. i pretty much finished off a tin of golden in two weeks this way. i agree that maple syrup is too sweet (it makes my teeth hurt). but there are greatly varying qualities of maple syrup, also. i have yet to try golden on my waffles...that will have to be my next tin.

thanks for the great photos! i lived in switzerland for 4 years and i miss it very much. the food is awesome anywhere you go, anytime of year - incredible freshness. when you are in the alpine regions you can actually taste the difference in the cheeses from different altitudes (due to the different flowers and grasses the cows are eating)a truly fantastic country!!


thanks for writing such nice things about where i used to live for 26 years - up until i moved to sydney last year... you make me miss my old home again...sob...

choccie cookie bonanza


i am a bit jealous of you kitchen aid owners.  not sure if red goes faster, but it looks pretty darn funky.  :-)  i will bookmark this pb cookie recipe for when the weather cools down a little!


hi niki - happy to see another entry in your chocolate chip saga!  those peanut butter and chocolate cookies sound wonderful, i'll have to try soon.


kitchen aid? hm.... i'm out of touch with these gadgets! my poor old mixmaster will hopefully survive to mix another day.love the sound of these cookies. definitely have to give them a go.


here's how to make delicious chocolate covered strawberries. first of all ensure that the strawberries you are intending to use are dry, then allow them to be room temperature warm prior to making them. after the strawberries have been covered in chocolate, put them in your refrigerator to cool, but do not store them in the fridge. consume within 1-2 days.


just wondered if you might find 'kate flour' to be useful in your quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie. i've written about it at http://amerrierworld.wordpress.com/2007/11/18/chocolate-chip-cookies/ ... good luck!


i've loved following your chocolate chip cookie quest(i'm on one myself!)i made the rock cookies, but they came out flat and brown on the bottom. then i re read the recipe and noticed that it said to add baking powder and soda, though it didn't list soda in the list of ingredients. i am assuming that was my problem. did you add soda, and if so, how much?thanks!


wow really informative steps by steps procedure thanks for sharing. i grab some of you article to be print out so that my auntie can cook same with this.


i love anything that has chocolate and peanut butter. going to have to hook some up soon.
