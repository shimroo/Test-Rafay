the calls for respect, courtesy, helpfulness, and bravery that are implicit in our scout oath and scout law guide us to always stand up to injustice, to thoughtfully listen to one another, to be committed to becoming the best versions of ourselves, and to lift up all of our communities. the scout oath and scout law have been our guiding principles since the bsa was founded in 1910. they have prepared generations of young people to work and serve in the world. and now, the opportunity is ours to be living examples of these ideals through our actions and words with all of those we encounter each and every day.   joinscouting’s programs and outdoor adventures give young people the opportunity and freedom to explore a world beyond the boundaries of everyday life. it presents them with chances to try new things, provide service to others, build self-confidence and develop leadership skills. these experiences not only help scouts while they are young, but also stay with them throughout their adult lives, growing into exceptional men and women that respect their family, community, religion, country and themselves.so what are you waiting for?   volunteerparents can join scouting too!
