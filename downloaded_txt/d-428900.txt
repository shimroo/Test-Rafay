jazz on edgeshows and videos




 


jazz on edge 5th anniversary series/13in13
for the year-long 13in13 project, five very special shows were produced. three appearances to launch the release of fluidensity by jazz on edge regular brian groder, with pianist tonino miano, with a workshop at the ucf jazz studies program, then taking their students out to perform at taste in college park. two days later the debut at the prestigious timucua white house to a standing-room-only audience, where they persuaded timucua owner benoit glazer to join them on trumpet. jazz on edge then took over hannibal's lounge in winter park for sold-out dinner show with vocalist heather friedman. finally, nu-jazz quartet la lucha became the live band onstage for a performance of joseph reed hayes' play, solos, at the orlando shakespeare theater.





 


edward simon trio & tiptons sax quartet jazz on edge 2010 was the first central florida appearance of the tiptons sax quartet – in fact, it was the first jazz show presented at the 299-seat garden theatre, and the only time internationally renowned pianist edward simon, a resident of nearby orange city, had performed in the orlando area, with his family in the audience. the weekend started with a free "fridays on the plaza" concert with the fellsway trio on feb 5, and a free preshow performance by the lakeview middle school jazz band outside the theater on saturday.
