sign up to be a big mentor.

take the first step to inspire potential.
 many of us are wondering what we can do now to be responsible citizens, protecting the most vulnerable, while finding ways to connect with each other. now is the best time to take that first step and be there for a child in your community. every step in the process to become a big can be started online, and we will get you ready for that life-changing moment when you get to meet your little for the first time! 












 know when you’ve met your match

meet vanessa
behind every big.  behind every little. behind every single interaction, there’s a talented and dedicated team member who makes it all happen. our highly-trained and caring professionals know just what it takes to bring the right people together. they might not be in the forefront, but their efforts are reflected in every success story.

big joe
little leo









big will
little nahum









big laura
little gianna










friendship.
that’s what brought leo to us! like most 12-year-olds, leo had a love for video games, but he also knew he wanted something more than “call of duty” in his life. when he was matched with his big brother, joe, the friendship that leo was seeking began to blossom. with every interaction and new experience their lives were enriched. joe, a former music teacher, has guitar plans for leo. but for now, they’re really focused on one thing. friendship. 
become a big






personal growth.
when will, a lakeview resident, became a big, he was looking to get involved in his community. “little” did he know, the experience would change his life. he was matched with nahum, a young rubik’s cube whiz. will found nahum had goals and values like his own as a teen. he recalled, how as a teen, he sought out advice to get a more mature perspective. in returning the favor, will gained much more than community involvement. he achieved personal growth.

become a big






self-confidence
 like many young people today, gianna was struggling and didn’t quite understand why. then laura became her big sister. laura noticed that gianna’s interest was piqued in a school play. she coached gianna through stage fright and helped boost her self-esteem. a heart-warming success-story culminated when gianna starred as lucy in the school’s production of “you’re a good man, charlie brown.” and her self-confidence stole the show.
