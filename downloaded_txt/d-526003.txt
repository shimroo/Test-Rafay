our company

bristol myers squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases.










about us

our company




"who are you working for?" this is one of the first questions new employees are asked when they start at bristol myers squibb. because most of our 30,000 colleagues have a loved one either waiting for a necessary medicine or who needed one.

 centering ourselves around our “who” is a deeply personal way for each of us to connect to bms’ vision of transforming lives through science. giving patients hope and delivering life-changing medicines is what inspires our employees each day. 

 what motivates us is the power of science. our success in treating cancer, hiv and cardiovascular together with our legacy of pursuing bold science gives us confidence that bms will continue to rise to each challenge. we’re accelerating the development of new medicines with differentiated research platforms and leading technology. each of these enables us to be more productive, agile, efficient and above all, fast. 

 evolution is in our dna, and we are reinventing to lead. by leveraging scientific expertise alongside our business acumen, we’re driving progress for bms now and in the future – because success for us means success for patients in need. but we also know these solutions need to reach beyond the impact of our medicines. this means working responsibly to advance health equity around the world. 

 and we do it all with a company of engaged and talented individuals working together to define what’s possible for the future of science and the patients we serve.
