from our very first visit, right up to the big day, cabra castle was amazing, noting was too much trouble. emma and bronagh in the office were amazing to deal with and answered any questions we had. on the day itself everything ran smoothly. mary in the granary kept us calm as the nerves kicked in before the ceremony. linda our manger on the day was on hand at all times and made us so relaxed. the food was absolutely amazing, from start to finish. our guests enjoyed cheese boards and canapés on arrival, then on to an amazing 5 course dinner. the steak was out of this world. the evening chicken and chips cones were a big hit, right down to the toasties in the residents bar. we cannot fault cabra castle whatsoever. 5 star service from start to finish. we can never thank them enough!

we both cannot recommend cabra castle enough, it was one of the first venues we viewed once we got engaged and we fell in love with it instantly. the staff are all amazing and went above and beyond our expectations in the run up to the wedding day. they responded to our many questions through emails and calls in the weeks leading to the wedding and we both felt so at ease in dealing with the staff, in particular brenda, ellen, aisling and emma who answered many of our emails and calls.the wedding day itself was a dream - the food ,the service and the staff. all our guests were full of compliments for the food and the general ambience and service that we had throughout the day.we also had our wedding breakfast and day 2 celebrations in the granary - a new addition to the castle which is beautiful both inside and outside.we are looking forward to visiting in a few months again!
orla & damien - april 2024






we can’t recommend cabra castle and the staff enough. it was the first and only venue we looked at - we loved it. the staff are all so friendly. the banqueting team are fantastic, they couldn’t have been more helpful. shortly before the wedding i spoke with emma from banqueting and she had the patience of a saint going through everything for day 1 and day 2 and she even recommended a dj when i mentioned i hadn’t found one. i left emma feeling completely at ease and with everything sorted. everything with cabra castle was smooth sailing from the time we booked. everything was perfect and we had the most amazing day. venue, staff and food all 10/10!
