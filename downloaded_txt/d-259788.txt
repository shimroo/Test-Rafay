urbania magazine call for sponsors







urbania magazine call for sponsors

as part of the goal to engage readers and interact with advertisers, i have decided to have fun all year... we are having contests! to lesson the load of planning and to automate some of the features of the website, i am calling for anyone who wishes to be considered a sponsor of the winter contest by donating a prize. all you have to do is send the prize and cover letter to our address. 

as an alternative for digital products, you can email our address here and we will get back to you.

here's what we are looking for:






prizes that directly relate to literature and art.  it may be 
an e-book 
physical signed book
photograph/illustration/print
website membership
online course
dvd film
website review
consultation time
anything you provide as an expert to help authors market their book

what do you get as a sponsor?


i will promote the contest during its winter run...hard.  links to your website and your prize will be on the contest page and will expose you to new visitors. there is no fee involved to be a sponsor. only the "cost" is providing what you're known for as a prize.






a paid sponsor option is available here if interested.








 to get started as  a sponsor, send the prize with a cover letter or complete the contact form of our publisher art official media llc and tell about your idea.

 thanks for considering to be a sponsor this year. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to e-mail.  i look forward to hearing from you soon.

rip guru





guru, gifted unlimited rhymes universal died today.  i'm just as much saddened as i have questions.  with all the aggregated content, no one reported on the type of cancer he suffered from. to have a heart attack at 42 and die at 43 is not normal.

guru was one of my favorite mc's of all time. the three videos below are dedicated to him.  

"ex girl to next girl"

should african americans critique president obama?







i missed the we count! program on cspan a few weeks ago. nothing big, the critique of the black culture occurs annually with the state of the black america and other panels that "talk" about the main issues. 

in past years, the conversation was necessary because there was no talk of a black agenda and most certainly no ear in the white house. very little changed for black america.  

there has been a lot of black mayors in major cities, but no huge upward shifts in the black population. critique president obama as we may, but know that we should hold him to the standard of those that have gone before him. nothing less. nothing more. 

do you think african americans should be critical of president obama in public? leave a comment.

free download - blackface: a novel by q.b. wells  (7 days)





reading and writing is infectious. so much so, i'm giving away blackface: a novel, my novel for 7 days. register and download now here  or http://ebookreadingchallenge.eventbrite.com/


when rawsistaz decided to hold the e book reading challenge and book chats, i cringed. although rawsistaz has earned the respect of the the publishing community and provided honest, informative free reviews for african american authors, i couldn't envision a free download of my book. why?

there are enough free e-books on the net.  

furthermore, unless the work is charity, no one works for free.  and anyone who does work for free has an empty plate.  at the same time, i realize during tough economic times, some people want to purchase but don't have the ends or resources to get the book. finally, the purpose of the e book reading challenge is to promote aa e-books and usher in the new wave of publishing.  

for everyone who couldn't purchase from a local store,  download blackface on your computer or mobile device. book reviewers, readers and anyone who would like to read can download for seven days.

to download, register for free @ e book reading challenge .  i hope to talk to you next month and chat about images and characters in blackface at www.rawsistaz.com. if not, catch me at a bookstore, in the street or grab a book from my website.

note:  there are several other authors participating in the e-book reading challenge, get their books too. it's free!
