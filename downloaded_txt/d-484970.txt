here we find ourselves, in the service of mary, queen of scots in this, the year of our lord, 1562. our 19 year old monarch has just returned to us as the young widow of a french king. she travels scotland to see her lands and meet her people.
come, meet your scottish monarch and join us on our journey . . .
st. andrew’s noble order of royal scots is a non-profit educational group. we focus on education by traveling to schools and scottish festivals to bring to life the court of mary stuart, queen of scotland as it was in the year 1562.  our youth outreach program, focusing on the seventh grade, brings history to life for students studying the renaissance.  at scottish festivals and games, we typically found at the center the living history section, helping explore the rich history and heritage of scotland.  we also attend various renaissance faires and festivals throughout northern and central california.
