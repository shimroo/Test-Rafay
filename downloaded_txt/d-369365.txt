swimming pool tips
when it comes to swimming pool, we've been there, done that, now serving 129 tips in 20 categories ranging from about fitness swimming   to using swimming pool pumps.











											should i buy a smaller pool heater to save money?
									 	

size matters
unless you love the shock of cold water on your body, you'd probably like to have a pool heater. most people prefer pool water that is around 78 degrees fahrenheit. unless you live in a particularly warm climate, you won't be able to rely on the sun alone to heat your pool. in most climate zones, you'll need a pool heater to provide consistently warm water. size does matter when it comes to pool heaters. though the initial cost of a smaller heater may be less, a larger pool heater may be better on your energy budget. basically, a smaller heater may have to work much harder and longer to heat your pool than a larger version. the longer and harder your heater has to work, the more expensive you can expect your energy bills to be. ask your pool equipment dealer for information about the most efficient heater for your pool.

											how can i spend less time taking care of my pool?
									 	

automatic pool equipment
most of us seem to love automation. from automatic garage-door openers to automatic bill-paying services, we love having tasks accomplished without lifting a finger. why should it be any different when it comes to pool equipment? there are numerous devices on the market that are designed to take the work out of just about any pool-related task. you can find pool equipment that automatically measures water pressure, dispenses pool chemicals, and turns vital support systems off and on. if you want to spend more time splashing in your pool and less maintaining it, look around for these devices.

											do in-ground pool liners rip?
									 	

look for a warranty
rips and tears are not unheard of when it comes to in-ground pool liners. small tears may be repairable, but large rips can cause significant problems. many pool supply dealers sell liners that are heavily inspected for defects and packaged in heavy-duty boxes for protection. choosing to purchase from a dealer who takes care with packaging and inspection can mean the difference between receiving a quality liner and something flimsy and in poor repair. to protect yourself against defects and unhappy surprises, be sure your in-ground pool liner comes with a warranty. learn the details of the warranty before you make your purchase. your pool dealer should be happy to explain the warranty to you and even let you read it in advance. if not, move on to another dealer.

											what do i need to know about pool liner thickness?
									 	

thicker is better
when it comes to above-ground pool liners, less is not more. above-ground pool liners come in several different levels of thickness. thicker pool liners are more durable and may last longer. pool liner thickness is listed as "gauge" or "mil." both terms mean the same thing. most new above-ground pools come with 20-guage liners, but they go up to about 30-gauge. for the best pool protection and the greatest longevity, purchase the thickest liner you can afford. often, new pools are sold with plain blue liners. sure, these liners are functional, but many long for something more jazzy. take your time and browse through the wide variety of pool liners available both online and in brick-and-mortar pool stores. you'll find many attractive styles to suit your unique tastes.

											why do i need a pool cleaner?
									 	

choose the right cleaner
one of the things you'll need for your pool is a pool cleaner. you'll need to keep your pool clean to prevent the development of health hazards. a clean pool also looks better and is much more inviting. consider the type of pool you have before purchasing a pool cleaner. if you have an above ground pool, you'll find that you have many choices. on the other hand, many in-ground pools are best when used with specific cleaners. your swimming pool dealer should be able to help you to make the right decision.

											what pools safety supplies should i secure?
									 	

keep safe in your pool
you might think in terms of ladders, cleaners, and nets when considering the pool supplies you need. however, safety supplies are just as important. too many children drown in pools each year and even experienced adult swimmers are not immune to this risk. to be prepared, every pool owner should have basic pool-safety supplies on hand. your collection of life-saving pool equipment should include a long pole that is at least 12 feet long. this pole should have blunt ends and be strong, yet lightweight. you should also have a throwing rope that is equal to one and a half times the length of the pool or 50 feet. attach the rope securely to a ring buoy. the ring buoy should be at least 15 inches in diameter. alternatively, you could use a similar flotation device.
