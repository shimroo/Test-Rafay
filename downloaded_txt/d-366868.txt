every performance is surprisingly different and always entertaining, exciting and educational with the award-winning duo atwater~donnelly, who provide a unique and thrilling blend of traditional american and celtic folk music and dance, along with original songs and poetry.
the highly praised husband-wife duo blends gorgeous vocals with an astounding array of instruments including the mountain dulcimer, old-time banjo, tin whistle, guitar, mandolin, harmonica, limberjacks, feet and more.
also not to be missed are atwater~donnelly trio shows where aubrey and elwood collaborate with cathy clasper-torch on vocals, violin, cello and chinese erhu, or erin lobb mason on vocals and double bass. the atwater~donnelly band shows include all four of us. lastly, another band combination is jerimoth hill - a six-member old-time gospel band.
