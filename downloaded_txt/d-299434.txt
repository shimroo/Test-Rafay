founded by chiropractors for chiropractors
chiropractic federal credit union (cfcu) began in 1950 when a group of seven chiropractors who had been denied loans from other financial institutions decided to pool their resources. they formed a credit union to provide financial support to fellow chiropractors. today, cfcu has 2,800+ members and has granted nearly 6,800 loans totaling more than $177 million. cfcu remains committed to growing and helping the chiropractic profession.
