where ordinary people develop extraordinary faith
we are a safe and healthy place where people can grow in the knowledge of our lord and savior, jesus christ. with every member of our congregation realizing and exercising their god-given talents and gifts, all of us can mature into a loving, faith-filled family. come visit, and see what god is doing through this anointed ministry, as we advance his kingdom. we look forward to meeting you!

maximize your potential conference
god has given each of us abilities that represent our potential which leads to our divine purpose. we must identify these abilities and maximize our full potential in those areas.
maximize your potential conference was birthed to provide the resources to help you identify your purpose and to maximize your potential to fulfill that purpose. 
1 timothy 4:15 tlb
