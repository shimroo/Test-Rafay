wake board tips
when it comes to wake board, we've been there, done that, now serving 208 tips in 16 categories ranging from hyperlite wakeboards to wet suits.











											should i buy a concave or a flat wakeskate?
									 	

deciding between concave and flat wakeskates
one of the major decisions facing wakeskaters is whether they should purchase concave or flat wakeskates. a concave wakeskate is thinner in the middle with thicker portions on either end of the skate. many wakeskaters who enjoy performing tricks prefer the concave style of wakeskate because it allows for more foot contact. however, concave wakeskates are significantly more expensive than flat boards. the two types of wakeskates perform similarly on flat stretches. wakeskaters who do not perform tricks may opt for a flat board to avoid paying more for features they won't use.

											how long should wakeskates be?
									 	

choosing a wakeskate length
when it comes to choosing a wakeskate length, height is certainly a consideration but it is not the only factor to consider before making a purchase. in general, longer wakeskates are designed for taller riders but taller riders may opt for a shorter board at times, and shorter riders may sometimes prefer a longer board. besides height, skaters should also consider their ability and style. longer boards are generally considered to be more stable. for this reason, beginner riders may prefer a longer board regardless of their height. also, taller riders who enjoy performing tricks may opt for a shorter board because they are easier to maneuver while performing tricks.

											does hyperlite make a wakeskate shoe?
									 	

is there a hyperlite wakeskate shoe?
many fans of wake sports enjoy many of the products offered by hyperlite. although hyperlite manufactures and retails wakeskates, they do not manufacture a hyperlite wakeskate shoes. hyperlite fans that are looking for wakeskate shoes will have to try other retailers for their shoe needs. other manufacturers such as jet pilot have wakeskate shoes available for purpose.

											what are the best wakeskate shoes?
									 	

choosing wakeskate shoes
there are many types of wakeskate shoes available in a wide variety of price ranges. one mistake wakeskaters can make is assuming the most expensive shoes are the best. more expensive models may be constructed of higher quality of materials or have advanced features but if they don't fit correctly they will not be a worthwhile investment. less expensive shoes are definitely worthwhile if they fit the rider better than the more expensive shoes.
