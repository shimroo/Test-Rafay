welcome to the congregation for humanistic judaism 



serving the jewish community of fairfield county and surrounding areas 






what is humanistic judaism?











we seek to affirm, celebrate, and enrich jewish identity and values for secular jews by birth, association or choice, along with their families. we believe in personal responsibility to fulfill the jewish ideals of loving-kindness, good deeds, justice and tikkun olam.
