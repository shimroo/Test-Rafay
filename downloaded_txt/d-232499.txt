hawaiʻi youth achieve climate justice victory



jan 28, 2025




for many, hawaiʻi means a vacation filled with relaxation, pristine warm beaches, and an escape from the stress of our daily lives; a time to enjoy all the beauty the islands have to offer. but for those who live in hawaiʻi, there is no denying the realities of how climate change is affecting the islands and changing the environmental landscape. these changes motivated thirteen youth from across the hawaiian islands to act and hold their government accountable for actively contributing to the climate crisis. with strong constitutional and statutory provisions, as well as their desire to protect their lives and the islands that they love, the youth plaintiffs were set up for success in the courts.

how litigation advances our democracy



oct 27, 2024




you might wonder what litigation has to do with democracy.   in her brilliant book, in praise of litigation, professor alexandra lahav explains exactly that.  she persuasively argues that litigation advances important democratic values and facilitates self-government. put simply, litigation allows an ordinary person—regardless of social status—to bring a multi-national corporation to court to account for breaking the law and causing injury.  ordinary citizens, acting as jurors, in turn hold the power to weigh the evidence and determine whether the law has been broken. in this way, lahav observes, litigation both reinforces social equality and ensures that no person in our democracy is above the law.

the seventh circuit breaks with eleventh, allows service awards for named plaintiffs



sep 4, 2024




in 2020, a panel of the eleventh circuit court of appeals stunned the class action bar when it ruled in johnson v. npas solutions., llc, 975 f.3d 1244 (11th cir. 2020), that service awards for class representatives are categorically unlawful. service awards are financial payments to class representatives that have long been used to acknowledge their service to the class. in april of 2024, the seventh circuit split with the eleventh circuit when it allowed service awards.
