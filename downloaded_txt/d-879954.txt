ponderosa  fire department  achieves the public  protection class (ppc) rating of 2!
effective september 1, 2019 the ponderosa fire department (emergency services district #28) achieved the public protection class (ppc) rating of 2!  this is the insurance services office (iso) nationwide community fire protection rating system that utilizes water supplies, communications and fire department capabilities that affects most insurance policy costs, and in our case will reduce most insurance rates.  you should contact your insurance agent soonest to obtain the savings.
the ppc rating places us in the top 4% of our nation’s fire and rescue agencies.  chief fred windisch stated, “we have consistently built our response system with the citizen in mind as our first priority; this rating demonstrates reliability, professionalism and capabilities that are truly the best of the best.  our volunteers, part time and full time paid firefighters always work with the end in mind, service first.” 
the ppc system uses many components evaluating various aspects of the response system.  a “10” rating is no fire department and a 1 rating is the highest.  the community rating is just that, and our wonderful water districts are very dependable and capable, our cypress creek ems communications system is second to none, and our fire department meets or exceeds national standards in most categories. the end result is dependable emergency services because when our citizens call 9-1-1 they are having the worst day of their lives. 
the boards of directors of the ponderosa volunteer fire association and emergency services district #28 are totally focused on service provisions. these citizens of our community are dedicated to making the right decisions within the resources available.  the lists of accomplishments are many; fire stations and equipment are top notch and we have volunteers and paid personnel who are the best people that understand our mission.
 emergency responses continue to increase.  this year we will respond to over 2,300 emergencies along with our neighboring agencies in a seamless response system – you will see red trucks and green trucks at emergencies but we know you do not care what color the truck is – you want high quality quick response.
