simple plumbing tips for homeowners


in today’s financially constrained times, homeowners want to save money wherever they can. so, next time you have a minor plumbing problem in the home, instead of calling out a professional and incurring unwanted expenses, instead try fixing the issue yourself. here are some tips to help you solve small plumbing escondido difficulties that often occur:
 
stopping a dripping faucet
it may be a minor issue, but the constant dripping will start driving you mad after a while, as well as increasing your water bill if you are on a meter. don’t call a escondido plumber, try this simple fix first.

first, look at where the water is coming from. if it is coming out of the spout then you are going to need a new washer, but if it is coming from the top then a new o-ring is required. to replace the washer, turn off your water supply at the isolation valve and then put the plug in so that no small parts get washed away. take off the faucet’s lid and then unscrew the screw inside to expose the cartridge. you need to get a washer to fit this cartridge, so if necessary, feel free to take it to a hardware store where an expert can point you in the right direction of the required part. take off the existing washer, put your new one on and tighten it all back up again. that annoying drip should have stopped. if your o-ring is the problem, all the steps are the same, except instead of replacing the washer, you will need to replace the rubber ring around the cartridge.
 
unblocking a sink
everyone has at some point experienced the unpleasant situation of a blocked sink or bath. there are a few ways to handle this. firstly, you can buy a device called a “magic finger” which is basically a long flexible stick which fits into the drain to unclog it. secondly, you could use one of the commercially available drain unblockers out there. thirdly, you could save money by making a solution of vinegar and bicarbonate of soda. putting this down the drain and leaving it for half an hour before flushing with water should remove the blockage effectively.
 
unclog shower heads
if your shower head has become clogged it could be limescale blocking it up. try placing it in a jug containing a solution of water and vinegar overnight. in the morning, it should be good as new.
