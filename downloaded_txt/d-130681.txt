current initiatives

balanced living
a balanced lifestyle is about the choices people make every day regarding what they eat, drink and do. we want people to make informed decisions about the beverages they consume.


sustainable solutions
changing how business is done, in ways that sustain our planet isn't just something we say, it's what we do. we take environmental stewardship seriously.


consumer choice & freedom
some believe that food and beverage taxes will make us thinner, fitter and healthier - but there is another side to this story.
