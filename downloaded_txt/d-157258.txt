growing together



in faith.



in community.



in love.

 







 

join us for worship … online :)



we believe that worship is a creative expression of jesus' love for us and our love for him. it's an opportunity for us to step out of the busy-ness of our lives and to recharge in the presence of the god who loves us! if you’re not able to join us in person, you can watch the service right here! may god’s peace and love rest upon your spirit this day.
