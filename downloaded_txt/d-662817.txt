air qualityair quality advisories
smoke advisories are issued for large fires in or near the south coast aqmd jurisdiction and are intended to provide a summary of current/past air quality and provide predictions of future smoke impacts. even in areas far from fires or areas not covered by a smoke advisory, if you can smell smoke or see ash from a wildfire, avoid or limit outdoor activities. for information about the effects of wildfires on your health, and how to reduce exposures, please see the aqmd website wildfire smoke & ash health & safety tips page.
click here for current smoke advisorylos angeles county department of public health – health officer order prohibiting air blowers
on friday, january 10, 2025, public health declared a local health emergency in los angeles county and issued an order temporarily banning the use of air blowing devices, like leaf blowers. the recent strong winds and fires have caused hazardous air quality, increased ash, and debris, and disrupted essential health services. during the fire recovery and cleanup, air blowers are prohibited throughout the county until the health officer determines it is safe to use them without harming public health. ash is like a fine, dangerous dust that can be inhaled deep into the lungs and can cause major problems everywhere it lands. it’s not just dirt.
click here for more informationwildfire smoke and ash health safety tips
wildfire smoke can cause unhealthy air quality in areas many miles away from the fire. smoke conditions change quickly, so check your air quality using the south coast aqmd app or on the aqmd interactive map. older adults, young children, pregnant women, and people with heart diseases or lung diseases (such as asthma) may be especially sensitive to health risks from wildfire smoke.
if you smell smoke, see smoke near ground level, or see ash due to a wildfire, here are ways to limit your exposure:

remain indoors with windows and doors closed or seek alternate shelter.
avoid vigorous physical activity.
run your air conditioner if you have one and make sure it has a clean filter. close the fresh air intake if your air conditioner has the option so that it is recirculating the indoor air to prevent bringing additional smoke inside. a higher efficiency filter (i.e. higher merv rating) will filter out more smoke particles than a low efficiency one.
create a space in your home with filtered air, by using a portable high-efficiency or hepa air cleaner while keeping doors and windows closed. this can be a room where you spend a lot of time, such as a bedroom. more information about air filters and air cleaners can be found here: fact sheet on indoor air filtration.
if you can stay cool without them, avoid using a whole-house fan or a swamp cooler with an outside air intake.
avoid using indoor or outdoor wood-burning appliances, including fireplaces. avoid combustion sources inside the home such as candles and incense that could further degrade indoor air quality.
if you must be outdoors in smoky conditions, keep it brief, and use a disposable respirator (n-95 or p-100). these respirators can offer some protection from smoke particles if they are worn properly and have a tight fit. do not rely on surgical masks or cloth masks for protection. information about using respirators to protect from wildfire smoke or ash can be found here: fact sheet on respirators
commercial building managers should follow their smoke readiness plan. guidance on developing a plan can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/emergencies-iaq/wildfires-and-indoor-air-quality-schools-and-commercial-buildings.
