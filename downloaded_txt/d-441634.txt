 award-winning daylilies  

from award-winning hybridizers!
 you are invited to own and enjoy a dazzling array of fantastic, modern daylilies straight from the verdant garden of daylily world in lawrenceburg, kentucky. this is our seventh decade of offering award-winning daylilies. make a date to visit the blue grass and enjoy seeing them in bloom from early to mid-june and july.


   

 how our business bloomed!
        ed kirchhoff began daylily world during the mid-sixties as a third-generation nurseryman in sanford, florida. he learned how to hybridize gladiolus from his grandfather in the 1920’s.     
      david kirchhoff and his partner, mort morss, came to daylily world, sharing the hobby and fondness for all things daylilies in the early 1970’s. soon their journey with daylilies had begun.
     maintaining a daylily garden of this size requires hundreds of hours of care. david is thankful for the dedication of our two workers, elias raymundo montes and patricia perez. elias has been responsible for growing the garden these past fourteen years and is an integral part of daylily world.
