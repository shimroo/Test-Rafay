who
                  am i?

a
                  recording artist of four solo musical cds, 45
                  meditation and teaching cds, an energy healer and
                  channeler. i receive information for individuals in
                  healing sessions, and written transmissions from
                  archangel michael, mary and thoth which i share in
                  my newslettters and articles. as a singer of
                  healing music i work with the hathors and
                  hildegard.


                  
                  what i do...

private
                  healing sessions
i
                  offer session both in-person and by phone. sessions
                  include both information and energy healing around
                  your current issues, and are recorded for you. it
                  can be extremely effective on chronic and deeply
                  rooted issues

chronic issues, including those around trauma,
                  sexuality, and power are up for everyone. these
                  wounds are the source of our greatest power when we
                  let our own healing and compassion move out through
                  them. this is why i offer individual sessions.

healing
                  concerts and
                  sound healing workshops
my
                  healing meditation concerts include
                  chants
                  by hildegard von
                  bingen
                  and songs
                  from spirit.
                  i use tibetan singing bowls and harmonic toning to
                  accompany harmonize the medieval chants. see my
                  itinerary
                  to find out when i'll be in your area, or go to my
                  booking

supports
                           natural healing
                           from the inside out
i
                           have used this myself for over three years
                           and recommend it. 
















i believe that singing, chanting,
                           toning, prayer and healing are all one and
                           the same. we are creative beings,
                           responsible for our bodies, our emotions,
                           our thoughts and minds. what we give our
                           attention to we give our energy to. by
                           consciously and intentionally using sound
                           we discover ourselves as co-creators.








all the arts
                           serving human desires and needs
                           are derived from the breath that god
                           sent into the human body
