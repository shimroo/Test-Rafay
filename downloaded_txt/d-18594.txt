what else is there to know about geocaching?


geocaches are rated according to a scale that measures their difficulty to find and terrain where the cache is located or the terrain you need to traverse to get to the geocache site.
finding a difficulty 1 geocache should take only a few moments, a difficulty 2 or 3 may take you 15 minutes to an hour searching for the geocache itself whereas a difficulty 5 may takes some weeks of puzzle solving.
a terrain 1 geocache should be able to be found by someone in a wheelchair or crutches whereas a terrrain 5 may require abseiling, tree climbing or other specialised skills like diving.
geocaches also have a size ranging from nano through to large and all sizes in between.
finding a nano geocache which can be smaller than your fingernail can be a significant challenge, a small is around 200ml and may take a little while to think through where it may be hidden whereas finding a large which is generally 20 litres or larger shouldn't be too troublesome at all.
when searching for your first few geocaches, choose a traditional cache type where the difficulty is low, the terrain is low and the size is small or larger.
you should also check the latest logs from the geocache page itself to make sure that there are no unattended issues with the geocache and that it hasn't recently been reported as missing.
be environmentally concious when searching for a geocache. you may be searching in some creatures home. do not rip or shred the area. be gentle and kind to the environment. if you can't find the geocache don't take it out on the rocks, plants, trees or creatures that may be living nearby.

						the method of loading coordinates onto your gps will vary depending on the type of device you have.
input coordinates manually
						if your device does not connect directly to the computer, you will need to enter coordinates manually. this process will be different for each device. check your device's manual for instructions.
