humans are destroying a beautiful, living resource. time is running out for the biodiversity of life that inhabits our planet and for our quality of life. we are dependent on the health of our planet and if it continues to decline, as it has done over the past century, then human health and wellbeing will decline as well. the window of opportunity for us to organise globally to create a sustainable society is open - but it is closing. the time to act is now!


the information for action website is a powerful tool for internet activism or cyber activism. we invite you to make full use of all our resources to lobby politicians and business leaders. you can make a difference for the environmental issues you are concerned about. choose from any of the following subjects: air pollution, antibiotics, conservation of biodiversity and habitats, greenhouse gasses and climate change, chemicals and human health, consumption, corporate responsibility,  eco-taxation, fishing, food, conserving specific forests (amazon, congo, png, russia and australia) and forests in general, genetic engineering, globalisation, land pollution, natural resources, nuclear energy, oceans, oil spills, ozone, pesticides, population growth, poverty, rainforest, roads and transport in  general, salinity, seagrass meadows, soil erosion, solar power, sustainability and development, trade, urbanisation, waste management, water pollution, wetlands, wind power, world debt, and war and weapons.
