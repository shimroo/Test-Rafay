 we are a group of the uk's largest and most dedicated collectors. we are always seeking to purchase only quality items of victorian  and modern taxidermy.  the site was launched august 2004 and is the best resource on the internet for the history of british taxidermy, given the number of taxidermists represented. no other internet site has the same level of detail and content. not a boast just a simple fact.







now there are hutchings collectors and there are hutchings collectors.  this chap is perhaps the largest. these images are just a sample of what is in the collection. most people do not have 40 cases by hutchings let alone 44 foxes by one person. also an additional 33 cases of foxes by other makers, so nearly 100 in total. add that to the additional 1200 other quality cases and this is quiet a collection. that said we are always interested in buying more of the same. just click on the dragon below to see more images.

contained within this site are over 7225 individual images of victorian and modern taxidermy and taxidermy related material, located on some
 192 individual pages. the most comprehensive website dedicated to taxidermy.  we will buy everything of quality you have for sale, no exceptions. to coin a phrase made recently, we collect dead people's dead things. we have,as the uk's largest resource, extensive / comprehensive knowledge of this subject which enables us ensure that the prices offered are both fair and accurate. our price database of some 1700 plus quality "named" cases sold privately and at auction over the last 7 years ensures that our offers to purchase or to simply value are very realistic and reflect the current market trends. now it has been an interesting 16 months or so, so apologies for not updating this site as much as normal.  still lots to report both now and in the future. we got a little distracted with the museums association, still that discussion will be set to continue and continue, as the majority of people we engaged with were disgusted at the outcome.  all the best (wink). 
just updated the taxidermy value page on the site.  despite bonkers prices being paid for junk, the average price only rose by 27.00 per case to £478.00.  word of advice when bidding on the phone, the cases look much better in the photos!!!!!!!.   have a look.
update on this development (26/6/2014).  we mentioned dr flemming as being a member of the ethics board, when he is in fact the chairman of the ma's ethics committee.  dr david fleming obe, director of national museums liverpool, remember him???. he's the one who lost out on the echalaz collection going to to a shed in essex. a collection of regional importance to liverpool and national museums liverpool with millions of visitors a year.  we can only assume is a good thing for the unlikely future divestments of public property, given his recent experience with the echalaz collection going to a shed in essex..  still no sign of the echalaz  and pennington collections, nearly 2 years on since they were acquired in a flawed manner (ma's words not mine in report dated spetember 2012 that looked into the disposal methodology).  petition pat morris the chairman of that club for an answer.  he can be found at most guild of taxidermy meetings, he might be able to shed some light on proceedings, maybe not. one thing is for sure, giving away of public property is unlikely to ever happen again.  auction yes, money returned to the public, yes.  giving it away i don't think so.

 echalaz collection
email dated 1/8/2014

dear........,

thank you for your email below. i am instructed to advise you that the agreement between sefton  council and  bhts trust has been terminated and the collections have  been accessioned by the council as part of its museum collection. i trust that this resolves your enquiry.

yours sincerely,

peter cowley, 

principal lawyer,

sefton mbc. 

personal comment to the above factual statement.  this means that the collections have already been returned to sefton council, we suspect in july 2014. once we have finished our discussions with the museums association and the arts council we shall publish everything on a separate page.  this is publicly available information, as clearly as memnbers of the public we have a legal right to know, hey feel free to ask around.  the trust document (terminated one) also made interesting reading.  this, it would seem concludes, this vile, disgusting undertaking.  i am sure if you ask, pat morris may be able to provide an explanation as he is the chairman of the trust. we found it morally offensive that during job cuts by sefton council and shortfalls in the local authorities budget, they found time to negociate, with kendal museum and bhts trust to give away public property to the bhts trust. all this to the detriment of national museums liverpool who were not notified during that process and only found out when the public property was planned to be given away.  i don't think so.  hence the sustained effort to get these items returned.  apparently they were always destined for public display, really?.  once again if you require an explanation as to morally offensive undertaking, i am assuming the chairman of the trust pat morris should have an answer for you.

cut and paste the link above.  dr flemming (remember him??, also comments)  i'd say there was no chance of any more "goodies" coming out of the public sector.  it is interesting to note that northampton sold their taxidermy collection also and they feature in this editorial also.

20lb 3oz common carp caught by mr john andrews on 6th september 1916 from the cheshunt resevior.  this was one of the last fish that mr cooper took receipt of before his death that same year.  this fish was therefore subsequently set up by his son.

stunning common carp in a wrap around case by john cooper, dated 1898.

bronze bream, 9lbs 8oz dated 1959.  superb and not for sale.  for all you john cooper fans out there, this fish formed part of a much larger collection recently acquired from the swan inn hotel, radstock, oxfordshire.  all of the fish present in this collection were caught in the canalised element of a tributary of the river thames and all mounted by griggs.  they were in the sole ownership of the hotel for over 50 years until their resent divestment to us.

bronze bream, 9lbs dated 1957.  superb fish.  we were offered two 9lb bream in less than one month, similar sizes and clearly by the same taxidermist.

bronze bream, 9lbs dated 1957.  superb fish.  we were offered two 9lb bream in less than one month, similar sizes and clearly by the same taxidermist. mr fullerton caught and owned the fish until his death.  he lived in east london and therefore most likely knew griggs.

pike by wf homer. whilst not by john cooper it is a good example of two different makers using clearly different styles in their approach.  homer an almost unreadable text and colours which no way resemble a fish in life and cooper frankly the complete opposite.  perhaps the only interesting fact about this fish is that mr maynard produced wine gums. compared with the work of cooper and or griggs this is rather ugly.

voodoo salon by errol fully. this book is a visual stroll through great examples of the craft  both historical and contemporary  with a commentary throwing light on its aims and intentions. work commissioned by the worlds great museums is featured;  so too are pieces ordered by private collectors including familiar names from the  past. charles dickens, for instance, grieving at the death of his pet raven, paid a taxidermist to preserve its outward form. 

bateleur eagle (terathopius ecaudatus) by rowland ward from the captain vivian hewitt collection.  recently acquired.  captain hewitt was also an auk collector eventually given the label of the worlds greatest private great auk collector. at an auction in 1934 he paid £7,245 for two auk eggs and two skins, which approximates to about £600,000 today in real terms. 

interesting piece of social history.  the marriage certificate of william maccleay of inverness dated 10th july 1895. you can see both william and his father are mentioned as bird stuffers.

moorhen by yours truly.  i put this image up to show the work in various stages.  some taxidermists prefer to bind the feathers using cotton, but this restricts your ability to groom the specimen as it dries.  once dried the pins, wire, and card are removed. drying can take around 3-7-10 days depending on the specimen.  then the specimen requires painting to put back those colours that fade when the animal died. it is also interesting to note that with the exception of mick gadd and carl church, all the other "taxidermy bookie wookies" are written by those who do not undertake taxidermy.  strange really to profess about a subject you haven't done. 

english partridge by yours truly.

english partridge by tony armitstead, perhaps the finest taxidermist in the north east.

memories of being taught by fred ashton 1906-1976

i was born in norwich in 1949, lived in north norfolk and went to gresham's
school, holt from 1960 to 1967.  i was an extremely keen naturalist and
ornithologist, even to the point of preparing skins and lab specimens and
was encouraged in this by the  well known east anglian naturalist ,painter
and photographer dick bagnall oakeley (also a teacher at greshams school)
.dick  got to hear of our 'antics'  and asked us(there were three or four of
us) if we would like to learn taxidermy from a professional.  somehow (i
expect he had wide contacts in this field) he arranged for fred ashton (this
would be around  1964) to come to the school  every  sunday after chapel for
taxidermy training sessions for about three months ( i expect dick paid him
a fee).

the first sunday fred arrived we could not believe what we were seeing. he
arrived on a motor bike and sidecar, the latter filled with all his
equipment , and he was wearing an old army great coat and tight leather
pilot's flying helmet with goggles - he was soaked to the skin (he had come
25 miles from his home in norwich).  over the next 10 -12 weeks he proved to
be probably the most, eccentric person i've ever met.  we went through all
the preliminaries in the first lesson and i remember he was meticulous in
recording species, sex , measurements, colours , and dates. we started with
skinning practices being careful to remove all flesh and preserving with
borax powder . we did birds ( he brought us some moorhens as our first
subjects - he kept the bodies and said he would eat them - we thought he was
pulling our legs) making bodies from wood wool  and packing muscle masses
with plumbers tow. we did mammals ( i remember he did a smelly stoat !) with
tow on a wire frame and we did fish with a wire through the middle and
packed with sawdust.  he mounted most of his specimens  on a simple perch or
boards  writing all the details of specimen in pencil underneath. i remember
he didn't tell us a lot about  background scenery etc.etc., but we got
artificial eyes from watkins and doncaster.

 

two of us stuck the full course and fred was always reliable even when some
started to fall away. i made lots of notes at the time and have done several
specimens over the years , but you really need a lifetime of practice and
observation to be really good.  i feel privileged to have been taught by a
practitioner who was one of the last of the thomas gunn school . i was
grateful to fred  and enjoyed his lessons all those years ago. i never saw
him again -   i  became a veterinary surgeon !!.

kendal museum
apparently an extreamly well attended event with some 130 participants, some "club" members were in the audience toooooo.  carl church exhibits were thoroughly enjoyed and the events, including the auction of specific items and prizes was a complete success.  this could potenitally be a blueprint for other museums around the country to follow this example of raising awareness.  the dodo theme seems to be a winning formula.  well done mr church for your efforts in promoting the dodo exhibit.
.


kendal museum
news: kendal museum with the assistence of mr carl church are creating the dodo exhibition.  also showcasing his work is luke williams of staffordshire skeletons.  this exhibition is to run from july 4th until october 2013. erroll fuller, a leading authority on british historical taxidermy and the life of the dodo and sir david attenborough have supported this undertaking.  well done mr sailor for his contribution to the events, namely his book documenting the echalaz collection and how it came to be donated to the people of liverpool. 

dodo and skeleton on display at kendal museum.



http://www.kendalmuseum.org.uk/what's_on_130502_great_dodo_exhibition.php

apparently well worth a visit. professor carl g jones mbe will open the event and hold a talk on the mauritian wildlife foundation, the importance of the dodo in history and recent projects he has worked on to save endangered species. what is evident is the absence of..............??? certain people.  perhaps the issues of the last year may have had an impact. anyway, moving on.


no need to add any further comment to that stated above.  we understand that proffessor pat morris (retired -holloway) is the chairman of the trust mentioned.

source of the quote above was an academic paper produced by dr j freedman for natsca.  the natural sciences collections association (natsca) is the uk's organisation for representing natural science collections and associated museum staff, and for communicating all relevant developments and news pertaining to that purpose.

they exist to promote natural sciences collections and their use and care, and our aims include acting as an advocate, providing training, and promoting best practice within the network of their colleagues and affiliated institutions.


http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/freedman_undertaking_review_nathistcoll_natscanews.pdf

interestingly dr freedman was not involved in any of the discussions that took place in 2011-12.  it is also worthwhile remebering that although liverpool museum were consulted (they were the only other museum involved seeking to acquire), they were only made aware of the horrendous / digusting developments after members of the public and the press informed them at the 11th hour when most of the decisions had already been made.  the ma did not inform liverpool of the disposal at the time of the decisions being made by sefton council, so mr freedman is right to observe what he has in his report. 
if however you wish to complain about public property being given away from or by museums currently and in the future, please then write to the following people.
mr mark taylor is a director of the museums association
mr alan davey is the chief executive officer of the arts coucil.  

both can be contact by email and both are aware of current views and developments. 
disgusting / vile undertakings.  how can national museums liverpool with over 2million visitors per year, not be the recipients of a publicly owned collection (echalaz collection) of regional importance.  it lost out to a shed (village of rayne in essex) that is not accessible by the general public.  seem logical to you????.  also how can the museums association, of which national museums liverpool being a board member, think is was "a good idea" to allow this to happen.  questions clearly are still being asked (2 million visitors verses a shed in essex!!!!), as this vile issue has not gone away so to speak, with more and more objecting to this less than transparent vile undertaking."
controversial developments with the public property of museums being given away (valuable taxidermy by famous naturalists), despite austere economic times and job losses in the public sector. 

following on from the disposal of the echalaz collection there is now an official enquiry by the arts council and a  review is ongoing. there is also and additional investigation by the ethics committee of the museums assocaition to look into whether the disposal of the collections was undertaken in the appropriate fashion.  the arts council decision is pending and the museums association reports back in september 2012 when it has completed it's investigation into why the rules and regulations were not followed. this followed objections from several musuems around the country directly, natural history curators around the uk, the media and concerned members of the general public as to the manner of the disposal.  please see dedicated page to this issue as detailed below or google this subject and you can read all about it from the information in the public domain already specific to this issue.  a group of dedicated objectors are now awaiting the decision of the ma and arts council.  ma's position will be published in september 2012.  national museums liverpool wanted the collections but were only informed after the decision was made to move the collections from public ownership.  sadly national museums liverpool were not informed with sufficient time to do anything meaningful to retain these collections for the people of liverpool.  they were owned by the people of liverpool and therefore public property prior to merely being given away and relocated to essex, where they have no historical importance or relevance and most likely will never been seen again.  potentially, one or two badly restored cases perhaps.

new taxidermy book by alexis turner, to be launched in may this year. having spoken to alexis today there has been a fantastic response to this punblication even prior to launch.  how many books can be written on this subject??????.  it appears still more to come.  this book has got the balance right being image rich (over 300 images to peruse) and of superb quality which is reflected in some 30,000 copies already been reserved.  another example of how to do a publication properly. add that to the 57,000 sold by errol fuller and well................


not strictly taxidermy but, worthy of note from authorities in this field.  errol fuller and sir david attenborough.  from the moment europeans were introduced to the birds of paradise in the early sixteenth century, their unique beauty was recognized and commemorated in the first name that they were given - birds so beautiful they must be from paradise. originally they were thought not to have legs and therefore never to land.  it is also refreshing to read a well research and beautifully presented piece of work. available on-line and also from quality bookstores. errol fuller, perhaps the uk's authority on victorian natural history and victorian taxidermy,  has a global reputation for his books on extinction and extinct species, as well as an artist and collector of natural history material. he is passionate about the birds of paradise.  also in terms of co-authour it doesn't get better than mr attenborough does it?. certainly a cut above the rest.


this case of kestrel by peter spicer made £1600 at auction this week, further enforcing the belief that prices continue to fall. 

interesting document detailing the death of john duncan aged 71.

case drawings by fm ogilvie from his personal collection of british birds.  here is a red necked grebe. this images shows a subtle use of colour also.  for a more comprehensive review of his drawings then have a look at the page dedicated to this.  we have all the case drawings, notes and correspondence, but suggest that you visit the museum where the collection is housed.
this has to be perhaps the finest arctic fox display we have seen. less is indeed more.
polecats by h brazenor of stockport.  used to think this was a fake, despite paying a hugue sum for it.  you know the expression, too good to be true???.  limited fading of the mustelids by example?.  that said until reported by morris in latest book (2010) that said person actually took breath.  case is rather delightful and pleased to confirm that mr brazenore did exist by morris.  case not for sale so "cost" is pretty irrelevant. never have been able to take a decent image of it.
following a theme of extinction at the moment, here is a male labrador duck. few examples of these ducks exist.  good example of a species eaten into extinction.

      wanted. please respond via this on-line form here 
      with a description of what you have for sale.

european polecat with prey by james hutchings.

we can be funny / obtuse toooooooo. this sums it up nicely for us.

victorian dabchick by g w quatremain of malvern.

victorian european curlew and chick, by hodder "presever of birds and animals" of north street clapham, london and not for sale. very much in the style of james hutchings, but by a victorian london taxidermist. 


a pair of skylarks with 4 chicks preserved by pratt of 
      brighton. this taxidermists features prominently in the booth museum. the 
      above case is the best pratt of brighton case i have ever seen in terms of 
      attention to detail and the overall balance within what is a compact case. 
      pratt tended to produce large cases, which sometimes made the birds look a 
      little lost.

this "website" has consulted with and has been 
      critically reviewed by european regulatory authorities / defra, monitoring 
      the sale of taxidermy and representatives of the uk guild of taxidermists 
      to ensure that it complies with current guidance / licencing on the 
      ownership and display of taxidermy specimens here in the uk. you are more 
      than welcome to check, the link(s) to defra and the guild's legal expert 
      are located half way up this page and within the site in general. in so far as is both reasonable and practical, we understand that all the modern items of taxidermy shown on this site were are informed by their owners to have the appropriate licences and documentation. sooooooo no need to go running as we are regular contact.  perhaps it is you that should be worried?.
with reference to "modern" examples, those produced after 1947, 
      we are interested in purchasing these also, but must have relevant and 
      appropriate defra and cites licences, when appropriate. 
      cases without such information shall be declined. we suggest you make your 
      own investigations in this area to avoid confusion. further information can be obtained at www.ukcites.gov.uk, www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/index.htm and www.eu-wildlifetrade.org
 copyright   
  all image use or reproduction by any means from this site is expressly forbidden.  subsequently, the british historical taxidermy society (bhts), who incidentally pride themselves on their 'integrity' [sic], started taking images from this site and watermarking them as their own. maybe not the best example on internet etiquette. because of this poor behaviour, from now on all images on this site are copyright of the people who provided them un-water nmarked and can only be used with their express permission in their original form.
