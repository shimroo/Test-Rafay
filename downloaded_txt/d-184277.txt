            experts give up hope for 157 false killer whales stranded on a beach in australia's tasmania state

marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on australia’s island state of tasmania. experts including veterinarians were at the scene on wednesday near arthur river on tasmania’s northwest coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on tuesday afternoon. rescue officials said efforts to refloat two whales failed because of ocean conditions with the animals continuously restranding. a marine biologist said the survivors would be euthanized. officials said there were 136 survivors on wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours. it was the first pod of false killer whales to become stranded in tasmania since 1974.

police in indian-controlled kashmir have raided bookstores and seized 668 books linked to a major islamic organization in the disputed region, where strict controls on the press have escalated in recent years. the raids began on friday in srinagar, the region’s main city. police said in a post on x that they acted “based on credible intelligence regarding the clandestine sale and distribution of literature promoting the ideology of a banned organization.” according to booksellers, the seized books were mostly published by new delhi-based markazi maktaba islami publishers, which is affiliated with the indian branch of one of the largest islamic and political organizations in the indian subcontinent, jamaat-e-islami hind.

            the netherlands has a record crop of new millers to keep the windmill sails spinning


2 hrs ago


the age-old craft of using windmills to to drain lowlands, saw lumber or grind grain is enjoying a renaissance in the netherlands, a nation famous for the windmills dotting its landscape. a record crop of 110 people recently qualified as millers. it takes two to three years to complete training as a miller, most of it hands-on experience at windmills, followed by an exam. most graduates become volunteers at one of the netherlands' 1,200 windmills, which need to keep turning to prevent them falling into disrepair. despite more modern technology such as electric pumping stations, many of the mills are still in use and lend a helping hand shifting water at times of extreme rainfall.

            israel's west bank crackdown triggers a wave of displacement unseen in decades


2 hrs ago


tens of thousands of palestinians have fled home following recent israeli military operations across the northern west bank. they have traveled by car and on foot, through muddy olive groves and snipers’ sight lines, in the occupied territory's largest displacement since the 1967 mideast war. after announcing a widespread crackdown against west bank militants on jan. 21, israeli forces descended on the city of jenin, as they have dozens of times since hamas’ oct. 7, 2023, attack on israel. soldiers then pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby towns, scattering families and stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over israel’s creation. during that war, 700,000 palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what palestinians call the nakba, or “catastrophe.”
