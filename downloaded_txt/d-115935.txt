myth of  wrought iron crafts

                            there is a common myth that wrought iron is indestructible and will never rust or corrode. however, this is not true as wrought iron is prone to rust and corrosion if not properly maintained.
                        







                            "the term "wrought iron" is often misused to describe other metals and alloys that have appearances."
                        





                            "modern "wrought iron" products are often made of mild steel, which is less expensive."
                        





                            "many antique wrought iron pieces are actually made of cast iron or steel, not true wrought iron."
                        





                           " wrought iron does not rust quickly or easily, and is not a "rust magnet" as some people believe."
                        







                            "wrought iron is not bittle or fragile, but is actually a very strong and durable material etc."
                        





                            "the production of true wrought iron is a complex and labor-intensive process that is rarely."
                        





                            wrought iron was not commonly used for armor or weapons in the middle ages, as it was too soft.
                        





                            wrought iron is not a type of steel, but a distinct material with its own unique properties.
