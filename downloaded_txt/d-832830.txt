we are st. stephen evangelical lutheran church
and elementary school.
we believe that jesus lived a perfect life for us and died on the cross to pay for our sins. he rose from the dead, which means god has forgiven all sins through jesus and whoever believes in jesus has eternal life.




			 


for god so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish,
but have eternal life. the one who believes in him is not condemned,
but the one who does not believe is condemned already,
because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten son of god. 
-john 3:16,18 (ehv)
