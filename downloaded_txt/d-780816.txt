quote to inspire:
"creativity is seeing what others see and thinking what no one else ever thought." -- albert einstein.
                                                


welcome february! 
this month, our focus is on exploring the originality and ingenuity of the human mind and spirit. what does it mean to be creative? how can we find our authentic voices amidst the constant distractions of daily life? our songwriting instructors, coaches, and pitch guests are here to support you on your creative journey. if you want to breathe some new life into your songs, find a new cowriter! will a creative connection strike you like cupid's arrow in the special event pitch cowriting-cupid playlist challenge? price update: to help offset rising operating costs while keeping membership fees unchanged, we will be increasing the 'optional/extra' pitching fees by 2 credits, effective march 6, 2025.

are you seeking the perfect connection?
valentine's season isn't just about romance; it's also the perfect time to find a creative (not romantic!) partner. a lennon to your mccartney. join the co-writing cupid challenge and connect with your ideal collaborator. find details in the pitching area.      

creating and pitching ai-generated songs 
the fascinating topic of how to respond to the rapid rise of ai in music creation is an ongoing discussion. new information and guidelines are emerging. stay tuned for updates on this topic. in case you missed it: this article provides everything songu members need to know about using ai in their songwriting and answers the question, can i pitch ai-generated songs at songu.com?

general registration reminders:
our mentors and pitch guests are available for private sessions by appointment only. you may have two active live songwriting feedback courses (fdbk) at once, but you can add a third if there is still an open spot 24 hours before the class starts. keep an eye on the live songwriting course schedule in case someone cancels during the week, and a seat opens up. find your favorite coach for song evaluations in the activity area. new to songu? welcome! check out the faq quick start guide for an overview of how to begin.

welcome international members! we've got live courses that fit your schedule
when selecting live courses, please consider those that are gmt-friendly, scheduled at 1 pm et during the week and between noon and 3pm et on saturdays. sign up on the live courses page.

(#2416)   pitch for licensing agent. alternative.   feel good songs for ads + promos.  a street pitch guest is seeking songs for sync licensing....


m g - "all you again"

pitch #2416


feel good songs for ads + promos.  a street pitch guest is seeking songs for sync licensing. please read the entire brief before submitting and pitch it appropriately. please do not submit ai-generated material.

seeking: the 'holy grail' of sync -- the 'feel good' song! musically, upbeat, mid to up-tempo, great energy, fun, danceable, happy and universal. no ballads. it must have a beat. think the hit of the summer or tiktok. male or female vocals ok. clean lyrics only. 

lyrical themes: having a great day, life is good, freedom, possibilities, feeling happy, being together, good times, being confident. no stomp or swagger. no straight-up love songs.  

genres: contemporary pop, soul, r&b, funk, hip hop, alternative, dance, pop/rock, indie rock (nothing hard or heavy).   

references: "happy place" oh hust!, "something good" ellen once again, "i just wanna shine" fitz and the tantrums, "show you my world, upstate, sam ryder  "put a light on me", "life's what you make it" graham colton, "sunroof" nicky youre,  "aok" tai verdes, "big energy" latto

songwriters, important: songs submitted have to be cleared for sync licensing as per the following guidelines (no exceptions): 
- you must own both your master (recordings) and 100% of your synchronization (publishing). if you do not...
- then, all master owners, co-writer(s) or co-publisher(s), must sign our licensing agreement as well. no ai-generated material accepted.
- songs must be cleared: meaning if you have paid musicians and/or singers including background vocalists, you must have a signed 'work for hire' or release form for each person involved in making your recording so that they have no further claim to the song. please note that the producer who produced your recording should be able to help you acquire a work-for-hire agreement or release; however, in many cases, there may be a fee involved, particularly if the recording was purchased as a demo. no writers signed with major publishing companies with major administration deals.  
- submissions must be master/broadcast quality recordings. if we express interest, you will need to supply us with a mastered copy of both the song and an instrumental track.

pitch follow-up: if this guest expresses interest in your song you will be asked to sign an agreement for this project only (non-exclusive); with a 50%/50% split for both the master/sync licenses. will not take publishing of the song so the publisher/writers will get all the performance income. if there is no upfront licensing fee, the 'guest' will take 50% of the publishing income for this placement only. the 'guest' will not take ownership of the copyright.
