                    great exuma, bahamas

warning: getting to know great exuma, bahamas
                    may make other places that you have visited seem lame.
                


                    there are many beautiful places on earth. you can probably think of a few wonderful
                    locations that you have already visited that make you wish you were there all the
                    time. if you close your eyes, you can probably picture yourself in one of those
                    places right now…

                    are you imaging a place with perfect weather—soft breezes and a warm, non-humid
                    temperature? are you picturing a spot that is not a tourist trap—no high-rise
                    hotels, not over-developed? is the water an unbelievable, clear aqua-marine color
                    that leaves you staring at the horizon. does your ideal spot have endless nooks
                    and cays to explore—you feel like you could never run out of things to see
                    and do there?
                

exuma is part of the chain of cays and
                    islands that form the bahamas. these islands stretch lazily across the tropic of
                    cancer about 300 miles southeast of the coastal united states. great exuma, the
                    largest of the exuma islands is home to georgetown,
                    a charming caribbean city that you must visit. there are flights
                    to the georgetown airport from nassau and miami. see georgetown
                        map.
                

                    imagine that you could not only be a tourist in such a place… you could become
                    one of the locals and yet, still be surrounded by people you know and love. it is
                    possible! it is called great exuma and it is in the bahamas. according to the washington
                    post, great exuma is one of the “10 most desirable international locations”.

                    click here to read about some great exuma resorts
                    where you can rent a villa, popular hotels, choose a fractional
                    ownership or build your own villa on an exclusive property. or, for rentals, choose
                    from a list of private bahamas vacation rentals at 
                        findrentals.com with many options in great exuma. you can also find 
                            all inclusive vacation packages at 
                                sandals.com to save on your major travel expenses. check availability for vacation rentals at vrbo for your travel dates.

so, let’s say the washington post is not enough of a recommendation
                    for you… you are the type of person who is not willing to take some reporter’s
                    word for it… that is understandable! you need to know more about this place.

                    if you are like me, you want to know behind-the-scenes information. you like to
                    know about a place before you go.
                

                    just south of great exuma lies the island of little exuma,
                    which measures a modest six miles and is home to some of the most lush vegetation
                    in the area. read more about it.
