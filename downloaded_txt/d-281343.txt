kansas
marion county300 acres
300 acres of prime hunting in marion county, ks. just a short drive north of marion!

just a few miles from marion county, ks, this 300-acre property is ideal for a trophy hunter. with abundant crop ground, it naturally attracts local wildlife, including whitetail deer and turkeys. whether you're an experienced hunter or just getting started, this land offers a prime opportunity to tag a trophy buck. on a recent visit, i spotted several deer within 80 yardsone of which i estimate to be a solid 170-inch, 10-point buck!

the eastern portion of the property features approximately 94 acres of gently rolling hills, overgrown hedges, and cedar thicketsproviding year-round cover and habitat for deer. the diverse landscape offers an unique and exciting hunting experience.

on the southern end, a secluded field is surrounded by a deep waterway lined with mature trees and thick grass, creating an ideal travel corridor for wildlife. the combination of natural features allows hunters to take advantage of multiple vantage points and wind conditions. marion county is known for its rich hunting traditions, and this property is no exception. 

access is convenient via well-maintained roads on the west side, though a little different story on the eastern road. this dirt road will be closed when wet so use discretion and save yourself a long walk if you get stuck. 

with easy access to marions lodging, dining, and other amenities, you wont have to rough it too much on your hunting trips. 

additionally, future clearing is planned for the eastern pasture, and the farm tenant lives nearby for added convenience.

kansas
decatur county843 acres
western kansas deer hunting at its finest in unit 1!!

the majority of this property sits on over 500 acres of rolling terrain.  it is a great mixture of pasture, agriculture, and timbered areas.  the timbered areas border a lot of the agriculture fields.  these fields were in corn this past year and this was plenty of activity along these edges.
the ag fields will be a rotation of row crops.  
the pasture elevates up around the ag fields and gives some great views of the whole property.  

great places to glass the area and set up for some nice rifle hunts.  the pastures have a lot of yucca in them providing some great cover for bedding bucks.  the yuccas are over waste high in some areas!!  there are also some ponds in the pastures for a water source.

the pasture also has some great ravines running through it.  these ravines have plenty of trees for cover and stands.  plenty of mature trees for stands or cedars to throw a ground blind up against.  there is a ravine that runs to the east towards the south end of the pasture.  this ravine runs right up into a small little acreage of native grass and trees.  looks like a great place to ambush a buck headed to bed!!

the 320 acres in sheridan county has two pivots on it.  i would not say this would be a great spot for deer but i also would not discount it as there are trails coming to the pivots.  my thought would be this area is more for upland game and possibly geese using the pivots.  there is some corners around the pivots that could hold some birds.  the pasture to the west has pond.  it was dry now but did have water and in a wet year could hold some waterfowl.

atv's allowed for hunting purposes only, no trail riding, and avoid damaging the fence on the property.  respect to crops and crop ground is a must!  

$2 million hunting liability insurance included with lease price. 

owner reserves the right to pasture cattle.

outfitters/guides must provide their own additional insurance.

grant county320 acres
320 acres of crp grass in grant county!!!  just in time for upland game season in november.

this half section will provide you an excellent hunting spot away from the walk in crowd.  the area has great grass surrounded by crop fields.  the bird hunting should be great!! the are some low areas that will hold some water in a wet year.  there may even be a whitetail or two that would call this area home with all the feed around it.  some great hunting possibilities.

$2 million hunting liability insurance included with lease.

eau claire county40 acres
nice property with woods, pasture, corn. this farm lays out really nice. there are apple trees at the north end of the woods. woods have a number of oak trees. there is not a lot of brush in the majority of the woods so that should make for easy shooting. the southeast corner of the woods has a lot of brush and is very thick. there's about 6 acres of corn on the east side with pasture next to it. there's a fair amount of clover around the corn edges and in the pasture. there may be dairy cattle in the west pasture at times. plenty of deer sign. turkey's also present as per owner.
there is a gate on the southwest portion of the property on shale ridge rd. this is where to park and please close all gates if you open them. owners are amish and live in the farmhouse to the north. please do not bother the owners on sunday. owners might allow camping. close to eau claire which has all the amenities, hotels and restaurants.
