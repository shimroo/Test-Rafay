original craftsmanship, original quality 



since 1967, we have pursued but one goal – make the best rv products in the industry. our awnings are woven of tough, american-made acrylic fabrics, and are still built with the same pride in craftsmanship as when they were first built in 1967. every product we put our name on is the result of one simple philosophy –take the road less traveled by. and this has made all the difference. 







 
about zip dee











 















customized for every vehicle. personalized for every style. 



every zip dee awning is custom made to the quarter inch using sunbrella® brand fabrics. and if that isn’t enough, we’ll go a few stitches further and personalize your awnings or accessories by embroidering or silk screening your name, monograms, rv club, company logo, or any other logo onto the fabric.
