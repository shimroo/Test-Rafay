there is something about gathering just as we are, in all our joy and sorrow, strength and weakness, seeking to worship god in spirit and in truth. what an incredible honor it is to sing praises to our lord, jesus christ and hear the truth of his word and work proclaimed.  we offer both traditional and contemporary worship services.
