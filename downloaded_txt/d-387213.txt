mica lamp company, turn of the century american lighting design and craftsmanship




































































turn-of-the-century american lighting design and craftsmanship is available today from the mica lamp co. we follow the same formula as the original craftsman. all of our parts are made of solid copper, assembled with hand driven copper rivets and finished with a rich natural patina.

our mica shade panels are the same natural materials used by the arts and crafts master lamp makers. mineral mica flakes, combined with organic shellac, make each mica shade unique with its variations of mineral deposit patterns and color tones. the famous san francisco coppersmith dirk van erp, was the first to make these copper lamps in 1910.

mica lamps are available only through our network of authorized dealers.
