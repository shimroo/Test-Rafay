a loving way to say what is in your heart 





welcome guest! would you like to log yourself in? or would you prefer to create an account?
even if you cannot find the words, you can still show you care.
enrolling your loved one in the assumptionist mass association is an extraordinary way to say what is in your heart. simply by registering that special person with the assumptionist mass association, you begin a special spiritual bond with the assumptionists. in addition, you and that special someone share these spiritual benefits:
:: daily remembrance in the holy sacrifice of the eucharist
:: remembrance in prayers and spiritual works of the assumptionists.
