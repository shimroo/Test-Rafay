outpatient care

                    rhi provides a wide variety of specialized outpatient care at one convenient location, and it doesn’t matter if a patient has been an inpatient in a different facility prior to coming for outpatient care at rhi. from vision rehabilitation and wheelchair seating clinics to neuropsychology services and balance retraining, rhi can prescribe the programs that will get you back to your maximum potential. as with inpatient care, each patient works with a team of experts to reach goals.

community reintegration

                    even when a patient makes tremendous progress after a traumatic incident, there still can be challenges going back to day-to-day living. rhi’s community reintegration program provides resources and support to ease that transition.
