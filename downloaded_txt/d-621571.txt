 john f. banzhaf iii
              [pronounced banz-half] is a nationally-known professor and
              practitioner of public interest law, and a former
              scientist, engineer, mathematician, and inventor. 
              [see links below and in left column]
  prof. john banzhaf has been called the "ralph
                nader of the tobacco industry," "one

















                  of america's premier legal activists," "an

















                  unsung american hero." "the man behind the ban on
                cigarette commercials," "the ralph nader of junk food,"
                "the
                  man who is taking fat to court" [for using
                  legal action to fight obesity], "mr.
                anti-smoking," "one of the most vocal and effective
                anti-tobacco attorneys," a "radical feminist,"
                a "man who lives by his writs," the "father of
                  potty parity," "the
























                  area's best-known 'radical' law professor," " legal



































                  academia's instigator in chief," one

















                  of the world's top "game theorists," and  an
                  "entrepreneur of litigation, [and] a trial lawyer's
                  trial lawyer."

  he has also been
                hailed as "one of the "100 most powerful
                people in washington," "the man big tobacco and
                now fast food love to hate," the lawyer "who's leading
                the battle against big fat,"  "a















driving
force
behind
the
lawsuits
that
have
cost
tobacco
companies
billions

































































                  of dollars," "the renowned and often flamboyant
                public-interest law professor at george washington
                university," "the fastest legal gun in the
                east," the "dean

































































                  of public interest lawyers," "a major
                  crusader against big tobacco and now among those
                  targeting the food industry," and "the law
                  professor who masterminded litigation against the
                  tobacco industry."  

  he's also been called â by





































                his enemies â a "legal




















                  terrorist"," the "osama

































































                    bin laden of torts," a "legal
                bomb-thrower," the man











                  from f.u.c.k., and a "legal
                  flamethrower," and he has frequently been attacked
                on web sites (which are often inaccurate) [see,
                e.g., banzhafwatch.com]
                by those who opposed his activities; clear
                indications, he says, that his many targets fear him and
                his legal actions.  
  as a young lawyer, john banzhaf brought a legal
                action which required broadcast stations to provide
                hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free broadcast
                time for anti-smoking messages â an action which
                resulted in the first ever decline in cigarette
                consumption, something even the 1964

































































                  surgeon general's report was not able to achieve. 
































































                

  subsequently, after founding action on smoking
                and health (ash) to serve as the legal-action arm of the
                antismoking community [ about ash ], he helped
                drive cigarette commercials off the air, and started the
                nonsmokers' rights movement by first getting no-smoking
                sections â and then smoking bans â
                on airplanes and buses, and in many other public places.

  banzhaf and ash have played a major role in the
                war on smoking and for nonsmokers' rights, including
                promoting and helping to mastermind law suits against
                the tobacco industry, in defending the legal rights of
                nonsmokers in hundreds of legislative, administrative,
                and judicial proceedings, in helping to pass, implement,
                and enforce the first world antismoking and nonsmokers'
                rights treaty [nosmoking.ws],





































                and persuading
                congress to authorize charging smokers more for their
                health insurance as part of its comprehensive reform of
                health care. 

  more recently he helped to ban cigarette
                advertising in several european countries, and to ban
                smoking outdoors, in homes and cars where foster
                children are present, to protect children involved in
                custody disputes, etc. [new
                  frontiers for nonsmokers].  his contributions
                to the war on smoking have been very widely recognized [
what others have
                  said about ash]

  at the george
                washington university law school, prof. john banzhaf
                teaches torts, administrative law, disabled people
                and the law, and law and the deaf.  he also teaches
                a unique world-famous course â "legal activism" [law

































































                  637], which has been dubbed "suing for credit"[gw's legal
                  powerhouse] and "sue

































































                  the bastards" â where his law students, which the
                press dubbed "banzhaf's bandits" [time

































































                  magazine], learn to become public interest
                lawyers by bringing their own legal actions [spotlight:
                  professor brings the classroom to the courtroom]. 
 
   he and his students are widely known for
                bringing hundreds of innovative public interest legal
                actions including one of the leading

































































                  supreme court environmental law suits, 
                persuading the f.t.c. to require "corrective
                advertising," preventing dry
                  cleaners from charging women more to launder their
                  shirts ," suing
































































                  former vice president spiro t. agnew  to
































































                recover the bribes he received, safety standards for
                school buses, clearer warnings on birth control pills,
                smoke detectors in airplane lavatories, auto bumper
                standards, new police procedures for dealing with
                spousal abuse, the end to a scheme to defraud veterans,
                greater roles for blacks on television, clearer labeling
                of foods, and many other victories.
  prof. banzhaf has also achieved many additional
                public interest legal victories, including: forcing

































































                the cosmos club to admit women, using the threat of a
                civil law suit to pressure durham county da mike nifong
                to step down and drop rape charges against three duke
                lacrosse players, helping to get the first woman
                admitted to formerly all-male state-supported military
                academies, etc.  he has been dubbed "the father of
                potty parity" for spearheading legislative and other
                movements to equalize the waiting time to use restrooms,
                and most recently won a major victory in the u.s. house
                of representatives.

               recently, prof. banzhaf started a movement
              to use legal action as a weapon against obesity modeled on
              his earlier successes in using legal action as a weapon
              against smoking [cbs1,
              cbs2, canadian

































































                tv].  so
              far, ten (including two threatened) fat law suits have
              been successful [link],
              and have forced mcdonald's, kraft, kfc, kelloggs, and
              other major companies to make significant changes likely
              to help reduce obesity.
  john banzhaf has discussed and/or debated
                smoking and obesity â as well a wide
                variety of legal issues, including self defense,
                governmental corruption, sex discrimination, auto and
                food safety, jury nullification, potty parity, drug
                testing, various constitutional issues, etc. â

  after graduating from stuyvesant

































































                  high school in new york city, link2,
                professor banzhaf received his undergraduate degree in
                electrical engineering from m.i.t.  for a time
                before entering law school he worked as a scientist and
                engineer, writing several published technical papers,

                the u.s. are those which belong to public interest law
                professor john banzhaf.  they have gone through a wide
                variety of different iterations  - e.g., "sue
                bast," "su bastrds," etc. - which all stand for âsue the bastards.â

                not only have
                they appeared in many media reports, but they were
                brought up on cnn, in a congressional hearing, and in
                the official congressional committee report, all in an
                effort to embarrass him.  p.s.: it didnât work, and
                the âcheeseburger billâ against which he testified never
                passed.  see: law

              son around, has a vanity

                bastards," a favorite credo. link

                lawyers of america, facebook: rebel with many causes:
              the george washington university law school catalog lists
              john f. banzhaf iiiâs most celebrated and notorious course
              as legal activism.
              the professor refers to this central part of his syllabus
              by a less scholarly title: sue the bastards.
                  his license plate once rendered the same
                sentiment semaphorically as sue bas.  link

                â  cnn crossfire [8/9/02]: 
              [robert] novak: professor banzhaf, i would like to put
              something up on the screen.
              novak: it's a license
                plate. can we put it up there? there it is. that's your license plate.
                and it says sue bas. is that your wife's name,
              sue bas?
              banzhaf: no, it's actually b-a-s-t, and stands for sue the bastards,
              and if virginia ever finds out what it stands for, they'll
              probably take it away from me.
              novak: isn't this a case of you are just one of the most
              litigious men in america. you will sue anybody at the drop
              of the hat.
              banzhaf: anytime i see wrongdoing, i will sue. i'm an
              equal opportunity litigator. as you know, i'm one of the
              few people, who when you first had the crossfire program,
              and you had the liberal and conservative, i got fired at
              by the conservative, and i got fired at by the liberal. i
              go after anybody. link
