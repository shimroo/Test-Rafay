 about finding an attorney is easier than ever using the handel on the law attorney directory. the handelonthelaw.com attorney directory is unique because it is backed by a nationally syndicated radio program that reaches millions of listeners. while other shows have come and gone over the years, handel on the law has enjoyed an almost unheard-of run of twenty years and is still going strong. whereas legal questions answered with bill’s unique brand of humor have been the show's hallmark, it became clear that callers often needed a qualified attorney to represent them. handelonthelaw.com is a website that prominently features an attorney listing service. websiteabout ushow it workslist your practiceblogfaqssitemapradio stationsfacebook attorney referral gold members searchbrowse categoriesbrowse locationspodcasts 2025podcasts 2024podcasts 2023podcasts 2022podcasts 2021podcasts 2020podcasts 2019podcasts 2018podcasts 2017 supportmember loginpassword retrievaltutorialscontact usdisclaimeradvertise: (888) 449-7746directory: (888) 669-6961pi cases: (877) 789-4878b handel: (800) 520-1534
