video research snapshots
dcdt’s research committee is dedicated to bridging the gap between research and practice. the video research snapshots highlight current secondary transition research, which can directly impact the positive postsecondary outcomes of their students with disabilities. every quarter, we will spotlight one article from dcdt’s peer-review journal career development and transition for exceptional individuals.
