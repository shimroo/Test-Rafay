				  i have a 5-month doxie and she is very small. she 
				  now thinks she is really hot stuff because she can 
				  now get on the bed by herself and on the couch with our dog 
					ramps. 
				  thank you from me and especially from "tayi". ramona



				  thought you would like to see your customer, "kelly." 
				  the dog ramp is wonderful and even helps me with my carpal tunnel from 
				  lifting him so much. thanks!"

				  "i just want to say how terrific your product is. this is my 
		third set of pet ramps." dr. s. trufolo


				  just to let you know that our little pomeranian, "poopzee" uses 
				  your unique pet step everyday to go onto and off our very high bed. 
				  there is no way that she could do this without her pawsteps 
		pet ramp.

sometimes pets just need that extra 
       step up. whether it's a little dog needing to be carried up on the bed, 
       or a big dog with a hip problem, or any pet along on an rv camping trip, 
       sometimes it's just not convenient to carry your best friend back and 
       forth. 

enter the multi-purpose pawsteps pet 
       ramp. dogs take to this ramp quickly, often immediately, and 
       you'll enjoy the freedom that this lightweight, portable pet ramp 
       affords. but where other carpeted pet ramps can get wet, stained or 
       smelly, the high quality carpet snaps off for easy cleaning. in addition 
       the lightweight pawsteps pet ramp comes pre-assembled, so you and you're 
		dog or cat can start 
       to enjoy your pet ramp right away.
