but there’s even more to like about prefab modular homes. the finest quality modular homes! 
 what is a modular home?
a modular home is a prefabricated structure built with repeated sections called modules. unlike a traditional stick-built house that’s constructed on the lot where the home will sit, a modular home’s built in sections offsite. once it’s done, the sections are loaded onto a truck that transports them to the homebuyer’s lot, where the house will be assembled. this finished product looks like any traditional stick-built home, having been constructed using the same building materials, including quartz countertops, wood framing, and brick exteriors.
many homebuyers love the idea of modular home building because of how easy they are to design and customize. plus, you can build any type of house you want, from a ranch-style home to a multi-million-dollar estate. 
  








we work with you our team each kintner modular homes team member is actively involved in building your home. we take pride in listening to our customers, being responsive and doing the best job possible, with the ultimate goal of creating a satisfied customer for life. modular homes offer a remarkable value. with more than 50 years’ experience, you’ll find our commitment to excellence in every board, nail, window and carpet and in every one of our modular floor plans. our homes are professionally engineered and built by skilled craftsmen and continually inspected to ensure they meet precise state and/or local building codes.
