our commitment to equity
the kansas children’s cabinet and trust fund (children’s cabinet) recognizes that equitable life outcomes start with an early childhood system that acknowledges children and families experience disproportionate access and opportunity across race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical and developmental abilities, home language, and geography. equity is an organizing principle of the all in for kansas kids strategic plan.
the children’s cabinet is committed to:

meeting the diverse and unique needs of all kansas families by integrating systems-wide approaches to ensure basic needs are available and accessible
elevating family voice and choice
utilizing data in ethical, timely, and responsive ways in partnership with communities and a broad array of experts
equitably funding programs
