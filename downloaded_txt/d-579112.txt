6 verbal tricks to make an aggressive person sorry






interesting.  but also why i hate watching main stream media interviews like this. it's more about bullying, using presupposition and dirty tricks to drive up ratings, than it is about genuinely discussing, debating, or understanding anything.  "journalism" as an actual thing, seems to be dead.  i've got better things to do than listen to polarizing bullshit the msm dishes up daily.

ultimately, most elections are about the economy





an not just the actually economy, but how the average person perceives it, and is affected by it.
how easy is it get a mortgage?  buy groceries?  this article explains it well:
what just happened - it was the economy, stupid.
 
the link doesn't allow me to cut and paste quotes.  but the article goes through a list of many strong points, that basically add up to many americans feel shut out of the american dream.  half of americans are spending 30% or more on rent or mortgage payments, which are a stressful burden. inflation has slowed, but prices are still rising. the article says a lot more, it's worth reading the whole thing.  i think it really explains well, what we are seeing here.

grumpiness and old age; does it have to be?





not if you don't want it to!  getting grumpier as you get older can be an easy habit to fall into, but not one that helps you much.  with some self-awareness and a bit of effort, life can be more enjoyable for yourself and those around you.  this article has some good reminders and tips on how to do that:if you want to be a more pleasant person as you get older, say goodbye to these 10 behaviors

alkaline vs acid ph in the human body; which is better, and why





i've been struggling with a number of health issues, including joint inflamation flares, arthritis, brainfog, etc.  following a carnivore-type diet has helped, but i've also been using a morning routine of having a fresh squeezed lemon every morning, with a 1/4 teaspoon bicarbonate (baking soda) to make my body's ph more alkaline than acid.  this article explains the benefits of keeping your bodies ph toward the alkaline side:the alkaline diet: is there evidence that an alkaline ph diet benefits health?
this review looks at the role of an alkaline diet in health. pubmed was searched looking for articles on ph, potential renal acid loads, bone health, muscle, growth hormone, back pain, vitamin d and chemotherapy. many books written in the lay literature on the alkaline diet were also reviewed and evaluated in light of the published medical literature. there may be some value in considering an alkaline diet in reducing morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases and further studies are warranted in this area of medicine. [...] 

it goes into quite a bit of detail, lots of useful information.  and a good primer for the basics of ph, what it does in human physiology, how it interacts with other elements.  and why it's important.
 also see the benefits of lemons:
