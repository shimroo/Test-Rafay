product noticewe have introduced a new diving laser for 2020.  it is smaller, brighter and has many more advantages.  click on the picture to the left for details. 







the air buddy is the only alternate air source to give you up to 20% more breathing time on whatever amount of air you have available to use.  this will work on pony bottles or the tank on your back. it will fit on your bcd, your pony bottle or can be used instead of the old fashioned "octopus rig" hanging on your firt stage.






the power beacon not only lights up the vertical shaft with a solit or flashing light, but puts out a beam of that light from the top end that can be used as a badk up flashlight, especially when you want to look in holes for fish when a white light would startle and frighten them.
