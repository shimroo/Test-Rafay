the destiny of a property
hidden in the heart of rutherford, quintessa is a 280-acre site that reflects a diversity of geology, biodiversity, exposures and microclimates. inspired by this distinct property, founders agustin and valeria huneeus believed that it was destined to become one of the world’s great wine estates. today, a total of 160 acres are planted with cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot and carménère on 26 vineyard blocks. each block is farmed—organically and biodynamic®—harvested, and vinified individually to preserve and enhance the nuances of the land.  inspired by the land’s natural grandeur, the huneeus family dedicated themselves to capturing the beauty and harmony of this land in the form of a great wine.  visit the estate>
depending on the vintage, quintessa may include some or all of the five varietals grown on the property: cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot and carménère. the fruit is harvested early in the morning, then sorted and gravity-fed into oak, stainless steel or concrete tanks and vinified. once fermentation and maceration are complete, the wine from each plot is aged separately for up to two years in french oak. after the final quintessa blend is created, the wine is bottled and laid down for yet another year before release.  discover our current release.
