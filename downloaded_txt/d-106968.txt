21.09.2007 5:44a star is born (1954 film) original lp version  once in a lullaby by: joey       special thanks to peleon for sharing this with me. the link to the original 320 kbps version this download is re-encoded from is in the comments of the beauty and the beast post. however, this is 40% of the size but almost the exact same quality, which is why i chose to post it here anyway.artist : judy garlandalbum : a star is born [original lp version]label : prism leisuregenre : soundtrackbitrate : 128 kbps mono cbr (= 256 kbps stereo cbr)source : cdruntime : 01:02:08 (57 mb)release date : 2007-09-20store date : 2005-08-09download!

(the man that got away even has an expanded intro not heard in the film.) it does, however, serve as a great companion cd, and it's a must have if you're a fan of the film, of judy garland, or soundtracks period.    16.09.2007 12:36beauty and the beast [special edition soundtrack]  once in a lullaby by: joey       well, i still don't have any new judy stuff for you all to download. i promisepromisepromise i will soon! i still have several albums ready to be uploaded at any moment. however, until then, enjoy this expanded edition of a classic disney soundtrack. :d artist : various artistsalbum : beauty and the beast [special edition soundtrack]label : walt disney recordsgenre : soundtrackbitrate : 224 kbps cbrsource : cdruntime : 01:04:43 (104.6 mb)release date : 2007-09-12store date : 2001-12-18download:part 1 (57.4 mb) - contains info txt, hq scans of packaging, and tracks 1-10part 2 (51.9 mb) - contains tracks 11-19[track list]1. david ogden stiers - prologue (2:29)2. paige o'hara, richard white, chorus - belle (5:07)3. paige o'hara - belle [reprise] (1:05)4. richard white, jesse corti, chorus - gaston (3:40)5. richard white, jesse corti, chorus - gaston [reprise] (2:04)6. jerry orbach, angela lansbury, chorus - be our guest (3:44)7. paige o'hara, robby benson, jerry orbach, angela lansbury, david ogden stiers - something there (2:19)8. jerry orbach, angela lansbury, jo anne worley, david ogden stiers, chorus - human again (4:54)9. richard white, chorus - the mob song (3:30)10. angela lansbury - beauty and the beast (2:45)11. alan menken - to the fair (1:58)12. alan menken - west wing (4:25)13. alan menken - the beast lets belle go (2:22)14. alan menken - battle on the tower (5:28)15. alan menken - transformation (5:50)16. howard ashman - be our guest [demo] (3:29)17. alan menken, howard ashman - beauty and the beast [work tape & demo] (3:58)18. celine dion, peabo bryson - beauty and the beast (4:07)19. alan menken - death of the beast [original early version] (1:29)this is the 2001 10th anniversary re-issue of the academy award, golden globe, and grammy winning soundtrack to disney's animated film beauty and the beast. this soundtrack was released on december 18, 2001 to coincide with the film's reissue into large screen theaters on january 1, 2002. this reissue included a newly animated song, human again, which had been dropped early in the film's pre-production due to conflicts between lyrics from the song and the plot - namely a motif of the passage of time, which conflicted with such plot issues as maurice searching for belle in the forest. when the film was developed for the broadway stage, the "passage of time" bit was removed from the song, allowing it to work within the show's plot. this allowed disney to go back and animate a new scene to seamlessly integrate into the film.the special edition soundtrack expands upon the original soundtrack:-human again is included.-a demo of be our guest and the work tape and demo for the title track are included. previously, these demos have only been available on the now out of print 4-cd set the music behind the magic, which presents the soundtracks to the little mermaid, beauty and the beast, and aladdin with previously unreleased masters and demos, as well as the scrapped aladdin score. included on the set, but not this cd are: a portion of the belle demo, the demo of the belle reprise, demos of gaston and its reprise, the unreleased wolf attack master, and the demo of human again. a shorter version of the human again demo is included on the dvd as a bonus feature, along with original storyboards.-the early version of the transformation scene music. on some early pressings of the original soundtrack album, this version was actually used in place of the music heard in the film. later on, disney would correct this by using the film version. here, it is merely presented as a stand-alone piece, without the music accompanying the beast's transformation and the final choral reprise of the title track.    30.08.2007 21:08peter pan (1960 television cast soundtrack) [vhs rip]  once in a lullaby by: joey       sorry about the lack of judy lately. i still have more stuff to upload. i just haven't been uploading much of anything because when i started this blog, i uploaded for about a week straight, and i got burned out. but there will be new judy uploads soon, i promise! for now, though, please enjoy this download of music from a television classic that's currently out of print in any format. *which should be a crime, btw.*artist : various artistsalbum : peter pan [1960 television cast soundtrack]label : nbcgenre : soundtrackbitrate : 128 kbps mono cbr (= 256 kbps stereo cbr)source : vhsruntime : 56:35 (53.1 mb)release date : 2007-08-24download!

(jerry herman has even said some lines even had to be spliced together note by note.) therefore, this particular release features a mixture of stereo and mono elements. the previously unreleased film versions and reprises are all in mono, except for a very brief portion of "the man in the moon," where the stereo soundtrack master had to be used to replace a portion of the film's soundtrack that cuts away from bea arthur's performance to a scene backstage where lucille ball as mame practices her only (spoken) line in the number. the edited stereo lp versions of "open a new window," "the man in the moon," and "mame" are also included on this edition as bonus tracks. oddly enough, the stereo lp version of "bosom buddies" is quite the opposite of the three aforementioned tracks - the lp version actually includes a brief portion of lines that were cut from the film, but still included on the album. therefore, i chose not to include the mono film version, as my only reason for including mono film tracks in the first place was because the stereo soundtrack album versions were edited.this is not an official release. rhino and warner bros. are only credited as the label as that's where the sources for this release came from. this is nothing more than a fan project to present as complete a soundtrack to this film as possible by using the dvd release's audio track to include some previously unreleased material.    30.08.2007 21:08summer stock (1950 movie soundtrack)  once in a lullaby by: joey       192 kbps mp3, cd ripdownload!

(the first one was an album released in 1964 by capitol titled just for openers.) while many many bootleg compilations have been released on vinyl and a few on cd, this compilation, released by hip-o in 2002, comes directly from the tv show's master tapes, meaning excellent sound quality. 32 tracks are here, many seeing their first ever release on cd, and many others seeing their first ever legitimate release. judy never recorded or performed many of these songs outside the show, so this truly is a treasure trove of rare stuff. there's the show's intro, the half-time tags, dialogue between judy and whoever she's singing with, and there are guest appearances by everyone from liza minelli to the now famous duet of get happy/happy days are here again with barbra streisand to peggy lee, mickey rooney, and lena horne, among others. there aren't a lot of standards from her career on this particular cd, and no you won't find over the rainbow. (in fact, she only performed over the rainbow one time - on the christmas episode. i'll be uploading a cd taken from that episode soon.) you will find plenty of classics that she never sang again, such as moon river, old man river, and her emotional and powerful performance of battle hymn of the republic, sung in honor of her dear friend, john f. kennedy sr., who had just been assasinated a month prior to the taping of the episode in december of 1963. (although that episode didn't air until january.)unfortunately, the show was cancelled after only 26 episodes due to poor ratings. although critics almost universally loved judy and generally liked the show, it recieved poor ratings due to being aired in the same timeslot as nbc's massively popular series bonanza. most of the show's episodes have since been released on dvd. sid luft himself released a cd of duets from the show in 1998 with duet partners such as barbra streisand, ethel merman, lena horne, bobby darin, tony bennett, frank sinatra, and dean martin, among others. hip-o released this compilation in 2002, and starting in 2005, savoy jazz began releasing additional compilations of songs from the show, such as that old feeling: classic ballads from the judy garland show, great day: rare recordings from the judy garland show, and the upcoming greatest hits live.    30.08.2007 21:08newest list of upcoming shares.  once in a lullaby by: joey        the one and only (3-disc capitol box set) the judy garland show: the show that got away (2002 hip-o compilation) uploaded and will be posted shortly. judy at carnegie hall two more capitol studio albums - miss show business (1955) and judy (1956) that old feeling: classic ballads from the judy garland show (the first in savoy jazz's series of remastered recordings from her tv show) the judy garland christmas album (taken from her tv show's christmas episode) and christmas through the years (compilation of live tv appearances, capitol and decca studio recordings, and radio performances) collector's gems from the m-g-m films (rhino 2-cd compilation of outtakes, alternate takes, and film versions of her lesser known film songs, all but five of which had never been legitimately released before.) soundtracks from rhino - the wizard of oz 2-disc deluxe edition, meet me in st. louis, the harvey girls, in the good old summertime, and summer stock two rhino compilations that include songs with judy - irving berlin in hollywood and romantic duets from the m-g-m filmsand i still plan to share the occasional non-judy music download...just because. ^_^    30.08.2007 21:08mame (1974 movie soundtrack) new! cd rip!  once in a lullaby by: joey       throw out your vinyl rips from this post, guys! mame's back in cd quality!192 kbps mp3, cd ripdownload!

lucille ball & chorusif you've downloaded my previous version, you definitely need to download this one. i renamed the files so that you can simply overwrite your old vinyl-ripped mp3s with these. like with the previous vinyl rips i uploaded, these are perfectly crystal clear and clean, but without that webstream-type thing going on. this rip either comes from the 2004 rhino handmade cd, which was released in an individually numbered limited edition of 2,500 copies, or the 2005 collector's choice release, which is not limited. either way, it's from a cd. both cds make the fact that none of lucy's songs were single takes. in fact, pretty much each line is from a different take than the last. in fact, some lines are even taken from multiple takes. when rhino remastered this soundtrack for cd release, they chose not to run any kind of equalizer on lucy's vocals to make them sound more even, as if they possibly came from a single take, or at least that practically every single line wasn't from a different take from the last. however, it's all this effort that keeps lucy from sounding completely horrendous on this soundtrack. angela lansbury would have been far better, but after listening to this soundtrack quite a few times lately, i find that lucy should have been dubbed, but that she wasn't horrible. frankly, jane connell as agnes gooch is far more shrill and annoying than lucy, if you ask me. :p i think this is worth a download if only for the curiosity factor...that's the reason i downloaded it the first time.notes about the cd version from the rhino handmade website's mame entry:lucille ball was chosen for the lead in the screen version of this blockbuster broadway musical for the same reason she might be chosen today: her name is beloved the world over. interestingly, as lucy ricardo in i love lucy, she often made comic sport of her less-than-sensational singing. but irony took a sad twist as controversy and hollywood politics ultimately led many critics of the time to skewer mame, ostensibly because ball was out of her league vocally. thirty years later, however, the film and music stand on their many merits.mame began as a best-selling book and was soon adapted as a dramatic play by producer robert fryer. starring rosalind russell, auntie mame opened in new york in 1956 to rave reviews and big box office. warner then brought it to the screen, casting russell along with jan handzlik and peggy cass. auntie mame earned six academy award® nominations, including best picture.fryer then got the itch to make a stage musical of the hot property, hiring the writing team of betty comden and adolph green as librettists for the up-and-coming composer jerry herman (hello, dolly!). angela lansbury easily landed the role of mame, eventually earning a tony for it. the show itself was the toast of broadway.in the wake of the sound of music, musical films abounded in hollywood. and when it was decided that mame would sing and dance on the silver screen, the producers reached for a household word. everyone loved lucille ball in 1970, and warner was eager to bring her big-screen success to match her popularity on television.ball was playing a part 20 years her junior, but she danced well and worked extremely hard. beatrice arthur, kirby furlong, bruce davison, and robert preston costarred. ball and arthur were a well-matched team, adding unintentional humor with their low-register harmonizing during herman's charming duet "bosom buddies." preston turned in a moving ballad with "loving you," which was added to the film's score.mame managed a decent box-office performance in 1974, even breaking records at radio city music hall. poison pen reviews aside, ball's essential charms seduced viewers, who enjoyed the film all the same. and thanks to heavy reruns of i love lucy, the funny lady's fan base has only grown over the years, offering a chance to appreciate mame outside its jaundiced show-biz circumstances.this warner bros./rhino handmade release is the first cd appearance of the original mame soundtrack. the higher fidelity format reveals overdubbing techniques used to capture more pitch-perfect performances by lucille ball. of unique interest to soundtrack enthusiasts, these anomalies have not been eq-ed out during remastering. we've left the work as originally assembled, while delivering the best possible sound quality.    30.08.2007 21:08question.  once in a lullaby by: joey       any of you out there in blogland have any idea how i could go about promoting this blog so it can get some visitors?    30.08.2007 21:08updated list of upcoming shares.  once in a lullaby by: joey        the one and only (3-disc capitol box set) the judy garland show: the show that got away (2002 hip-o compilation) judy at carnegie hall two more capitol studio albums -

"judy in love" is the opposite in theme from her previous album, "alone" in that it focuses on more upbeat songs about, obviously, being in love.also released in mono format, the mono and stereo versions of "zing! went the strings of my heart" are different takes. oddly enough, "judy in love" did not hit the charts, as most of judy's albums did.    30.08.2007 21:08judy garland - alone (1957) + bonus track  once in a lullaby by: joey       artist : judy garlandalbum : alonelabel : capitolgenre : popbitrate : 256 kbps cbrsource : cdruntime : 37:32 (69 mb)release date : 2007-07-13store date : 1957-05-06download!
