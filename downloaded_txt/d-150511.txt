the title of this song of lost love means “insomnia.” written by dejan ivanovic, it was featured in the 2005 serbian film ivkova slava (ivko’s feast), and was a hit for the macedonian singer tose proeski. after a rubato verse, we play it in jeni jol rhythm. the melody shown for the rubato intro is approximate at best; listen to the original instead.

kceri moja aliji
posted by mike gordon on oct 17, 2018 in 2/4, balkan sheet music | 0 comments
popular in much of former yugoslavia, this traditional song is said to be turkish in origin. it’s one of several songs in which the daughter says she doesn’t want to marry any of the village worthies that her father proposes – oh no, she wants to marry a bekrija, a bad boy who likes to party. the song is often performed with a man singing the father’s lyrics, a woman singing the daughter’s lyrics, and both singing the chorus.

phirava daje
posted by mike gordon on oct 2, 2018 in 2/4, balkan sheet music | 0 comments
phirava daje is a rom song heard in bulgaria, macedonia and kosovo that tells a charming love story. we learned it from carol silverman at balkanalia!, the dance and music camp held near portland every summer. we play it with a bo diddley beat, to which people often do the dance cocek.
(ph = hard p + h, not f. kh = hard k + h, not scots loch.)

serbian racenica
posted by mike gordon on sep 28, 2018 in 7/8, balkan sheet music | 0 comments
krivo drom, a band from new orleans, plays a melody in the bulgarian meter called racenica (7/8, 2+2+3) that members of the band learned from unnamed serbian rom musicians. a pretty little three-phrase melody that can cycle endlessly. we transposed the original up a fifth – play it in any key you like.
(this happens to be the 50th chart i’ve uploaded to this site.)

phiravelman kalyi phuv
posted by mike gordon on sep 25, 2018 in 2/4, balkan sheet music | 0 comments
we like this recording by the hungarian rom band romanyi rota because its lyrics are a stark prayer to god for strength to be good in hard circumstances. we play it as a relaxed cocek.
the song is similar to, though not the same as, the serbian brass band melody “kako kolan da se videm,” with lyrics by r. todorovic. two songs for the price on one!
