mission la salle institute is an independent, catholic college preparatory school serving students from grades six through twelve.
its mission is to educate young men and women in the lasallian tradition by providing a loving, caring, supportive environment, encouraging them to realize their whole potential and become moral, responsible, and productive members of their communities with a sense of purpose and dedication to truth, honor and duty.
la salle accomplishes this through excellence in teaching by a devoted staff in a small, student centered environment which imparts christian values in the tradition of our founder, saint john baptist de la salle.  this commitment is shared by all members of the lasallian community.
