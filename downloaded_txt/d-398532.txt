osc's mission is to promote broad understanding, awareness, and recognition of caltech's research, people, accomplishments, and legacy across print and digital channels and events.




we work closely with divisions, departments, and individuals across campus to effectively communicate the impact caltech has on science and the world through the institute's main web pages, social media channels, central publications, events, and partnerships with media outlets and channels.
