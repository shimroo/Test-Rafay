my book dachshund coats, colors, & patterns and my new book the dachshund spine are now available to order!� if you've ever wondered about the great amount of visual variety in the breed, the first is a fun picture book with plenty of genetic description you will enjoy.� and if you are the owner of a dachshund, beagle, lhasa apso, mini or toy poodle, pekingese, or shih-tzu, having a copy of the second book can literally be a lifesaver!
