royal poinciana fiesta 



known and loved for the striking beauty of their bloom, royal poinciana trees are cherished and planted throughout the tropics and subtropics. however, they are endemic to madagascar, an island nation off the eastern coast of africa whose climate is similar to south florida in that it is both warm and characterized by wet and dry seasons. its discovery in madagascar is attributed to wenceslas bojer in 1824. seeds were taken first to mauritius and then to england, as reported enthusiastically in the curtis botanical magazine.
