19th-century girls' series

long before nancy drew, the hardy boys, sweet valley high, the 
babysitters' club, or magic tree house,
 series books provided a 
source of enjoyable fiction for children.  the first children's 

fiction series appeared in the united states in the 1830s, and by the 
1860s the genre was well-established 
and earning both praise and 
censure.  




i've been researching series books for over twenty-five years.  

this page draws upon some of that research; it is devoted to 
bio-bibliographies and commentary about 

nineteenth-century authors of series books for girls and younger children 

as well as samples of some of their writing.  it includes some of the century's most popular authors 

and a number of lesser-known figures whose works -- now almost forgotten -- show the evolution of the

genre. 

the most recent updates reflect my current interest in women authors, especially those slighted 
or omitted by traditional reference sources.  usually, such authors wrote only a few books or attained only 
modest success.  recovering their lives and works contributes to a better understanding of the development 
of series fiction and women's part in nineteenth-century publishing.
  



the table below alphabetizes authors by real names, using the library of congress authority file as a 
guideline; please check the comprehensive name index for pseudonyms and 
variants. the series bibliographies include links to etexts of volumes online at this site and 
elsewhere.

a note on categories in the chart: "series bibliography" generally covers only titles for girls and younger children; in cases where a series for boys was a counterpart or somehow related to a girls' series, it is also included.
"supplementary" material is generally commentary by an author's contemporaries or autobiographical essays.

other material at this site
since my series research often draws on or encompasses material other 
than the bio-bibliographies of 19th-century authors, the site has always carried some 
supplementary material.  now, as my research interests expand or take odd directions, 
new pages related to those areas sometimes are added to the site.  the chart below 
identifies and links to those pages.
