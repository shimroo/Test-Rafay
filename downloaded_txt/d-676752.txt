why buy from us?




an important outlet for local craftspeople


the mexican hammock company works in conjunction with the rural people of southern mexico to bring you the finest quality handwoven hammocks currently available. the company provides an outlet for hammocks produced by local craftspeople and assists in their struggle towards an improved quality of life through self-motivated development.


made with loving care

our hammocks are made with loving care by mayan craftspeople following a hammock weaving tradition which stretches back over 4000 years. the skills needed to create our mexican hammocks have been passed down through many generations and the basic design and weaving method has not changed for centuries. the weaving of mexican hammocks is not a wholly commercial affair but also an integral part of mayan culture.


free hammock backpack and illustrated handbook

each of our hammocks comes with a handy free weatherproof backpack. we also supply an illustrated hammock handbook containing detailed information on hammock use, hammock care and maintenance, washing, hanging methods and much more. compare the prices of our hammocks to other types of furniture and consider the huge advantages that a mexican hammock can bring.


developing a reliable, alternative source of income

the mexican hammock company was established in 1983 to provide an outlet in europe for co-operative based groups in rural mexico producing handwoven mayan hammocks. the company was set up as a joint venture between ourselves in the uk and a small group of hammock weavers in southern mexico with the specific aim of developing reliable, alternative sources of income in areas of high unemployment and relative poverty. hammocks are now a community lifeline towards a better future in each of the villages that we work with.
