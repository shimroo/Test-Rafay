drs. little and horwitz are both very engaging, and the lectures were incredibly informative.


i just wanted to reach out to say that the seminar on managing feline health and behavioral concerns was one of the best continuing education events i have attended. i have been able to apply something from every lecture into my daily routine as not only a veterinarian but also as a cat owner.
