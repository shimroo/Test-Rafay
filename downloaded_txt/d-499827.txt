built to last since 1955





durability, robustness and troublefree operation




it goes without saying that customers expect trouble free operation regardless of whether the machines are installed in the best maintained installations or the toughest 24h open selfservice laundry.
that’s the reason why wascomat washers are built to last 30,000 cycles. with more than 50 years of experience and being a laundry equipment reference brand in the usa, we have knowledge and skills to produce high quality machines in highly technological factories. not only, we have also developed intelligent softwares which increase the wash performance and extend the machine’s lifetime.











high performance line




wascomat laundry equipment is designed for reliability, low water and energy consumption, long lifetime and low running costs.
