     holding hands in jerusalem
    




via pink news: 

a social experiment where a gay couple holds hands in public has been recreated in jerusalem, with shocking results. similar to videos created in ukraine and russia, and shows the men enduring vile abuse. as they walk down the street, dozens of people look, and others make homophobic comments. this video comes just two weeks after six people were stabbed at a pride parade in the city, which left one 16-year-old dead.

     seattle: #blacklivesmatter activists shut down bernie sanders speech
    






the seattle times reports: 

a seattle speech by democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders was pre-empted in a chaotic confrontation saturday afternoon with a pair of black lives matter protesters, who took the stage and refused to let him speak. the vermont senator, who has drawn huge crowds around the country, was to be the star attraction and final speaker for a rally at westlake park to celebrate the 80th birthday of social security and the success of other anti-poverty programs. but his afternoon plans were scuttled by protesters determined to turn attention instead to sunday’s anniversary of the shooting by a white police officer of michael brown, an unarmed black man in ferguson, mo. later in the evening, sanders received the reception he’d expected from the seattle area as the progressive alternative to democratic presidential front-runner hillary rodham clinton. an estimated 15,000 supporters packed hec edmundson pavilion and an overflow area as sanders took the stage to thunderous applause and delivered an hourlong populist stemwinder about his plans to wrest the country from the control of billionaires.

     new date set for terry bean trial
    




the oregonian reports: 

a lane county judge agreed friday to reschedule the trial of prominent gay activist terry bean to allow the state more time to find its elusive star witness. bean, 66, and his former boyfriend, kiah loy lawson, 25, are accused of having sex with the boy at a eugene hotel in 2013. each is charged with two counts of third-degree sodomy, a felony, and third-degree sexual abuse, a misdemeanor. the trial was scheduled to start tuesday in lane county circuit court, but the boy, now 17, is nowhere to be found and the trial cannot proceed without him. circuit judge jay mcalpin ruled friday that there was good reason for a delay and reset the trial to sept. 1 over the opposition of attorneys representing bean and the boy.
last week prosecutors accused the alleged victim and his mother of engaging in an elaborate series of ruses in order to avoid being served with a subpoena before the trial deadline. the state says it may now take the teen into custody as a material witness and hold him until the new trial date. if they ever find him.labels: grindr, hrc, oregon, terry bean

     larry kramer on stonewall boycott
    




"don't listen to the crazies. for some reason there is a group of 'activists' that insists on maintaining their prime importance and participation during this riot. unfortunately there seems no one left alive to say 'it wasn't that way at all,' or 'who are or where the fuck were you.' as with so much history there is no way to 'prove' a lot of stuff, which allows artists such as yourself (and me i might add) to take essences and attempt to find and convey meaning and truth. i sincerely hope this boycott your film shit peters out. we are not dealing with another 'cruising' here. keeping your film from being seen is only hurting ourselves. good luck and thank you for your passion." - larry kramer, responding to the facebook page of stonewall director roland emmerich. labels: boycotts, gay writers, larry kramer, lgbt history, movies, nyc, stonewall (movie), stonewall rebellion

     trump's top adviser leaves campaign
    




politico reports: 

donald trump made the surprising announcement saturday afternoon that he was firing his top adviser, roger stone, but hours before the political consultant’s friends told politico that he was actually quitting. earlier in the day, stone’s friends told politico that he sent an email to trump announcing his decision to leave the campaign. more than an hour later, trump told a washington post reporter he fired stone. the news coincidentally hit twitter about 15 minutes after stone told a fox news tv show that he couldn’t appear saturday because he was no longer affiliated with the campaign, friends say. “i can’t believe roger got out-trumped, that he got out-stoned,” one of stone’s friends said. “roger’s mistake was trusting donald and not establishing a clear record that he was resigning first.” regardless of who resigned or was fired first, the campaign shakeup was the first sign that trump’s election effort was seriously damaged from within after his thursday night debate performance and his subsequent comments in which he attacked one of the fox debate moderators, megyn kelly.
according to politico, stone is considered to be a "nixon-era dirty trickster." hit the link for a conversation that reportedly took place between the two after the debate.labels: donald trump, gop, infighting is funny

     big think: george takei
    




from the clip recap: 

actor, activist, prolific meme-generator, and cultural icon george takei graces big think with his presence today in this powerful 5-minute clip. takei explores star trek creator gene roddenberry's ambitious and progressive vision for the future: "roddenberry felt that the enterprise was a metaphor for starship earth and the strength of this starship lay in its diversity." we also learn that takei's character, sulu, represented a united asia free of the many strifes roddenberry witnessed during the 20th century. takei tells us how the name "sulu" came about; it's an incredibly inspirational story. finally, takei explains the now-glaring omission of gay and lesbian characters from roddenberry's progressive enterprise. in short, it was the 1960's and the biracial kiss between uhura and kirk nearly sank the show. roddenberry knew there were limits to what the public would tolerate and he couldn't risk losing his platform for social commentary by testing them. thankfully, as takei notes, times have changed quite a bit since then in so many ways. and star trek and gene roddenberry are partly responsible.

     petition: stop megyn kelly
    




from the petition: 

megyn kelly apparently finds the state of our union amusing and "fun", whereas the viewers (our fellow citizens) deserve a much more serious moderator. in addition, she had a clear agenda to attack donald trump, by tenaciously clinging to his past rather than his vision for the future. she focused on trump personally, rather than politically. ultimately, she did not not live up to the "fair and balanced" slogan at fox news and news corporation. while her disdain for mr. trump was evident, this peititon is a call for truly fair and balanced coverage of all candidates. thus, megyn kelly should be barred from hosting or moderating all future republican presidential debates.

     trump disinvited from redstate event
    




trump was to be tonight's headliner and most of the other gop candidates will be speaking there this weekend. while we enjoy the escalating teabagger implosion, let's not forget that erick erickson, the person now leading the charge against donald trump, regularly calls you a nambla-supporting member of the gaystapo and a hell-bound mentally ill homofascist. erickson has also called the first lady a "marxist harpy wife" and called a member of the supreme court a "goat-fucking child molester." and then there are the times that newly-minted feminist erick erickson refers to "ugly feminazis" who should "get in the kitchen and learn to cook." oh, but he totally has the right to the moral high ground regarding donald trump.labels: donald trump, erick erickson, gop, hypocrisy, infighting is funny, megyn kelly, redstate, teabaggers

     brian brown has the fox debate sadz
    




"the nation watched the first debate of the presidential cycle this week, as fox news hosted the affair from cleveland on thursday evening. as many nom supporters have observed, the mainstream media rarely treats the marriage issue with the importance it deserves, and even fox news has been reluctant to give it fair and balanced coverage. regrettably, this was evident in their handling of the marriage issue during the presidential debate. only two candidates were asked about marriage, and it was phrased in an adversarial way, pitting support for traditional marriage as being at odds with support for a gay family member. how ridiculous! sadly, when it came to the marriage issue, fox news bumbled badly. we hope that future debates will give the candidates a fuller opportunity to expound on their views about protecting marriage and the actions they will take as president to reverse the illegitimate ruling of the supreme court. nom is committed to helping the american people separate out the marriage champions from the pretenders by issuing our presidential marriage pledge. a number of candidates have signed onto our pledge, and we will be announcing those names soon." - hate group leader brian brown, writing for nom's blog.labels: brian brown, debate watch, nom, the sadz
