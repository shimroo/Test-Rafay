"it's hard to imagine another artist on the folk scene 
 who combines the same
concise, deceptively understated, lyrical insight and sometimes devastating wit with such world-class instrumental prowess" 

chris rietz, musichound folk, the essential album guide

 

"joel mabus
is a free-ranging fretboard genius and funny, deep songwriter whose warm
voice, 
sly humor, and musicianship sweep audiences along for the ride.

"throughout his career, joel mabus has interwoven creativity and
traditional music in satisfying balance. in concert, joel mabus connects.
performing in a gentle, easy manner, he may lull his audience into a relaxed
state, then roll them on the floor with laughter or make them sit up and think,
or stun them with his instrumental pyrotechnics.

"joel mabus can be summed up in one word: style. he oozes with style: 
homespun sophistication, mellow innovation, low-key wizardry, and uncynical
minstrelsy."
cornell folk song
society 
(jm)

(jm)
"joel is one of those 
quintessentially midwestern american artists...

he has a style we will always associate 
 with will rogers or mark twain,
and a great sense of humour which 
 compliments, rather than contradicts, 
 some very serious material.
he has perfected the art of 
 being entertaining without pandering, 
he teaches without lecturing, 
 and does it all with great style."
vancouver folk
festival

emails to you. no need for concern, it is still me!
the pobox address is fine.  i had a computer crash

happened to me, please send an email to me, so i can re-load your address in my
