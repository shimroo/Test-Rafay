the national federation
              of state poetry societies (nfsps) is a non-profit organization,
              exclusively educational and 
			  literary. its purpose is 
			  to recognize
              the importance of poetry with respect to national cultural
              heritage. it is dedicated
			  solely to the furtherance of poetry on
              the national level and serves to unite poets in the bonds of
              fellowship and 
			  understanding.the emblem of the federation is the athenian greek coin
                insignia that appears on all nfsps publications 
			  and has been
                incorporated into the design of the medal (see above) which is
                presented to nfsps presidents 
			  at the end of their terms.
              the members of the federation are members of an nfsps
                affiliated state organization. any poet wishing to
