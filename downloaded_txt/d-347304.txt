we are a specially designed blend of improv, sketch, musical, cirque, and stunt comedy created to help kids of all ages and abilities. aiding in confidence for all kinds of kids, from the athlete to the dancer, the autistic child to the hollywood actor, we bring joy to kids and parents, which is the greatest joy, hence…joy theatre! through teamwork, love and laughter, in a safe, creative, and fun environment in a working theatre, members learn and perform all aspects of “what it takes” to put on a live theatrical show. from the shyest of children to the class clown who needs a venue, our kids find a second home on our stage. our mission is to build confidence, not hollywood stars; however, for those pursuing that life, we are agents and managers secret weapon. all are welcome. 
there is no audition.everyone deserves an opportunity to learn how to help people laugh! we look forward to having you as part of our family.
