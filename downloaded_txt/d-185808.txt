the heart of the black hills





hill city, south dakota is the perfect place to start your visit to the black hills. the short drives will give you more time to enjoy mt. rushmore, crazy horse memorial, the mickelson trail, and custer state park.











hill city: richness everywhere you wander
hill city is a favorite destination in the black hills all year long!  you’re just minutes away from the jaw-dropping views from black elk peak (7,242’ elev.), cathedral spires and the breathtaking views of mount rushmore and crazy horse memorial. take a scenic drive through ponderosa pines, see bison in custer state park or have an adventure hiking, biking, horseback-riding or rock-climbing.
after a day of recreation, plan to take in hill city’s art galleries, gift and boutique shops, museums, antique shops and more that line our walkable-shoppable little town, or indulge in some of the area’s finest restaurants, wineries and breweries. there’s richness everywhere you wander.
