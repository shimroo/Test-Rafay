irish railways line by

volume 3 -
              dublin and the south east

          
railway photographer jim edgar has
            put together in this book a collection of his photos of irish
            railways between 1973 and 2012. volume three covers dublin and the
            south eest of ireland. starting in the dublin area at heuston
            station  and inchicore
            works, this volume covers the cork main line as far as ballybrophy
            before venturing to waterford via kilkenny. next the south wexford
            line between waterford and rosslare is visited, followed by a return
            to dublin, this time arriving at connolly station. the former sugar
            beet traffic along the south wexford line is featured. to show the
            development of the railway system over the years covered, there is
            also a short feature showing scenes from the start and end of the
            period. 
 
for all the changes we can see during the years covered
            by this book, some parts of the railway maintained the feel of a
            bygone era throughout the period. a wide range of passenger and
            goods trains feature, ranging from wooden bodied stock to modern air
            braked and air conditioned trains, and from loose coupled sugar beet
            wagons to container liner bogie freight trains. 
 
locos include the classes a (001), b (sulzer, 121
            141,181 and the first 201 class), 071 and the second 201 class.

dvd available now -
 irish archive volume 8 - tara to clara

 this dvd is yet
          another delve into the recordings made by irish railway enthusiasts.  
 
 this time it
          covers the period 1987 to 2012.
 with most irish
          passenger trains now in the hands of railcars, we thought it would be
          the right time to savour an era when the locomotive was king.
  there is a
          major feature on the   tara mines trains, irelands only remaining mineral traffic
          carried by rail. we also see, coverage of our exploits recording
          trains in the twilight the starburst years, views of   cement traffic, now lost to rail. the ie  
          relaying trains 
using donelli system are put under the microscope, both
          in detail in their latest version and back in 1987 when we found an
          earlier version in operation on the cork main line. we also pay a
          visit to   attymon and dunsandle  in county galway,
          where the latter now hosts a small collection of railway exhibits, and
          finally we look in at   clara, where freight and passenger trains still
          pound past the single platform.  
 this video
          features coverage of the following locations - alexandra road tramway
          in dublin, attymon, beauparc, birdhill, buttevant, cherryville
          junction, clara, drogheda, duleek, dundrum, dunsandle, east wall
          junction, howth junction, kilsheelan, limerick junction, navan, port
          laoise, rush and lusk, sallins and naas, and tara mines.
