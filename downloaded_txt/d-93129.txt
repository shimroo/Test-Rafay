for over 80 years the freeport tuna club (ftc) has been one of long island's premier fishing clubs.  some of the best local fishermen and fisherwomen are among our 200-plus membership body. we fish hard and enjoy each other's camaraderie throughout all twelve months of the year. many small and large scale tournaments have been won by freeport tuna club members.  we enjoy a waterfront clubhouse with over thirty slips and all inshore and offshore fishing grounds are easily accessible from our convenient freeport location.
























join the club
once a month we hold a general membership meeting that includes a buffet dinner, raffles, and guest speakers. check the club calendar for exact dates. from april to october we have weekly outdoor meetings including a barbecue, where members get a chance to crew up with each other for fishing adventures. we also participate widely in many inter-club and intra-club events.
