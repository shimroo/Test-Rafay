body systems evaluation
 



 

christian domergue 
energy wellness since 1994

                  the key factor in maintaining health in the body is to first strengthen all "body systems" that might be weak.  in this way, the   body is given a better chance to adapt to the stresses of life, and   heal.   
                  like the                   musicians who make up an orchestra, the body systems -digestive,   hepatic, intestinal,                   circulatory, nervous, immune,   respiratory, urinary, glandular and                   structural -must all work in harmony. 

                  many of us are aware of the folly of having a client go to a heart   specialist for the heart, a kidney specialist for the kidneys, and a   urologist for the bladder. in many cases, none of the doctors know about   any of the other doctors treating that same client. each doctor is   concentrating on his own specialty, often ignoring the dynamic   interrelationships between all the "body systems" and the importance   of synchronicity in their activities. 

                  energy medicine supports the body's innate ability to heal itself at all   levels. it enhances the body's natural synchronization to enable it to   repair its own parts more rapidly.

  what people are saying







i have come seeking christian’s treatment and   wisdom many a times. not only i have used his treatments but also my   kids. as they were smaller and got sick, christian would be instrumental   in getting them out of a crisis – be it an infection, high fever,   stomach, you name it. 


 



 





this is such a wonderful place, my parents have been going here since i   was younger. now i’m having problems and they took me to christian. he   is the most amazing person ever. 
          i would highly recommend this place to anyone. he can help you.


 



 





one of the best out there! so grateful for christian and his expertise,   wisdom and insight. not only compassionate and understanding, but truly   as elite as it gets in the world of health and wellnes. he has been such   a gift to my family.
