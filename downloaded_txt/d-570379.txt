the ohio state university off-campus housing network

every year, thousands of students look to move into off-campus rental properties. most have never faced the challenge of finding a new place to live and are confronted with numerous options and choices.  
the ohio state university off-campus housing network establishes certain criteria (pdf) for off-campus property owners. those property owners that commit to meeting these criteria will be considered in-network.
