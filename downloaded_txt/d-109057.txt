soupy noodles
2 

mix veg soup with noodles
lots of veggies, some noodles, a bit of sauces with some seasoning, when mixed together, result is â€¦. a bowl full of refreshing appetizer.you can remove the noodles part without a second thought but i prefer it to get the slight feel of munchow. you can fry the noodles after boiling them too. many variations in just 1 recipe :). i have mentioned the method fro vegetable stock too. needless to say, you can use plain water if in hurry.

this is a such a simple and healthy dish and turns out great every time. i used 3 cloves of garlic, fresh chopped jalapenos and substituted olive oil with avocado oil. the results were great
