about experience corps




aarp foundation experience corps is a volunteer program that trains people over 50 to tutor students to become better readers by the end of third grade. not only is the program proven to improve students’ reading skills, but it also builds critical social and emotional skills they need for successful learning now — and later in life. currently, the experience corps program operates in 18 communities across the united states. 








so far, experience corps volunteer tutors have helped thousands of elementary students across america. during the 2023-2024 school year, 1,284 senior volunteers helped 3,659 kids to become better readers before the end of their third-grade year. 
learn more about volunteering with experience corps.








why it matters








did you know that a child’s likelihood of graduating high school can be reasonably predicted by their reading level at the end of third grade? 








in fact, children who can't read at grade level by fourth grade are four times more likely not to graduate from high school, putting them on a path to poverty later in life. but older adults, like you, are helping turn that statistic around.








it’s not just the students who succeed through experience corps. our volunteers report feeling a renewed sense of purpose and satisfaction by contributing in a meaningful way to their communities.








in addition, studies conducted by experience corps show that: 








●     among 2,573 students with at least 2 test scores, 95.3% showed improvement on at least one key metric.








●     98% of volunteer tutors reported that experience corps helped them stay physically and mentally active, and build digital and workforce skills.








●      96% reported feeling better about themselves.




●      more than 85% felt their lives had improved because of their involvement with experience corps.
