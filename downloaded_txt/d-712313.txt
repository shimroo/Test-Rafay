        about the iai      




the inter-american institute for global change research was established to address gaps in knowledge on global environmental change, that is,  the interactions of biological, chemical, physical and social processes that regulate changes in the functioning of the earth system, including the particular ways in which these changes are influenced by and impact on human activities. 

in 1992, 12 nations of the americas signed the declaration of montevideo, calling for the institute to promote regional cooperation for interdisciplinary research on aspects of global change, with particular attention to impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, socio-economic impacts, technologies and economic aspects associated with the mitigation of and adaptation to global change. 

sixteen governments signed the resulting agreement establishing the iai which laid the  foundation for the iai’s function as a regional intergovernmental organization that promotes interdisciplinary scientific research and capacity building to inform decision-makers on the continent and beyond. since the establishment of the agreement in 1992, 3 additional nations have acceded the treaty, and the iai has now 19 parties in the americas, which come together once every year in the conference of the parties to monitor and direct the iai’s activities.

since 2018, the iai has hosted the belmont forum, a partnership of funding organizations, international science councils, and regional consortia committed to the advancement of transdisciplinary science. please see the notification on the hosting of the belmont forum secretariat by the iai directorate.
