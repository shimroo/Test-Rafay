building a tennessee where all can belong and thrive




    join our movement.
  
















at the tennessee immigrant and refugee rights coalition, we know a better world is possible–one where all our families, neighbors, and communities have opportunities to thrive, regardless of nationality, immigration status, or racial identity.








































we’re tirrc, a statewide, immigrant and refugee-led 501(c)(3) organization.



tennessee has a rapidly growing immigrant population, and while our communities bring vibrancy and value to our state, we don't always have access to the same opportunities as our neighbors. so in 2003, immigrants, refugees, and our allies came together to fight for change. and for the last 20 years, tirrc has continued building power with and for immigrants and refugees in order to strengthen our communities, build belonging, and transform tennessee and the south. 




    learn more about who we are
  


























we believe every person possesses agency and power and that real and lasting change must be led by those directly affected by injustice. that's why we organize our members and develop their leadership to drive policy advocacy campaigns and defend our communities–improving the lives of immigrants and refugees, transforming our state, and building power for collective liberation.
