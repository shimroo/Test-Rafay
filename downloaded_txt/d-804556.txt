fat grafting to the breast
fat grafting, or cleavage therapy, is not about replacing the implants; it is about improving the quality of your breasts.

dr. khoobehi has been instrumental in bringing fat grafting to the breasts to the masses. fat transfer enhances the shape and feel of the breasts with a natural look and touch. fat-grafted breasts grow and change with you, and they allow you to achieve the feminine curves you want. dr. khoobehi offers fat grafting to the breast alone or in combination with implants, a breast lift, or breast implant removal.
 about fat grafting (breast) 











facelift under local anesthesia
many of dr. khoobehi’s rejuvenating facelifts are performed in-office under local anesthesia. 

facelift under local anesthesia provides a safer and often more desirable alternative for patients who don’t want to undergo general anesthesia. aging is as much about volume loss as it is sagging tissues; facelift surgery with or without local anesthesia is commonly combined with fat grafting to the face. this allows dr. khoobehi to fill and lift your features for a more natural look and feel that lasts.
 about facelift 











mommy makeover
motherhood changes your figure in more ways than one. this is why it is important to combine breast and body contouring techniques. 

dr. khoobehi’s mommy makeover integrates abdominoplasty with lipo 360 (liposuction of the torso’s circumference) and fat grafting to the hip area to create or restore the desired hourglass figure. this procedure is about finding the perfect combination of treatments and areas of fat grafting. curves come from fat, not bone or muscle, and must be handled delicately.

google review from c.r.




dr khoobehi is an excellent plastic surgeon who is very meticulous and precise. i wouldn’t have any cosmetic procedure done by anyone else…
google review from n.s.




dr khoobehi is in a league of his own with his craft. he will be honest, but professional… he is conservative with what he will and can do for the best results. he takes time listening….
