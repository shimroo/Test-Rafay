welcome to the huskies hockey club
the right league for every team.the right team for every player.
the huskies place teams into leagues in which they will be competitive and develop. our mite teams compete in the chicago united hockey league (cuhl). while the majority of our travel teams are placed appropriately into the northern illinois hockey league (nihl), we are excited that the bantam major huskies team has been invited to join the central states development league (cs) this year.

1969–2024
celebrating 55 yearsof huskies hockey
the huskies hockey club, established in 1969, began its journey playing at the ymca outdoor rink in elmhurst. over the years, the program has grown significantly and has been instrumental in developing talent at various levels. it has produced not only nhl players and olympic gold medalists but also numerous college hockey players and, most importantly, thousands of youth hockey players who have cultivated a deep love and passion for the game.

what parents say about us 














we were unsure if hockey would be the sport that my son would enjoy. he joined a team in which he did not know anyone. he quickly made friends and hockey became his entire life. he would wake up in the morning every day asking if he had practice or a game. he was upset when there were days off. he would talk about how the coaches would tell him he did something really good. he has grown to love hockey and can't wait to get on the ice every day. 









the huskies are a well-run, community hockey program that focuses on the kids. playing out of one rink makes it easier for us to manage as a family. 









this was the first year of my son’s travel experience. what a difference from the start of the season to the end of the season. practices really challenged the teams and they grew to make the right plays with the puck. can’t wait for next year! 









this was our first season with a huskies hockey player. as a single mother that has limited knowledge of the sport and its requirements. i was blown away with the knowledge of development that was provided to my son throughout the season. i was hesitant to sign him up for the season due to his lack of skills at such a high level of play but the improvement from the start to the end of the season was incredible. every week he stepped on the ice it was clear to see his skills improved from the week before. 









huskies hockey is a top-notch youth hockey development organization. well-run, excellent coaching, and a belief in developing skaters to learn the game the right way. 









transferring to the huskies was the best and most positive experience we could give our son. his development in one season has been tremendous and we look forward to another season with the huskies and watching our son grow into a more advanced and smart hockey player! 









playing for the huskies really upped the game and skills for my son. we should have made the switch years ago! 









i appreciate the fact that the teams practice across skill levels. it gives all players an opportunity to increase their competitive nature. 









not only on my son’s teams, but throughout the entire huskies club, the families support each other. it's truly a positive experience for the whole family! 









this was my son’s first year in travel hockey. the coaching my son received during the season took him from novice to a competitive player. i have witnessed during clinics, practices, and games the huskies coaches get down to my son’s level and explain and demonstrate to him what to do, and how to make the play. all i see is my son smiling when on the ice. we made the right choice joining the huskies organization. 









being a goalie parent it is hard to get good goalie coaching from a program, and you almost always have to seek private lessons outside of your club. however, the huskies do a great job developing their goalies by investing in great goalie coaches that are available to your kids all season long. great job huskies! 









great coaching staff, challenging our kids each time they are on the ice, great facility. we will stay with huskies as long as our son wants to keep playing. thank you huskies! 









great coaching staff, challenging our kids each time they are on the ice, great facility. we will stay with huskies as long as our son wants to keep playing. thank you huskies! 









the huskies hockey club is a welcoming program that not only elevated the skill of our player but made him fall in love with hockey all over again after leaving a program that was only concerned about their top teams. 









we moved from another club that didn’t help the lower teams, but at the huskies, you get the same training no matter what level your kid is. 









our son has played for the huskies from the start. the reason he has is because of how well the organization is run. as a parent, hockey is expensive and we want to make sure we are getting value for our money. we have seen our son develop strong skills and great friendships along the way. we too have made some great friends through the huskies that we will have for a very long time. the coaching staff is very good at keeping the players focused on having a passion for the game. the huskies provide the tools, our child has to just learn how to use them. 









we find the club to be almost like a family environment. it doesn’t matter what team your kid is on, the kids always seem to pull for each other as do the parents. coming from a club where that was definitely not the case, it’s very great to see.
