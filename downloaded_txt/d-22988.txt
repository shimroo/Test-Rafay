peer stories






 



					adrian cunanan				

i have always loved technology. i even go as far as saying, “my mind (aka my cpu) is my favorite and most powerful muscle.” 










 



					sarah bauer hernandez				

having bipolar disorder has not made for an easy life. but within my pain and struggles there have been transformative gifts...








 



					marya hornbacher
