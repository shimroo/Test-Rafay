"the wing chun archive is a welcome addition to the 
				online wing chun kung fu community. it is a necessary and unique 
				endeavor through which all branches of the art are represented, 
				respected, and welcome. may it serve to surpass political 
				polarization in the eye of future generations if not each of our 
				own." sifu peter spier wingchun.net
