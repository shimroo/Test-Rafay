rule #1: only wake surf behind inboard boats 


never wakesurf behind an outboard, stern drive, or inboard/outboard boat. if you can see the boat's propeller, you may not surf behind that boat. if you break this rule, you may die or lose arms or legs. if you see someone breaking this rule, tell them to stop. invite them out on your boat. click on the skull and crossbones to see a picture of a hand chewed up by a propeller.
