sudbrook is communitya neighborhood of families, closely-knit, diverse and eclectic. boasting one of the area's oldest and most active community associations, sudbrook park is a community that cares--passionate about preserving its past while making the most of its present, and ultimately, planning for its future.

 

sudbrook is charm - a quaint and unique locale where hollywood came to film, where 1940s film star dorothy lamour came to live, and today, where families choose to work and play. the homes, from the delightful 1940s brick cape cods tucked cozily along tree-lined streets to those grand victorian delights with wrap-around porches and lawns that seem to go on forever, create what olmsted described as "a respite for the spirit."



sudbrook is tradition - a community steeped in time-honored rituals. with each season, the park's residents come together for cherished celebrations: families gather 'round the sudbrook christmas tree to ring in the holiday season; kids, donned in their patriotic finest, celebrate the 4th of july in red, white, and blue; and little goblins, witches, and ghosts walk the pumpkin-lined neighborhood streets in the halloween parade.



sudbrook is history - a place that enjoys a rich and fascinating past. designed by the father of american landscape architecture, frederick law olmsted, sudbrook park embodies the olmsted vision of the suburban village with winding roads, village greens, picturesque landscapes, and beautiful turn-of-the-century homes. a visit to the park is a trip back in time.
