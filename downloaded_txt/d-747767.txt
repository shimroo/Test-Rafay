welcome to cmtbl at hkbu

research in our lab focuses on theoretical 
                              and computational aspects of condensed matter and 
                              biological systems, particularly from a statistical 
                              mechanics view point. we are interested in quantitative 
                              modeling and analysis of large scale properties 
                              of these systems, such as ordering and fluctuations, 
                              from a given set of interactions at the microscopic/molecular 
                              level. increasingly, our fascination is shifting 
                              towards living organisms, where complexity rules 
                              and intelligent organization holds the key to fitness 
                              maximization. by combining genome-wide, high-throughput 
                              data with quantitative modeling that implements 
                              the relevant biophysical and biochemical constraints, 
                              we hope to gradually develop an appreciation of 
                              nature's design plan for life forms, starting from 
                              unicellular organisms e. coli and s. cerevisiae.
