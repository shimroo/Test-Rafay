“a noticeable trend in kitchen and bathroom remodeling is reflected in the move towards minimalism and understatement.

clean lines, simple geometric forms and less ornamentation result in a room that is elegant and upscale, while retaining a casual ambiance.”

		process	

					what you can expect from your designer

floor plan


we generate a floor plan that shows the wall layout from above and an outline of the components that will fill the space, such as cabinetry and appliances.









elevations


we also generate a "flat" image that shows each wall of cabinetry as if you were standing and facing it. the elevation is a good resource for cabinetry details and measurements.









perspective


to understand a project we create a 3-dimensional image showing the room as if you were standing in it. perspective drawings show details like areas that are increased or decreased in depth, a quality that elevation drawings don't offer.









pricing


we document the overall price of the cabinets with modifications, all needed trims and parts to complete installation included so there are no surprises.
