where the old west meets the oceannestled on california’s scenic central coast, halfway between los angeles and san francisco, cayucos is a hidden gem known as "the last of the california beach towns." tucked between the pacific ocean and rolling hills of untouched ranchland, our town offers a tranquil escape from the fast-paced hustle of city life. here, the quiet stillness of a small-town setting meets the natural beauty of oak-studded hills and grazing cattle. the cayucos chamber of commerce proudly serves as a cornerstone in the growth and preservation of this unique beachside community. cayucos is a peaceful haven and a true california original, offering a perfect retreat for those seeking simplicity, serenity, and a connection to nature.
