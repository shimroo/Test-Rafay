over 50 years of policy researchtprc promotes interdisciplinary thinking on current and emerging issues in communications and the internet by disseminating and discussing new research relevant to policy questions in the u.s. and around the world. it serves researchers, policymakers, and members of the private sector and civil society, from students to well-established practitioners.








why tprc?



tprc is a more than an annual conference. it’s a community of individuals dedicated to researching pressing issues facing the digital world today.  here’s what some of our members have to say:













nonpartisan"tprc is the world’s foremost conference in its field: where policy begins, orthodoxy ends, facts matter and partisanship has no place." eli noam, director, columbia institute for tele-information

 











international dimensionkrishna jayakar of pennsylvania state university has presented multiple papers at tprc, including research on broadband adoption for people with disabilities that went on to reach policy audiences around the globe. jayakar says he’s a “big fan” of the conference, which “attracts a wider and broader perspective than any other. it's great to get feedback from industry and policymakers as well as other scholars,” he continues, “and tprc has a real international dimension. "

  











fresh perspectivesdave clark, of mit’s computer science and artificial intelligence lab has published a number of influential papers on internet architecture. “i got hooked on the conference a long time ago,” he says. “tprc is a wonderful venue for anyone who is serious about undertaking multi-disciplinary research in telecommunications. the range of people who [attend] will broaden your thinking and give you fresh perspectives.”
