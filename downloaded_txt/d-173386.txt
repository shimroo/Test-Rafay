monitoring, alert notification and data logging
              technologies designed for demanding applications



since 1976, hampshire controls has been a
              leading us-based designer of high quality, nist-traceable
              calibrated sensor-based monitoring, alert notification, and data
              logging systems.
our products include single and multi-probe systems
              for monitoring a comprehensive range of conditions; including
              temperature, humidity, chemical concentration (e.g., co2%),
              pressure, flow rate, voltage, current, etc. hampshire controls
              delivers monitors and alert notification systems with unparalleled
              accuracy, resolution, and repeatability using the specific suite
              of sensors required for your application.
hampshire controlsâ monitoring, alert notification, and logging
              systems are used in research laboratories, in hospitals, for food
              processing and storage, in pharmaceutical manufacturing and
              biologic storage, and in blood banks. they are also used within
              cryogenic dewars and mechanical ultra-low temperature (ult)
              freezers, in test chambers, in biosafety cabinets, in batch and
              inline ovens, and to oversee a wide range of industrial
              manufacturing materials and processes.
our renowned tâ° sentry products are used in
              precision temperature and humidity monitoring systems. these
              systems are often used as stand-alone continuous monitoring and
              alert notification systems, or they can be integrated into
              hampshire controlsâ tâ°
                  sentry alert  monitoring system
              lan-based data logging software to allow you to monitor, alarm,
