Â 

cavin-morris gallery has been exhibiting contemporary artists from around the world for almost 40 years. we specialize in the work of contemporary artists who do not intentionally make art for the art world mainstream canon. we represent past and new generations of artists whose work ultimately feels timeless to us.we show an eclectic selection of tribal art from all the major regions of the world, focusing on the unusual and the formally surprising, focusing on the arts of masking.we also concentrate on both functional and non-functional contemporary ceramics. we are especially interested in the way certain ceramists push the envelope in their expression of traditional forms and cultures. we show work by western ceramic artists, as well as works by artists from japan, korea, and china.the common thread that connects all this art is its uniqueness, its integrity, visionary authenticity, and its reflection of cultural homeground. we look for the place where labels become irrelevant and the work remains urgent, immediate, and singular.
