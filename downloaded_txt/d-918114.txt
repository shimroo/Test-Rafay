welcome to sanctuary climbing & fitness.

 






























































 











a new beginning
sanctuary rock gym was established in 1996, making it one of the first 100 indoor climbing gyms in the united states.  in 2019, after losing our location of 23 years to redevelopment plans, we proudly announced the  opening of a fresh new state-of-the-art facility with all the good stuff! we were super stoked and excited to get everyone back on the walls! we opened february 10, 2020-which happened to be 1 year to the day that we closed the doors and said good-bye to our first location in sand city. we were offering a full schedule of climbing & over 50 fitness classes a week and our aerial program had just begun. it was awesome! or as we liked to call it, sanctuary 2.0! and then - the floor fell out and the world changed and covid-19 rearranged everyone’s’ plans for 2020 and once again, we were forced to close just 6 short weeks after we reopened.  with the kindness, generosity and grace of the owners and management of university plaza and the support of our generous members, we have been able to weather the storm and we are once again looking forward to welcoming everyone back to the brand new-ish sanctuary climbing & fitness.welcome to sanctuary 3.0.like they say, the third one’s a charm!!michael ‘spike’ & deirdre bascou



 




 

sanctuary 2.0



in 2019, after 3+ years of searching, we successfully locked in a 20 year lease on this amazing space in the university plaza shopping center at 1760 fremont boulevard in seaside, california. the new space is over 10,000 sq. ft., twice the size of our first location. it had been recently remodeled from top to bottom, allowing us to invest the savings in the best climbing walls, equipment and amenities we could find. you’re going to love it! our new walls were built by the world leading manufacturer of climbing walls for the past 30 years, entre prises usa, in bend, oregon, the official wall builders for the 2021 olympics.  the walls were designed, manufactured and installed by climbers, all here in the usa, and that makes us feel good! the walls made a 9.5 hour journey from their manufacturer in bend, oregon down into california, across to highway 1 and into seaside on multiple flatbed trailers. super cool! our state-of-the-art safety flooring was installed by a super team from flashed flooring- also official suppliers to the olympics. 

 

10k+square footage siteclift wall, tread wall, strength area, functional training arch, aerial silks, led moon board, auto-belays, and more!

 

26years serving the communitywe’re looking forward to seeing you all again and providing you with the brand new state-of-the-art sanctuary climbing & fitness!

  

159+parking spotswe have 159+ parking spots right outside our front door with an all new led lighting and camera security system. it’s super convenient and safe!
