❤️ “just wanted to send a shout out and support for this website! i met my love through your site over 9 years ago. he is canadian, i'm american, i thought it would never work. now we are both married and living together in canada and forever grateful for your site! <3”
❤️ “i just wanted to let you know that your website is the 2nd best thing that happened to claire and i!  the first, of course, is that we met each other on veggieconnection in 2017, fell in love, and married in 2018!  thank you so much veggieconnection.com!
marc”
❤️ “i want to thank you. my husband and i met on your site and our 10th anniversary is this year :)”
❤️ “i met someone on this site about a week after updating my profile, and we have been inseparable ever since.  this was only possible due to the focus of your site bringing like minded people together.”
❤️ “i first joined veggieconnection (omisinurheart) after not having luck on other vegan sites.  few guys caught my attention and i never looked globally... only 200 mile radius. then one day, a view from another activist and vegan caught my eye. he was from canada and he was sooo much like me. i added him to my favorites and to my surprise he added me back and messaged me a real message.  we talked via veggieconnection and moved to emails and phone shortly after.  skype was next and i found myself falling for him. we were so similar and had the same views on almost everything. i felt like he was the male version of me.

         now as i type this,  i am sitting clear across the continent from new york to british columbia right next to my soulmate devin. devin (shadowski) and i made our first visit together back in may. we are planning to move in together this october and fight for animal rights while becoming better vegans.  thank you so much for bringing us together. i'd never know this love without him and your site.”
❤️ “i would like to express my gratitude to veggieconnection website, which helped me find my  significant other. we've been married for 3 years now and have a one-year-old boy who is constantly making us happy. i wish success to everyone here who are looking to find their life partner.”
❤️ “hi!  i am so thankful to your website for. finding me the love of my life. we are engaged now and getting married in september.”
❤️ “hello! my name is katie, and i met met the love of my life (christian), my soulmate, and my everything on veggie connection july 29th! since then, we have traveled over 30,000 miles combined to see each other. he proposed to me 4 days ago on july 23rd. i couldn't be anymore blessed, happy, and overjoyed! we are incredibly happy together, and all of our loved ones are equally happy! we would love to share our full story with you guys, and would love to be contacted if you're interest in seeing photos of us, learning about our back story, or hearing our extreme thanks and gratitude for being the site that brought us together. we're very thankful! thank you again.”
❤️ “i met my soulmate - they do exist - on this site. she goes under the name monona (hope you don't mind me putting that in there honey), she is the best person i have ever met, and we are very much in love. so this site does work...thank you very much veggie connection!”
❤️ “my name is traye, and i have met the love my life! about five months ago, we met on veggieconnection.com. wayne and i have continued to talk for hours every day, and we met in person in august! i have returned to reno, and wayne is moving out in december so we can be together! i hope you guys know how much i am grateful to you for allowing me to find such an incredible guy who is perfect for me. thanks for changing my life - traye”
❤️ “i found the most amazing man here at veggieconnection and we'll be moving in together next month.  thank you veggieconnection!”
❤️ “we met on veggiconnection on december 1st when maruko (real name yvonne) sent me a greeting. her being from indonesia, and i from the us, i couldn't imagine this as being more than a nice pen-pal kind of relationship. over the next few months, we found we shared many values, so i flew to indonesia and spent 3 weeks getting to know her in person, meeting family, and getting a feel for the culture of her homeland.

we spent nearly a year communicating online before her fiance visa was approved, so we had lots of time to learn more about each other and to probe all the non-physical aspects of a relationship.

on february 28th, she and her son richard arrived here in honolulu. on april 13th, we were married, but we both feel that we were married in a more personal way back when we were together in indonesia.

i think that the values that brought both of us to veggieconnection were more fundamental predictors of relationship success than anything an eharmony or the like could ever come up with. we're looking forward to many adventures together and to spend the rest of our lives together.

keith and yvonne

❤️ “just wanted to let you know that we met through vc.  he was looking for someone in england  and found my profile by accident.  when i saw he'd looked at my profile but not left a message, i contacted him.  over the last year we both crossed the atlantic a few times and when richard came back in march we decided to get married - the ceremony was a couple of weeks ago and richard's dogs arrived last week.    if it wasn't for you we would have never met.  thank you so much.

mindy”
❤️ “last august, as a part of my birthday resolution i joined veggieconnection.com in order to open myself up towards the possibility of an ideal relationship.  within 24 hours of joining i met imani707.  we have discovered that we are extremely compatible and happy together.  we were engaged on 12-15 and will be getting married on 5-17.  thank you veggieconnection!!”
❤️ “i found my perfect partner through veggieconnection.com. we are now married. thank you veggieconnection.com.”
❤️ “at one point in our lives, we both (giannis & othmantus) seemed to have lost all hopes to find true love, but this site allowed us, unexpectedly, to find each other in the end. although living worlds apart (culturally and geographically), the unique organization of this site helped to establish quickly a strong connection between us. thus, were overcome the first hurdles on our relationship, which finally saw flourishing a true passion that pushed othmantus to come all the way from singapore (south east asia) to montreal (canada), where our first meeting was wholly successful. we quickly came to realize that our first impression was right and that we are indeed meant for each other. we are now preparing for me (giannis) to relocate to singapore and for us to get married and happy there.

we are grateful to veggieconnection and we both would like to encourage people around the vegetarian community (and beyond) to become a member of this great community. we would like again to thank this site, because its
 truly a wonderful job done. at first, doubts clouded our hearts as to whether or not we could find what we were looking for. in the end, our similarities of being vegetarians and open minded families have allowed us to become a couple of perfect lovers. on top of this winning scenario only a bit of sense of humor and enthusiasm is good enough to warm our hearts up tremendously. well live together next year and the romance shall continue.may you all find true love with veggieconnection.”
❤️ “i have a success story i wanted to share with you. in the summer i met doug on veggieconnection.com. two years later, i have moved from atlanta, georgia to victoria, british columbia and we are planning our wedding for september 22! there is certainly more to it than that, but i don't have much time to write about it at the moment.

thanks for your site. sure worked for us! i'll send photos from the wedding later on.”
❤️ “settling down with a meat eater wasn't an option for either of us. thanks to this site it didnt have to be. we exchanged messages at first and talked about all things veggie environmental and generally any thing else. it wasn't too long before we decided to meet up (july 30th). we have been seeing each other since and are extremely happy together!”
❤️ “just wanted to thank you for your service. i met my future husband - nimai @ veggie connection and we are to be wed in september!”
❤️ “i found the love of my life on veggieconnection. her name is lena, and we plan to marry this year. she is the most fantastic person i have ever met in my life. we have been together a year in february. i love her so much i just can't tell you! seriously, veggieconnection works.”
❤️ “fitandtrim and len are together now thanks to veggie connection. our first meeting was on february 19. after exchanging a few emails we decided to meet our first time at a chamber music concert at a church we both know. we went to a nearby restaurant afterwards to share a veggie sandwich. we quickly realized we have many interests in common and have been together ever since. we rotate visits to our respective homes, usually on weekends, depending on the activities we plan. we are so happy together and the intimacy we share is incredible!

we know that this was a match made possible by your astute team, but we think it was a union made in heaven!

thanks! thanks! thanks!”
❤️ “i met someone on your site nearly two years ago - we emailed, phoned, met, fell in love and now live together, firstly in england and now in ireland. no wedding bells just yet but you never  know - anyway i'm a big advocate of internet dating and of your site so thanks and all the best!”
❤️ “surprise! i don't know if we can claim some sort of record yet but........we met through veggieconnection.com 6 months ago. bizarrely snookums lives in england and bigbluemarble in new england, a mere 3250 miles apart! neither of us were looking beyond 100 miles and certainly not considering re-locating...but after you featured bigbluemarble, snookums just had this impulse to send a message. bigbluemarble responded almost instantly and we got into an immediate pattern of sending daily e-mail letters to each other...

despite the distance we have now met 4 times (snookums is in new england at the moment) and are simply 'in love' and are planning to be together permanently in the near future.

this could never of happened without veggieconnection.com... we are deeply indebted to your website... attached is a photo taken 04/11/05 at the top of mount monadnock, new hampshire.”
❤️ “just wanted to say thank-you, i was a member on yer site a while back and i found my husband to be [on veggieconnection.com]. we will be married on april fools day, just wanted to say thanks, don't know how we would have met if not for your web site : )”
