a little history 
						about us!
we are a small family 
						business started in 1976 run right out of our house. in 
						1986 we built a warehouse in doylestown and the rest is 
						history. since then we have tried to stay true to not 
						only the parts but the customers as well. we want to see 
						you get the correct part that you need/want for a price 
						that you can feel okay about. the industry is not what 
						it used to be but we try our hardest to obtain them.
						all we ask is that you be patient with us.

if you are restoring 
				or modifying a 55-56-57 chevy, you owe it to yourself to 
				check out 
				our catalog. link 
				here
our catalog 
					reflects a 100 plus years of experience, not just selling 
					parts, but using these parts every day in our shop and on 
					our own personal cars. over 200 
					pages packed full of most of the items you will need. for 
					years we were printing out our catalog but with the economy 
					being what it is and the constant changing of prices we can 
					no longer print them. however if you click the link above 
					you can view the entire book covers and all.                 
(however prices are 
				still subject to change without notification.) 
our website is not an 
				online store it really just showcases our digital catalog but 
				hopefully will contain the information that you need in order to 
				purchase the correct parts.
happy hunting!!


we accept visa, mastercard and discover credit cards 
				(no american express), cash and money orders. 
                we only accept in state checks and they will be held for a 
                minimum of seven business days for the check to clear the bank.
