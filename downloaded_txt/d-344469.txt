      supporting peacebuilding in zimbabwe    




















 
the zimbabwe information centre (zic) informs australians about current developments in zimbabwe. we support organisations in zimbabwe advocating for good governance, embracing diversity, and building an inclusive society, with fair distribution of wealth and benefits, equality for all and human rights for all.
we work in partnership with the zimbabwe peacebuilding initiative (zimpi). working with government and with member organisations of around 750,000 people, zimpi fosters ‘synergies for peace with justice, safety, security, green entrepreneurship, happiness and prosperity for all’. peacebuilding is a tool to bring zimbabweans together and resolve intergenerational challenges as one society, building on traditional values of ubuntu.
"africans have this thing called ubuntu... the essence of being human. it is part of the gift that africans will give the world. it embraces hospitality, caring about others, willing to go the extra mile for the sake of others. we believe a person is person through another person, that my humanity is caught up, bound up and inextricable in yours. when i dehumanise you i inexorably dehumanise myself. the solitary individual is a contradiction in terms and, therefore, you seek to work for the common good because your humanity comes into its own community, in belonging." archbishop desmond tutu
