monoglass incorporated
spray applied thermal & acoustic insulation products

the original sprayed fiberglass insulation, since 1979.


monoglass spray-on insulation was developed in 1979 when mr. douglas eyrl recognized a need for a spray-applied fiberglass insulation that could provide higher r-values with easier application than the cellulose-based spray insulations in use at the time. the result was a versatile, safe and effective thermal and acoustic product that would better meet the needs of architects and installing contractors alike.
 
our products are fiberglass based, non-combustible, and contain 58% recycled glass content.  our reliability and competitive pricing has made monoglass spray-on insulation the choice for architects, engineers, specification writers, and building owners since 1979.
 
monoglass products are used in many countries worldwide. follow the links to find out more about our insulation products, their benefits, and uses.


new!  monoglass spray-on insulation and sonoglass acoustic treatment are now listed in the product masterspec online system, making specifying our products simple.   read our post for more information
