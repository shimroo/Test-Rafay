database speed, power & simplicity
panorama x combines the best elements of database and spreadsheet technology into a single package, making it an unparalleled tool for collecting, manipulating and analyzing any kind of information. like a spreadsheet, panorama x is ram based for speed and flexibility, but with all of the data processing power of a full-blown database application and more.




ram based performance
there's one key difference between panorama x and every other database program out there: panorama x is ram-based, not disk-based. you read that correctly â panorama x performs all database operations completely in your computer's high speed ram, never touching the much slower mechanical disk or ssd drive (of course changes are regularly auto-saved for safety). you'll see incredible performance when sorting, searching, performing analysis, and even when doing complete data restructuring. massive tasks that would be impossibly slow when using other database software become routine.



even if a database already contains tens of thousand of records, panorama x can quickly conquer tasks like shifting misaligned data, splitting or merging fields, correcting misformatted or improperly capitalized data, search and replace, phonetic searches or even searching with a formula or regular expression. it's like a swiss army knife for your data!


modern user interface
the origins of panorama go back in 1984, but if you've used an earlier version of panorama, it's time to look again. panorama x has been completely rebuilt as a mac-only app (ð¯% appkit), all new from the ground up with a timeless new design, delightful, easy-to-use and consistent interactions, all wrapped up with the latest ui goodness from apple.
"panorama x is a conscientiously modern cocoa app." â¦ "panorama x, with its brilliant undo stack, shows how a properly implemented cocoa app can provide total freedom from fear as you perform sweeping changes on huge amounts of data."
matt neuburg (book author: programming ios 15)

even with a million record database, scrolling is smooth and responsive. graphics are crisp, sharp and retina-ready, and all the hallmarks of a modern macos application are included: 64-bit, customizable toolbars, inspector panels, full-screen mode, complete unicode support, even multi-level undo!













get started fast
panorama x makes simple tasks easy and difficult tasks possible. with panorama's intuitive, spreadsheet-like data sheet view, you can get your first database up and running in less than a minute. you can start from scratch or import existing data in comma-separated (csv), tab-separated (tsv), or json format. as your needs and abilities grow, you can add custom layouts and programming to create database applications tailor-made to your exact specifications. take your personalized panorama experience as far as you want to go. you'll be guided every step of the way by the detailed documentation and quick start video training guides.


multi-level undo
panorama x is the first database program ever to support universal, multi-level undo. you can feel free to work quickly with no worries about making mistakes, because panorama x always keeps a safety net there for you. multi-level undo isn't restricted to small changes â any operation you perform in panorama x can be instantly reversed, including:

data entry
inserting and deleting records
inserting, deleting, merging and splitting fields
sorting, searching & bulk data modification
graphics and code modifications

if you need to reverse changes over a longer period, panorama also supports revert to saved (not just the most recently saved version, but any previously saved version using the standard time machine interface).
			












deep searching
panorama x can easily search all fields in a database or any combination of specific fields. text fields can be searched for complete or partial matches, or even searched phonetically or using a regular expression. fields can be compared to each other as well as to fixed values. multiple searches can be combined for very specific results, and for advanced searching boolean formulas can be used. search results are updated live, as you type, even for the most complex and advanced searches.


interactive data analysis
data outlines are a unique feature that summarize raw data in a multi-level outline, with each higher level corresponding to higher level categorizations of the data. the outline is interactive, so it can be collapsed to show overall trends or selectively expanded to reveal specific details at lower levels. summary levels in the outline can be further processed by sorting or selection, making it easy to answer questions like who were the top five sales associates in each region last quarter? or which sectors are growing the fastest internationally?













data visualization & analytics


panorama x's visualization and analytics tools transform raw data into actionable intelligence. watch the data visualization & analytics video to see how you can unleash the potential value that is hidden in plain sight in your data.
analytic tables
summary tables reshape unorganized data into concise tabular analysis, including computations of subtotals, averages, standard deviation and more. crosstab tables provide two dimensional data visualization, for example spending vs. month or income vs. age. both types of analytic tables enable rapid, interactive exploration of your data space. all analytical tables remain bound to the raw data, so you can instantly drill into and audit the backing detail behind any summarized value.



charts & graphs
often the best way to really understand complex data is to plot it with a chart or a graph, and panorama x makes that easy, automatically transforming raw data into chartable form according to your specifications. chart options include bar, stacked bar, line, area, stacked area and pie charts.
live chart interaction
you can hover over any chart element to display the actual numeric data value of that element, enable and disable individual chart elements, and even zoom in to examine chart details. watch the charts & graphs video to see live chart interaction and to learn how to embed charts into a database form with custom graphics.













custom layouts
panorama x's complete suite of drawing and layout tools allow you to rapidly design and create custom windows, dialogs, forms, labels, and custom reports. you have complete control over the layout and, if necessary, any programming you need. layouts can be fixed or responsive to window size. programming code can be embedded into any element, much like hypercardâ¢. available layout elements include:




shapes
text
styled text
images
push buttons
checkbox buttons
radio buttons
icon buttons
popup menus




segmented buttons
slider
stepper
level indicator
progress indicator
tab panels
web browser
tables (text list)
matrix


 
 
if you've ever used apple's powerful xcode interface builder, you'll be instantly familiar with how the panorama application builder works. to add a new graphics object, simply drag it onto the layout, then use the inspector panels to configure, including adding code.


automation
here at provue, we're big believers in automation. if a task is going to be performed more than 2 or 3 times, automation is the best way to ensure that the task is performed rapidly and accurately. that's why every aspect of panorama x operation can be automated â database manipulation, modifying database structure, even graphical layout tasks can be automated.
recordability
basic automation doesn't require any programming at all. just turn on the "watch me" recorder and panorama will automatically write the code for you as you search, sort, and perform other database tasks. the recorded code is automatically added to the action menu, where it can be played back at any time. it can also be attached to a button, or set up to trigger when a specific event occurs.
programmability
for advanced users, panorama x includes a full-featured  programming language, including conditional logic, subroutines, alerts and dialogs, full menu control, debug instrumentation, background timers, asynchronous internet access, and much much more. you can even integrate code written in applescript, shell script, python, ruby, php and more.














panorama server
panorama server makes it possible for multiple users to work together on a database as a team. the server coordinates access to the database so that everyone in your organization can work together seamlessly. whether you have two, five, or dozens of users, the server keeps everything organized so that users can modify data without interfering with each other, and everyone has the most up-to-date data at their fingertips when they need it. panorama x server unlocks the power of panorama for multi-user teams of any size.
panorama server database sharing allows multiple users to share one or more databases in cooperation. each user access the data through their own copy of panorama x on their computer. the server keeps everything organized so that multiple users can view and modify data without interfering with each other and keeping everything up-to-date, while still enabling blazing fast ram based searching, sorting and data analysis on each users computer. users can share data across a local network or even across the internet.
database web publishing allows information stored in a panorama database to be viewed and modified using a web browser â safari, chrome, firefox, etc. with database web publishing your databases can reach a global audience â anyone with a browser on any type of device and/or operating system.


relational
panorama includes full support for relational database structures, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and range-to-one relationships. once a relationship has been established between two databases, that relationship can be used to quickly select data that corresponds to the current database, to display related information in a form or report, to accelerate data entry of related information (including cross-database clairvoyanceâ¢), to post updated data to a related database, and to perform super fast full joins between two databases (including inner and outer joins). relational keys are not limited to a single field, and can even be defined with a formula (allowing two databases to be linked even if they don't have the exact same field structure).

















bulk data modification
panorama allows huge data sets to be bent, reshaped or refactored at will. fields can be added, removed, rearranged, hidden, merged or split at any time. entire datasets can be rapidly altered based on parsing/manipulation rules set up from pop-up menus (advanced users can also use arbitrary formulas and regular expressions). typical examples include:

swapping first and last names
splitting combined names into separate first/last names
merging adjacent fields
shifting misaligned columns
search & replace words, phrases or regular expression patterns
normalizing format of phone numbers
removing extraneous punctuation
fixing incorrect capitalization
add or remove prefixes & suffixes
adding sequence numbers (1, 2, 3, â¦)
recalculating entire field (with formula)
running totals & differences
filling in missing values
removing duplicate information
modify all fields in a single operation

multiple parsing/manipulation rules can be chained together for complex transformations, and sets of parsing/manipulation rules can be saved for later re-use. proposed modifications are previewed in real time as they are changed, and actual database manipulation occurs at 10k-50k records per second (when working with single user databases).


easy & accurate data entry
panorama x streamlines data entry with features like clairvoyanceâ¢ (auto-complete), automatic capitalization, input and output patterns, default values and the unique smart date feature that understands human friendly dates like today, friday or last monday.
regular expressions
panorama x includes full support for industry-standard regular expressions, enabling powerful and lightning fast pattern match based searches and search/replace. there are literally thousands of regular expression pattern matching examples online (as well as books) that you can plug directly into panorama x.
geographical data
if your data contains addresses, panorama x can display it on a map. databases that contain latitude/longitude data can be searched for proximity to specific locations â what airports are within 200 miles of san francisco? if a database contains addresses within the united states, approximate proximity searches can be performed based on the zip code (lat/long data not required). panorama can also look up the city and state for a zip code.













64 bit high capacity
panorama x databases contain no indexes, so they are extremely space efficient (high speed ram operation makes indexes unnecessary). in fact, panorama databases can typically store five to ten thousand records per megabyte of ram, allowing panorama to easily handle extremely large databases. (one of the databases shown in the demo movie contains registration details for all 314,000 aircraft in the united states in only 81 megabytes.)
flexible import & export
panorama x can import text files in comma-separated (csv), tab-separated (tsv), or json format. export supports the same formats plus html. data can be automatically restructured as it is imported or exported to match up with external programs (for example re-arranging, merging or splitting fields as the data is imported or exported). 
database integrity seal
panorama x embeds a tamper proof integrity seal in every database document file. if a document is tampered with in any way (either deliberately or due to hardware failure) you will be notified immediately.


aes-256 encryption
panorama x can optionally encrypt your sensitive data and proprietary custom code for maximum security.

frequently asked questions (faq)









why is panorama x ram based?




your computer has two kinds of memory: ram and disk. even if your system has a ssd instead of a mechanical disk drive, ram memory is still thousands of times faster. panorama takes full advantage of this speed by loading entire databases into ram memory. unlike other database software, panorama never touches the disk drive once the database is open. all searching, sorting, editing, and everything else occurs directly in your computer's high speed ram.







how do i start the free trial?




to start the 7 day free trial, simply download and copy to the applications folder. you don't need to give us a credit card, email address or any other information, just get started. (note: the 7 days of your free trial don't have to be consecutive.).







how do i purchase panorama x?




when you're ready to buy, purchasing credits for your panorama x account is done in the app itself (not on the web). simply choose site license from the panorama menu, create a new account (if you haven't done so already), then click on the payments panel. see creating a new panorama x account and managing your panorama x account to learn more.







how much does panorama x cost?




only a few dollars a month, and nothing if you don't use it during a particular month. see affordable pricing below.







how much will future upgrades cost?




nada. zip. zilch. all upgrades are included with your active account, and panorama x can automatically update itself when new versions are available (with your approval, of course).










how much data can fit in ram?




a lot. panorama's efficient storage techniques can pack from 3 to 15 thousand records in each megabyte of memory, so on even an older 4 gb computer that is up to 60 million records. as a real world example, the panorama x intro video shows a demo database that packs all 313,000 aircraft registered in the entire united states into only 81 megabytes â only enough to fill a tiny percentage of ram on modern mac systems.







can i import my existing data?




yes. if you've been using panorama 6, your databases will import directly into panorama x (including data, forms, and procedures). if you've been using another database or spreadsheet program, panorama can import text data in csv (comma separated), tsv (tab separated) or json format.







can i export data from panorama x?




yes. panorama can export text data in csv (comma separated), tsv (tab separated), json and html format, as well as pdf. the format of the exported data can be customized into any format.







what platforms does panorama x run on?




panorama x is available for macintosh systems running macos 10.12 or later.







what documentation is available?




panorama x includes extensive written and video documentation, available both within the application itself and on the web..
