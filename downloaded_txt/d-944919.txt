mobile app development – what is it.


the concept of developing mobile applications for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices includes writing software code in order to create programs that will run on certain mobile platforms (today there are 2 main platforms for mobile operating systems – android and ios, and the less popular windows phone and symbian). these programs and applications can be preinstalled on mobile phones, personal digital assistants, corporate digital assistants, smartphones and other mobile devices before the devices fall into the hands of the user, or downloaded by users to the device directly during use.
the user interface of mobile applications plays a very important role in the process of creating an application, because the interface is the link between the hardware and software of the mobile device and the focus of user interaction.
apart from smartphones, we can also refer to mobile gadgets and mobile devices as tablets, electronic watches, fitness trackers, and a huge number of new gadgets, which appear more and more every year – for example, glasses with augmented reality and smart tv. all of these devices often also use our main 2 platforms, and applications for them can be attributed to mobile development.
