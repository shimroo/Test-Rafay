the art of motion control

"motion control" is an industry term for computer-controlled movement in applications like robotics and cnc.  this technology has revolutionized industrial production and design,  but until more recent times, its complexity and expense has placed it out of the reach of most artists.i have spent the past 30 years dedicated to exploring motion control as a medium for artistic expression, building cnc art  tools and kinetic sculpture that combine my love of art, science and education.sisyphus tables:  http://www.sisyphus-industries.com/
