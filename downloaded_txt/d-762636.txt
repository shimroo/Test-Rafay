moved into my new apartment last saturday.  been here for a week!  finally got the internet up yesterday. but its very screwy.  keeps shutting on and off.  ive had this problem before.  uh, so far the digs is pretty nice.  i like the freedom.  the gas in my car is lasting longer.  i have spent a lot of money for this place.  but i wont be spending too much as of now.  cause i bought most of my stuff for it.got lots of plans for the upcomming months.  i might go to a better shift, with better hours.  and i want to go see trans siberian this year!money money money.anyways...cheers!

well not really, but things are looking good.  money wise.  i finally got my raise, my last check was uh...very nice.  to say the least.  oh and not too long ago (about 2 weeks ago), my supervisor resigned.  lol.  i woke up late, and i rushed out and called my supervisor.  to say that i'm gonna be late.  and he didn't answer.  so i'm like "w/e."  i get there and i clock in, (1 min late).  the operations manager comes up to me and asks why i was late, and i tell him that i just woke up late.  and he's cool with it.  then he proceeds to tell me that gordon resigned earlier today.  and my eyes are filled with excitement.  i go to where everyone is working and they are all smiles.  the team lead says, "hey damian *heeehee*, did you hear what happened?"  and yea.  so we're still short a supervisor.  and a new guy started monday.  so we have 2 guys that are new.  that means lots of overtime.  :dum, i'm getting back into my piano.  trying to learn it all over again.  or from what i remember back in the day.  i'm currently working on moonlight sonata.  lol!  i'll get it.  i have 10% of it figured out.  i love the piano.also, those ciabatta burgers from jack in the crack sucks ass.  don't ever buy them. i threw it out the window while i was driving home from work (4am).going to six flags today (hopefully).  got my season pass and rdy 2 go.  i'm hoping to buy a laptop soon.  nothing expensive though.  i just want my own computer and shit.  ok i have nothing else.bye.
