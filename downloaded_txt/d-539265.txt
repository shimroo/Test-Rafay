more testimonials










“november 5, 2024 – i cannot express enough gratitude for the exceptional support provided by azcops, azcops’ attorney steve serbalik, and steve’s staff, aaron and max. after over twenty years in law enforcement, facing the challenges of a medical retirement process can be overwhelming. the team at azcops was not only committed to serving me but also to truly understanding and telling my story to the retirement board. their dedication to capturing the nuances of my service and experiences made all the difference. in a system often mired in bureaucracy, their expertise and commitment ensured my voice was heard and my story accurately represented. i genuinely believe that without azcops’ representation, i would have faced a much less than favorable outcome. their work is invaluable to those of us who have dedicated our lives to service, and i am forever grateful for their support and professionalism.” 



-jason (retired police officer) 











latest news 








				the d.o.j. released the phoenix report			




the u.s. department of justice just released their report into the phoenix police department. the only problem? the report is inaccurate. like so many cities before phoenix, the doj is hoping to bully city leaders into cooperation, without releasing proof of the allegations made.







				syncing personal phones to government vehicles			




as agencies update their fleets, and more officers are familiar with the technology allowing phones and vehicles to communicate (no pun intended), new considerations pop up that police need to be aware of. this video addresses an issue that just about every member of the leo profession might encounter, even if a sheriff’s deputy or state trooper doesn’t have any cell service in most places they patrol. check it out!






				starting and stopping off duty jobs			




off duty jobs have become popular in the law enforcement community. cops, sheriff’s deputies, and troopers everywhere have taken advantage of the request for certified leos by private organizations. this is a benefit to police officers and can be a great thing in their lives.
however, with these new situations, new questions and scenarios have arose.
we did a video about having lights in a personal vehicle for off duty jobs. this week, we want to address when an officer may want to check on, and off, from an off duty job, and why.
check it out!
