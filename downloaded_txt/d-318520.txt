opportunities
we function as a co-operative arrangement
of self-motivated professionals. salary is strictly performance-based,
with bonuses.
contracts are available in the us, the
uk and the republic of china (taiwan) for talented programmers with 370
bal, jovial or c experience (air traffic system experience a plus). all
employment inquiries should include
a current resume and a cover letter.



the history
in 1986, several of us formed a little recreational
programming club. we got together on thursday nights, when our significant
others were otherwise occupied. we called it "the thursday night club".
our most common criticism of each other's designs was "yeah, but that would
be overkill" (and then we'd implement it anyway). when we suddenly realized
that "the thursday night club" was a really lame name, we jokingly
called ourselves "overkill, incorporated". we wrote recreational
software and a collection of ibm cms utilities that have been in use ever
since in more than 20 air traffic sites in england and the usa.
in 1987, we decided to formalize the club
into a legal partnership, invest in 5 atari mega sts and develop marketable
software. we registered the name "overkill", became official atari
3rd party developers and churned out a couple small utilities and a shareware
game of risk. we had struck agreements with university of delaware (for
a graphics terminal emulator) and avalon hill (for an adaptation of one
of their board games) when our "day jobs" separated us. we were suddenly
spread from nj to boston, florida and england. the partnership dissolved
into a sole proprietorship and eventually became inactive. we now refer
to this venture (with mixed nostalgia and regret) as overkill "classic".
overkill uk, ltd. was formed in
1991, first as an invoicing mechanism and then approved by the civil aviation
authority in 1992 to bid contracts at the london air traffic control centre.
john became the first full-time employee, followed immediately by corrine.
overkill us was formed in march of '93 allowing us to bid on contracts
at the hughes faa technical center
in nj. our status as 
guice associates has enabled us to participate in
a number of successful programs in the us, uk and republic of china.
bill and john have been a part of each
incarnation of overkill to date.



the name
overkill is a memorable name that confuses
the suits. at least it's better than "the thursday night club uk, ltd."
for further information, see the
history.



racing sponsors
overkill sponsored a local stock car racing
team, and we occasionally made the trip to support the company colors on
the track.
 

game nights

it is an age-old company tradition to gather
several times a year for an evening of ridicule and humiliation in the
form of "friendly competition".
cosmic encounter has provided some entertaining
(and nearly violent) evenings.
at some of our game nights, we've had the
privilege of alpha- and beta- testing various new board and computer games
including an unreleased cosmic encounter expansion, the city of heroes expansion city of villains, and several quake enhancements.
we sponsor a fleet in star trek online.
we used to have christmas/hannuka/kwanzaa/candlemas/festivus dinner at the philadelphia
dave and buster's, but as they're particularly uncooperative for small businesses (and we have more pinball machines than they do),
we decided to change venues each year.
here are pics from the 1997,  
1999,
2001,
2007 and
2008,
2018,
dinners.  pictures from 1998 and 2003 were lost, the 2000 dinner never actually happened, (2002 pictures may eventually surface here) 
and no one bothered to take pictures of the 2005 party (in 2006), we forgot to take pictures of the 2009 event in 2010, and only have the police artist sketch of the 2010 event in 2011.  the 2011 event in 2012 was too loud to photograph, and (mumble, mumble) through 2023.   
i hope you were paying attention, this will be on the final.
