long island’s premier business development network














closing the deal begins with the right relationship.



for some, business is all numbers... leads, revenue, closing ratios, profits, costs.  but smart business people know better.  they understand the human side of business: relationships, trust, fun, and even friendships. and while the mathematics can define how successful you are in business, it is the human side that initiates that success. with the sum being the shake of a hand. or the wave of a pen. welcome to the long island business exchange, where business owners and sales executives meet and exchange ideas, opportunities and business leads in a confidential, professional and fun environment. 














bring in the deal that makes the difference in your business, with linx.



so how do you make your mark?  and become that one person that others unconsciously rely on and automatically refer?  it’s not just networking… it’s much more than that.  isn’t it time to build those ironclad relationships that truly generate the revenue you deserve?














welcome to linx.



don’t take our word for it.  on second thought, take our word for it.



where we meet every other week.



the linx experience: inside track,  roundtables, education/member highlights and  thank yous/action calls… the fuel for business relationships.
