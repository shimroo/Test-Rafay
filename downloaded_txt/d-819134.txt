you can buy cosmetics on line with this tips





buying cosmetics online can be a tricky thing. there are so many  purveyors of different kinds of cosmetic goods that you may at first  feel overwhelmed by your options. there are a few different things you  can do make the process easier.first consider what it is exactly that you're looking for. do you need age  fighting moisturizers or a new lipstick? are you interested in classic  colors in nail polish or the hottest new sparkle lip gloss? it's depend on what you want, you may find that certain companies  manufacture specifically what you are looking for. entering a specific  term into the search engine keyword box like 'eye cream' or 'lip gloss'  rather than 'cosmetics' or 'lotion.' you'll find a more targeted return  of choices in websites to choose from.  be careful of purchasing from individuals or non-manufacturers. you  don't know how long the store has had the product in storage or how it  is stored. unless it is a general store that you trust and you are just looking for  something basic like hand lotion, then well known chains will work well  for you. drugstore.com, for example, is a general purveyor of cosmetic  goods as well as many other things. make sure that there is a return  policy that allows you to get a full refund if you find that the product  is sub par. never buy used cosmetics online. auction sites like ebay are popular  places for people to list 'lots' of mixed cosmetic items, some used and  some not. considering the fact that lipsticks and mascara has a shelf  life of only six months in your own makeup kit, it doesn't make sense to  spend money on someone's used items that are probably already passed  their expiration date.

how you have got boy's attention





when it comes to relating to boy, not everyone is born with  confidence or conversational adeptness. fortunately, with practice and  the following few tried and tested tricks anyone can develop these  skills. have in mind the goal of your conversation before it starts. do you want  to let him know that you’re interested in him? do you just want to  catch up and have a fun? identify the goal and set a strategy for how  you’ll achieve it. one good way to break the ice with a guy is to be totally honest with him and tell him what  your agenda is. for example, if you’re talking to a guy who you have a  crush on and you really want to discover whether he’s single, you could  say something like, “when i walked over here, i promised myself i  wouldn’t leave until i found out if you had a girlfriend or not!” or if  you’re on a date with a guy you’ve just started seeing and your goal is  to be less shy, say something along the lines of, “i was thinking that  i’ve been pretty quiet on our other dates. today i decided i want to let  you know what i’m like.” setting a strategy helps to keep a potentially  unnerving situation in perspective. be the individual you are, not a clone of him. there is nothing more  annoying for a boy than when a girl goes along with everything he says.  don't be afraid to express likes and dislikes or to share opinions. for  example, if a boy asks what you'd like to eat or what movie you'd like  to see, don't automatically respond, "i don't mind" or "whatever you  want". accept his questions as genuine interest in you and give him an  honest response. if you really don't have any preference then it is okay  to say so. your tastes and views do not have to be the same as the guy  you're talking to. you don't have to listen to the same music, or  support the same football team, or agree with his political or religious  beliefs. it's okay to disagree with his opinions as long as you are  respectful. standing up for what you belief in commands respect and it  also gives him the chance to get to know the real you and what you are  passionate about. no one, no matter how pretty, intelligent or funny, gets the response  they want from others all of the time. most of us have some experience  of rejection, but that is what helps us hone our tuning skills! take  comfort from this and don't be disheartened if a boy you like doesn't  reciprocate your interest. the saying "one person's trash is another  person's treasure" rings true here. another saying, "you've got to be in  it to win it", is also true. you don't want to be left wondering what  might have happened if you'd had the courage to go and talk to him, so  take a chance and put yourself on the line! once you've got your boy's attention there are a few tried and tested  tricks for keeping it. the most important thing is to show a genuine  interest in him. smile at him, maintain eye contact, maybe touch his arm  to emphasise a point. people love talking about themselves so try  asking him questions. keep it simple, like, what music do you listen to?  what's it like living at your place? how do you get on with your  family? what's the best holiday you've ever been on? what do you like to  do on weekends? if you are feeling self-confident, an added benefit of  getting a boy to talk about himself is that it takes the spotlight off  you. once he starts confiding you'll feel more relaxed and be able to  talk about yourself too. observe others and then develop your own style. pay attention to the  girls who are more confident and flirtywatch these girls in action and  take note of exactly what they say, do, and even what mannerisms they  use.before you approach a boy give yourself a pep talk. the thoughts we have  influence our mood and our behaviour so concentrate on happy vibes.cheer up  any negative thoughts and substitute them with positive  thoughts. if you anticipate that someone is going to laugh in your face  or find what you are saying boring, you are likely to feel sad  and defeated. if you remember all the compliments you have been given or  a time when you had a friend in stitches laughing, you are likely to  feel happy, calm and confident. visualise success and it's more likely  to occur.

fat loss&weight loss





he human body is composed of a variety of different tissue types  including lean tissues (muscle, bone, and organs) that are metabolically  active, and fat that is sum total weight of  all this constitutes body weight and decrease in percentage of muscle,  fat and bone weight constitutes weight loss. where as decrease in body  fat % constitutes fat loss.standard body weight scales provide a measure of total weight, but  don't determine the lean-to-fat ratio of that weight. standing on most  scales can tell you only if you weigh more than the average person, but  not if that weight is fat or muscle. based only on scale weight, a  250-pound athlete with 8% body fat may be considered "overweight" by a  typical weight chart. such charts are not a good indication of ideal  body weight for general health or for athletic performance.he ideal weight and fat-lean ratio varies considerably for men and  women and by age, but the minimum percent of body fat considered safe  for good health is 5 percent for males and 12% for females. the average  adult body fat is closer to 15 to 18% for men and 22 to 25% for women.athletes tend to be at low end of this scale due to their increased lean  weight . while low levels of body fat seem to be related  to improved performance, body composition alone is not a great predictor  of sports success. body fat among elite athletes varies largely by  sport. there is little evidence of any benefit when men drop under 8%  and women drop under 14 percent body fat.to keep muscle but slowly lose fat, you have to consume plenty of  protein and lower carbohydrate and fat intake. do not eliminate  carbohydrate or fat. they are both still important components to keeping  healthy. it should be spread out over 6 meals (about every 3 hours).  try to consume a bigger percentage of your carbohydrate in your earlier  meals and immediately after training. do not drastically cut your  calories, but reduce them. add about 10% more protein while reducing  carbohydrate by 10-15% for most of your meals. also, choose protein  sources with a lower percentage of fat, such as egg whites, turkey  breast, fish. this will cause your body to start using more fat for  energy instead of carbohydrate, and the extra protein will help prevent  much muscle breakdown for energy.
