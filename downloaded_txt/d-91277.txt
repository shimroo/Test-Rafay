 i'm not sure what delights me more  writing for children or sharing my love of poetry. as one of the original (circa 1997) children's literature sites, this continues to be a great way to share news about my picture books and poetry collections. this site is also my contribution to a vibrant, web-wide effort to emphasize the joy and value (think common core standards!) of poetry for young readers. explore: you'll find resources for teaching, writing, and sharing children's poetry...and the occasional frog-sighting bulletin or sprig of gardening news. something you'd like to see? let me know.                 home     kristine's books     poetry aloud    appearances   teachers/parents     kids     bio     e-mail poetry +plus+ newsletterjoin our list!
