frontline kills rabbits!

 never use frontline if your rabbit has fleas.see our flea page for help with fleas on rabbits. 

effective january 1, 2012, sb 917 prohibits the sale, display or offer for sale or give away as part of a transaction, a live animal on any street, public right-of-way, parking lot, carnival, or boardwalk. sb 917 prevents animal suffering, safeguard the public, and reduce pressure on animal shelters and local governments. text of the bill here.
rabbits or other animals should not be sold at flea markets or by
people on the street trying to sell off litters from their animals.. 

the short list: are rabbits right for you?

rabbits
are wonderful & adorable pets, but very different from dogs or
cats. a rabbit may not fit everybody's situation. they have different
behavior & care needs. learn about the basic differences.
read our 9 rabbit myths poster. our handy shelter poster highlights the main points to consider a rabbit as a housepet. 
a pet rabbit should not live outside. you will be able to enjoy & care for them better when they are inside with you. consider these reasons.
 rabbits are cute & cuddly. are you primarily interested in getting a bunny for your child? find out if a rabbit is good pet for your child. 
rabbits are better suited to certain adults & households. see if you are a match.
 rabbits are not "starter pets". they deserve as much care & attention as a dog or cat that you would keep forever. carefully consider your commitment to keeping a rabbit. read our easter bunny poem. 
although rabbits do not need vaccinations like cats & dogs, they have their own medical concerns due to their unique physiology. 
observe house rabbits in their natural habitat on our video page. 
hop to our library of fliers to learn the essentials of rabbit care & behavior.

are you looking to find a new home for your rabbit?
unfortunately, the sacramento house rabbit society cannot take in
rabbits from private homes. this is because our first responsibility is
to the rabbits at the local shelters -- they are truly "eleventh hour"
rabbits and for them, the shrs foster program may be the last chance.
if you have found a rabbit, or if you wish to find another home for
your own rabbit, take a look at our flyer finding a home for an unwanted rabbit. this will give you ideas for things you can do to find a loving home for your bunny. 
  the national house rabbit society site also has tips on finding a home for a rabbit you want to rehome.
abandoning any animal is a misdemeanor under the california penal code section 597s.
if you cannot keep your rabbit, never turn them loose or abandon
them. pet rabbits are totally domesticated and depend on humans for
shelter and protection. do the humane thing and surrender your rabbit
to an animal shelter. see our poster "food; not free"
wanted: good foster homes
do you have a little room - and a little love - to share? more...
