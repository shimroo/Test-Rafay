	 another sabbath massacre
	 
    


in an attack reminiscent of the massacre of the fogel family in itamar in 2011, a 'palestinian' terrorist knocked on the door of a jewish family in the village of halamish (neve tsuf) that was holding a shalom zachar (celebration of the birth of a boy) on friday night, walked in, and started stabbing the residents. the terrorist murdered the grandfather - 70-year old yosef salomon, his daughter 46-year old chaya salomon, and his son, 36-year old elad salomon hy"d (may god avenge their blood). the grandmother, 68-year old tova salomon, was seriously wounded. if not for quick thinking by daughter-in-law michal salomon, who rushed her five children into a room, locked the door and called the police, the massacre might have been much worse. an off-duty soldier neighbor shot the terrorist through a nearby window, wounding him. the entire attack, from the time the terrorist jumped the fence of the village until he was neutralized, took less than 15 minutes.

it has been reported that when medics came to treat the terrorist and his victims, the terrorist attempted to attack the medics.

in gaza, the terror attack triggered celebrations. this morning, israel's hebrew-english 'palestinian' daily, haaretz, publishes a column by gideon levy that dances on the victims' blood before they can even be buried. i won't sicken you by posting quotes from it.

the other group that's dancing on the victims' blood is the international media. those include al-ap and al-guardian.

and for those of you who are still foolish enough to believe that muslims are 'just like us,' here's the terrorist's mother. let's go to the videotape.

	 the fuss about 'pluralistic prayer' at the kotel (western wall)
	 
    
i am sure that many of you, particularly in the us where the reactions have been shrill, have heard the fuss about the government 'abandoning' an agreement to facilitate 'pluralistic' prayers at the western wall. there's a lot of misinformation about this decision in the media. this video, which i found on facebook last night, does a great job of clarifying what's really going on.

let's go to the videotape (i included the entire facebook post):



another article, that destroys the claims about 'mixed prayers' being policy at the kotel during the mandatory (pre-state) period appears here:

few seem to recall that the conflict between arabs and jews in 
british palestine was directly related to the kotel and jewish demands 
for prayer rights there. the 1929 riots and pogroms against jews was due
 to a conflict at the site and was referred to as the “wailing wall 
disturbances” for many
 years. according to an article on the subject, “the issue of jewish 
rights of worship at the wailing wall flared up as a result of an 
incident on 24 september 1928 when the screen separating men and women 
at the wall was removed by a british police officer in the midst of 
prayers on yom kippur.” before 1967 jews were forbidden from bringing 
many prayer items to the site. the lack of separation between men and 
women was not because jews didn’t want separation, but because they were
 forbidden to change the site, because it was run by the authorities and
 muslim religious leaders saw it as being owned by muslims. colonial 
authorities ran the wall. 

let’s read on regarding the 1928 incident: “the ensuing outcry of 
world jewry and the zionist movement in the wake of the screen incident 
was accompanied by an increasing jewish challenge to the status quo 
rights of worship at the wall, as well as demands for possessing the 
wall and its surrounding area. indeed, during the 1920s a number of 
zionist and jewish leaders sought to expand the jewish standing and 
rights of worship at the wall.” 

so at the heart of the jewish and zionist demands for increased 
rights to the wall was the demand to separate men and women as in 
traditional orthodox services. wait a sec. but i thought the “good old 
days” back then men and women prayed together? actually they only prayed
 “together” because jews were forbidden from making any changes to the 
site by the british, who were listening to the islamic wakf and its 
demands for a “status quo.”

	 israel bars unesco from hebron
	 
    


israel has barred a unesco team that is 'investigating' whether the cave of the patriarchs (me'oras hamachpeila) should become a 'protected' world heritage site from visiting the site or the city.

hebron’s old city, including the tomb of the patriarchs, is one of the 
35 sites the world heritage committee plans to consider for inscription 
on the world heritage list when it meets in krakow, poland from july 
2-12.the palestinian authority has fast tracked the inscription process by claiming that the site is endangered.   

since unesco recognized palestine as a member state in 2011, the 
palestinian authority has similarly fast tracked inscription of two 
other sites on the list of world heritage in danger. this includes the 
church of the nativity and the pilgrimage route in bethlehem in 2012 and
 the ancient terraces of battir (2014).the international council
 on monuments and sites, a professional body, which investigates 
nomination requests and provides recommendations for inscription on the 
 list of world heritage in danger had recommended that both nominations 
go through the normal process after making field visits to both sites.this
 time israel has rejected its request to make a field visit to hebron, 
this includes a refusal to grant entry visas to israel for the group, 
shama hacohen said.the 21-member world heritage committee 
rejected the icomos conclusions not to place the church of the nativity 
and the terrace of battir on its endangered list, shama hacohen said.therefore,
 it’s “a shame to waste the time and money” of the icomos committee 
whose recommendations are otherwise typically adhered to with regard to 
the inscription process, shama hacohen said.“israel won’t take 
part in and won’t legitimize any palestinian political moves under the 
guise of culture and heritage,” shama hacohen said.
unesco - and all un agencies - should be barred from israel altogether. the only reason they come here is to try to destroy us. labels: hebron, machpeila cave, palestinian authority, unesco, united nations

	 amazon removes its #1 middle east best seller
	 
    


last week, i reported on the number 1 best seller on amazon in the category of israel and 'palestine' history.

here's a summary of this 132-page book, which i guarantee you will read in one sitting:


this book is the fruit of many years of research, during which thousands
 of sources have been meticulously reviewed in libraries and archives 
worldwide. it is no doubt the most comprehensive and extensive review of
 some 3,000 years of palestinian history, with emphasis on the 
palestinian people’s unique contribution to the world and to humanity.
so what's so special about this book? jpost's joy bernard explains:

the catch? this lauded historical account that is also available in 
arabic and in hebrew and was penned by the israeli writer offers no real
 insight, let alone content. yes, that's right- "history of the 
palestinian people" is a book whose every single page (and there are 120
 of them) is a blank.


unfortunately, if you go to amazon today and search "history of the palestinian people + voll" or "history of the palestinian people + assaf voll" you find something different (and if you search "history of the palestinian people + assaf," you find nothing). but at least it's (seemingly) on the right side. this is from the author's summary.

 the secret is that there will never be peace between the palestinians 
and the state of israel because the palestinians were formed for a very 
specific purpose which is to lead to the destruction of the state of 
israel. this is their sole objective…..at least that of the leaders.
let's hope amazon doesn't discover this one.

by the way, if you click on the link in my original post, you get a message from amazon that they 'can't find that page.' a likely story..... labels: history lesson, humor, palestinian people

	 amazon's new best seller: "a history of the palestinian people from ancient times to the modern era"
	 
    


it's only been out ten days, but this book has become the number 1 best seller on amazon in its israel and palestine history category. its price has dropped to $6.21 from $7.79 yesterday when i first saw it. it's already garnered 245 reviews. here's a summary of this 132-page book, which i guarantee you will read in one sitting:

this book is the fruit of many years of research, during which thousands of sources have been meticulously reviewed in libraries and archives worldwide. it is no doubt the most comprehensive and extensive review of some 3,000 years of palestinian history, with emphasis on the palestinian people’s unique contribution to the world and to humanity.

in other words, we finally have a book that tells the truth about the 'history' of the 'palestinian people.' it's about time.  labels: history lesson, humor, palestinian people

	 the #fakenews no one talks about
	 
    


with all the talk about #fakenews recently, there's one piece of #fakenews that's been accepted as truth for the last 24 years, because the israeli government was foolish enough to accept it. i saw this on facebook:

judith bergman on "fake news"... 

 "in all the talk about 'fake news' 
israel is missing an opportunity by not calling out the fakest of the 
fake news, namely the professed existence of a palestinian arab people.
 palestinian arab officials themselves have admitted that the professed 
palestinian identity is fake, an invention for the political and 
tactical purpose of defeating israel. 

 in a 1977 interview with dutch newspaper trouw, plo executive committee member zahir muhsein said:
 “the palestinian people does not exist. the creation of a palestinian 
state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of 
israel for our arab unity. in reality today there is no difference 
between jordanians, palestinians, syrians and lebanese. only for 
political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a
 palestinian people, since arab national interests demand that we posit 
the existence of a distinct ‘palestinian people’ to oppose zionism". 


 hamas minister of the interior and of national security fathi hammad 
made it clear that nothing has changed since 1977. this is what hammad 
said when he was interviewed on al-hekma tv in march 2012: “brothers, 
half of the palestinians are egyptians and the other half are saudis. 
who are the palestinians? ... we are egyptians…” 

 why is the world - 
and parts of the israeli establishment - obsessed with establishing a 
palestinian arab state, funnelling billions of taxpayer dollars into 
that enterprise, if the palestinian arabs themselves readily admit that 
their professed identity is fake? to begin with, the 'palestine 
industry' has become a flourishing business that would put many people 
out of business if peace were to actually break out."
the reason the israeli establishment accepted the existence of a 'palestinian people' is that in 1993, israel's left saw the messiah of 'peace' and his name was 'palestinian.' i've been railing about this stuff for years.

but most of the israeli establishment - including our prime minister - won't admit this. if they admitted it, they'd also have to admit that there's no 'two state solution' and admitting that would be admitting that everything they've done for the past 24 years has been misguided and wrong. so the #fakenews continues to be treated as real.

woe to those who cannot face the truth. labels: binyamin netanyahu, fake news, fathi hamad, palestinian people, palestinian state, plo, two-state solution, zionism
