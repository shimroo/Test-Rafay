the new black lab albumi’m thrilled to announce dark star, the (re-)release of black lab b-sides, soundtracks, and demos featuring michael belfer, remastered and streaming now.michael was the original guitarist in black lab, and together we recorded not just your body above me but over a dozen other tracks. among these are recordings that saw the light of day ('wide open,' 'keep myself awake,' 'black eye') as well as those that found life in future versions. when michael passed a couple of years ago, i knew i wanted to re-release the songs he played on in a way that paid tribute to him and his work. michael was a founding member of seminal bands the sleepers and tuxedomoon, and had a big influence on thurston moore of sonic youth among many others. michael was a star — but often too dark to see — and his brightness as a person often hid the dark struggles within.

biosinger-songwriter paul durham started the san francisco alt.pop.rock band black lab in 1997 and released its critically acclaimed debut your body above me on geffen records. following a national tour, two charting singles (‘wash it away’ and ‘time ago’), hot mtv action, tons of soundtracks, and way too many trashed hotel rooms, the band split up.after signing with epic records in 2000, durham started a new chapter of black lab with la guitarist/programmer andy ellis. the band’s second album, see the sun, featured ‘learn to crawl’ from sony pictures’ spider-man soundtrack.

 












after leaving epic, the band established a strong web presence with blacklabworld.com. more music followed including passion leaves a trace, technologie, give us sugar, two strangers, a raven has my heart, a new world, an unplugged record, a live acoustic dvd/cd collection, a set of electronica instrumentals, and the latest singles, "in a moment" and “changes,” all available for download at bandcamp and itunes plus the streaming services.since completing an $80,000 crowdfunding campaign last fall, paul has finished his debut solo collection,  which is out now and streaming everywhere. to hear this sweet life, buy a cd, hear paul play live in person & online, please head over to pauldurham.com.

 












the band has had much success leveraging its independent status through social media campaigns (”bumrush the charts”), youtube stunts (the “transformers” cover), and a kickstarter for a raven has my heart — all due to the passion and long-term commitment of its fans.  black lab songs can be found in major films, trailers, tv shows and commercials, including permanent midnight, varsity blues, the covenant, pretty little liars, house md, banshee, the shield, buffy the vampire slayer, what i like about you, flashpoint, honda, gm, and dozens of others.please sign the email list to receive occasional updates.
