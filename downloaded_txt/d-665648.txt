welcome to paratime design's home page. this site is dedicated to old school rpgs maps drawn by tim hartin. paratime design offers personal commissions, commercial maps for sale (see our drivethrurpg store), and 250+ map freebies (as either image files or as pdfs) with more being added all the time. 


please note that the store link in the menu will open a new page and take you off-site to the official paratime design store at drivethrurpg.com.  




every friday, a new creative commons licensed map will be released (there will be the odd exception now and then). see the friday freebie maps for the latest freebie maps. some of these maps will receive an enhanced option. friday enhanced map products contain a multi-layered pdf (allowing the options of white or black backgrounds, numbered or non-numbered areas, and secret doors on or off) and a zip file with all relevant map files as individual jpg images.
