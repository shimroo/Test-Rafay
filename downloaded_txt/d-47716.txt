versione  italiana




for almost one thousand years, in every part of the world, playing cards
have been one of the most common pastimes. as a collectable item, instead, they are indeed
less popular.
an amazing number of different varieties exists, surely many more than even
the most experienced card players would ever imagine. there are decks with special
illustrations in place of the usual courts, but others, used in some parts of the world,
also have different suits in place of the ones most people are accustomed to.
and some decks do not even have suits: according to the games they were created for,
they may have numbers, or other special illustrations.

these pages discuss in depth most topics concerning playing cards, with a particular
interest for their history, and the many patterns used in different countries, the
obsolete ones as well as the varieties still used. the picture galleries, organized
by type and by geographical distribution, present several examples of the varieties
extant, providing at the same time an extensive description, yet easily understandable
also for first-timers.

visit!
