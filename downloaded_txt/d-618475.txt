journalist william mellus first established the mellus newspapers in lincoln 
park during the depression era. under the news-herald name, the two newspapers 
merged in the mid-1980's, then adding a sunday edition in 1990 and friday 
publication (weekend entertainment news) in 2006. today the news-herald is the 
"voice of downriver."
