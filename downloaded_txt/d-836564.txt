the sunday morning worship service at first church is a richly textured experience. our service is traditional in structure, but we bring together the arts – music, literature, poetry, painting – as well as science and religious texts – to create a joyful experience of community. each sunday we engage the heart and mind, believing that faith and reason are essential to the spiritual journey.

first church is a vital, diverse and multi-generational community of faith. people of all ages – children, families of all configurations, young professionals, seniors, and everyone in between, come together in an authentic experience of christian community. as an urban church in the heart of the city, we celebrate compassion, diversity and inclusivity, respecting people wherever they may be on the journey.

we live in the deeply held value that every human being is a child of god, and that we are called to open the doors of our church as wide as god’s heart. our values of faith, rooted in the life of jesus, continue to be forged by the contemporary issues of our time. as the oldest protestant church in the city of los angeles, we celebrate the many diverse religious voices in our city, even as we seek to embody the spirit of jesus by loving our neighbor as ourselves.

 











 

first congregational church of los angeles is a proud ucc church.
