help sign pro on house bill 1310 by january 30th to increase special education funding!

january 27, 2025january 28, 2025lily chan 


it is great to see that funding k-12 education is a top priority during this legislative session! this thursday various k-12 funding bills will be heard in the house including rep. pollet’s bill to increase special education funding that he discussed at our bryant legislative panel a few weeks ago.  as we know, insufficient special education funding is one of the primary reasons sps currently faces a large budget deficit. please take a minute to go here and sign-in pro on this bill.
the senate heard a group of important k-12 funding bills last week, and this thursday three of these bills are scheduled for executive session (this is where legislators will vote on whether the bills should leave committee and continue through the legislative process). the bills are sb 5263 (special education funding), sb 5192 (msoc), and sb 5187 (student transportation funding). the bryant ptsa supports all three of these bills!
also, on the same day as these hearings/executive sessions, advocates are meeting in olympia to rally for increased k-12 funding! if you want to be part of the action and support our schools, attend this advocacy day!
lastly, remember to keep informed about the school levies, there is a lot of information available from sps, advocates and news outlets. votes must be in by february 11th, 2025!
