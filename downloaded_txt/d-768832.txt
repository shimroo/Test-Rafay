kay is the oracle!



apr 4, 2018




what would i do without kay? her exceptional ability to articulate the complexities and intricacies of both the individual and the individual within a relationship is not only stunning, but invaluable. i feel so lucky to have her as counsel in my life. i bring all my big life questions and concerns to her, both in my personal and professional pursuits and her knowledge, point of view, astrological wisdom, expertise and spiritual guidance is valued beyond measure.- a.l. -

caring



mar 20, 2018




i have known kay for a few years. the most important characteristic for me, that i always find in kay, is that in addition to being very perceptive/intuitive, she is also caring. she makes me feel that she really cares about being helpful addressing my issues and that it is not just to do the one hour of a reading. i am very grateful for that.- a -

providing a clear path



mar 20, 2018




i was a little skeptical at first, but after a few months of contemplating a visit, i finally did it. and it was 100% worth it! once kay started speaking she pulled my story and my experienced together without me saying a single word. we talked about how everyone has an innate ability to understand what they need/want to do, but the path becomes cluttered and blurry at times. kay did an amazing job of pulling everything together and providing the clarity i needed to stay on my path.- nave brar -

after my session it was clear to me kay would be a huge part of my life. her insight is extremely accurate which of course is important; however, it is her honest and sensitive presentation which is so valuable to me. she has proven herself to me over and over again and i consider her a friend, not just a guide and teacher.- r -

mar 20, 2018




i have been consulting with kay for more than 13 years. i have found her to be a beautiful, loving and information gentle soul. her intuitive gift has allowed me to find life a lot less stressful by allowing me to follow a path that has become a wonderful journey. a bit bumpy at times but that is when kay has stepped in. kay has helped me to make sense of a number of situations by especially after the tragic death of my son. kay has afforded me the closure i needed.- kathy erken -

an amazing experience i will always remember



mar 20, 2018




kay read me like an open book and knew things about me that very few people, even my closest friends, would know. as such, i trust her insight completely and because of her, i feel more confident and attuned to my own purpose and desires. she is the person to talk to if you ever feel lost and/or confused about how to find your own fulfillment, joy and purpose in this life. - sienna v -

accurate, empathic, instructive



mar 20, 2018




i have been having readings from kay for many years now; her accuracy rate and ability to put into language what i sense, what i sometimes criticize in myself, and what feels amorphous, helps me to make it tangible, see more clearly, validate my own sensing, feels empathy where i feel confusion. my intuition grows, while i understand more.- sharon w -

a gifted woman



mar 20, 2018




as kay read me i was able to feel my own energy strongly, she undoubtedly could penetrate and see through me in a way that was palpable. her words were equally impressive, describing things i have long sensed in myself but were wonderful to hear spoken by another. i went to kay on a whim and would highly recommend that anyone considering her services should simply stop doubting and go. the visit has left me calmer and more in tune with the fullness of life.- rachel h -

we live in this crazy swirl of life; of our own creation, of our karma, of the expectations and desires of others. how to explain the healing gifts brought forth by this warm and wonderful woman? what kay provides is a safe bubble, a haven, where you can be heard without judgment, to feel nurtured by spirit, and to feel connected to your higher self. she is a tremendously gifted healer.- scott h -

i needed greater understanding, and kay provided that for me. to "know thyself" can be difficult at times. we receive so much information and oftentimes, conflicting information. kay provided a light into area where i needed illumination. truth is truth and when it is truth about self it resonates. i have greater understanding of myself and my current situation, and for this i am grateful. thank you, kay!- joya benson -
