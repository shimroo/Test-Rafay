“domino’s farms has been a labor of love for decades and is the realization of a dream.  as a lifelong admirer of wright’s work, i was honored when vincent scully, the renowned architectural professor at yale, called it the ultimate triumph of frank lloyd wright’s prairie style.  we have worked to build a unique integration of city and country, work and wellness to create an environment where businesses grow and people thrive.”

— thomas s. monaghan, founder, domino's farms
