📣 𝐏𝐒𝐀 🐾
given the financial challenge of caring for animals in today's economy, we are implementing a new fee-based intake policy to help cover the costs associated with caring for animals. this policy aims to ensure the sustainability of our operations while continuing to provide necessary services to the community.

𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬 (animals with owners longer than 7 days):
* all personal surrenders 6 months or older must be spayed/neutered prior to being surrendered to hart and will have a $75 fee due at time of intake
**if under 6 months & not altered there will be a $100 fee due at time of intake
*** if you have a litter of puppies/kittens please call for the intake process and fees
call the shelter for an appointment to be made for surrendering.

𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐲 𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬 (animals without an owner):
we are contracted to accept animals from the city limits of:

baxter-dogs
brainerd- all domestic animals
breezy point-dogs
center township-dogs
crosby-dogs & cats
crosslake-dogs
garrison-dogs & cats
riverton-dogs
crow wing county unorganized-dogs

**if you find an animal in these areas, please call the shelter to arrange either a drop off at the shelter or a dispatch of animal control.
if you are outside of these contracted areas and find a stray animal, we require you to find the nearest shelter for intake (helps families get reunited). if we are your nearest shelter, there will be a $30 fee for us to care for said animal and an appointment made for drop off.
by implementing this fee-based intake policy, we aim to maintain the quality of care for the animals we shelter while addressing our financial constraints. your cooperation and understanding are greatly appreciated as we strive to continue serving the community effectively.

🐾teamwork makes the dream work! 🐾






every june a group of recruits from the national guard army in brainerd, mn, donate a morning of physical labor at the shelter. and of course, they also visit with the animals.
this year they did outside clean up as well as washing crates for the garage sale.
what a great group of young adults.




















donate to hart







h.a.r.t. is so excited that you have decided to adopt a pet from us, but please come in or call to ask any questions about the pet that you wish to adopt. 











































lost and found animals








we all hope our beloved pet never is on the missing list but unfortunately it can and does happen. someone leaves a door or gate open, the dog runs off when it was only suppose to be doing it's "business" and so on.
the first thing everyone should have on their pet is an id tag with your current phone number on it. a city license tag or a rabies tag can be next to worthless if an animal is found after hours. having your pet micro chipped can be beneficial but it is not a guarantee you will get your pet back. as an owner you will need to keep the chip updated with your current phone number.  if a pet has a change of owners that will also need to be changed with chip company.  then there is the issue of getting the pet scanned.  keep in mind not all animals brought into a shelter can be scanned due to temperament issues.
if you have lost your pet or found someone else's pet here is what you should do.

contact your local shelters with your information. if you have found a pet contact your local law enforcement to determine if you are in a contracted impound area.  if you are the animal control officer will transport animal to hart.
putting lost and found information on social media has it's pros and cons. it may return your pet to you but it also may give the finder all the information about your pet. and they may keep it.
it is best to bring a found pet to a shelter so the owner can pick it up.
