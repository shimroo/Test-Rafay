aboutlocated just south of san francisco, in the idyllic town of woodside, the village pub opened its doors in 2001 and quickly secured its reputation as one of the top restaurants in the bay area. approximately 80 percent of the produce for the village pub comes directly from their unique partnership with smip ranch located in the hills above woodside, all of which is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. in addition to being recognized both locally and nationally for its award-winning cuisine, the village pub has also received consistent praise for its unparalleled wine and spirits program.

 

awards and accoladesour team prides itself on their hard work and dedication to producing the finest foods and unparalleled level of service. it is these hallmark standards that have secured us recognition from the top publications in the world. the village pub has received one michelin star for 12 consecutive years. the wine list, which features over 3,500 labels, has received wine spectator’s highest honor, a grand award, for 7 consecutive years. shortly after opening in 2001, chef mark sullivan was selected as one of food & wine’s “best new chefs.” these, along with many local accolades, have secured the village pub as one of the most iconic restaurants in the state.
