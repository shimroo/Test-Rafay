about us
in 1927, joseph skilken founded a construction company which which has become a real-estate developer, e-commerce, and banking firm. originally the company built many large military, public and private projects until, in the 1960’s, it started focusing on developments for its own ownership.
today, we develop and own prime income producing shopping centers, office buildings and apartment communities. we are a full-service real estate brokerage representing both owners and tenants. 
if we can help you in any way in our fields of business, we are happy to talk with you.
