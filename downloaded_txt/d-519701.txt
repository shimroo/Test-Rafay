                        a bit more about patersons
                            in 1895, john & isabella paterson founded their bakery in the royal burgh of rutherglen, scotland, where they sold their home baked goods from a horse-drawn van. now, over 125 years’ baking experience, we’ve created a shortbread fit for the 21st century, and we are proud to say that it is the nation’s favourite!
