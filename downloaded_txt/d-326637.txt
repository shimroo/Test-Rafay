   i will attend my building's next  open studios on february 21. on the 
   fourth floor, 53 works from my weeks and months are now hanging,  
   and can be seen when the building is open. enter through the lot near  
   3420 s. racine, and look in two locations on the fourth floor, one of
   which is next to my studio, 4f4052.
   i have begun making films again, titled interactions, forty years after 
   having stopped, in 4k video and best seen projected. all are silent,
   most from four to eight minutes. see liam kenny's fine essay on them. 

   brian hischier wrote this excellent review of my book seeking brakhage.
   i have a long jeremaid on our current culture and the restorative power of
   art in the journal logos, which has been translated into portuguese.  
   see also my in despair at the state of the world.

   two friends have made videos about my art, dreams of lost wholeness    by brian hischier, and fred's unthreadings by yoel meranda. as a result,    i have placed on my site for the first time works from weeks and months, 
   whose shooting hischier documented.
