                                        hit it out of the park once again. as usual, i have nothing but great words for old town florist. an amazing simple arrangement, super prompt delivery and communication when it’s needed. even from the other side of the world ( where i am ) it’s always been nothing but exceptional service and product.

                                        i ordered these for a friend's birthday. they were gorgeous. she sent me a picture and the bouquet was exactly as described & pictured on the website. my only issue, and it's a small one, was they were delivered about 5pm instead of earlier. i ordered a full day early & i only wish they could have been delivered earlier. i generously tipped (of course!) and i'll use them again.

                                        perfection!  i've been ordering bouquets from old town since 2022. each one has elicited "wow" reactions from my daughter & her co-workers. shen the bouquet arrives, she already knows that it's from mom without seeing the card. my daughter sends me photos & i've never been disappointed. flowers are always beautiful & delivered on time. i've never had to worry about being disappointed. many thanks to old town florist!

                                        i wanted to send a bouquet to a family member in portland but i live in another place. the process of ordering online was easy and user friendly. i chose designer's choice and the arrangement turned out beautifully. i will be ordering from here again if i want to send another bouquet to family in portland.

                                        i ordered this as an office-warming gift for my boyfriend, who is starting a new job. the european garden arrangement was even more beautiful than the picture. additionally, i made a last-minute change to the notecard without any problems. i will definitely be ordering from old town florist again!
