we appreciate your taking the time to check out our website - we would greatly appreciate your signing our guestbook and letting us know what you think.

our goal is to find "forever homes" for homeless bouviers.  the majority of our bouviers are rescued from homes and shelters because they - through no fault of their own - are no longer wanted.  some of the dogs are docked and cropped, some are only docked, some have pedigrees when they are surrendered.  all these dogs have an abundance of love to share - they just need a deserving family to share it with.  they need a second chance - and that is how we came up with our name - second chance bouvier rescue.
immediately upon rescue they are examined, immunized, neutered or spayed and afforded any healthcare deemed necessary by our veterinarians.  upon release from the veterinarian they are placed in our foster facility to be carefully evaluated.  only after extensive evaluation and careful consideration of any extenuating circumstances, the bouvier is placed on our adoptable list.
we accept applications from people interested in making a permanent place in their hearts and their homes for these deserving animals.  all applicants are carefully screened so that we can make - what we think - will be a suitable match for both the adopter and adoptee.  we offer our continued support and advice to all adopters - and do follow-ups to make sure there are no problems.
if you are interested in adopting a bouvier, bouvier mix or wannabee, or would just like some more information, please email us or fill out our adoption application.
