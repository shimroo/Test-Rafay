the best of polish pottery



we import from a variety of the potteries in boleslawiec. our main tableware range is shown on the website but we have lots more at our shop in lewes including unikat (limited edition) pieces. see more on our facebook page.

since 1997, we have imported this beautiful, hand-decorated, 'eyespot' stoneware from boleslawiec in poland. our range of tableware and kitchenware represents the creativity of the potteries in boleslawiec: ceramika artystyczna (ca), zaklady ceramiczne boleslawiec (zcb), manufaktura (mb), wiza, kalich, galia, tyrzcz, cergor and more...

we like to describe boleslawiec stoneware as ‘made to be used’. a high kiln temperature (1250 c) and fine glaze results in a hard wearing finish that is completely impermeable and very durable. everything is freezer, dishwasher, microwave, aga and ovenproof.

trade marks of the four main potteries in boleslawiec
from the left, the first and fifth trade marks are from ceramika artystyczna (ca); the third and sixth are zaklady ceramiczne boleslawiec (zcb); the second is manufaktura boleslawiec (mb) and the fourth is wiza.

anna & will rogers first started importing boleslawiec pottery in november 1997. it was shipped by sea from the polish baltic port of gdynia - hence our name; baltic trader

lewes is the most historic and picturesque town in sussex and well worth a visit. please click on the 'lewes shop' button for more visitor information.
