please have your bib# placed on:
1-both shoulders, & both leg side calves (both left and right sides)2-on the front of your bike helmet3-on your bike front tube closest to the handle bars, for easy side viewing4-and on the front of your chest or abdomen, not on your back!

– if you are transferring from a higher priced race to a lower priced race, you will not be refunded the difference.– if you are transferring from a lower priced race to a higher priced race, you will be required to pay the difference in addition to the transfer fee.– transfers must take place no later than 30 days prior to the race date.– you may transfer into eligible races (races that are not yet sold out) until 30 days prior to the race date. this may be done through your profile on runsignup.com.– if a one-day usa triathlon membership was purchased during your registration, you will need to email eventpower at info@eventpowerli.com to have your one-day usa triathlon membership license moved from one event to the next. once moved, then you can continue with the transfer.
