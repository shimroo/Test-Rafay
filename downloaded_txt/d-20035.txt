today is your day to win










 






hello 
						internet friend,
						no matter who you are or how you got here, you may be 
						thinking, "he's pretty sure of himself with that most 
						inspiring newsletter stuff."
most times i'm pretty 
						humble.  no one likes a 
						braggart, after all.
but after building the 
						#1 most traveled personal development product website on 
						earth (another one of our websites) and because over 
						3,000 people individually emailed me in the last 
						12 months alone telling me that my newsletter has 
						changed their lives... that they've improved their 
						relationships because of it, gotten better jobs because 
						of it, met the love of their life, lost a truckload of 
						weight, quit some rotten stinking habit forever, are now 
						getting straight as in school, ended the abusive 
						relationship, gotten off all drugs (legal and illegal) 
						because of it, and sooooo much more...
...well, i just gotta 
						toot my own horn a bit.
you do, after 
						all, want to learn things that can 
						help you to do, be and have more in your life while 
						having tremendous peace of mind, don't you?
thought so.
me, too.  most 
						people do.
the best people to 
						learn from aren't just those who know something...  
						it's those who know it and who can teach what they know
						so that you get it.
today is your day to 
						win started out in 2000 as a simple, short newsletter 
						meant to give a little daily boost...  
it's turned 
						into a worldwide phenomenon.  
it got such rave 
						reviews over the years that i published the most rocking 99
						fast sessions into a 322 page softcover book.  
						it's been read by over one million people worldwide.  
						and you don't even have to buy it if you only want to 
						read it online...

						because it's free.
and a subscription to 
						the new stuff is free, too.
part chicken soup for 
						the soul, part drill sergeant forcing you to accept 
						nothing less than the best from yourself, i will 
						absolutely move you to action.  it will help you 
						succeed where you've failed and get you feeling happier 
						and more self-assured than you ever have in your life. 
						
that is my commitment 
						and my promise to you if you subscribe to this letter.
there is no other 
						newsletter like it on the internet.
subscribe now and 
						these are just some of the issues that you will learn 
						about:

what the oldest 
							people in the entire world eat to stay healthy
how you can change 
							the voice inside your head that never shuts 
							off from talking you into feeling bad and failing 
							and into feeling great and succeeding
the unconscious 
							mental patterns of all successful people
surefire ways to 
							stop being depressed
what your doctor 
							doesn't know about anti-depressants
how to stay 
							motivated to do anything no matter who or what is 
							pulling you down
the only three 
							ways to increase your net worth
what 
							self-forgiveness is and why it's absolutely critical 
							to a happy life
how to sell 2-10 
							times more of your products and services
how you can adopt 
							the self-image of a champion in 5 minutes a day
how to be as 
							productive as a multimillionaire
what emotions are 
							and how they affect your body on a cellular level
stopping the worry 
							habit
insider 
							information about drug companies
how average people 
							just like you become millionaires
what the chemicals 
							in your food are really doing to you
what you actually 
							get from exercising
supplements - good 
							for you?
rising up to be 
							the most successful person in your family
ending panic 
							attacks
changing from a 
							die-hard procrastinator to a goal achieving machine
and a whole lot 
							more.

so the way i see it 
						you've got two choices...
1) click below to read 
						the archives and get blown away by the helpful straight talk - i 
						won't give you a shoulder to cry on.  instead, i provide options 
						and ideas. 
...or
2) read the archives 
						and sign up so you can benefit from my most recent 
						research on all things success.
and if you do become a 
						subscriber now, you can be sure of another thing... that 
						i will never ever let anyone else see your email 
						address.  i will only use it to personally give you 
						information that will enhance your life in every way 
						possible.  i hate spam and any other form of 
						unsolicited junk email even more than coming in second 
						place.  
i know you'll find the 
						information beyond this page to be as valuable as 
						138,000+ other people have.  enjoy!
sincerely,



mike brescia
p.s.  if you 
						don't subscribe, you'll lose in life a whole lot 
						more often than you should and you'll feel rotten a 
						whole lot more than you would if you subscribed now.  
						because no matter who you are, where you are from and no 
						matter what has ever happened to you, every day 
						can be your day to win.
