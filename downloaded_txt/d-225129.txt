heights driving school was established in 1957 with the goal to provide the best driver education available anywhere.  all of our teachers have gone through our extensive training program and have been approved and licensed by the department of public safety.   heights driving school was the first driving school in the country to contract with a public high school to provide driver education for the school, and we still hold that contract today.  *please note state law: teens taking the teen driver education course  may only take 4 hours of  instruction per day
***please check each locations class schedule before attending for class being taught and/or cancellation***
