the 10 best wives on tv



tina kennard (laurel holloman, the l word): this may be a teensy bit of a controversial choice, but tina deserves a second look.  fine, she gets into some shady territories but she always does the right thing in the end. ok, her relationship with bette porter is somewhat codependent, but by the end of every season they wind up back where they belong: with each other.http://www.yourtango.com/200913632/top-10-wives-tv
