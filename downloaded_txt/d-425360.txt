i have used dialaflight several times for holidays and flights and the service never wavers. some companies get you on board and then take you for granted but not dialaflight.
    
i would 100% recommend these guys. they are honest, open, quick responding, helpful, funny, professional and always there to pick the phone up as soon as you dial.
    
i was recommended to dialaflight by a colleague and have used them ever since. if you want what is verging on a private concierge travel service then no need to look further.
    
after trawling through no end of websites and visiting a high street travel agent i came across dialaflight only to realise that i could have saved myself so much time and effort.
    
dialaflight instantly found me a great deal for a flight that left the following morning. the paperwork was sent speedily and we were all booked within just 20 minutes.
