use online signup. this speeds things up a ton for you and for nchsa. you can do membership and race day signup for any class online.
online race signup is $2 cheaper than signing up on sunday at the track. 
membership cost $30. if you are racing 5 rounds, you should join the series. non-members pay $5 more per race. 
online signup must check-in at every race. 
you can run any number you choose on your bike. you must run a sticker on your helmet with your number, that we will provide. 
non-members can also use online signup after they are assigned a number at the track. we will assign non-members a number at the track during the signup process. then you can use online signup for any race after that.  
if you are running two classes on the same day, you can only run one points class each day and you must run that points class first. for example, you could race mini d and 9a and trail rider at 10:30. an adult could race 250a at noon and then run unlimited at 3p.
 
><><><
rider promotions are based on avg mph over the last 5 rounds of the season. there are no promotions in the 9a or 10:30 mini races. for the 3p race the top 30% of riders were promoted but only if speed warranted. total of 28 riders promoted across all big bike classes. if your name is on the promoted list you must ride at least that class level or higher. be glad to discuss any promotion questions.
><><><><><><
we are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our long time nchsa president alan champion on monday 5/17/2021. 
alan was a loving wonderful father, grandfather and friend to many. he had a kind heart and was always willing to help. alan loved our sport and committed a huge piece of his life to the nchsa.

info





we have nchsa t-shirts, stickers and license tags available at the signup trailer. 







race hotline - weather questions





we make every effort to race on the scheduled dates. however there are times when we are forced to reschedule a race due to rain leading up to the race day or forecast rain on race day. this is being a responsible partner for our land owners and tracks. a heavy mud race can destroy a property and cause permanent loss of a track.
we will post and race date changes no later than 12p on satruday before each race. you can call the race hotline if weather is questionable. for the sc races we typically make that call by friday at 10pm.
