what is bergfreunde - mountain friends?

the purpose of bergfreunde-mountain friends is to offer a wide variety of year-round recreational sports, social activities, and travel adventures for the enjoyment of our members.  we have evolved from being just a ski club in 1966, but still maintain memberships in regional and local ski club councils. whether you are new to the portland, or / vancouver, wa areas or have lived here your whole life, being a member of "bergie's" is a great way to explore all the pacific northwest has to offer with a fun, friendly, and active group. this is a place to make life - long friends!  much more is available on the website for members: the full calendar, membership directory, document library, and details on all the interest groups.  we look forward to meeting you! click the join us button below to access the member application.
