tim says, "ride 'em – don't hide 'em!"
“we
survived the turbo era”, allen l.
"several
times in the past 25 years i’ve considered replacing the turbo,
but i enjoy its rarity and i can’t find another motorcycle with
the wind protection, ability to comfortably cover 500 miles of
two-lane roads in a day, and the addictive “stronger as it goes
faster” power of a turbocharged engine. even today, the yamaha
turbo offers a thrilling ride every time you twist the throttle - and
have the guts to hold it there." winding road motorcycle times
