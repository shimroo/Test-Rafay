welcome to congregation or zarua 















join us!congregation or zarua, now in its 35th year, creates joyous jewish life in a multi-generational, egalitarian, traditional and full-participatory setting. or zarua is intimate and caring, and welcomes people – regardless of their knowledge or previous level of involvement in jewish life. oz creates community through study, prayer and a variety of programming led by the rabbi and congregants. we also engage in the pursuit of acts of kindness (hesed) within and beyond our congregation and in support of the state of israel.
