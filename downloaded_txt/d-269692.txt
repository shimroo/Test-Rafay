my mum by susan quinn and sarah matthews


author the dolphinpublished on february 14, 2025



 

my mum is a beautifully illustrated, stereotype-busting celebration of all the everyday things one child's mum does to make her so wonderfully awesome!
my mum says that when i arrived
i was like a star
drifting
down
from the sky
and into her life.
the story follows mother and child from before the child is born, celebrating the bond between mother and child even when the child is just a dream. with a wonderful inclusive feel, all mother and child relationships are celebrated in this story – whether biological or adoptive mothers.
a joyous spirit of adventure is present throughout the story, following mother and child as they take on life's big and small adventures – together. from sailing a ship around the garden and exploring forests, streams and meadows to telling stories in a cosy den and cuddling before bedtime, a child reveals all the simple yet amazing things she loves to do with her wondrously adventurous mum.
with lyrical text by susan quinn and imagination-filled illustrations from sarah mathew, my mum is a joyous celebration of motherhood, perfect for enjoying together as mum and child – creating a special reading experience for children to treasure. 
the perfect gift for new mothers, or mother's day, my mum celebrates the unique bond between mother and child, no matter how this relationship starts.
a beautiful book that is staying with me for my granddaughter and grandma moments!

a story of love, care and rescue from internationally acclaimed picture book creator, barraux. it is the story of fleeing... from all you have known and landing into the unknown. but on the way you may need some help!

the story orchestra musical puzzle, carnival of the animals illustrated by jessica courtney-tickle


author the dolphinpublished on october 18, 2024november 12, 2024




discover the magical world of carnival of the animals in this musical reimagining of this celebrated suite for children – push the button in each breathtaking scene to hear the vivid sound of an orchestra playing from camille saint-saëns’ score.
one day, two brothers discover a magical animal kingdom behind their bookcase. they are greeted by the royal lion with his shaggy mane; ask for directions from an old lonely tortoise; take a ride on some lumbering elephants; topple a skeleton of dinosaur bones; and swim among a school of shimmering fish. if only they could take them all home...
the book includes extracts from ‘the swan’, ‘aquarium’, ‘fossils’, and ‘finale’ (from disney’s fantasia) along with a totally new story to link the pieces together.

as you and your little one journey through the magical scenes, you will press the buttons to hear 10 excerpts from the suite’s music. at the back of the book, find a short biography of the composer, camille saint-saëns, with details about his composition of carnival of the animals. next to this, you can replay the musical excerpts and, for each of them, read a discussion of the instruments, rhythms and musical techniques that make them so powerful. a glossary defines musical terms.
the story orchestra series brings classical music to life for children through gorgeously illustrated re-tellings of classic ballet, opera and program music stories paired with 10-second sound clips of orchestras playing from their musical scores. with the story orchestra keyboard sound books, children can play the famous melodies themselves with the sound of a real grand piano.
beautifully presented and makes a wonderful gift.

a home that means the world by victoria turnbull


author the dolphinpublished on october 2, 2024november 12, 2024




a home that means the world is a book full of compassion. a wonderful book with beautifully delicate illustrations about a world of turmoil. the story moves slowly on and takes you into a world of chaos where home is always the best place.
 flora slept and woke.
she felt sun
and wind
and every day she searched the horizon for something small
that would grow into a home.
one day, a weaver ant family’s world is turned upside down when their home is destroyed.
with only a few belongings on their backs, they set off in search of a place to live, meeting many creatures on the way. some are kind, some are not so kind. some of the places are warm, some are cold. sometimes the creatures they meet are friendly, sometimes they are not. and some are on similar journeys, moving across the land.
they stay here and there, under and over ground, up high and down low. but none of the places feel quite right. will the weavers ever find somewhere they can call home again?

this heartwarming read from award-winning author/illustrator victoria turnbull teaches values of inclusivity and community, putting the concepts of displacement and asylum into terms that young children can easily understand. a book that encourages kids to be welcoming and considerate, empowering them to be kind to all.
frances lincoln children's books, an imprint of quarto publishes unique collections of amazing books.
this really is a book that every home should have!

blue monster by petr horacek


author the dolphinpublished on october 2, 2024november 12, 2024




blue monster wants to play with rabbit - but rabbit is sleeping and doesn't want to play. so... what should blue monster do?
a fun book with meaning! blue monster just can't help himself from upsetting his friends in a big way! but together they sort it out he is forgiven, and they stay friends!
blue monster does something you should never do and then... he does it again and again! now he definitely has no one to play with! he feels sad, lonely and very guilty. but when blue monster opens  his mouth and yawns... what a surprise!
things may get better after all! if blue monster only says he's sorry.
a wonderfully funny and surprising picture book about friendship and forgiveness, that's perfect for reading aloud.
petr horácek was born in prague and studied at the academy of fine art. after graduating in 1994, he moved to england. his first two picture books were published in 2001, winning the 'books for children' newcomer award. since then he has gained a string of international distinctions. his books for otter-barry include the last tiger, the perfect present, shortlisted for the booktrust storytime prize 2024, and the star whale with nicola davies. he lives in worcester.
otter-barry books publishers have a wonderful portfolio of unique and beautiful children's books.

the remarkables, the most incredible children i’ve met so far! by clotilde perrin


author the dolphinpublished on august 24, 2024september 23, 2024



 

meet 38 extraordinary children: an electric child, a flying child, elastic, invisible, miniature, a child made of cake. each child describes their characteristics, tells anecdotes, and presents the special powers that make them unique. a “class photo” brings everyone together with a quiz finale for readers to discover their own superpowers.
the remarkables is a big book of fantasy and humour that entertains and provides a way to talk about emotions and identity. through clotilde perrin’s unique imagination, this inclusive encyclopaedia celebrates individuality, strengths and differences, allowing every reader to explore what miraculous superpower they would wish for—or might have.

known for her original lift-the-flap explorations of fairytale stories, perrin here turns the lens onto her child readers, showing each one that they are a superhero.
gecko press publishes amazing books and the remarkables is a book like no other. each page is packed with interesting and mind blowing concepts, designed to explore thoughts and places beyond every day life. i love it!

cake for everyone by thé tjong-khing


author the dolphinpublished on july 3, 2024august 21, 2024



 


such a beautiful book! the story develops through the illustrations as there are no words, the pictures say it all. it is an intriguing book with a whole range of stories for your imagination on every page.

time for cake! but the eagle swipes up the blanket and flies away. the animals chase after to find all their stolen picnic things.
thé tjong-khing’s visual storytelling slows us down and invites us to look more closely. can you remember everything on the blanket? hat, ball, doll, feather, cake? who is hiding in the bush? what has the dog seen on the cliff? how will pig get back her sun umbrella? why is the rabbit crying? and how can there be cake for everyone when the very hungry rat family has eaten it already?
gecko press are working with thé tjong-khing. interesting illustrator...
'thé tjong-khing (born in 1933) is a children’s book illustrator based in the netherlands. he was born in indonesia, attended the seni rupa arts institute in bandung, and moved to the netherlands in 1956. as a child he was interested in the "tarzan" comic strips of edgar rice burroughs. thé has won the golden pencil award three times (a major dutch children’s book award), and in 2005 the woutertje pieterse prize for best dutch children’s book for his book waar is de taart? (where is the cake?), a wordless picture book which was also nominated for the german youth literature prize in 2007.'
collect all the missing objects, find out who they belong to, and come back home for more cake in this cheerful, wordless look-and-find story that culminates in the delightful reward of sharing.
a delight to read and share with young children and their powers of observation are superb.
