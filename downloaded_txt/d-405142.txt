event details
this year's black history month program at oceanside museum of art (oma) will celebrate and explore the untold stories of black artists who have contributed significantly to mainstream culture, particularly in animation, film, theater, and music.
our three featured speakers represent three different generations and have all experienced the reality of being the ‚Äúonly one‚Äù in their careers, navigating moments that forced them to become racially aware. through this multi-genre exploration, we hope you‚Äôll gain a deeper insight into the power of storytelling and the importance of representation in the arts.
north county african american women‚Äôs association (ncaawa), oceanside public library (opl), and oma are proud to partner on the presentation of this community discussion.

featured artists & speakers:
-marshall toomey: an animator, artist, and author, marshall will share insights from his upcoming book and reflect on his journey in the animation industry and elsewhere. he will also read a short excerpt from his unpublished work, offering attendees a unique glimpse into his experiences. marshall is currently an exhibiting artist at oma.
-laura williams: voice actor from the lion king, a piano prodigy, and daughter of o‚Äôside community-renowned arts commissioner karen williams graham. laura will perform a song from the lion king, sharing her experience as the voice of young nala and the impact it has had on her and her family‚Äôs lives.
-kevin ‚Äúblax‚Äù burroughs: as the artistic director of oceanside theatre company, kevin "blax" burroughs is an award-winning multi-hyphenate theater artist with expertise in directing, choreography, lighting design, and performance. as the youngest artistic director of a professional theater in san diego county, kevin has worked with notable companies such as moonlight stage productions, cygnet theatre, new village arts, and san diego musical theatre. he will also graciously perform a song live.
-elaine swann, moderator: one of the nation‚Äôs most recognized lifestyle and etiquette experts, elaine is the founder of the swann school of protocol, an institution dedicated to enriching lives through etiquette and social courtesies. she is a sought-after keynote speaker, corporate etiquette trainer, and author of let crazy be crazy. elaine will lead this engaging and thought-provoking discussion.
