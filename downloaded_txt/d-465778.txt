isn't it amazing? you plug a power cord into an ac receptacle at one end of your audio system and music comes out of the other end. you place a disk of stamped plastic on a rotating platter and, voilà, you're in a concert hall. in the mid-1980s, the late dr. arthur loesch (pronounced "lesh," like the grateful dead's phil lesh), physicist and professor of atmospheric dynamics at the university of new york at albany, developed a unique collection of audio components designed to bring the excitement of live music into his home. now you can enjoy the magic that professor loesch created in your own listening room. visit the pages linked above to learn more about each component.
