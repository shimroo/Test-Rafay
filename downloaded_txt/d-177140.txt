colorized running husky done by me to look like our original siberian loki.
we often grant permission to requests from other siberian
        husky sites to include our "loki" image above, however, we request that the image is not
        to be used as part of any other site banners as it has been
        part of one of our site banners since 1997. the original banner only referenced 100+ siberians.
