welcome to the 2025 championship season!
this year, weâre proud to present a schedule that offers flexibility and opportunity for players of all ages and genders 
to compete in our events. our format is designed to ensure fairness and inclusivity, whether youâre a seasoned competitor or a new participant.

our gross divisions bring together the most competitive fields, structured by age and tees played, without the 
use of handicaps. these divisions emphasize skill and precision, offering a true test of ability.

for those seeking a balanced and inclusive playing experience, our net divisions leverage the handicap system to 
level the playing field. these divisions allow participants to select tees that match their competitive goals and comfort 
level. while shorter tees may result in a lower handicap, players still compete against the entire net field in one inclusive division.

whether you aim to challenge yourself against the best or simply enjoy the camaraderie of competition, our 2025 championship 
events are designed to meet you where you are. join us for a season that celebrates the love of the game and the spirit of competition!
