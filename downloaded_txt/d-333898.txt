welcome back my 
      friends....




thank you 
      for supporting guitarattack.com!

guitarattack.com began as a hobby in 
      the pre-social media world of 1998.  
      originally started as a two-page site to document the jeff beck les paul build, it has 
      grown steadily into what it is today.  we've made lots of friends over the 
      years and appreciate all we have learned about guitars from this journey. 

we use this site to talk 
      about our guitar 
      pickups, guitar repair, our original music, and general information on 
      guitars.  visit often - there is a lot to look at 
      here and make sure you visit our guitarattack forum to join the 
      conversation.
 









 
      make sure you check out our new kandahar guitar society (kgs) ep, jet 
      black sky.  it is our first ep since 2020 and it was a lot of fun 
      to get the band back together to record this project.  

thanks for the support.  
      we getting ready to get out there and play some live dates soon and the 
      new ep is being recorded now.

held over!
      we are lucky to own an 
      original 1988 e-serial number fender hm strat and a fender japan hm strat reissue from 2020.  
      how do they stack up?  click here to read the review. 
don't pass up our adventure 
      in gretsch pickup upgrades.  our korean-made electromatic 5120 was kind of tired 
      and we decided to do an electronics upgrade. 
      click here to read all 
      about it.
note:  these are 
      completely uncompensated reviews and have turned out to be very popular.











 




we've been winding and repairing pickups since way back 
      in the year 2000. winds and tones are still the same as always 
      but we are constantly evolving and getting better.
we do a lot of custom pickup work - including repair - and if you want 
      something you can't get from a big box store, ebay, or an offshore website, shoot us an email. 
      



click here to read all about 
      our pickups including our 1984 humbucker. we are extremely 
      busy in the shop but we always look forward to the next challenge. more to follow on our schedule...drop us 
      a note.
we are always building one-offs and 
      custom builds. we've been building a lot of pickups 
      for coodercasters, and we can also fix your old supro lap steel pickup.  
      let us know what you 
      are looking for.

      diagrams.
