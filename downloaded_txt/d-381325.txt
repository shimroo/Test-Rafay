hein bijlmakers  



welcome to my home page
my family name is “bijlmakers” which means “axe maker”. it’s the second oldest profession.
on my website you will find pages on a variety of topics such as “insects”, “agriculture”, “genealogy” (my family tree), collections of “proverbs and quotes”, information about “wine making”, and much more. this page is the starting point to visit all my pages; just pick one of the topics below.
“every problem can be solved”

insects and spiders
      
i am an entomologist, so i created several websites about insects and spiders. have a look at:

entomology for beginners
araneology for beginners
proverbs and quotes about insects
glossary of entomology


 

fruits & vegetables
visit the world crops database
are you interested in agriculture? visit these pages:

fruits for beginners
vegetables for beginners
cereals for beginners
tropical fruits

also have a look at the world crops database with information and photos of hundreds of agricultural crops.


 

genealogy


one of my hobbies is collecting information about my family tree with all its branches and roots.
surnames in the family tree include: bijlmakers, rulkens, vaessen, deckers and körner.

 

proverbs and quotes
another hobby is collecting proverbs and quotes on a wide range of topics.
for example, this quote by george bernard shaw:
i often quote myself. it adds spice to my conversation.
have a look at “insect proverbs and quotes” or “fruits proverbs and quotes“. more proverbs and quotes are on a separate website: “quoteproverbs.com“.

 

play games

i like programming so i developed some games  to play on my website.

wine making

yet another hobby is wine making and i am especially proud on my honey wine or mead.
of course i have also collected some proverbs and quotes about wine.
“some men will build a wine cellar when they have found just one grape”

 

simulating insect populations

i created a few pages about making computer simulations of the growth of insect populations.
have a look at this short introduction: simulate an insect population.
a more complicated simulation is this: pest control simulation.

 

simulating evolution

i wrote a few scripts to simulate evolution or ‘natural selection’.
read first the introduction: simulating evolution.
the most detailed evolution script is the peppered moth simulation. but also have a look at the peacock simulation.

 

other pages and links

i have several other pages such as the page about the cooper test. 
also, have a look at my other websites, such as beautiful chiangmai and books. 
and here are my dutch pages.
