wargames
blitzkrieg commander (spanish civil war and world war two, 1936-45), cold war commander (modern, 1946+) and future war commander (the future) are fast-play wargame rules that allow you to re-create combined-arms battles from the second world war through to the present day and well into the future, using miniatures on a tabletop. command anything from a company right up to a division and get a result in 2-3 hours without becoming bogged-down in detail. suitable for miniatures from 2mm right up to 28mm (including 3mm, 6mm, 1/285 scale, 10mm, 12mm, n gauge, 15mm and 20mm) and no re-basing is required.
