vaccination liberation


vaccination liberation is part of a national grassroots network dedicated to providing 
information on vaccinations not often made available to the public so that one can make the only informed choice, 
complete avoidance and refusal.

mission statement:


  to reveal the myth that vaccines are necessary, safe and effective
  to expand our awareness of alternatives in healthcare
  to preserve our right to abstain
  to repeal all compulsory vaccination laws nationwide
