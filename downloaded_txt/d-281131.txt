ayurveda is india’s 5,000-year-old “science of life” – it is the art of living in harmony with nature. your “dosha” is your ayurvedic mind/body type, and it expresses in your personality traits and physical attributes.
there are three doshas in ayurveda: vata (air and space), pitta (fire and water), and kapha (earth and water). we each have all three of the doshas in our physiology, just in different, individualized proportions. your dosha is unique and personal to you, like your fingerprint.
to determine your unique dosha, start by taking the dosha quiz. this will help you understand which dosha is dominant for you, and what steps you can take to be your healthiest and happiest!

“ that is the truly beautiful and encouraging aspect of freedom; no onestruggles for it just for himself.”-fanny lewald, in hanna ballin lewis, “the education of fanny lewald”(1871)
if there is a lesson in our struggle for freedom, (and there always is a lesson, in any struggle) then it is that there is no separation between us. weare all one. we are not truly free until each and every one of us is free.-lissa coffey
