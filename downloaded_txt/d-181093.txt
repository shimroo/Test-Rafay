"we started camping at ocean view about 25 years ago! they have everything you could possibly need right in the campground, but if you do decide to leave the beach is only 5 minutes away. they have casual dining on site and many fantastic restaurants close to the campground! i can't imagine a better place to go on vacation!"

"very nice campground with a nice quiet atmosphere depending on where you are. some parts are where the action is, but our family stayed in the quiet area. there are many things to do and most are included with no extra fees. there is a pool, lake, mini golf course, two arcades, and a tram for free that runs all over the campground. this place is good for people who have trailers and like to camp seasonally, but is also good for people like us who like to stay one week in a cabin. you will not find any bugs in your cabin or bathrooms. this is definitely the best campground i have ever been to with my family and i cannot wait to go next year!"
