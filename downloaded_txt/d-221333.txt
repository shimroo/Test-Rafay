how it works
bankruptcy pre-filing certificate
during your pre-filing bankruptcy counseling session, a certified credit counselor will work with you one-on-one to develop a detailed personal financial assessment. your counselor will review your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. this in-depth bankruptcy credit counseling process will provide you with a true and accurate picture of your financial situation, a reasonable and manageable spending plan, a detailed action plan, and short and long-term financial goals.
upon completion of the bankruptcy counseling session, you’ll be issued a certificate of participation that allows you to proceed with the bankruptcy filing process. certificates are delivered by email, fax, or mail.
bankruptcy pre-discharge certificate
the pre-discharge education course covers a variety of financial and budgeting topics, giving you the tools necessary to build a strong financial foundation.
you’ll discover how to set achievable financial goals, calculate your net worth, create a livable budget, and build a savings plan. in addition, the program facilitator will show you how to obtain credit reports, establish or re-establish credit, dispute errors, and protect yourself from identity theft.
