all new reviews appear on our new modern 
			mobile-friendly site here:




https://www.musicwebinternational.com/

since musicweb was founded nearly 30 years 
				ago, the internet has moved 
			on, and at an increasing pace. we have been conscious of the need to 
			upgrade the site; for example to make it mobile-friendly. i’m 
			delighted to say that moment has arrived. the new site will be the 
				home for all new reviews and articles published from december 
				2022 onwards. the new site represents a really important 
				step in musicweb’s development. it will offer a clearer layout, 
				easier navigation and a crisp, modern look. however, we 
			know that our readers greatly value, as a source for reference, the 
			huge amount of material that musicweb has previously published. 
 
				therefore, musicweb will now operate on two sites with the old site 
			(where you are now) to be known as the musicweb archive. the old site will not be 
			completely inactive - a number of the more substantial sections 
			(e.g. the indexes) will remain here and continue to be 
			updated.  the message board will still work from either site 
			and you will still be able to access all our nearly 60,000-strong back catalogue of reviews and all original articles. 
				you will know which site you are on because they will look 
				totally different. links on both sites will mean you can easily 
				flip between the two. 
                    there will be one or two features of the present site which 
                    we won’t be able to replicate, at least initially, on 
                    the new version. however, i think that any lost features will 
                    be amply compensated by the improved look and feel of the 
                    new site; furthermore, we will continue to work on it to make 
                    it even better for you over time.
onwards and upwards!len mullenger

musicweb 
        international reviews more classical recordings than any other site.

 
recent articles & notices
it has come to our attention that the now defunct online cd 
	retailer crotchet, to which we used to link reviews back in the 2000s, has had 
	its domain name taken over by an escort agency. so if you see a link to 
	crotchet on our site, please don't click on it. there are probably thousands 
	of reviews with the crotchet link, so it isn't feasible to go back and 
	delete them all.

musicweb international is seeking new reviewers for cds, videos, digital downloads and 
			streaming. if this interests you, please 
		send a specimen review to len mullenger 
		(len@musicweb-international.com). we regret this position is unpaid.
