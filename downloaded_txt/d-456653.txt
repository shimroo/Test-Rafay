rip blog.





considering today's events, it seems like as good a time as any to make this offischyul:i'm retiring from the blog business.  sold out to the man.  been bought out.  pulling a michael scott.  whatever.it's been in the back of my mind for a while, as some of you well know.  and i think it was fairly evident -- i wasn't writing very often and when i did, it was mostly pretty bad.  i got an offer to take the domain name off my hands a couple of weeks ago (that will be happening sometime in the near future), so it's a perfect solution.in my grand tradition of making decisions ridiculously compulsively, i went and ate some lunch and decided it was time to be done.i officially started with ayl this week, and i'm still writing for asn.  you can call me all the names you want over there.  i've learned a lot in the three years i wrote this blog, primarily from my mistakes.  i hope to do better in my new ventures.thanks for reading.  and don't forget to read yourself some kick-ass landycakes fan fiction.
