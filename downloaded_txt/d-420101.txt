owned and operated by real freezer engineers with the goal to create high-quality freezers with state-of-the-art technology. 

















spiral freezers – tunnel freezers
advanced equipment produces three different capacity ranges for our iqf spiral freezer. our packaged spiral freezers process small capacity (1-2,000 lbs per hour) to medium capacity (8,000 to 10,000 lbs per hour) production levels. our site assembled spiral freezer handles large capacities (over 10,000 lbs per hour).
advanced equipment offers eight tunnel freezer versions that handle a wide range of food freezing processes. our modular tunnel freezers allow you to expand freezing capacities without having to replace your existing freezer. scalability is just one of the advantages of an advanced tunnel freezer.
advanced engineers have over 250 years of experience in the design and manufacturing of iqf tunnel and spiral freezers. specialized expertise is why you can expect higher efficiency, less floor space, lower operating and equipment costs with an advanced equipment tunnel or spiral freezer.
