  degree finders                     skip to content      degree finders                find freedom & happiness just on the other side of alternative education & online business     helping you navigate the digital landscape and build toward your own dream one opportunity at a time.         my #1 opportunity                                why i made this sitethe traditional career path never really worked out too well for me:go to school, get a ‘safe’ 9-to-5, save up all your money, and maybe one day you’ll have enough to retire! like many of you, i bought into that plan at first… but after a while i realized i was just wasting my life and potential by building everyones dreams but my own.once i graduated from school, i realized how much of a flawed plan it was – and so i struck out on my own and built my own company installing garage doors and fences.but i only had one problem… i didn’t know how to generate customers!long story short, i ended up joining a local marketing course & scaled my garage door company to the moon.that course changed my life, and so i use degree finders to educate others about courses and programs that might change their lives, too.            higher vs alternative education     many of us are brought up under the following ideal: go get a higher education, get good grades, get a high paying job, be happy, retire and then hopefully live a happy life for at least 10 years. familiar? if only life allowed for things to go according to a plan like this.most often, things happen, life-altering situations come up. a little freedom is ideal throughout a lifetime. probably has a little something to do with why the alternative education industry is expected to be worth over $250 billion in the next few years. it would be impossible for an entire industry to experience this explosive growth without people like you and i asking ourselves things like: “there has to be a better way, right?” – or – “is what i’m living right now all that’s out there for me and my family?”let’s look at each using comparative aspects: income potential, control & time.                     income potential  limited to finding a new job or waiting for a direct superior to deem your efforts deserve a greater reward. the average raise given in the united states is 3% per year.        control  your day-to-day workflow is directly determined by your superior(s). essentially, wherever they decide your time is best spent for the betterment of the company (and let’s be honest – themselves). furthermore, they decide when you take time off, your work schedule and really anything else related to your work life.        time  8+ hours a day? 40+ hours a week? 40+ years? for what? sure you’ll make some money – maybe you’ll even make really good money. but for what at the end of the day? someone else’s dream?                       income potential  direct control over how much you make dependent on your desire to do so. the only one capping your income ceiling is you.        control  you have complete ownership of your day-to-day life. when you work, how you work, when you get to spend time with family, when you can travel to see new places. yeah, everything. not to mention you have complete control & ownership of the end result. the bottom line. your bottom line.        time  however much time you want to spend in relation to how much you want to make. when you own it, you get out what you put in. build it to the point you can live on it and then take a 1 year hiatus in bali with your family if that’s the dream. or just enough to be comfortable, at least you’ll have your time back and can spend it as you wish.             now, when i say alternative education, i’m talking about building something real and tangible. something that allows you to take control of your life and attain true freedom. a freedom business. your freedom business.             i evaluate opportunities based on these criteria               education    the foundation of any opportunity. if you aren’t taught the things you need to know in order to be successful then you’ll stand next to no chance of achieving what you want to achieve. it’ll be over before you even get a chance to start. pay attention to the education and training you might receive, it’s the starting point.                 industry leadership    leadership and mentorship is critical. it’s beneficial to follow someone that’s blazed the path for you, has experienced many mistakes so they can teach you how to avoid them and lead you through the ever-evolving world of alternative education, and business.                 peer network    it’s always nice to know that you aren’t in it all alone. walking the same path that others have walked before you is incredibly important for various reasons. it can provide motivation, show a proven path to what you want for yourself and provide an additional element of support when you have questions you need answered, or even reassurance.                 the #1 online money making model i place above all the rest     being a digital landlord                  ownership & control    this model isn't just about changing your own life, it's about changing the lives of other people along the way. as a dl, those lives would be those of small business owners & their familes.                 profit margins    as a digital landlord you have complete ownership & control of your digital assets, which means the cost of your services & who you work with is always in your hands.                 impact    your digital assets can generate anywhere from $500-$1200+ with the potential to deliver 80% margins or more, which means you get to keep the majority of the revenue you produce.               see how it works here                                latest posts...                all rights reserved
