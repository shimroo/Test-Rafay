read morewhat our clients have to say about usmark ti have been using realgy energy at my business for the last 5 years and i love the service. i save money with them year round and can see the savings so i know it really works. each year realgy contacts me at the start of winter and offers me a rate lock that saves me big bucks. this year however they contacted me and said that my utilities companies rates were lower and a warmer winter was expected so they were not going to rate lock me as they felt i would save more on the variable discount program i am on. great services. couldn’t recommend them enough.leon kthey have provided my natural gas exactly as they advertised. i have had no issues whatsoever with realgy energy. i am willing to give them a high rating for the bbb.
