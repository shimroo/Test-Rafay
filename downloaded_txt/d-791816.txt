hafiz speaks of the fleeting nature of passion


altthese line are from ghazal به مژگان سیَه (with your dark lashes) written by hafiz حافظ, in the 13th century: جهان پیر است و بی‌بنیاد از این فرهادکُش فریادکه کرد افسون و نیرنگش ملول از جانِ شیرینمthis world is ancient and fragile, so beware of love, that cruel deceiver, like the one that destroyed farhad,for its magic and tricks have left me weary, even of my beloved shirin, once the muse of my affections- - - these two lines are powerful statements, speaking about the love story of farhad and shirin فرهاد و شیرین. hafiz employs a powerful analogy to the doomed love of farhad and shirin to convey their own disillusionment. this storytelling element showcases the destructive potential of love and the importance of maintaining perspective in the face of its allure.— farhad azad

in this world of change…


i came across these lines that ahmad zahir would sometimes recite before his private recordings. they possess a stoic quality, an acceptance of life’s highs and lows, emphasizing the fleeting nature of both joy and sorrow. this, too, reflected his own existence, a sentiment he felt deeply during his brief life—that all experiences, in time, fade away.— farhad azadfall 2024 photo: by farhad azad (tübingen, germany)

the inheritance of shadows


the inheritance of shadows: a brief glance at spozhmai zaryab’s “the hunt for the angel”by farhad azad, summer 2024in شکار فرشته “the hunt for the angel,” acclaimed kabul-born author سپوژمی زریاب spozhmai zaryab (1949-) composes a stirring tale of a young girl’s enchantment with snowfall, which is swiftly overshadowed by her mother’s well-intentioned yet harmful religious stories. spozhmai zaryab elegantly knits together themes of childhood innocence, boundless imagination, and the insidious nature of fear-based religious indoctrination.as the girl’s curiosity about the origin of snow is met with a fantastical tale of angels descending from the heavens, her world expands with wonder. however, this nascent joy is soon tempered by her mother’s recollections of a childhood haunted by the specter of judgmental angels, diligently recording every deed for the impending day of judgment. the mother’s own anxieties, handed down by her grandmother’s teachings, become a chilling inheritance for her daughter.spozhmai zaryab’s narrative probes the delicate balance between nurturing a child’s natural curiosity and imposing a belief system that prioritizes fear and punishment. the story serves as a stark reminder that well-meaning intentions can inadvertently stifle a child’s spirit, replacing awe and joy with fear and guilt.this exploration of childhood trauma, subtly inflicted through seemingly innocuous interactions, is a frequent motif in spozhmai zaryab’s corpus. her works often shine a spotlight on the child’s perspective, revealing the insidious ways in which outdated traditions and societal norms can erode innocence and creativity. in “the hunt for the angel,” zaryab gently reminds us of the profound impact that stories, whether whispered in hushed tones or clamored from pulpits, can have on the malleable minds of the youth.

the hunt for the angel


altby spozhmai zaryabtranslated from the farsi by farhad azad, summer 2024my daughter stood by the window in the kitchen. i chopped onions, and she watched the snow fall with her round eyes. from her gaze, i realized that she was enjoying the spectacle of the delicate snowflakes falling gracefully, majestically toward the ground. the sight of the snow falling enchanted her. she grabbed my hem and said: “who makes it snow?”reflexively, i answered: “angels.”she didn’t understand, so i continued, “each snowflake is an angel coming from heaven to earth.”she asked: “what is an angel?”i said: “an angel.”it had been a few days since my daughter turned four. in her mind, she had a relatively clear understanding of angels. she had looked at pictures of angels in illustrated books that i had difficulty finding with some effort for her.a beautiful and magical being with white wings— wide-eyed and hesitant, she asked: “and does each snowflake have an angel that brings it down to the ground?”i said: “yeah.”next to the window, she couldn’t see the snowfall very well. she ran at once and brought cushions, stacked them on each other, and stood on them. she grew taller, pressed her face against the window, and watched the snowfall, awestruck. she was silent.with difficulty, i opened my eyes, still burning from the onions, and gazed towards my daughter.it seemed to me that she saw a lovely and mystical creature with white wings descending towards the ground with each snowflake.it seemed to her that the space was filled with beautiful and enchanting life forms with white wings as if they each had embraced the snowflakes in their arms. my daughter turned her face and questioned: “can’t we see the angels?”i said: “no.”then she said: “i wish i had white wings and could bring the snow down. how fun!”and then she giggled. from the giggling, i felt joy.as i was dicing onions, i stepped back twenty-five years. i remember that one day, i asked my grandmother the same question, and she said, “on each snowflake, an angel from the sky brings it down to the earth.”and i too amazed, asked: “can’t we see the angels?”my grandmother said: “no.”i asked again: “what is an angel?”my grandmother, at first surprised and speechless, and then vexed, said, “we cannot see angels. all places are filled with angels.”and i fearfully looked around me and didn’t see anything.my grandmother carried on: “right now, as you’re sitting, there is an angel in front of you and an angel behind you, one on your left shoulder and one on your right shoulder.”again, i immediately peeked in front of me, behind me, at my right shoulder, and at my left shoulder. i didn’t see anything, but this unseen presence around me terrified me.again, my grandmother said: “if a person does good deeds, the angel who sits on their right shoulder writes down the person’s good deeds. if a person does bad deeds, the angel who sits on their left shoulder and writes it down." i was scared. it seemed to me that these invisible creatures were sitting around me and, without me seeing or knowing, were quickly writing something about me, which frightened me.i asked again: "what do they do with it?”“they are writing down into our account of deeds.”“what is an account of deeds?”my grandmother, as usual, was rolling the prayer beads in her hands and looking towards the sky. the sky was not visible with snowflakes as they slowly and gloriously came towards the earth.she said: “the account of deeds on the day of judgement will be of use to a person on a sheet of paper. all the person’s deeds are written on it, the good deeds of a person, the bad deeds of a person, all of it. if a person’s good deeds are many, they will go to heaven. if there are more bad deeds, they will go to hell.”and then she sighed and added: “may god protect us from the fires of hell. in hell, no matter what a person does, they hit them with a flaming club. the person is shattered and broken into pieces. again, the ants gather all the pieces, put them in one place, and make the person whole again. again, they hit the person on the head with a flaming club, and the person is shattered again… the person burns from thirst and wants water, but no one gives them water.”and i imagined hell as a huge torture chamber that on all sides of it were mutilated, burnt, and pulverized people; dismembered, fragmented, and burnt hands; dismembered and burnt legs; dismembered and burnt heads; dismembered and burnt…horrifying it was, and from that moment my relationship with the angel of my left shoulder, in fact with my left shoulder with my left hand and foot was ruined.like a secretary, this angel on my left shoulder wrote about me from morning to night to night to morning. and jotted down and aimed to send me to hell. if i didn’t greet my grandmother, if i looked directly into my grandmother’s eyes, if i didn’t obey everything whether just or unjust, if i questioned anything, if i drank a glass of water and forgot to say thank you, if my grandmother entered and i didn’t stand up straight, and if i didn’t kiss my grandmother’s hand, i knew i was doomed.like a dependable scribe, the angel on my left shoulder would write down all my sins and report them. the distance between me and hell would grow closer and closer. sometimes, out of fear, against my own will. sometimes, out of fear, against my own will, i would turn my face towards my left shoulder and force a friendly smile. i wanted to tell the angel on my shoulder that i loved her so that in this way, my relationship with the angel on my left shoulder would be good and at least not unjustly or write anything on that page out of spite.the angel on my left shoulder had become a bad dream for me. during the days, in any event, i wasn’t very aware of the presence of the angels. but at night, in alone bed, i drew the blanket over my head, i’d ponder about the angel on my left shoulder. i would think about the things it had reported. i would hear the sound of my breaths, the beating of my heart, and all the sins i had committed that day. i would think, and to god, i prayed that the angel wouldn’t have written anything unjustly, that it wouldn’t have written out of malice, that it wouldn’t have written for no reason. i prayed that it would write down exactly what i had done… what would happen if it didn’t know the meaning of this or that act?what if it wrote something false about me… and then, while still under the covers, i promised myself that starting tomorrow, i shall greet my grandmother, not look her directly in the eye, obey her in everything whether just or unjust, and not question her. if i drank a glass of water, i would definitely thank her. if someone entered the room, i would stand up straight. i would kiss the hands of all the elders. then i would ask myself again, “what if this angel on my left shoulder scribbles everything down unfairly and out of spite, and on the day of judgment, with an open book, they stand and read its writings out loud? how will it be?" i thought a flaming club would strike my head, shattering me into pieces. then, the ants would gather my fragments.i was in the kitchen with oil, onion, rice, and meat. the smell of fried onions filled every corner. i saw my daughter moving the chair from under this window to under that window and from this room to that room, going to and fro to see the falling snow better and better.i saw that she opened the window. she put her hand out of the window. snowflakes fell on her palms.she shouted: "an angel is in my hand! sitting!she ran to me. her fist was shut.she said: "do you see? there is an angel in my fist?”a drop of water slid into her tiny palm when she opened her hand. she said, “it flew away. did you see it? it went to bring more snow. did you see?”i said: “no.”she adamantly said: “i saw it!”she grabbed my dress and said: “buy me two white wings.”i said: “okay, i will buy them." "when?”“tomorrow.”she asked: how much will it cost?i said: “i don’t know.”she hastily searched her jacket pockets, dragged something out, and said: “i have my own money. let’s go then.”i said: “i told you i will buy them tomorrow.”she tilted her head to one side.impatiently, she said: “well, tomorrow they will be here in the same place, so let’s go!”i said: “well, wait until i finish my work." my daughter jumped up with joy. she laughed. with hope, i watched her run to the other room.perhaps i was also gazing hopefully at the world of possibilities, at a world where it is possible to wish for everything, think about everything, and say everything. in this world, there are endless tomorrows. tomorrow is today, right now, and numbers are abstract concepts. my heart clenched. i remembered it had been a while since she had stood by the window in the other room, opening it and hunting for angels. i feared she might catch a cold and cough throughout the night.from the kitchen, i shouted: "close the window so you don’t catch a cold. you’ll catch a cold.”she strongly said:“ no, i won’t.”i called out again: “i said close it.”again, firmly, she said, “no, i won’t. i’m making snow angels.”i walked with greasy hands and a sweaty, wet forehead. i closed the window and returned to the kitchen. i came. i heard my daughter through the window again. i don’t know why it reminded me of my grandmother, of the story of the angels i had remembered. i said nothing. i don’t know how long she stood, but she stood before the open window, capturing the angels in her hand and releasing them. my daughter either got cold or got tired walked towards me, and said nothing; i was happy that i planned to go to the market and buy white wings she had forgotten. once she said: “what did you say before?”i asked: “what did i say?”she said: “you didn’t say angel, you said something else.”i said: “i said, angel?”she said: “yeah, "malik"…"malik” is another name for angel.“and this time, without intending to, i told her the story of the angels. i told her that an angel is in front of a person, one angel is behind a person, one angel is on a person’s right shoulder, one angel is on a person’s left shoulder. i told her people will go to heaven if they do good deeds. if they do bad deeds, they will be sent to hell. i told her that if a person doesn’t obey the elders, doesn’t kiss the elder’s hand, if with the elder they argue, if they drink water and don’t say thank you if they don’t stand up straight in front of the elder’s path, the angel of the left shoulder writes all of it down.and records it in the book of deeds. when their words were finished,they sent them to hell. again, i told the story of the flaming club, the story of shattered pieces, the story of the ants, the story of thirst and scorched lips i told her, the story of asking for water—i told her the story of them not getting water.my daughter looked at me thoughtfully. i gazed at her round face and flowing, curly hair. her mouth was left open. once she went to the window of the other room, she closed. she didn’t say anything else.  hushed. her usual bounce was gone. she ate silently, and like every night, there was no fuss. she came to me every night in her pajamas while getting ready for bed.i hugged her, kissed her face, and recited a prayer. i prepared a special prayer for her bedtime. every night before sleep, as i caressed the braids of her hair, i would whisper in her ear, "may you see the sun and the moon in your dreams. may you see flowers and meadows and me in your dreams.”she laughed and said: “i see you in my dreams.”she stopped and lay down in her bed. i pulled the blanket over my daughter. she was alone. it was late at night. i finished my nightly chores. before i went to bed, i checked on her. i saw her tossing and turning under her blanket.on other nights, i would sing about the sun, moon, flowers, and meadows in her ear. when i would put her to bed, i would pull the blanket over her, and as soon as she lay her head on the pillow, she would fall asleep.i pulled the blanket off her. she moved. she was not asleep. she looked at me, a worry hidden beneath her sleepy eyes. perhaps even with fear, she thought of the angel on her left shoulder. she thought of her book of deeds. the angel on her left shoulder had written something unjust or with malice instead.this short story was written in 1983 and published in the june/july 1983 issue of the kabul based writers union digest zhwandun.about spozhmai zaryabspozhmai zaryab, born in kabul in 1949, embarked on her writing journey at seventeen with her first published short story. “my father instilled in me a profound love for literature,” she recalls. “he was an exceptional man. he never treated me as ‘just a girl’ and never imposed restrictions or forced me to do anything. in those days, before television had invaded our lives, he would spend evenings reading poems aloud, which i eagerly absorbed. i would chime in, reciting the latter half of a poem after he had begun. i must have been a mere three or four years old. later, my literary journey was enriched by a deep appreciation for farsi classical poetry. but the short story, my true literary passion, is a western innovation. i owe my love for it to foreign authors, particularly those from europe and america.”she holds a ba in french from kabul university and an ma and ph.d. in comparative literature from montpellier university in france. a prolific writer, she is the author of numerous novels and short story collections. zaryab currently resides in france.

the heart’s resting place: ahmad zahir


altthe heart’s resting placeby farhad azadjune 2024 kabul, september 2002—the summer’s heat was waning as i returned to my birthplace after two decades away. i made my way to the famed شهدای صالحین (pious martyrs) cemetery, flanked by the slopes of the کوه آسمایی (asmai mountain), where the oldest hindu temple stood, and تپه نارنج (tepe narenj), the site of a recently unearthed 6th-century buddhist stupa. i was seeking the tomb of ahmad zahir, the nightingale of kabul, the voice of generations.the path wound through dust and unmarked graves, but his tomb was unmistakable. a group of thin, hungry-looking children led me to the spot, their eyes reflecting the city’s hunger for stability and peace. the tomb, a reflection of the city he cherished, lay shattered. its white dome was gone, leaving skeletal steel rods reaching for a sky that seemed to mourn for what had been lost. the sight was a moving reminder of the artist’s absence, the city’s struggle, and the rule by the intolerant.fans had gathered fragments of the dome and marble tombstone, like relics of a saint. on one pale stone, a fan had etched the inscription “dearest of the hearts” – a fitting epitaph for an artist who had captured the essence of love and longing in his music. this devotion was a tribute to his music’s enduring impact and deep bond with his listeners.i rested against a pillar, the warm morning sun a balm on my face, as i gazed at the desecrated grave. yet, i didn’t feel his absence. perhaps it was because, as he once said on radio kabul, “music nourishes the soul of those who listen.” his songs lived on, not in this broken tomb, but in the hearts of those who truly heard them.ahmad zahir’s lyrics spanned a wide range, from tender love ballads to fiery political protests and soul-searching spiritual poems. he often said of a poem, “this captures the condition of my heart.”though he never sang this particular poem of the 13th-century mystic rumi, they resonated with his spirit, echoing in the ruins of his tomb. this poem seems particularly apt:بعد از وفات تربت ما در زمین مجویدر سینه های مردم عارف مزار ماستجلال‌الدین محمد بلخیdon’t look for our grave after we’re gone,our true resting place is in the hearts of those who are wiserumiahmad zahir was gone, taken too soon. but his music, that rich, colorful tapestry woven in a tragically short career, lived and continues to live in the hearts of millions. it was a testament to art’s enduring power, a beacon of vitality, a defiant song rising above the ruins, and a promise that the nightingale’s music would never fade even in death, inspiring generations.altalt

a voice unbound: ahmad zahir’s enduring legacy


a voice unbound: ahmad zahir’s enduring legacyby farhad azad in a 1968 radio kabul magazine interview, a young ahmad zahir, just 22 years old, spoke of his bold aspirations: “first, to perform abroad, and second, for artists’ records to be released in the market and for people to become interested in them.” a decade later, his life would be tragically cut short by murder, but not before he’d fulfilled his dreams in ways that continue to reverberate today.ahmad zahir’s music was not confined by borders, captivating audiences not just in his homeland but also in neighboring iran and tajikistan. despite the absence of vinyl records during his lifetime, his soulful voice and charismatic performances, broadcast on radio waves and captured on cassette tapes, deeply touched listeners across central asia, particularly in uzbekistan and tajikistan, leaving an indelible mark on the region’s cultural landscape.his uncanny ability to make any song his own and infuse it with a unique ahmad zahir essence solidified his place as an icon. any song he touched became indelibly his, a testament to his artistry and the emotional depth he poured into every note.this exceptional curated mix by dj omjvinyls vividly portrays ahmad zahir’s musical journey, a journey that was not solitary but one of rich collaboration and inspiration. it’s a tapestry woven from threads of diverse influences and collaborations, featuring artists from iran, tajikistan, uzbekistan, and his own homeland. we hear the voices of those who influenced him, like the revered jalil zaland, and those he collaborated with, like the composer nainawaz and the legendary mahwash. the mix ventures into the diaspora, capturing the sounds of 1980s kabul funk rock bands and the echoes of ahmad zahir’s music in the work of contemporary progressive groups. it beautifully illustrates the unity and diversity of central asian music culture, a testament to ahmad zahir’s far-reaching influence. ahmad zahir’s birthday and the anniversary of his untimely death are commemorated each year, but his spirit lives on, 24/7, in the hearts of those who continue to find solace, inspiration, and joy in his timeless music. his voice, forever young, continues to echo across the globe, a testament to the enduring power of art to transcend borders and touch the soul. it’s a legacy that surely surpasses even his own youthful dreams, a proof to the undying spirit of a true musical icon, a legacy that continues to resonate and inspire, transcending time and borders, reminding us of the universal language of music.follow  dj omjvinyls

echoes of a hidden lyricist: ahmad zahir’s uncredited collaborator


altechoes of a hidden lyricist: ahmad zahir’s uncredited collaboratorby farhad azad june 12, 2024the composer, the lyricist, the singer—a trio of elements that, when harmonized, yields timeless beauty. احمد ظاهر ahmad zahir’s آخرین شام آشنایی ما “our last evening together,” like many of his songs, possesses a singular quality. he stands as one of the few radio kabul vocalists to seamlessly blend singing and spoken word into a unified artistic expression.though the poem was attributed to the renowned poet ناصر طهوری nasser tahuri, a recent revelation by کریمه ویدا طهوری karima widaa tahuri in a 2021 article on radionowruz.com unveils a different truth:“he [ahmad zahir] had a unique taste in poetry and composed most of his songs himself. when he read the poem ‘our last evening together,’ he loved it. i took the poem to mr. [nasser] tahouri for review, which was one of his responsibilities. he changed many poem verses, not just correcting them but altering them to his liking. the poem was recorded on a radio program in its altered form. since it wasn’t customary then – and still isn’t – to mention the poet’s name, many didn’t know who the song’s original author was. it wasn’t until a few years ago, during an interview on تلویزیون آریانا افغانستان ariana afghanistan tv’s 'didgah’ program with زهره انصاری عثمانی ms. zohra ansari osmani, that i mentioned in response to a question that 'our last evening together’ was my creation.” — karima widaa tahurithis revelation adds another layer to the song’s mystique. a unique work, it remains untouched by other singers to this day. perhaps, none dare to attempt it, fearing they cannot reach the bar set by ahmad zahir’s rendition.* special thanks to parween pazhwak for her invaluable contributions in researching this introduction and providing translational edits for the poem.

a brief introduction to khalid nawisa’s short story, “the fifth season”


the unchanging seasons of oppression: khalid nawisa’s “the fifth season”by farhad azad june 9, 2024 in the summer of 1999, a year after its publication, khalid nawisa’s debut collection, “the fifth season,” found its way into my hands. the first story, a haunting tale of a traditional family steeped in religious rituals yet devoid of true spirituality, has stayed with me through the years. i recently translated it into english, compelled by its enduring resonance.the story unfolds like a medieval fable, yet its impact is as sharp today as it might have been centuries ago. hajro, a woman forbidden to marry because she inherited the family home, lives in a fort-like abode under the oppressive thumb of her brother and his family. in a modern retelling, hajro’s brother might wield a smartphone instead of a cane. still, the patriarchal structures that bind her would remain unchanged.nawisa weaves together a fusion of themes: the harmful nature of unchecked male power, the hypocrisy of religious piety used as a control tool, subtle hints of class divisions, and the crushing weight of shattered dreams. the cage, as farsi poet qahar asi put it, “remains bloodstained, as long as the song of freedom is sung.”in a 2014 interview, nawisa revealed that “the fifth season” was inspired by a woman living under taliban rule. he expressed some slight hope for progress in cities like kabul, but a decade later, even that tiny optimism seems misplaced. the rural oppression of women has flooded into the capital, and the storm clouds show no signs of clearing.

a poet’s fate: film review


by farhad azadin the epic russian-language film a poet’s fate (1959), the life of rudaki, the celebrated 9th-century farsi poet, unfolds against the backdrop of the samanid empire’s grandeur and political intrigue. rising from humble beginnings to become the court’s favored bard, rudaki’s lyrical verses captivate the ruling elite and common folk alike. this widespread appeal is vividly depicted in a scene where rudaki, a man who has risen above societal barriers, encounters a group of laborers who passionately recite his poems. this moment, a subtle nod to soviet ideals, emphasizes the capacity of art to transcend social challenges and invites the audience to empathize with rudaki’s journey.rudaki’s heart, however, is not merely captivated by negina but consumed by a fervent love for her. she is an educated enslaved woman under the ownership of the grand vizier’s wife, and his passion for her sparks a fierce determination to secure her freedom. this pursuit becomes intricately entwined with his artistic aspirations. it ultimately leads him down a perilous path of political intrigue and personal sacrifice, eliciting the audience’s profound compassion and understanding.as rudaki’s star rises, he encounters envy and opposition from the court’s military chief, a symbol of the war-mongering, anti-intellectual sentiment that threatens to stifle artistic expression and social progress. the shah praises his completed collection of poems as a masterpiece. yet, it also stirs suspicion and fear among some in power. this tension underscores the societal impact of rudaki’s poetry, as it becomes a catalyst for change and a threat to the established order, including donating his acquired wealth to the struggling poor and oppressed.  when political winds shift, he uses his poetic gifts, a weapon against tyranny in the spirit of idealistic sovietism. amidst the turmoil, he manages to secure negina’s freedom, only to see their reunion tragically cut short—a scene resembling the death of rabia balkhi in the bathhouse.throughout the film, rudaki’s relentless resilience blazes through as he persists in creating art, even in the face of subsequent exile and poverty. his steadfast belief in the power of poetry to challenge injustice and uplift the human spirit remains a wellspring of strength, even as he confronts political persecution and personal tragedy. this resilience attempts to evoke a deep feeling of admiration and respect for the main character.a poet’s fate, directed by boris kimyagarov (1920-79) and written by sotim ulughzoda (1911-97), stands out for its distinctive fusion of historical narrative and soviet-era ideals. this cinematic style allows rudaki to emerge as a folk hero, leveraging his artistic prowess to challenge the established order. his pen becomes a mighty spear against tyranny and an open invitation to embrace intellectualism for the masses.  this historical drama finely strives to portray a multifaceted historical figure. yet, in its focus, it overlooks other aspects of the poet’s life. nonetheless, rudaki’s enduring legacy as a cornerstone of farsi literature remains undeniable, his words continuing to resonate and influence centuries later.the film opens in rudakhi’s village, where the young poet (staring marat aripov, 1935-2018), already celebrated for his verse, receives a cautionary farewell from his uncle not to mingle with the nobility for “you will be a caged bird.”negina (dilbar kasymova), the intellectual enslaved woman and the love of rudaki, laments and foreshadows, “i’ll die in captivity.“we are enemies forever from now on, rudaki. someday, you will curse this unfortunate day.” — military chief (mukhamejan kasymov, 1907-1971)“it’s easy to take a poet’s life, but no one has power over his creations, not even a military chief.”—rudaki (marat aripov, 1935-2018)the tug-of-war between power and artistic expression persists in the region today.the most quoted of rudaki’s poems, “بوی جوی مولیان آید همی” “the scent of the waterway of muliyan comes to me,” composed in herat to encourage shah nasr ii (r. 914-943) to return to bukhara after a lengthy stay is depicted in this scene.muliyan, a waterway near the samanid castle in bukhara, was the site of a royal garden.echoing a historical scene from rabia balkhi, the character negina is killed in the bathhouse. she writes with her blood on the wall: “farewell, my beloved, in flames of armor today, i leave this faithless world…”in his twilight years, blind and impoverished, rudaki, reflecting on his life’s accomplishments, declares, “all my books, my wealth, my very thoughts i give to you because i loved you. i pass on, my friend, my life to those whom i loved.”watch the film “a poet’s fate”
