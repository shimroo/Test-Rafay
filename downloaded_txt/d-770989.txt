posted on february 15, 2025faith in the digital age: how social media and internet addiction challenge the church 


in today’s digital society, technology has become an integral part of everyday life. social media, streaming platforms, and online communities provide connection and information at an unprecedented scale. however, as the internet continues to evolve, so too do the challenges it presents—especially for the church. among these challenges, social media and internet addiction stand as significant obstacles, affecting both individual believers and the broader faith community.
the rise of digital distraction
the modern world is defined by instant access to entertainment, communication, and information. social media platforms like facebook, instagram, tiktok, and x (formerly twitter) encourage endless scrolling, while video streaming services keep viewers engaged with auto-play features. this constant digital stimulation can lead to addiction, characterized by compulsive online behavior, withdrawal from real-world interactions, and an inability to focus on spiritual growth.
for many christians, these distractions interfere with prayer, scripture reading, and genuine fellowship. rather than turning to god in times of distress, individuals may seek solace in the endless consumption of digital content. the convenience of online life can make it easy to prioritize virtual relationships over real-world spiritual accountability, leaving people feeling disconnected despite their constant digital engagement.
impact on the church community
churches, once the central hub for spiritual guidance and communal support, now struggle against the pervasive influence of digital culture. many believers attend church services but remain mentally checked out, scrolling through their phones even during worship. others may substitute online sermons and christian influencers for real-world church attendance, leading to a decline in active participation in faith communities.
furthermore, social media fosters a culture of comparison, where individuals measure their worth based on likes, comments, and followers. this pressure can lead to insecurity, depression, and anxiety—emotional struggles that pull believers away from faith-based confidence and reliance on god. the curated nature of online personas can also create unrealistic expectations about christian life, making genuine faith journeys feel inadequate by comparison.
the church’s response to digital addiction
recognizing the growing impact of social media and internet addiction, churches must take proactive steps to address these issues. here are a few ways faith communities can respond:

encouraging digital detox: pastors and church leaders can promote the practice of digital fasting, urging believers to take intentional breaks from social media and online distractions to refocus on their relationship with god.
teaching digital discipleship: churches can educate their members on responsible social media use, emphasizing discernment, mindfulness, and the dangers of digital addiction.
fostering real-world connections: hosting in-person bible studies, fellowship events, and community outreach programs can help believers prioritize face-to-face interactions over virtual connections.
providing counseling and support: addiction to digital media can be just as serious as substance abuse. churches can offer counseling, support groups, and resources for those struggling with compulsive online behaviors.

finding balance in a digital world
the internet is not inherently bad, and social media can be a powerful tool for spreading the gospel and connecting believers worldwide. however, unchecked addiction to digital content can weaken spiritual discipline and distance individuals from their faith. the church must navigate this reality with wisdom, helping believers find a balance that allows them to engage with technology without losing sight of their spiritual priorities.
by fostering awareness, promoting accountability, and encouraging meaningful real-world connections, the church can guide its members toward a faith-centered life in the digital age—one that embraces technology without being controlled by it.




posted on october 14, 2024navigating faith in a distracted world: how digital addictions challenge church communities 


in our hyper-connected, technology-driven world, digital distractions are everywhere. smartphones, social media, and the internet are now integral parts of everyday life, reshaping how we communicate, work, and even worship. while these innovations bring many benefits, they also introduce significant challenges, particularly for faith communities. digital addictions—whether in the form of social media dependence, excessive gaming, or compulsive use of streaming platforms—can erode spiritual focus, hinder meaningful relationships, and weaken communal bonds. for the church, navigating these distractions is a critical task as it seeks to guide its congregants toward deeper faith and stronger community.
the nature of digital addictions
digital addiction refers to the compulsive use of technology, often to the detriment of one’s mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. this form of addiction can manifest in various ways, such as compulsive scrolling through social media feeds, binge-watching videos, or obsessively checking notifications. research has shown that these behaviors can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including increased anxiety, depression, and isolation. moreover, digital addiction can create a sense of disconnection from reality, as individuals become more engrossed in their virtual lives than their real-world relationships and responsibilities.
from a faith perspective, digital addiction represents a new kind of temptation—one that draws people away from prayer, reflection, and community. it can distract individuals from their relationship with god, replacing time spent in spiritual practices with mindless digital consumption. more than just a personal issue, digital addiction affects entire church communities by undermining the depth of connection among members and weakening the collective spiritual experience.
the church’s struggle with digital distractions
for many church communities, digital addiction presents both a pastoral and cultural challenge. in an age where instant gratification is only a click away, the traditional practices of the church—such as contemplative prayer, communal worship, and deep theological reflection—can feel increasingly difficult for people accustomed to rapid, superficial interactions. this shift has been particularly pronounced among younger generations, who often struggle to find spiritual fulfillment in a world dominated by screens.
one of the most pressing concerns is how digital addiction erodes attention and focus. for christians, faith requires intentionality—a conscious decision to set aside time for prayer, bible study, and worship. however, in a world where notifications constantly pull people’s attention in multiple directions, it becomes harder to cultivate the quiet and solitude needed for spiritual growth. digital distractions interrupt the ability to engage fully with worship services, bible studies, or personal reflection, leading to a more fragmented and shallow spiritual experience.
how the church can respond
while digital addictions pose real challenges, the church is well-equipped to offer solutions that promote spiritual health and community resilience.

fostering awareness and education church leaders can start by acknowledging the issue of digital addiction and educating their congregants about its dangers. sermons, small group discussions, and bible studies can focus on the spiritual implications of digital distractions and the importance of maintaining a christ-centered focus in the midst of a technology-saturated world. encouraging reflection on personal technology use can help individuals recognize areas where they may need to set boundaries or make changes.
promoting digital sabbath practices in line with the biblical principle of sabbath rest, the church can encourage a “digital sabbath,” where members intentionally unplug from technology to create space for god, family, and real-world interactions. taking regular breaks from social media, gaming, and other digital platforms helps believers reset their minds and hearts, fostering greater awareness of god’s presence and cultivating deeper relationships with others.
building stronger in-person communities in a world dominated by virtual interactions, the church has a unique opportunity to create spaces where people can experience authentic, face-to-face community. by prioritizing in-person gatherings, fellowship events, and small group meetings, churches can help combat the isolation that often accompanies digital addiction. these gatherings provide opportunities for meaningful conversation, accountability, and mutual support that are difficult to replicate in online environments.

conclusion
in a world filled with digital distractions, the church faces new challenges as it seeks to guide individuals and communities toward spiritual wholeness. digital addictions threaten to undermine faith, community, and personal well-being, but the church can offer a countercultural response by promoting awareness, encouraging digital sabbath practices, and strengthening in-person relationships. by addressing these challenges head-on, the church can help its members navigate their faith in a distracted world, reconnecting them with the deeper spiritual truths that bring lasting fulfillment and peace.





posted on september 5, 2024digital temptations: the church’s role in addressing addictions in the age of technology 


in the modern digital age, society is more connected than ever. with smartphones, social media, and the internet dominating daily life, technology has revolutionized how we interact, learn, and work. however, with these advancements comes an often overlooked consequence—addiction. from social media dependence to gaming, pornography, and screen addiction, the digital world presents temptations that many struggle to control. as a result, the church finds itself in a unique position to address these emerging issues and provide spiritual guidance for those ensnared by digital temptations.
the rise of digital addictions
digital addiction refers to an excessive reliance on technology and digital platforms that interferes with daily life and well-being. it can manifest in various forms, such as obsessive social media use, compulsive gaming, or endless scrolling on websites. studies have shown that these behaviors can lead to negative psychological effects, including anxiety, depression, and social isolation. more disturbingly, some forms of digital addiction—such as pornography addiction—can warp individuals’ perceptions of relationships and morality.
for many, these digital distractions serve as a coping mechanism for deeper emotional or psychological struggles. the constant barrage of notifications, the allure of likes and comments, and the instant gratification offered by online platforms can foster a sense of dependency, similar to substance addiction. people may seek validation, escape from reality, or an artificial sense of fulfillment through their screens.
the church’s role in addressing digital addictions
historically, the church has always played a pivotal role in addressing societal issues. from helping people overcome substance abuse to supporting mental health, the church has provided a safe space for healing and spiritual growth. in the context of digital addiction, the church is uniquely positioned to offer guidance, support, and a path toward balance and spiritual well-being.

raising awareness and educating congregants the first step in combating digital addiction is acknowledging the problem. many individuals may not even realize they have an unhealthy relationship with technology. church leaders can raise awareness by incorporating sermons, bible studies, or discussion groups that explore the dangers of digital addiction. by framing it as a spiritual battle against temptation, the church can motivate congregants to reflect on their use of technology and the ways it affects their faith, relationships, and mental health.
encouraging digital fasting the church has long advocated for fasting as a way to develop self-control, deepen faith, and grow spiritually. a “digital fast” can be a powerful tool for those struggling with digital addiction. encouraging congregants to take breaks from social media, gaming, or other forms of technology can help them reclaim time for prayer, reflection, and connection with others. this intentional break also fosters mindfulness, allowing individuals to recognize their dependence on digital distractions and realign their priorities with their spiritual values.
providing spiritual counseling and accountability for those battling addiction, spiritual counseling and accountability are crucial. the church can provide a safe space where individuals can talk about their struggles openly. spiritual leaders and trained counselors can offer guidance on how to integrate healthier digital habits and break free from the cycles of addiction. small groups or accountability partners within the church community can also provide support, helping individuals stay on track as they work toward healthier technology use.
modeling balanced use of technology in an age where digital devices are nearly unavoidable, the church must model responsible and balanced use of technology. church leaders can set an example by demonstrating how technology can be used as a tool for good—spreading the gospel, connecting communities, and sharing knowledge—without becoming enslaved by it. by emphasizing moderation and intentionality, the church can guide its members to use technology in ways that align with their spiritual values.

conclusion
as digital temptations continue to rise, the church plays a critical role in helping individuals navigate the challenges of modern technology. by raising awareness, promoting digital fasting, offering counseling, and modeling balanced technology use, the church can empower its members to reclaim control over their digital lives. ultimately, the church’s mission in this digital age remains the same: to lead people toward spiritual freedom, healing, and a deeper relationship with god. in doing so, the church can help individuals break free from the shackles of digital addiction and rediscover the true fulfillment found in faith and community.




posted on july 29, 2024navigating the digital age: how the church is addressing internet and social media addictions 


in the contemporary world, digital technology permeates every aspect of daily life, reshaping how we communicate, work, and even worship. as the internet and social media become ever more integral to modern existence, they also bring a host of new challenges, including addiction. the church, traditionally a bastion of moral and spiritual guidance, is now stepping up to address the growing concern of internet and social media addictions among its congregants.
recognizing the problem
the first step in addressing any addiction is recognizing its existence and understanding its impact. internet and social media addictions are characterized by excessive use, leading to negative consequences in personal, professional, and social spheres. symptoms often include neglect of responsibilities, withdrawal from face-to-face interactions, and emotional disturbances like anxiety and depression. the church has increasingly acknowledged that these digital dependencies can be as destructive as substance addictions, undermining the well-being of individuals and communities.
spiritual and psychological support
churches are uniquely positioned to offer support through a combination of spiritual guidance and psychological counseling. many congregations have initiated programs that integrate faith-based approaches with contemporary psychological practices. pastoral counseling often includes discussions about the spiritual voids that individuals might be attempting to fill with excessive internet use. by fostering a sense of purpose and belonging, churches help individuals find healthier ways to connect and fulfill their spiritual needs.
education and awareness
education is a critical tool in combating digital addiction. many churches are organizing workshops and seminars to educate their members about the risks associated with excessive internet and social media use. these educational efforts often include practical advice on setting boundaries, recognizing the signs of addiction, and seeking help when needed. by raising awareness, the church empowers individuals to take proactive steps in managing their digital consumption.
creating digital detox programs
recognizing the need for concrete action, some churches have developed digital detox programs. these initiatives encourage members to take breaks from their screens and engage in offline activities that promote real-world connections and personal growth. retreats, communal activities, and service projects provide opportunities for members to reconnect with each other and with their faith in a more profound way. these programs not only help reduce digital dependency but also strengthen the sense of community within the church.
leveraging technology for good
while addressing the negative aspects of digital technology, the church also recognizes its potential as a force for good. many churches are leveraging social media and other online platforms to extend their reach, engage with their congregants, and spread positive messages. online bible studies, virtual prayer groups, and live-streamed services are just a few examples of how technology can be harnessed to support spiritual growth and community building. by modeling responsible and purposeful use of digital tools, the church sets a positive example for its members.
support groups and accountability partners
support groups and accountability partnerships are other effective strategies being employed by churches. these groups provide a safe space for individuals to share their struggles and successes in managing their digital habits. accountability partners offer encouragement and hold each other responsible for maintaining healthy boundaries. through these support networks, individuals gain the strength and motivation needed to overcome their addictions.
in an era dominated by digital connectivity, the church plays a vital role in addressing the challenges of internet and social media addictions. by offering a blend of spiritual guidance, educational resources, and practical support, churches help individuals navigate the complexities of the digital age. through community-based initiatives and a balanced approach to technology, the church not only addresses the symptoms of addiction but also fosters a deeper sense of purpose, connection, and faith among its members




posted on june 13, 2024church initiatives in addiction support 


in recent years, churches have increasingly recognized their role in addressing addiction within their communities. with a mission rooted in compassion and support, many churches have developed initiatives aimed at helping individuals and families struggling with substance abuse. these initiatives not only provide practical assistance but also offer spiritual guidance and a sense of community, essential elements in the journey to recovery.
1. creating safe spaces
one of the fundamental contributions churches make to addiction support is creating safe spaces where individuals feel welcomed and accepted despite their struggles. this non-judgmental environment is crucial for those grappling with the stigma often associated with addiction. churches strive to cultivate an atmosphere where individuals can share their experiences openly, knowing they will find understanding and support.
2. support groups and counseling
many churches host support groups specifically tailored for individuals dealing with addiction. these groups provide a platform for sharing experiences, discussing challenges, and offering mutual encouragement. faith-based counseling services are also common, offering individuals and families a confidential setting to explore the spiritual aspects of their recovery journey.
3. education and awareness
churches play a vital role in educating their congregations and communities about addiction. they organize seminars, workshops, and educational sessions to raise awareness about the signs of addiction, its impact on individuals and families, and available resources for support. by fostering understanding and empathy, churches help reduce stigma and create a more supportive environment for those seeking help.
4. prayer and spiritual guidance
spiritual support is integral to many church initiatives in addiction recovery. churches offer prayer services, spiritual counseling, and pastoral care to help individuals find strength and solace in their faith. for many recovering individuals, spirituality serves as a cornerstone in their journey toward healing, providing a sense of purpose and connection to something greater than themselves.
5. outreach and community engagement
churches extend their addiction support initiatives beyond their walls by engaging with the wider community. they collaborate with local organizations, rehabilitation centers, and healthcare providers to ensure individuals receive comprehensive care. some churches also participate in advocacy efforts, supporting policies and initiatives that promote addiction prevention and treatment.
6. family support
recognizing that addiction affects not just the individual but also their loved ones, churches often provide support programs for families impacted by addiction. these programs offer guidance on coping strategies, communication skills, and how to navigate the complexities of addiction within a familial context. by strengthening family bonds and providing practical assistance, churches help create a more supportive network for recovery.
7. celebrating milestones
churches celebrate the milestones of individuals in recovery, such as periods of sobriety or personal achievements. these celebrations are significant as they reinforce positive behavior and encourage continued progress. they also highlight the importance of community support in sustaining long-term recovery.
church initiatives in addiction support are diverse and multifaceted, reflecting a holistic approach to addressing the complex challenges of addiction. by providing safe spaces, support groups, education, spiritual guidance, outreach, family support, and celebrating milestones, churches play a vital role in supporting individuals and families on their journey to recovery. through these initiatives, churches exemplify compassion, empathy, and faith in action, demonstrating their commitment to healing and restoring lives affected by addiction.





posted on may 3, 2024how technology addiction is shaping church dynamics 


in today’s digital age, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, profoundly influencing how we communicate, interact, and engage with the world around us. while advancements in technology have brought numerous benefits and conveniences, they have also given rise to new challenges, including the prevalence of technology addiction. as individuals increasingly grapple with compulsive behaviors related to smartphones, social media, and digital entertainment, these trends are reshaping the dynamics within church communities. in this article, we’ll explore how technology addiction is shaping church dynamics and the ways in which churches can respond to this evolving landscape.
1. altered patterns of engagement:
one of the primary ways in which technology addiction is shaping church dynamics is through altered patterns of engagement among congregants. with the proliferation of smartphones and other digital devices, individuals may find themselves distracted or disengaged during church services and events, as they succumb to the temptation to check notifications, browse social media, or engage in other online activities. this constant connectivity can disrupt the worship experience and hinder meaningful participation in church activities, impacting the overall sense of community and fellowship.
2. fragmented attention and presence:
technology addiction can also contribute to fragmented attention and presence within church settings. instead of fully immersing themselves in worship, prayer, or fellowship, individuals may struggle to maintain focus and concentration, as their minds wander to digital distractions. this divided attention not only detracts from the worship experience for the individual but also affects the collective atmosphere within the church, diminishing the sense of reverence, unity, and spiritual connection among congregants.
3. challenges in communication and connection:
in addition to affecting individual engagement, technology addiction can present challenges in communication and connection within church communities. while digital communication platforms offer convenient ways to stay connected, they can also foster shallow, superficial interactions that lack depth and authenticity. moreover, excessive reliance on digital communication channels may erode face-to-face interactions and interpersonal relationships, hindering the development of meaningful connections within the church.
4. opportunities for outreach and support:
despite its challenges, technology addiction also presents opportunities for churches to extend outreach and support to individuals struggling with addiction. by leveraging digital platforms and resources, churches can provide educational materials, support groups, and counseling services tailored to address technology addiction and its effects on mental health and well-being. additionally, churches can utilize social media and online platforms to disseminate messages of hope, encouragement, and spiritual guidance to individuals in need.
5. cultivating digital discipleship:
in response to the prevalence of technology addiction, churches are increasingly focusing on cultivating digital discipleship—a holistic approach to faith formation that integrates technology with spiritual practices and principles. digital discipleship initiatives may include online devotionals, virtual small groups, and interactive worship experiences designed to engage congregants in meaningful ways and foster spiritual growth in the digital realm. by embracing digital discipleship, churches can harness the power of technology to deepen faith, build community, and facilitate transformative encounters with god.
in conclusion, technology addiction is shaping church dynamics in profound ways, impacting patterns of engagement, attention, communication, and connection within church communities. as churches navigate this evolving landscape, they are called to respond with creativity, compassion, and intentionality, seeking to foster environments that promote authentic worship, meaningful fellowship, and spiritual growth amidst the challenges of the digital age. by addressing technology addiction with wisdom and sensitivity, churches can remain relevant and effective in ministering to the needs of their congregants and extending the love and grace of christ to all.




posted on october 16, 2023october 16, 2023how the modern digital society is affecting the faithful 

from the early days of the internet and the social media craze, to the current age of high-tech gadgets and apps, the digital age has completely changed how we interact with one another. and the church isn’t immune to this vast shift in societal behavior. in fact, addictions to such modern digital tools as online gaming, smartphones, and social media have become rampant among church members and clergy.
addictions and the church have always been closely intertwined. religion and substance abuse have a long, tangled history. now, modern addictions such as internet gaming, social media, and smartphone usage have infiltrated the church and have begun to affect faithful believers’ spiritual life.

although the exact numbers vary, a survey of 1,500 pastors and church members conducted by the barna group showed that 71% of church members said that at least one individual in their church was struggling with an addiction of some kind. furthermore, the same survey showed that 18% of pastors said they had personally battled with an addiction.
these statistics seem to indicate that the church is affected by the modern digital society in a major way. with the advent of smartphones, it’s easy to access the internet right from our pocket and become addicted to things like online gaming. social media can be just as addictive, with its near-constant flow of gossip and trending topics.
the church can’t afford to take the issue of addiction lightly. it must face the challenges of modern addictions head-on, and develop thoughtful plans to help members find deliverance from harmful behavior. in addition, church leaders must ensure that members are provided with proper education so they can make wise choices.
for the church to have an impact in the lives of those who are addicted, it must offer more than just words of hope. it must provide tangible outreach and support. churches can create counseling programs, support groups, and even deny ministry positions to those with a history of addiction. in addition, an individual’s friends and family can provide moral support to help guide them on their journey of sobriety.
the modern digital society has had a tremendous impact on the church, and addictions are just one of its many negative influences. but if the church plays its role correctly, it can provide an avenue for change and help its members beat their addictions so that they can lead healthy and productive lives following god’s word.




posted on july 1, 2023july 1, 2023modern digital society and how the church is effected by addictions 

addiction has become an increasingly pervasive issue in today’s modern digital society. with the prevalence of social media, internet access and mobile phones, addiction is a growing problem in many communities, including the church. with the rise of technology, the church must now confront the reality of addiction and how it can affect its members and the wider society.
what are the implications for the church?
the rise of technology has had a profound effect on the church, in both positive and negative ways. for some, it has opened up the possibility of reaching out to people who may otherwise be reluctant to attend a physical church meeting. on the other hand, technology can also increase the risk of addiction, from gambling and pornography to internet gaming and social media.
the growing prevalence of addiction within the church has a number of implications that need to be considered. many churches struggle to confront the reality of addiction, often considering it an individual problem that can be dealt with outside of the church. as a result, members of the church may become isolated and feel unable to talk to anyone about the problem. this can lead to feelings of shame and guilt, both of which can act as a barrier to seeking help.
at the same time, the way in which people access technology can have an impact on how the church engages with them. for example, if a congregation uses social media as a method of connecting with members, yet many members are unable to access it due to addiction, this may damage the relationship between the church and its members.
what can the church do to support people?
the church must respond to the challenge of addiction in the modern digital society by providing support and resources for those affected. this support can come in a number of forms.
the first is to create a safe and supportive environment. this means opening up dialogue about addiction and providing a neutral ground where individuals can seek advice and support without feeling judged or embarrassed. churches can also provide resources and links to relevant websites, such as the national helpline for addiction.
another important step is to promote positive digital use within the church. this means promoting education and prevention around the dangers of addiction and helping members to find alternatives where possible. it could also involve creating church-based activities which are based around positive digital use, such as youth groups or online prayer meetings.
finally, churches can work to remove the stigma and taboo that is often associated with addiction. this could include openly discussing the issue in church meetings, leading discussions on social media, or speaking out against discriminatory language or assumptions about addicts.
conclusion
addiction is a major issue in the modern digital society, and the church must take responsibility in confronting it. churches should provide a safe and supportive environment, promote positive digital use, and work to remove the stigma associated with addiction. by doing so, they can help those affected by addiction to get the support they need, and create a more inclusive and safe church.




posted on may 30, 2023may 30, 2023the role of the church to help with addiction 

it is no secret that addiction is a major problem in today’s society. while there are numerous organizations dedicated to providing help and support for those battling their addiction, the church has an important role to play. the church has a special relationship with members of its congregation, and its role is to provide spiritual guidance to those struggling with addiction.
the first way in which the church can help with addiction is through prayer. the power of prayer is often underestimated, but it is one of the most powerful weapons in the battle against addiction. prayer can serve as a reminder of hope and faith, and it can also help to open up the lines of communication between family members and those struggling with addiction.
the second way in which the church can help with addiction is through its network of parishioners. the church is a community, and when it is organized and works together, it can be a powerful support system. church members can serve as mentors, friends, and confidants to those struggling with addiction. through their collective support, those dealing with addiction can find the strength and courage to overcome it.
the third way in which the church can help with addiction is through its resources. many churches offer counseling, support groups, and addiction recovery programs. these resources can serve as a lifeline to those in need. a church can offer a safe space for their members to discuss their struggles and establish strong support systems.
another way in which the church can help those struggling with addiction is by helping them to establish and maintain a spiritual practice. many people turn to spirituality in times of crisis, and churches can provide the tools and resources needed to keep a person connected with their faith while in recovery. through prayer, meditation, spiritual guidance, and community support, members of the church can provide a strong foundation for an individual’s recovery.
finally, the church can help those struggling with addiction by becoming a source of education. many churches are making efforts to provide educational programming and resources for their members on the understanding of addiction and how to prevent it. this kind of education can be invaluable to those in need of help.
addiction is a complicated and difficult disease, but one that can be conquered with the right help and support. the church can provide much of this help and support. through prayer, education, counseling, and support, the church can be an invaluable part of any recovery plan. as a community of faith holders, members of the church can help those struggling with addiction to find the hope and inspiration needed to overcome their problems.




posted on december 16, 2022december 9, 2022role of the church in helping addicts 

when it comes to helping addicts, churches have a pivotal role to play to ensure that their affected members get their lives back on track. it is the responsibility of the church to ensure the physical and spiritual growth of her members.
therefore, when problems like addiction surface, the church needs to provide all the help they can to tackle the issue headon till it fades off. here are some of the roles that the church plays in helping addicts.

spiritual support
the church needs to provide her addicted church members with spiritual support so that they can solidify their fellowship with god.
when someone is addicted, they are likely not to have a smooth fellowship because of their feelings of guilt. addiction draws the believer away from god, but the spiritual support from the church can help in restoration.
additionally, the church will encourage the believer to read their bible, pray regularly, spend time meditating, and do good acts that are pleasing to god.
physical treatment support
when someone is struggling with addiction and they need help, physical treatment support is essential. this starts from getting counseling which helps the individual figure out the root cause of their addiction.
counseling also helps to create a personalized treatment plan for the addict, because addiction treatment has a higher success rate when it is individualized.
it is also important for the church to be present for their addict all through the addiction treatment phase, and the aftercare stage.
encouragement and care
when addicts are receiving treatment, they need all the motivation and care to bounce back on their feet. some of them have strained relationships with their family and friends, which makes it hard to get the help they need.
with the encouragement that addicts get from the church, they will be able to follow through with addiction treatment till they achieve long-term sobriety.
