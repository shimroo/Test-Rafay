		about waes
	


waes (wasatch avian education society) is a 501(c)(3) foster-based nonprofit rescue whose mission is to rehome companion parrots and to educate the public about their complex mental, physical and emotional needs. as utah’s oldest parrot rescue, our ongoing rescue, foster, education and adoption programs help companion parrots who are abandoned, and as our resources allow, those whom their owners can no longer keep.
our rescue and adoption process is sustainable and effective. since 1994 we have rescued over 500 parrots throughout the state of utah.
