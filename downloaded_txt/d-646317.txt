enjoy an exciting, memorable experience at quashnet valley – cape cod golf 

the quashnet valley championship golf course is built on a beautiful natural site. ponds, streams, wetlands and the quashnet river come into play on fifteen of the eighteen holes. through the years qvcc has hosted the mga junior amateur, mga mid-amateur, and the mga public links, as well as the mass women’s open and the cape cod open.
the course and the abutting wetlands and woodlands are home to a great variety of native wildlife. while playing watch for red tail hawks, swans, rabbits, the occasional blue heron, and other “non-golfing” beings sharing the course.
