have you had it up to 
                            your eyeballs with being stuck, feeling trapped and 
                            lost?  
have you tried to 
                            improve your life, set your intentions, taken action 
                            steps, worked with the law of attraction the best 
                            you know how, and still your life feels like chaos?
                            
implodes without 
                            warning?  
sucks the energy 
                            right out of you?  
and certainly has not 
                            improved - or if it has, its only been for 
                            milliseconds before you're back in a pit of despair 
                            struggling to crawl back out?
i've been there.  
                            working so hard to make life better, when all of a 
                            sudden the heavens open up and what feels like a massive amount of 
                            poop gets dumped in the middle of everything!  
and i'm left standing 
                            there bewildered and dazed...  wondering... what - the - heck 
                            - just - happened?
after years of trial 
                            and error (don't you just hate that? just get 
                            it right for goodness sake!), i figured out what i 
                            was doing to recreate over and over again the mess i 
                            already had and i learned what to do to redirect and 
                            mold my 
                            creation energy into prosperity, joy and happiness!
you'll find all the 
                            tools i've used here on the soul kisses website.  
                            some of the tools are free while some have a 
                            monetary energy exchange.
but if you're looking 
                            for more...

                            a live community to support you, guide you and 
                            provide every tool you could ever need to improve 
                            and live the life you truly deserve, you'll want to take a look at the all 
                            extraordinary manifesting 
                            with florence support community!  
but before 
                            you do that... there was a time when i didn't choose 
                            something better because if i didn't choose, then i 
                            wouldn't be disappointed when what i wanted didn't 
                            work out. 
                            
a time when 
                            i felt like i didn't fit in with the people in my 
                            environment - especially my family.  as a young 
                            child i was convinced i was adopted because there 
                            was no way these people could be my family!
later i 
                            learned all those emotions i kept pushing down, deep 
                            into my subconscious, so i didn't have to deal with 
                            the pain of them had names.  they were: 
                            
* not good enough
* unworthy
* not lovable 
                            
* and the 
                            emotional energy that shadowed everything was:  i didn't feel like i deserved to be 
                            happy. 
then i learned these feelings are an 
                            illusion of fear.  now i know and i want you to know 
                            too, that  no matter what you have or have not 
                            done in your life, you - you - deserve to be happy! 
                            

you-are-lovable!
you-are-worthy 
                            and good-enough to live a life of prosperity, joy 
                            and happiness!
one of the best parts 
                            of my life is being a part of your world -- sharing 
                            tools and supporting you to take your power back and 
                            create the life that's yours by divine right.
--- the life that your heart longs for --- 
---the life that is joy, love, prosperity and blissful 
                            happiness - the life that's yours!
then when something 
                            awful dumps itself on your life - and it will because in this physical world of duality, you live 
                            in a human body and human bodies experience 
                            adversity - you'll know exactly what to do to 
                            manage it, move through it and create something 
                            better!
don't know who 
                            florence is?   
you. are. in. for. a. treat!  
                             
                            
this loving support community 
                            i'm hosting is based on the magnificent teachings 
                            of florence scovel shinn, author of the game of 
                            life and how to play it.
florence's teachings 
                            saved me when i was drowning in fear, yet never 
                            physically dying.  her spiritual energy supported me to take my 
                            power back and change my life from one where i was:
the "queen of recreating 
                            drama 
                            and unhappiness over and over"
===> to miraculously 
                            creating joy, happiness and prosperity - more than i could have ever 
                            dreamed of.

dear one,
										i invite you to explore the soul 
										kisses spiritual whispers website to 
										discover why your angels guided you 
										here.  
i want you to know, that i 
										understand the human need to struggle, 
										to be afraid - sometimes subconsciously - 
										longing to live your life with joy and 
										happiness ==> absent of drama.  there was a time that 
										when i laughed, it surprised me - 
										because i hadn't heard my own 
										laughter in so long, it sounded foreign 
										to me.  i get the self 
										sabotaging human need to struggle.
i'm human just like you - and even 
										though i know what to do to maintain a 
										joy filled life - when i'm 
										tired, i allow fear to sneak in, i 
										welcome worry back as my best friend 
										and i slip into the abyss of struggling, 
										feeling helpless, separated and alone - 
										again. 
										
then i recognize what i've allowed to 
										happen and i take a deep breath - and consciously choose to be a 
										different energy.  i break up with 
										worry, ask my angelic a-team for help 
										with their wisdom and guidance and 
										implement the tools i've learned - 
										all while resting safely in the palm of god.
before i learned how to work with my 
										angelic a-team i lived years of my life drowning in 
										fear, yet never physically dying.  
										with the tools my angels, guides and 
										earth teachers have given me, i don't 
										live there very often anymore - only 
										when i'm tired!
										 
										because i now know what to do to 
										ascend my energy to create the highest 
										possible outcome in all areas of my life 
										- and the process is simple!
is it time you live the life you 
										really want to live - the one that is 
										happy? --- your version of heaven on 
										earth?
i'm living my version of heaven on 
										earth as consistently as is humanly 
										possible.  will you join me?
click through the website, you may 
										resonate with me and my teachings or you 
										may find a recommended resource that 
										illuminates your path.  you're here 
										for a reason...  
discover it!  
										
claim it!  and powerfully transform 
										your life!
i welcome you to the community!  
										scroll to the top of this page and fill 
										out the form to claim your free 
										essential mastery tools and begin today 
										to step into your true. powerful. 
										authentic. self!
for now, i send you love... i 
										send you light... and i see you as 
										powerful, living your most magnificent 
										life!
in love and light,

st. jude 
					children's research hospital
					when i was four years old, my parents took me to st. jude 
					children's research hospital in memphis, tn to find out why 
					my face was wasting away.  i was diagnosed with parry romberg syndrome (also known as progressive hemifacial atrophy).    





					children with hair loss
					i know first hand what it feels like to 'look different' due 
					to facial disfigurement. children 
					with hair loss accepts donated hair in lengths of 8 inches 
					and up. my hair is very healthy and grows very fast. i've donated twice in the past four years 
					and am in process of growing it out again to donate in 2017.




                    ask your angels to send you a rainbow of hope and guidance.  
                    they will.
