this is not a protein bar.this is not a snack bar.this is the og superfood bar. 



it is powerfully efficient because it contains 1000mg of the og superfood: shilajitsome effects are felt immediately (enhanced energy & focus)& some within a few days (memory, recall, muscle recovery)& some are compounded over time (stamina, cognition, sexual health)



eat one bar a day for two weeks & see for yourselfeat one bar a day for life & never look back


























as mentioned in a recent huberman lab podcast by popular neuroscientist andrew huberman:



minute 01:08:59 hormone health: shilajit  "there are certain supplements, things like shilajit, for instance, something from ayurvedic medicine; which mainly has the active ingredient fulvic acid, which is known to, for instance, increase things like fsh (follicle stimulating hormone), which, in women is going to increase certain aspects of egg growth [hence the name follicle stimulating hormone]; its going to stimulate certain aspects of fertility - its pro-fertile - and in males can make for more sperm production or more motile sperm.  fsh is also going to indirectly increase testosterone in males; it's known to increase libido in both males & females. so things like shilajit, can indeed, augment multiple hormones and support multiple hormone systems, generally in the direction of pro-fertility, pro-libido and increasing estrogen & testosterone.”

what is shilala shilajit?


















































































shilala shilajit is a naturally occuring & purified resin created by the decomposition of organic matter of thousands of years.it is harvested from high elevation rocks (over 10,000 ft!) throughout the altai mountain ranges.shilajit has been referred to throughout history as the “destoyer of weakness” … why?because the key to its nutrional value is the abundant presence of fulvic acid - which allows all the 85+ minerals it contains to be highly bioavailable to the human body.shilala is a fulvic acid delivery method that is natural & sustainable




    order shilala
  




it is extremely important to verify that any shilajit you consume has been harvested mindfully & third-party tested for impurities, microbes & heavy metalswe source our shilajit directly from the harvester in the altai mountains of mongolia view our certificates of anaylsis

the state of our soil is dirt poor. the current quality of our soil sucks due to many years of over-farming & over-cultivation.low quality soil = soil with low mineral content.  if there are no minerals in the soil, then the plants & crops grown in it will not have any minerals to absorb.this means that even if you eat a colorful, organic, plant-heavy diet, you may not be getting the nutritional benefits of the food that you think you are.but do not despair, because — guess whatshilajit is basically pure ancient dirt --- preserved in the high elevations of the mountains for thousands & thousands of years.the composition of shilajit is humic & fulvic acids … and 85+ minerals! guess what else(first off, please forgive me in advance for the repetition of the word minerals – but they’re aren’t any synonyms) it’s the combination of insanely high levels of fulvic acid & minerals that makes shilajit such a nutritional powerhouse!fulvic acid increases the absorption of minerals because its molecules are small & lightweight – these qualities not only allow it to bond with the 85+ minerals, not only increase bioavailability but also support a slow release of these minerals!we’ve all heard varying statistics about how much of a multivitamin or daily supplements our body retains … basically, we pee most of it out.  normally, if your body does not have a use for a specific mineral at the time of ingestion, it will flush the mineral out of your body. fulvic acid holds on to the minerals & vitamins in your body just a little bit longer, giving your body a chance to absorb the nutrients when you need when you need them. so, yeah.  fulvic acid is pretty incredible. ergo:shilajit is kind of like a little lab assistant in your body --- running around & topping off the beakers of minerals that aren’t quite full.  everyone has different deficits & the 85+ minerals intentionally ushered into your body by the fulvic acid fills up a lot of those empty beakers.

main compounds & potential uses














fulvic acid



since fulvic acid molecules are smaller & less weight than humic acids, they are more bioavailable to the human body & the key to increasing the absorption of all the minerals into the body's cells



dibenzo-alpha-pyrones [dbp's]



metabolites created from the decomposition process; they help to govern & regulate metabolic processes such as breathing, circulation, digestion, cells growth & repair, hormone level management & body temperature regulation 



85+ minerals

        traceboron                     chromium               cobaltcopperiodineironmanganesemolybdenumphosphorusselenium      



minerals 101



minerals can be divided into two categories: essential & nonessential. essential minerals are nutrients which humans must acquire through food &/or supplementation; they are not able to be synthesized  [produced or made chemically] by the human body.  there are two categories of minerals deemed essential : macro & trace.  macro minerals are also referred to as electrolytes: the 6 macro minerals are: calcium,  magnesium, chloride, sodium, phosphorus & potassium.  they are required by the body in  larger amounts than the trace minerals.trace minerals are also necessary for normal functioning; just in smaller amounts.***specific functions of the essential minerals are detailed below ***nonessential minerals is kind of a misnomer.  they are still essential to healthy system functioning; however,  they are nutrients humans can synthesize on their own & do not need to absorb through food.  what do the minerals do?macrocalcium: most abundant mineral in body, plays many roles such as maintaining strong bones & teeth, assisting in the contraction & expansion of muscles & blood vessels; nervous system messaging; supports release of enzymes &  hormones needed for many bodily functions; it is best to obtain from a natural source [such as shilala!]chloride: supports electrolytes & fluids balancephosphorus: bone healthpotassium: essential for fluid balance, homeostasis, bone, heart and kidney healthmagnesium: involved in over 300 different enzymatic reactions in the body; energy production, cardiovascular health, muscle function [contraction/relaxation] production of blood cells, neurotransmitter function, bone & blood healthsodium: essential for nervous system functioning, muscle contraction, fluid balance, hydrationtraceboron: bone health; estrogen & testosterone balance; supports absorption of calcium & magnesium; wound healingchromium: reduces & regulates high blood sugar, helps breakdown carbs, sugars & fats; supports weight losscobalt: essential for red blood cell formation, supports the nervous system; assists with b-12 functioncopper: essential for red blood cell formation, serves as co-factor for several enzymes & nutrients (cofactors are usually metal ions and increase the rate of a reaction)iron: assists with transporting oxygen around the body, energy production, immune functioniodine: essential for thyroid health, metabolism, energymanganese: regulates blood sugar, bone formation, reproduction, immune health, mitochondria function, mental health, protects against oxidative damage & gut microbiome imbalancemolybdenum: assists with removing toxins and liver detoxificationselenium: essential for thyroid health, reproduction, metabolism & fighting infectionszinc: immune system, inflammation, skin health, liver health, gut repair, dna formation, cell growth, detoxifies copper overload
