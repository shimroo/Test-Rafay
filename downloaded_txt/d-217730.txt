'do
not be troubled or weighed down with grief.  do not fear any illness
or vexation, anxiety or pain. am i not here who am your mother?  
are you not under my shadow and protection?  am i not the fountain
of life?   are you not in the folds of my mantle?  in the
crossing of my arms?   is there anything else you need?' (words
spoken by the patroness of the americas -  to juan diego on december
12, 1531)

about
us - and what we do
museum
inspired: rare, one of a kind collectable rosaries, chaplets and religious
jewelry constructed to last many lifetimes.  rare beads: we use antique
beads, precious stones, faceted pearls, fossilized corals, natural materials
and handmade beads from american artists.  hand cast metal supplies: 
all metal components used in our pieces are available individually. 
each one is hand cast in solid bronze and sterling silver from antique
and vintage pieces.  (your only retail source on the internet for
these crucifixes, crosses, religous medals and centers.)  dedicated
to our lady of guadalupe  -  giving visual glory to god.

what
in the world *is*
going on?
the
middle east, terrorism, weather, natuarl disasters, war, abortion issues,
squabbling politicians, and now the stock market, something is going on.
and what are we doing about it? we either talk about it or bury it deeply
in our worry box. but do we pray? do we trust? do we pray the divine mercy
chaplet? the mysteries? the lord says:
"behold
i am with you till the end of the world'' (mt 28)
do
we trust him?




jerusalem
(madaba map - late 6c)

pray
for the peace of jerusalem. may those who love
you
prosper.  (psalms 122:6)

2 
god, do not be silent; god, be not still and unmoved!
3 
see how your enemies rage; your foes proudly raise their heads.
4 
they conspire against your people, plot against those you protect.
5 
they say, "come, let us wipe out their nation; let israel's name be mentioned
no more!"
6 
they scheme with one mind, in league against you ---
---
19  show them you alone are the lord, the most high over all the earth.
(psalms
83:2-6,19)
