machine learning for engineers: book list 2024

april 11, 2024
by bill de h√≥ra
in books



at the end of 2019, i posted a book list for engineers new to machine learning, to help develop basic knowledge of the fundamentals, organised into four groups: machine learning & algorithms, tools & frameworks, data science & analysis, and companion mathematics. this post provides an updated book list using the same groups, which have held up well. at the time the list covered 26 books, this iteration is more concise, covering 11 books. this time around 3 are new, and 3 have seen updated editions in the interim.read more

by bill de h√≥ra
in software, systems-engineering



leverage is an important concept for an engineering organisation. when we are debating whether to standardise and on what, which technology tools and stacks to use, whether to add new technology, replace an old system with a new one, which programming languages to use and how many, under the surface we are ultimately talking about or around, the topic of leverage of technology. read more
