                community around
                cordell bank. the rocky bank is encrusted with colorful anemones, sponges, and corals and provides
                habitat for species like top snails, decorator crabs, rosy rockfish, lingcod, and giant pacific octopus.
                the waters above and around the bank concentrate krill, juvenile rockfish, anchovy, and jellies
                attracting ocean sunfish, california sea lions, and the blue whale.
