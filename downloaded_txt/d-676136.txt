about us






“working in haiti is incredibly difficult for foreigners. our mission is successful because of rev dorcinvil’s ability to administer our work in a manner that glorifies god.”

— calvin babcock

  

calvin and gueillant make a great team. they credit the lord for putting them together in 2002, when both felt the lord's leading to start working in haiti.

 











calvin is the cfo for the organization, and has a strong background as a christian businessman, having earned an mba at harvard.













rev dorcinvil has a phd, and was recently elected mayor of his hometown of st michel.

 

together, calvin, gueillant and their wives make a great team to guide living hope haiti towards the future of helping more haitians in northern haiti.
