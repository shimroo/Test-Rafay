 choral, cabaret and musical theater all rolled into one
with more than 150 singing members backed by a small army of volunteers, the cgmc family covers a diverse cross-section of the chicago metropolitan area. under the visionary guidance and inspired direction of artistic director, jimmy morehead, cgmc delivers a distinctive brand of entertainment that keeps our audience coming back again and again. our members log thousands of hours annually to accomplish an ambitious schedule of performances, fund-raisers and charitable appearances.

 our mission
chicago gay men’s chorus is an inclusive, community-based performing arts organization that creates musical experiences to entertain and enlighten, inspire change, and build community. through colorful performances that blend traditional choral music with musical theater, jazz and pop, and a gay aesthetic, we seek to delight our audiences, enrich our members and explore issues relevant to lgbt people and their allies—enlivening chicago’s cultural landscape and creating a better community for all.
