base closure extended
due to the continued inclement weather, the tinker installation commander has directed to extend the base closure through 11 p.m. wednesday, feb. 19, for day shift and swing shift employees. if you are telework-eligible, your telework agreement will dictate your work status in-coordination with your supervisor. the installation commander will continue to reassess the situation to determine an appropriate time to reopen the base. base personnel should continue to monitor tinker afb social media accounts, website, or call the tinker straight talk line at 405-734-talk (8255) for base operating status. do not call base operations, the tinker command post, or security forces for weather updates. the tinker main gate and gott gate will remain open.
