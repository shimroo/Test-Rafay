the camp, the convo, and the chicken chop

the camp. ntums freshmen orientation camp (17th to 20th july) turned out to be great.despite me being kinda grumpy on preparation day at not being able to change the group name from red bull to something i felt to be more macho (eg: red dragon, red barracuda)...i thoroughly enjoyed myself.i think faiz and i made a good team, despite being first timers at facilitating.and i definitely love love love love my red bullies.am super proud of their performance nightand the fact that we won the water bomb challenge thingie (together with green hornets).*woohoo*what made foc even sweeter was mussy baby!yes.she came down all the way to hang out with us sweaty camp people.and i loved her for coming down~!!!she flew back to adelaide on monday. boo.cant wait for december when she gets returns again!i shall post up camp pictures once they're all in.the convomonday tuesday and wednesday were spent mugging for my paper on the 27th.aside from the mundane mugging, i got to sneak in for picture ops at the convo!habz is now officially an accountancy graduate.and she looks all happy and adult in the very labuh gown.congrats babe~!!!i wasn't supposed to be at shaliza's picture op...but yanto dragged me along...when we met that wednesday morning, "where are the flowers?" was the first thing i asked.the silly silly boy decided flowers werent necessary... and i wanted to whack him.like, hello! her whole family's gonna be there!so i made him go get her flowers (from the nearest florist)i had to carry the flowers from the florist to the car,from the car (once we reached school) to the library.i actually didn't mind carrying the flowershalf the time i was doing the miss universe wave with the flowers in my arms...but i also enjoy watching him squirm when he has to carry them for all to see.carrying flowers does not decrease the level of machoness.ok?and when it was time to go meet shaliza, wat did yanto do?hide the flowers within his jacket...why am i writing about all this?because i'm amused.and i guess it was just funny to watch him get nervous about meeting her family...but anyway, i was glad i made him do all that...and gave him support...coz shaliza was happywhich made him happyand i was like *awww*cute kan the both of them?the chicken chopafter our exam ended, yanto and i did a quick recce around school for his upcoming mock camp for kidsden headed down to clementi.and satisfied my chicken chop craving..look.sinfully oily, but still so sedap.and now i know how to get there on my own!to conclude everything,i've been good.happy.relieved.and now, satisfied!can't wait for next week.:)

cavana: my new experience

i've always liked the food at cavana.i think it's always worth the $.on saturday, i was pleasantly surprised when i discovered that the cavana at woodlands had a different concept from the usual cavanas i've been to.they served appetizers, desserts, fancy schmancy food and funky drinks.we ordered the black pepper chicken with spaghetti (for me), beef satay with rice, sausage cheese balls and ice cream + banana for dessert.fabulous food.altho i felt the tauge and mixed vege didnt really go with spaghetti or satay.but since i'm not cerewet, i lapped it all up.my fav was the sausage cheese balls.had fun with the cheesyness of it.and i ate the extra cheese with the tauge and mixed vege.melted cheese heaven!was somewhat disappointed they didnt have bandung chicken noodle on the menumy absolute fav from cavana at paya lebar.still, the woodlands' outlet rawks!for more info, check out the cavana website

sometimes you just wish you had the courage to click that post entry buttononce you've got an entry typed out.but the thing that holds you backis the fear of offending the people dearest to you.so you highlight the whole entry and delete it.most of the time your thoughts and your secrets involve the people you care about most.they're not of the bad, bitchy, petty nature.they're more of thoughts induced by your actions towards these people you care about.bad thoughts.thoughts that just make you feel you're lesser of a person.that you're not a proper human being.because you're just mean. and hurtful.and you're mean and hurtful because you have such horrible thoughts and secrets you keep.they're secrets you keep because you don't want them to know.isnt it better to not know and avoid the pain, rather to know then, endure the pain?so, who do you turn to in your delicate time of need?not your journal.confessing to people outside your immediate social circle is the best alternative.these are the people you contact time and again.the hellos you say mean so much more.the people you rarely ever meet, but are always able to make you feel comfortable..to confide in.to share a laugh.to pick up from where you left off.chatted to nas online earlier.confessed a few things i've been keeping for some time.and it was good.to get the load of my shoulders.to let him know what's been happening back here.and to learn his opinions and thoughts.he never makes me feel lesser as a person.even though i play villian in my confessions.a great friend, through and through.glad to know he's doin ok in the us.such a shame we didnt have a proper goodbye before he left.after maghrib, i shall be meeting kak siti, another dear friend.and i will meet her baby, nabil.and we will pick up from where we left off.

the keetee cat

everytime i go for tuition,othman's cat will always greet me.i will plop myself on the chair...princess will mew and scratch the edge of the seat i'm onwhich means i have to give her a good rub.and for a good 10 mins, i will be a slave to this manja british short hair..before i can begin my proper tuition session..sometimes princess just likes to place herself on the assessment booksor the assessment papers from other schools.she loves how plastic sounds and feels against her.which is why, i sometimes don't have the heart to pull (slowly, of course) the worksheets from right under her.she loves my socks.my toes.and she loves occupying my chair, then falls asleep on it.am i obsessed with this cat?yes i am!i want a cat tooooo!wanna see princess?if you've got the patience... :)click mus is back from aussie.hello mussy baby!yanto cut his hair (this is for the benefit of ain, who's during her europe tour...)i think he looks really good with his hair this way...i like.i've been enjoying the course i'm going for this special semester.gp04 - ways of thinking for creative solutions in problem solving.the lecturer's a comedian.he gets woozy whenever i sway my legs back and forth (a habit),is as frustrated about superman's red underwear as much as i amand he hasn't put me to sleep.it's a plus point that yanto's in the same course.and it's even more of a plus point i bump into fan & osh from time to time.amin, my colleague at fast, asked me to listen to toad the wet sprocket.a band he says is better than dishwalla.they burst into the scene way back in 1991, i think.i like this song by them, crazy life.( ear candy: 11-06collapse )oh. but i still think dishwalla's better.

whenever they walked past my tablethey would look at it gaping...once, someone tried to flip it closeand i snatched it away just in time "if you close it, it might not switch on again.the screen goes blank."it switches off whenever it feels like it too.so for more than 2 months,i've mostly left it gaping open.wide open.it looks like a sanitary... (you can complete it)osh said it.samantha said it.i can't deny it.aside from the blanking out,the buttons became unfriendlycalls get cut off as well.it's not that i didnt love it.i did.but when flipping caused problems,and dad refused to compromise...(he had certain principles...)i just continued using iti didnt do much to change the situationbecause i know dad will always have his way.then they would always bug me to get a new one on my own.i would explain it isnt that simple.because dad's principles weren't gonna changethat getting a new one would just cause an eruption,an eruption i would prefer to avoid at all costs...even if it means using it til it disintegrates...but today, things changed.i went from...to...because 16 of my colleagues came together and surprised me with that new phone!do i love my company or wat???i'm the happiest girl.i was so happy when they surprised me with it,i cried!as in, full-blown, blushed-so-hard-till-i-cried kinda cry.i'm over the moon high.grinning and grinning...happy happy joy joy happy happy joy joy!
