what is a passy muir speaking valve?
invented by a patient named david muir, the passy muir® tracheostomy & ventilator swallowing and speaking valve is a simple life-changing medical device used by tracheostomy and ventilator patients. when placed on the hub of the tracheostomy tube or in-line with the ventilator circuit, the passy muir® valve redirects air flow through the vocal folds, mouth and nose enabling voice and improved communication. years of evidence-based research has shown that the passy muir® valve offers patients numerous clinical benefits beyond communication, including:



voice/speech production
improved swallowing
secretion management
oxygenation
restores positive airway pressure
in-line ventilator use & interchangeability




weaning
decannulation
olfaction
infection control
pediatric speech/language development
quality of life

why use a speaking valve?

when properly assessed and placed by a healthcare professional, speaking valves allow tracheostomy patients to communicate.


why choose a passy muir speaking valve?

passy muir tracheostomy & ventilator swallowing and speaking valves (pmv®) offer patients numerous clinical benefits. in addition to voice and speech production, passy muir valves improve swallow, secretion management, and the sense of smell and taste. the valves may reduce aspiration and assist with infection control, ventilator weaning, and decannulation. many pmv users have reported that use of the passy muir valve has resulted in a significant positive impact on their quality of life. passy muir valves may be utilized on pediatric and adult patients and attach easily to a standard tracheostomy tube hub. all passy muir valves are proudly made in the usa.
