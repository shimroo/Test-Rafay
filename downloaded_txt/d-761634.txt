bend but not break





isaiah 42:2 when you pass through the waters, i will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.a blog friend posted a picture today, of rushing waters and lillies that normally stand strong, flattened in the rushing water. i immediately thought of the above verse. there have been many times when i felt like i was drowning:drowning in feardrowning in nightmaresdrowning in paindrowning in confusiondrowning in povertydrowning in fatigue the fires burned oh so hot as the questions for the future encroached on my every waking, and sometimes sleeping momentsmy futuremy son's futuremy husband's future there were days when i literally could not lift the fork of food to my mouthcould not chew the scrambled eggscould not hold my sons 4 oz bottle (of formula, because i was not strong enough to hold him to breast feed him) could not dress myselfcould not get my son into the program he so desperately neededcould not see how things could changethe realities of life seemed to be too big as the roof didn't just leak, it pouredthe doctors gave me one morediagnosismedicationprognosisthe teachers gave me one more note sayinghe's failinghe's strugglinghe's loosingthe bills piled higher the budget got cut no way out, no way in .. not way around it ... and yet .. the roof did not get fixed .. we got a house through habitatthe education did not get givenmy son is a good guy, lots of character inpersonality and ethicsthe body did not heal but it did improvemy husbands did not diethe sun came out and a future was revealed and when it comes right down to it .. i know that every last minute of every fear, depression, discouragement .. i knew that god was with me, holding me, knowing that the sun was coming out and i'd stand again .. i was bent, and i was covered in water ..but i did not break. my roots learned that there are hard times and they planted just a bit deeper so the next time .. i'd have a better chance of standing strong. it's funny how hindsight gives us that, but i can see each trial, each struggle, each chaotic situation left me slightly better able to handle the next ... this is lupus awareness month ..and i thought about writing about how lupus has effected me and inside i was fighting that .. i did not want to write about how it has effected me and seeing that picture .. i realizedi wanted to write about how lupus did not break me.

perspective





a few nights ago, i was unable to sleep. that, in and of itself is not uncommon at all. i was trying to figure out in my mind what my next steps in school should be. i started to think of all the classes i've had to repeat ... those from when i went to school when i was too sick to be there and now i needed to repair my gpa speechdevelopmental psychhumanities 2computer concepts those that i had to repeat because of my math issues beginning algebraintermediate algebraintermediate algebra and those that i had to repeat because nsu told me to take classes at tcc and then did not allow the credits to transfer ..but they were still required. child psychpersonality theories and all the extra time that it took and realizedif not for all the repeating ..i'd be graduating in a month. wow, i've got 3 semesters to go but i theoretically *could* be graduating this semester if not for the time taken up taking these classes (let's not even start to talk about the money!) benjamin walked into my room and saw my face and asked what was wrong and i told him.he quietly said"yeah, and if my iep had been followed and if i hadn't repeated any classes, i'd be graduating in a month too"ouch he's not said anything about not being in school, not being able to finish, but obviously it is bothering him. and really ..what is 3 semesters? it's time, it's money and i'll be a year and a half older than planned when i finally get through, but the truth is, in a year and a half i'll still be 48 no matter if i'm working on my masters or finishing my bachelors ..and those 3 semesters won't prevent me from getting my masters and they very well may have me better prepared for my masters. but my son? his lost opportunities? those will be much harder to bounce back from. that is the true frustration.

self hatred and refomatting the brain





you're ugly.you're stupid.you're not liked.you're immature.you're a crybaby.you're lazy.you're in the way.you're worthless.you're boring.you're a failure.  these are things that come to mind when i look in the mirror or think about myself. they have permeated my life and the way i interact with the world. they make me keep people at arms distance ... the fear that if they knew who i really was (which is the list above) then they would not only not like me, but be disgusted by me. in the last several years i've been on a journey to change the way i live on this planet. somewhere on this journey i became aware of the fact that my filter that i see myself through is skewed. while i'd never pretend that everyone loves me (i can list several who barely tolerate me off the top of my head and a few who outright dislike me) by and large, i have a lot of friends. i have people who tell me they respect me and love me. i realized at some point that maybe rather than waiting for the other shoe to drop i needed to take a look through the filters that others see me. i worked at that for a long time with some success, but limited. recently, i've taken to reformatting my brain ...through prayer, meditation, mindfulness, yoga and education. this has caused me to exam my thoughts and compare them to the facts. some of these thoughts, i can't quite get around ... but some ...some i can truly defend to my innerself as being invalid. you're stupid: you were in california's mgm program (mentally gifted minors ..is that not the most pretentious name for a program ever?) you graduated with a high gpa. you interact with relative ease with those who society sees as intellectuals. you have gone back to school and maintained a 4.0 in credited classes. you're not liked: you have too many friends for this to be true. you're a crybaby:  you can't even name the last time you truly cried. you're lazy.you have worked with church ministries, you have raised 2 challenging children, been married for 23 years while combatting chronic illness, pain, a frustrating educational system. you are going to school full time and doing quite well. you're worthless. you have friends who value you, who respect you. you have children who respect you and value your presence in their lives. you're a failure. your gpa is a 4.0 upon returning to school. you returned with a 2.1 gpa and have, through your 4.0 brought the cumulative gpa to 5.431. you are a member of phi theta kappa, an officer in the regional alumni association. you are on track for being a member of psi chi. you have done all this inspite of mg, inspite of lupus, inspite of having family responsibilities. in looking at those, it becomes glaringly clear ... self hatred has no true role in my life except to hold me downkeep me backprevent me from living a fullfulfillingenjoyableanddelighted life. re forming the way i think and looking at truths rather than thoughts is going to be necessary to combat the self hatred i've lived with for so long.

if only in my dreams





i was asked today if i was able to have my dream job as a psychologist,what would it look like. in 1972 two mothers, armed only with a dream and a passion and a raised $3000 opened school for their special needs children. the little light house was born out of a desperate need to fill a void that was dark and deep. we had the privilege of being associated with the program while benjamin was in kindergarten. that year remains in my heart as an oasis in a very dry, arid and frightenly vicious desert. benjamin had a loving teacher, physical therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. for 1 very blessed school year, we got to take our son to school and did not have to cart him back and forth to 3 differnt types of therapy ... pt once a week, speech twice a week and ot three times a week .. from the age of 9 months till 11 years old ... except the year he spent at the little light house. we got a desperately needed break.not only that, but we, as parents were loved and encouraged. if i were to dare to dream ... this is what my dream job as a psychologist would look like. the desire, the dream, the drive coming from much the same place as the founders of the little light house. if i had my dream job:i would have a place that housed physical therapistsoccupational therapistsspeech therapistspediatric developmental specialistpediatric neuropediatric psychiatristpediatric gastroenterologistpediatric orthopedistpediatric pulmonologistpediatric endocrinologistpediatric rheumatologistdevelopmental psychologistschild psychologistschild life specialisti would like there to be a small 'drop off'style day care where parents could drop the siblings of their child that is there to be seen, so they didn't have to bring them along to the appointment as an added distraction, hire a baby sitter or enlist family to help. they would come in as a family, be serviced as a family and supported as a family. a place where if an evaluation was done and it was decided that the child needed a certain specialist, they would be there, in that building, an appointment could be made. you might be saying right now "that sounds like many children's hospitals all over america ... yes, probably so, but with one major difference: the family dynamic would be the focus. the child's developmental needs taken into consideration, referrals would be primarily in house, saving on time, paperwork, lost communication and stress. therapies could be coordinated, treatments would be coordinated and the parents would be fully supported. the child would get the developmental, physical and behavioral support needed. the focus would be on 'no ceiling' for the child, reach for the stars ... the parents would be given the kindness, and support that is so often missing in the desert that is special needs. they would be given the tools they needed to feel like a competent parent. they'd be given time to enjoy their child .. to truly enjoy and laugh with their child. if there was a school battle,we'd be able to help them. they'd be given the chance to form a stronger family unit. they'd be shown and told what they are doing right instead of the constant "you need to do this" a fully integrated clinic, prepared to fully deal with the dynamic that the child's special needs bring. i am not a ground breaker, the chances are i will wind up at our already established children's hospital, i will work within an already functioning system ..but ... if i had my dream job ... it would be one that helped the child reach for the stars and we'd celebrate with the whole family when the child does lasso their star!
