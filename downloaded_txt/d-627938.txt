remodeling
 a panel saw is a remarkably versatile tool. you can find them in large diy stores or lumber yards where they’re used to cut wood to customer specifications. however, most of these saws are quite large and don’t fit real well in a standard sized garage. what most people don’t realize is you can have the same type of setup at home for a fraction of the price.








home projects
are you thinking about building a playhouse for the kids to create some wonderful outdoor memories? perhaps your garage is overflowing and the cars are now parked in the driveway because you are out of space! consider the the panel pro vertical panel saw for your project!
