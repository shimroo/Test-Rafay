slippery surfaces and light ice build-up from freezing rain or freezing drizzle.

when:
beginning this morning and ending sunday evening. the heaviest snow is expected sunday.

additional information:
a potent low pressure system will bring another impactful winter storm to the area. periods of snow, at times mixed with freezing drizzle, will begin this morning bringing general snowfall amounts up to 10 cm by late this evening. snow may become lighter tonight with a risk of freezing drizzle.

conditions will rapidly deteriorate sunday morning as a more significant area of snow and blowing snow arrives. an additional 10 to 20 cm is likely. freezing rain or ice pellets may mix in with snow at times on sunday, especially for areas near lake erie, which will impact total snowfall accumulations. travel will be hazardous and is not recommended, particularly on sunday.
