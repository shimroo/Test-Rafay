who is virtual creations?



								 
							


we're a website company based in mullumbimby, nsw, australia (near byron bay). basically, we build websites, and we host them. and we're amazing at what we do (if we're allowed to brag). our websites look gorgeous and are tailored to your specific needs. they're not expensive, and you can update them yourself - no technical expertise required! if you want, our experienced programming crew can even create you a powerful "web application" (software in a website), to manage your business, staff, products, customers, etc.
our website hosting is awesome: our servers are situated in major datacentres around the world; they're fast, reliable and never overloaded, and come with a control panel if you ever feel inclined to manage your hosting account yourself. if not, we can do all of that technical stuff for you.
but the main reason our hundreds of customers love us is our superb customer service and support. you can call us or email us any time, day or night, with any sort of question. there are no phone queues, no faceless corporate behemoths to deal with, no call centre operators in bangladesh. just us - highly experienced and knowledgeable about websites and hosting, yet friendly and willing to help. professional and personal - that's us!
