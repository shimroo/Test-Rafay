our storya delightful mix of rustic and natural elegance, kiana lodge is a perfect place to hold a meaningful event. the smell of fragrant gardens and the sea salt air. the warmth of the sun on your face as you watch eagles fly high above. the rushing sound of the waves hitting the shore, as you sit on the deck sipping a refreshing cocktail. soft leather couches, floor to ceiling fireplaces, the soft crackles of the fire as you sit and sip the perfect glass of cabernet. that hint of fresh rosemary in our signature salmon. you can experience all this and more; only a short ferry ride away from seattle.
