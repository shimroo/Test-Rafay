syrupproduction



our sugarbush is located in the foothills of camel’s hump, one of the highest mountains in vermont.we have approximately 10,400 taps, mainly on a pipeline system that enables the sap to flow directly to the sugarhouse or into collection tanks around the smaller hills and mountains.our sugarhouse is equipped with a 5’x16’ wood-fired, forced draft evaporator. we have a "piggyback" pan that utilizes the steam from the evaporator to improve our efficiency and make a top-notch final product.all our syrup is pumped through a filter press to ensure purity. the syrup is either packaged for retail sale or put into bulk barrels for later use. some syrup makes other fine products like maple cream and maple sugar.
