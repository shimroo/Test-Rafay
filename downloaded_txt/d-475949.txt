lt. gov. knoll
press release:
     
harrisburg, november 13, 2008  
state senator vince fumo (d-philadelphia) issued the following statement today 
regarding the death last night of lt. governor catherine baker knoll:
     "i was saddened to learn of the passing of lt. governor 
knoll. catherine and i were close for a long time; i have been friends with her 
and her family for many years. it is a huge loss for me personally and for the 
commonwealth. she was a warm and caring person, and that was reflected in her 
tireless efforts for the people of pennsylvania. she was a true champion of the 
poor, of working men and women, and of seniors in our state. my prayers go out 
for her and her loved ones. i will miss her."

consumers get energy help, but 
work remains
press release:
     harrisburg, october 8, 2008 
 the state senate passed an amended piece of energy legislation (hb 2200) today 
that helps electric utility customers in several crucial ways, but does not yet 
provide relief from potential huge monthly bill increases that will hit them 
when rate caps expire in the next few years, senator vince fumo (d-philadelphia) 
said.
     fumo, who was the main force behind the imposition of 
rate caps after pennsylvania deregulated electric generation in the late 1990s, 
said he is confident that the general assembly will address the looming rate 
hikes during the 2009-10 legislative session that begins in january. fumo is not 
running for re-election, and therefore will not be a member of the senate in the 
next session.
     i and many other members of the legislature would have 
preferred to extend rate caps in this legislation, fumo said. unfortunately, 
we were unable to gain enough support for that at this time. that is a fight 
that will have to wait for another day. but if we dont act now, the problem 
will get worse. 
     fumo and several other senate democrats were heavily 
involved over the last few months with senate republican leadership, officials 
of the rendell administration, and electric utilities in trying to reach a 
comprehensive energy compromise that would include limits on consumer price 
increases that could be as large as 60 percent when caps come off for most 
electric company customers in 2010. while they reached agreement in several key 
areas, a deal on rates eluded them.

we must protect 
		against huge electric bill hikes 

floor speech, september 18, 2008.
    
		mister president, 
    
		as all of you know, i did not expect to be in harrisburg this week, but 
		since i am able to be here i want to speak for a few moments about an 
		issue that will soon have an impact on every person in pennsylvania. 
    
		politicians make a lot of speeches. i certainly have made my share on 
		this floor, but every now and then we have a chance not just to talk, 
		but to act in a direct fashion to help people. 
    
		we have that opportunity before us right now. 
    
		the united states financial markets are in turmoil. our economy seems to 
		be sinking. by one estimate that i heard last night, $1.2 trillion 
		dollars of wealth in this country has been wiped out over the past three 
		days. undoubtedly, that includes some of the hard-earned savings, or 
		investments, or retirement nest eggs of many pennsylvanians. 
    
		as we sit here in the pennsylvania senate, we dont have the power to do 
		very much about the meltdown on wall street, and we cant correct the 
		lax regulation in washington that got us into this mess. we cant do 
		much about the crisis in the national credit markets, or undo the 
		subprime mortgage lending mistakes. 
    
		but we can take action on a simple matter that affects the checkbook of 
		every family in our commonwealth, as well as every business -- large or 
		small -- that pays an electric bill. 
    
		we can do something to prevent our citizens from being hit with enormous 
		and unfair electric rate increases. <more>
 




new food distribution 
center coming to phila.
press release:
     philadelphia, september 4, 
2008  with state assistance, a private developer will build a new food 
distribution center in south philadelphia, containing retail and wholesale 
operations that sell fresh produce throughout the mid-atlantic region, state 
senator vince fumo announced today.
     the $218.5 million dollar project will include a 
667,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art facility occupying a 48.6 acre parcel of 
land at 6700 essington avenue, with another 15 acre parcel nearby that will be 
used as a parking/staging area. it will retain 1,468 current jobs, and create an 
estimated 375 more.
     essington avenue partners ii will develop the new 
philadelphia regional produce market. the state will provide a $100 million 
grant, with additional state and federal loan financing, through the 
philadelphia regional port authority. the prpa will be the landlord under a 
40-year lease. 
     this has been a long time coming, with numerous 
obstacles and detours over the past seven years. but many people were determined 
not to give up, and now we are going to have the kind of modern, world-class 
facility that we need to serve our population in the 21st century, said fumo, a 
democrat who represents the first senatorial district, home of the current food 
distribution center facility on galloway street in south philadelphia.

phil. lawmakers pledge 
action  on riparian rights
press release:
            philadelphia, 
august 25, 2008  a coalition of state senate and 
house members who represent districts along the delaware river in 
philadelphia
sharply criticized last weeks supreme court decision giving away riparian 
rights, and said today that they would urge the legislature to restore state 
control over state land.
            they also promised to seek federal court review.
            representatives william keller and mike obrien, along with senators 
vince fumo and mike stack (all d-philadelphia) called fridays high court ruling 
dramatic and unprecedented. not only did it convey public land to a casino 
without any payment to the state taxpayers who own it, but it also declared the 
conveyance irrevocable.
            with all due respect to the court, they simply got this one wrong, 
said keller.  he pointed out that it has been long-established legal practice 
for the state general assembly to decide whether or not to approve the lease of 
submerged waterfront land, which the state owns, to private entities. the state 
is also entitled to compensation.
