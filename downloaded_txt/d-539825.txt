featured story
to the formers far distant from the slain goliath of our history, now we battle with scars, old injuries that never healed quite right and achy joints brought on by the passing of time. but time, it doesn’t bring us to peaceful fields to rest does it? where are the still waters, the green pasture? indeed it can seem time instead brings us to yet again, another battle with anotherby shari tvrdik
