who we are

                welcome to the home page of the seattle chapter of the international plastic modelers society (ipms)! 
                we are a group of over 100 modelers (in plastic and other media) that meets monthly in the 
                greater seattle area. we are a supportive group that has a tremendous number of highly-skilled 
                modelers, any number of whom are more than willing to help you reach your next level of 
                model-building mastery.
