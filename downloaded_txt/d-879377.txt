  kentland bank

kentland bank has come a long way from its beginnings during the great depression. substantial local funds were lost in the demise of newton county state bank in 1931 and left kentland without a bank. undaunted, glen c. tolin and edgar teague pooled their resources, put their faith in the abiding prosperity of kentland, and opened kentland bank for business in the fall of 1932.  
their legacy of commitment to the community they served continued through to their successors who steered our growth from one bank in kentland to where we are today, three branches in newton county, one branch in jasper county and one in tippecanoe county. we are thrilled to be a part of those communities and love giving back to them when we can, whether it’s by financing loans to help jump start a new business, giving donations to local charities and fundraisers, or by having our employees volunteer to help out at events.at kentland bank, we’re dedicated to providing you with the very best products and services that will help you with your everyday financial needs. with a focus on great customer service, we want you to leave the bank happier than when you came in.

    history




    
      

  alexander j. kent settles in kentland, in
in the early 1800s, indiana was a wild, rich land of fertile fields and abundant forests. the land provided a good living for the hard-working pioneer families who settled here. one of these early settlers was businessman alexander j. kent, first citizen of the town of kentland.kentland was a crossroad of only two buildings when it was named newton county seat in 1859. over the years, both the population and the number of buildings grew steadily. through the early part of this century, residents built schools and churches while developing business and commerce.but hard times came even to agriculturally rich indiana in the great depression of the 1920s. residents felt the same economic hardship that beset the rest of the country. many people were unemployed, banks closed and worse still, farm prices fell to painful lows. substantial local funds had been lost in the demise of the newton county state bank in 1931.
