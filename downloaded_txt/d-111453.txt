"when i found the international nanny association (ina) through a google search, it was a god send. i felt like i was home, i found my tribe. it was so overwhelming because i felt like i had been in isolation for over 17 years as a nanny. without a doubt, being a member of the ina has been one of the best choices i’ve made for the advancement of my career." 







angela johnson sutherland








"i love being a member of the ina because it has provided me with a great sense of comradery and a wealth of educational opportunities when running my own nanny agency. the ina is a fantastic organization that gives nanny industry professionals the opportunity to grow and learn from each other in a supportive and encouraging environment."

as an agency owner with locations in several major markets, ina membership consistently provides access to qualified candidates nationwide, along with new client leads who are seeking a reputable agency. with access to professional resources, annual conferences, and networking groups, i consider the ina an invaluable partner.
