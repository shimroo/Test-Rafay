             we welcome you to divine maltese

              proud breeders of champion 
              maltese puppies &
             maltese show dogs



            divine maltese are small hobby
            responsible

	        maltese breeders that exclusively breed 
            
            maltese dogs.   
            we began in 1992 with the goal of breeding 
            healthy, happy, sound 
            maltese puppies 
            for maltese show dogs and 
            maltese pet puppies according to the 
	        
            akc breed standard for maltese.
            if you have ever been "owned" by one of these "little charmers" 
            you know exactly why we feel this way.  our 
            maltese puppies 
            are home-raised and receive extra special 
            attention from our three grown sons, 3 grandsons, daughter in laws 
            as well as nieces, nephews and friends. 
            socialization is very important for the development of wonderful, outgoing, 
            personalities that distinguish maltese dogs from all other breeds.
	       

            we built divine maltese on a solid foundation of 
            maltese breeding lines that 
            are well known for producing successive generations of healthy, elegant, beautiful, and 
            adorable canine companions.  we are so fortunate to have gotten our 
            foundation dogs from our dear friends at 
 	        marcris maltese,
            rhapsody maltese and
            pashes maltese. we 
            have also been fortunate enough to work closely with
            maltangel's maltese,
            veranda maltese ,  tiffanee maltese, avante maltese  and grace 
            maltese and 
            consider all of them not just friends, but family.

            divine maltese show dogs
            have captured "top honors" 
            including multiple best-in-shows, best in national 
            specialty and national sweepstakes, top producing sires and dams, 
            and pedigree 
            award winners in 2000, 2001, and 2002 for the #1 
            akc maltese 
            conformation shown in the usa. our divine maltese have been 
            equally successful in south america, europe, and asia. divine

            winners going on to place and even win the toy group at this 
            prestigious show.
           

 	        our divine 
	        maltese champions are widely recognized for 
            consistently gorgeous heads, outstanding movement and outlines, 
            wonderful silky coats, and absolutely adorable personalities. we 
            have been blessed to be able to place some of our divine show dogs 
            with the best maltese breeders in the us and consider all of them 
            part of our extended family.
