 turnaround management association southern africa
over the past 10 years, the south african economy has faced significant challenges when it comes to growth. while the rest of the world, including many african states, has achieved growth rates in excess of 3% per annum, south africa is struggling to kick start our economy with growth failing to reach even the 1,0% mark.
this has put significant pressure on companies. many companies have been put into business rescue in an effort to keep the doors open and keep staff gainfully employed. this has raised the profile of turnaround practitioners who become vital lifelines for companies struggling to survive in a tough and changing economic environment.
this impacted both private companies and state-owned companies like south african airways and sa express which have been put into business rescue to give them a much-needed lifeline. 
the turnaround management association of southern africa (tma-sa) is an organisation that represents and promotes the interests of the business turnaround industry while engaging with relevant stakeholders to the benefit of the south african economy.
over the years, the tma-sa has worked hard to become the leading industry association when it comes to business turnaround by supporting its members and providing them with key skills such as knowledge, key expertise and experiences from key business rescues that would benefit members in future rescues.
