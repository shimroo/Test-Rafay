what is fots?
 
founded in 1992, the fellowship of the spirit conference is held annually in the colorado mountains, where hundreds of aas and alanons gather to attend 12 step workshops, and hear speakers from far and wide.  this ‘big book’ focused four day conference is family friendly and open to anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of recovery as described in the book alcoholics anonymous.
the weekend starts on thursday afternoon, with separate workshops (panel presentations) on each of the 12 steps in order, and continues through sunday morning.  mixed in with these discussions are speakers, regular aa/alanon meetings, meditations, banquet and a potluck picnic, ice cream social, and the best fellowship on god’s green earth.

fellowship of the spirit

 


the fellowship of the spirit conference has its roots in a small community of recovered alcoholics and al-anons who live along the front range of the rocky mountains.

 


in 1992, through informal discussions and gatherings, a community took shape around a vision of carrying the basic message of alcoholics anonymous to families and individuals affected by the disease of alcoholism.

 


so began a long journey of becoming more connected with god and with each other. every year the conference grows larger as more families get involved. we have seen both newcomers and old timers transformed by making personal commitments to the conference and to carrying the basic message.

 


best of all, every year brings a new team of volunteers together, whose “blood, sweat and tears” make the conference possible. every year, new personalities and new vision fill the community as we join together with a great sense of alignment and purpose.
