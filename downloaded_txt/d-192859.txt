us az: forget arizona's cactuses, it's now about the weed
new york times, 01 apr 2021 - phoenix - when arizonans voted to legalize recreational cannabis in november, it seemed plausible that sales would begin sometime in the spring. but on jan. 22, less than three months after the vote, the arizona department of health services started quickly approving applications, allowing dispensaries to sell cannabis to adults 21 and older immediately.



us ny: new york legalizes recreational marijuana, tying move to
new york times, 01 apr 2021 - after years of stalled attempts, new york state has legalized the use of recreational marijuana, enacting a robust program that will reinvest millions of dollars of tax revenues from cannabis in minority communities ravaged by the decades-long war on drugs. gov. andrew m. cuomo signed the cannabis legislation on wednesday, a day after the state legislature passed the bill following hours of debate among lawmakers in albany.



us ny: with marijuana deal, new york could create $4 billion industry
new york times, 26 mar 2021 - state lawmakers finalized a deal on thursday to legalize recreational marijuana in new york, paving the way for a potential $4.2 billion industry that could create tens of thousands of jobs and become one of the largest markets in the country. following several failed attempts, lawmakers in albany struck an agreement with gov. andrew m. cuomo to legalize cannabis for adults 21 and older, a move that officials hope will help end years of racially disproportionate policing that saw black and hispanic people arrested on low-level marijuana charges far more frequently than white people.



us: senior happy hour goes up in smoke
new york times, 23 mar 2021 - for years, harry b. lebowitz spent the cocktail hour at his home in delray beach, fla., sitting in his backyard overlooking a lake and smoking a joint while his partner relaxed with her vodka and club soda. mr. lebowitz, 69, a mostly retired businessman, qualified for a state medical marijuana card because he suffered from anxiety, sleep apnea and back pain. he credits cannabis with helping to wean him off several prescription drugs.



us: few regulations for this medicine
new york times, 09 mar 2021 - dan shapiro was the first person i knew to use medical marijuana. as a junior at vassar college in 1987, he was being treated for hodgkin's lymphoma with potent chemotherapy that caused severe nausea and vomiting. when dan's mother learned that smoking marijuana could relieve the distressing side effect, to help her son, this otherwise law-abiding woman planted a garden full of the illegal weed in her connecticut back yard. decades later, marijuana as medicine has become a national phenomenon, widely accepted by the public. although the chemical-rich plant botanically known as cannabis sativa remains a federally controlled substance, its therapeutic use is now legal in 36 states and the district of columbia.



us: not quite pot, this high slips past most bans
new york times, 01 mar 2021 - texas has one of the most restrictive medical marijuana laws in the country, with sales allowed only by prescription for a handful of conditions. that hasn't stopped lukas gilkey, chief executive of hometown hero cbd, based in austin, texas. his company sells joints, blunts, gummy bears, vaping devices and tinctures that offer a recreational high. in fact, business is booming online as well, where he sells to many people in other states with strict marijuana laws.



us: state cannabis approvals expected to spark boom
wall street journal, 17 feb 2021 - voters in four states last year approved the recreational use of marijuana. that is likely to launch a land rush there for warehouses and retail properties. similar measures in other states have sparked heated competition for these types of real estate. owners have been able to charge as much as three times market rates when selling or renting to businesses involved in the cultivation, distribution, processing or sale of cannabis, according to brokers, landlords and cannabis industry executives.



mexico: oped: end the war on drugs now
new york times, 20 nov 2020 - mexico city - on june 17, 1971, president richard nixon stood in front of the white house press corps and made his historic declaration of a new type of war. "public enemy no. 1 in the united states is drug abuse," he said. "in order to fight and defeat this enemy, it's necessary to wage a new all-out offensive." it would be a government-wide effort, and rally the united states's power abroad to stem the supply of drugs. among the countries targeted was mexico, which was home to abundant marijuana production and had been resistant to aerial crop spraying.



us: state ballots show a shifting debate on legalizing drugs
new york times, 27 oct 2020 - oregon has an addiction problem. pockets of rural poverty, chronic homelessness and cities with lots of young people have given the state one of the highest rates of substance abuse in the nation. it is also, because there is so little money allocated to it, one of the toughest places to get treatment. a proposed solution on the ballot next week would be one of the most radical drug-law overhauls in the nation's history, eliminating criminal penalties entirely for personal use amounts of drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine. tax revenues from drug sales would be channeled toward drug treatment.

since 1996, ten states have legalized medical
marijuana use: ak, az, ca, co, hi, me, nv, or, vt and wa. eight of
the ten did so through the initiative process, hawaii's law was enacted by
the legislature and signed by the governor in 2000, and vermont's
was enacted by the legislature and passed into law without the
governor's signature in may 2004.

the institute of medicine's 1999 report on medical
marijuana stated, "the accumulated data indicate a potential
therapeutic value for cannabinoid drugs, particularly for symptoms
such as pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite
stimulation."

the science base,"

the institute of medicine's 1999 report on
medical marijuana examined the question whether the medical
use of marijuana would lead to an increase of marijuana use
in the general population and concluded that, "at this
point there are no convincing data to support this concern.
the existing data are consistent with the idea that this would
not be a problem if the medical use of marijuana were as closely
regulated as other medications with abuse potential." the report
also noted that, "this question is beyond the issues normally
considered for medical uses of drugs, and should not be a factor
in evaluating the therapeutic potential of marijuana or
cannabinoids."

in the institute of medicine's report on medical
marijuana, the researchers examined the physiological risks of using
marijuana and cautioned, "marijuana is not a completely
benign substance. it is a powerful drug with a variety of effects.
however, except for the harms associated with smoking, the adverse
effects of marijuana use are within the range of effects tolerated
for other medications."

the institute of medicine's 1999 report on medical
marijuana examined the question of whether marijuana could
diminish patients' immune system - an important question when
considering marijuana use by aids and cancer patients. the report
concluded that, "the short-term immunosuppressive effects
are not well established but, if they exist, are not likely great
enough to preclude a legitimate medical use."

"conclusions: smoked and oral cannabinoids did not seem to be
unsafe in people with hiv infection with respect to hiv rna
levels, cd4+ and cd8+ cell counts, or protease inhibitor levels
over a 21-day treatment."

of cannabinoids in patients with hiv-1 infection - a randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial," annals of internal medicine,
aug. 19, 2003, vol. 139, no. 4 (american college of physicians),
p. 258.


"this study provides evidence that short-term use of
cannabinoids, either oral or smoked, does not substantially
elevate viral load in individuals with hiv infection who
are receiving stable antiretroviral regimens containing nelfinavir
or indinavir. upper confidence bounds for all estimated
effects of cannabinoids on hiv rna level from all
analyses were no greater than an increase of 0.23 log10
copies/ml compared with placebo. because this study was
randomized and analyses were controlled for all known
potential confounders, it is very unlikely that chance imbalance
on any known or unknown covariate masked a
harmful effect of cannabinoids. study participants in all
groups may have been expected to benefit from the equivalent
of directly observed antiretroviral therapy, as well as
decreased stress and, for some, improved nutrition over the
25-day inpatient stay."

"nevertheless, when considering all 15 studies (i.e., those
that met both strict and more relaxed criteria) we only noted that regular cannabis users performed worse on memory tests, but that the magnitude of the effect was very small. the small magnitude of
effect sizes from observations of chronic users of cannabis
suggests that cannabis compounds, if found to have therapeutic
value, should have a good margin of safety from a neurocognitive
standpoint under the more limited conditions of exposure that
would likely obtain in a medical setting."

the controlled substances act of 1970 established
five categories, or "schedules," into which all illicit
and prescription drugs were placed. marijuana was placed
in schedule i, which defines the substance as having a
high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use
in the united states, and a lack of accepted safety for use under
medical supervision. to contrast, over 90 published reports
and studies have shown marijuana has medical efficacy.

on september 6, 1988, the drug enforcement
administration's chief administrative law judge, francis l.
young, ruled:

"marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known....[t]he provisions of
the [controlled substances] act permit and require the
transfer of marijuana from schedule i to schedule ii.
it would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the
dea to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits
of this substance."

drug enforcement agency, "in the matter of marijuana
rescheduling petition," [docket #86-22] (september
6, 1988), p. 57.
the dea's administrative law judge,
francis young concluded: "in strict medical terms
marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.
for example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response.
by comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough
marijuana to induce death. marijuana in its natural form is one
of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.
by any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used
within the supervised routine of medical care."

drug enforcement agency, "in the matter of marijuana
rescheduling petition," [docket #86-22], (september
6, 1988), p. 57.

of columbia passed legislation recognizing marijuana's
medicinal value.
