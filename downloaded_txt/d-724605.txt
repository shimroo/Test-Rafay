you are invited to take a virtual trip through the lower canyons of the rio grande in the film bravo y grande.
“bravo y grande is a much welcomed and long overdue glimpse at the majesty and grandeur of the rio grande’s lower canyons, its stunning canyon scenery, its powerful whitewater, and its compelling natural history. the film’s cast bring numerous poignant insights into what may be the least accessible river stretch in the lower 48 states. quite simply, i cannot imagine a more rewarding way to spend an hour than watching this lovely journey into the lower canyons.” keith bowden, author of the tecate journals: seventy days on the rio grande

bravo y grande - the lower canyons of the rio grande from brazos film & video on vimeo.
bravo y grande was produced by the big bend natural history association and brazos film & video in cooperation with the national park service and made possible by a funding award from the national park service and outdoor foundation along with financial and in-kind contributions from brazos film & video, big bend river tours, desert sports, far flung outdoor center, and the big bend natural history association.
