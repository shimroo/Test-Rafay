                      product reviews
we were looking for a
                      low cost promotional "giveaway" to use at health fairs and other community events that would appeal to all age groups. the
                      squeezable foam stress relief balls from tension relievers fit the bill.  kids loved them; teens juggled them; adults grabbed them. but we were very surprised when older adults sought us out at a city-wide event.  we didn't realize it then but soon found out the stress balls are great
                      as hand exercisers for those suffering from arthritis!  who knew?  i would recommend this item to anyone wanting to appeal to any and all age groups. the staff at tension relievers are very helpful and make the whole process easy. we had our logo and phone number printed on the stress balls and the 5,000 ball order was delivered when we needed it.  talk about a stress reliever!

to whom it may concern,

        i work for a  pediatric orthopedic group and the foam squeezable stress balls with our logo on them have been a hit! i have been receiving these stress balls from this company for a few years now  and we always ordered the blue color ones.
        until recently when  i ordered the
        multi-colored ones. what a huge hit with the kids! we give the balls & to kids just  coming out of an arm  cast
            to use as hand exercisers to work on strength and to entice the little ones to walk down
            the hallways to check the
        gait. our physician love them as well. 



 


great
              service that really helped me out in a jam! i need 100 stress
              relief balls delivered asap during the 4th of july week. i was so
              amazed at how accommodating and quick the turn-around was even
              when my contact was on vacation. he made sure that the shipment
              went out and my event went on without a hitch!

              during our event, when we agreed with someone, we threw the balls
              in agreement at the person. great way to get a point across and
              keep the mood light in the room. tension relievers are my stress
              relief and go to company for their awesome product!

              dear alan at promostressball,

        we have been using your stress balls for over the past five years and we wanted to let you know how much we love them. we are a chrysler dodge jeep dealership in a small, tight-knit community. every year we participate in the annual 4th of july parade and toss out the balls from our float as we caravan thru town. we are the only parade participant that gives away anything other than candy and i will tell you that we are the hit of the parade.  the response that we get from the crowd is overwhelming and the people are so excited.  they are a great promotional gift for kids & adults alike.  our dealership is now known for the stress balls on the 4th of july within our town.  we strongly feel that is an inexpensive way to get your business noticed and not forgotten. we look forward to a long standing relationship with your company.

        sincerely,
ray tucker,

great service and a great product! we have been using these stress balls for a few years now and we couldn't be happier with them. they work great as an icebreaker at our parent fairs. everyone loves them, from teachers to students. our representative is very attentive and always has our orders correct and on time. we work with many vendors and they are one of our favorite.

we recently contacted allen at promo stress ball with a rush request! he was more than accommodating and willing to help us out. the product arrived the next day as promised. working with alan was a treat and i would happily recommend him to anyone in the future who wanted to deal with a honest and reputable company.

wounded frog ltd. has done business with tension relievers for almost 16 years. in that time, we have always had the best service possible. they keep me on track for my standing orders and always check any orders for problems. no order is too complicated and every order is important to them. they are perfectly willing to work with you in order to get every order accomplished. of course, having the best products at the best prices doesn't hurt either. i absolutely cannot recommend tension relievers highly enough. i hope to be a customer for another 16 yearsand more.
