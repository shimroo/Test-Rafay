welcome to 
          trust
i have made this website as a place 
          for people with anxiety disorders to come and find information and self 
          help. trust is something that not everyone with an anxiety disorder 
          has a lot of. trust that we will overcome this, trust that we can talk 
          to people about this and that they will understand, trust that we can 
          go to a certain place and not have an anxiety attack. the list is endless. 
          i have learnt that a little faith in my being ok goes a long way. i 
          wish you all a speedy and full recovery and hope that my page becomes 
          a place for you to share your  experiences, find help and also 
          support. more things are being added constantly so be sure to check 
          back soon. any suggestions on things that should, or could, be included 
          are gladly received.
while i myself have suffered from 
          an anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia, i am not a medical practitioner 
          or medical professional. 
          i cannot stress how important it is to first see one to be diagnosed 
          and to talk to. anxiety disorders are medical conditions and should 
          be treated as such. never just assume you have one.  it is also 
          extremely important to talk to someone, or see your doctor if you are 
          suffering from depression or are having suicidal thoughts. too many 
          people with anxiety disorders lose hope and suffer. we have a high suicide 
          rate. it can be a debilitating and hard condition to live with, but 
          it is also a controllable and treatable one. never feel you are alone, 
          anxiety disorders are very common.  good luck with your recovery-  
          jen.
