why immanuel?as a community of faith, immanuel follows jesus in our congregation and in our individual daily lives. jesus gathered a community around himself to teach others to be peacemakers, doers of justice, and messengers of god. as christians, we believe that god calls us to work for peace, stand up against injustice, and be god’s grace and love in the world. god gives us community to help us do this; in community we support, accompany, and pray for each other. we help each other become the person god intends that person to be. we understand membership not as an obligation, but rather as being a part of this community god has called together.
