            federal judge won't immediately block elon musk or doge from federal data or worker layoffs

a federal judge has refused to immediately block elon musk and the department of government efficiency from accessing government data systems or participating in worker layoffs. u.s. district judge tanya chutkan on tuesday found that there are legitimate questions about musk’s authority but said there isn’t enough evidence of grave legal harm to justify a temporary restraining order. the decision comes in a lawsuit filed by 14 states challenging doge’s authority to access sensitive government data in seven agencies. they argue that the constitution allows only elected or senate-confirmed officials to wield the powers doge has used. the trump administration says musk has no government authority of his own. read morefederal judge won't immediately block elon musk or doge from federal data or worker layoffs
