still smokey



click here to downloadthere is a 5700 hectare forest fire burning south of us.  it was in washington, but it's jumped the border into bc.  i am not sure how far away it is, but we don't usually see smoke until the late afternoon...this footage was taken at 7am.there are actually 2 fires.  one that is moving towards keremeos, bc and the other threatens manning provincial park (2 hours drive from here and a great park).related links: forest fire smoke prompts emergency landingupdate: fire prompts evacuation alert near b.c. parktechnorati tag(s):   forestfire  |  smoke  |  penticton
