the united states coupby valencia


the united states is under a coup by elon musk and 6 teenagers. it is so bizarre living in this timeline. the united states of america has fallen.  trump also wants to kick mexican-americans out too...it is insane here. elon musk got protection from the department of justice so we are screwed. the democrats are also useless, i swear the people who voted trump in, i hope they die an excruciating death. i will edit this as i get more news.

forum thread: mmoexp: upgrading your diablo 4 healing potions with the help
forum: general discussion
i just saw this on the main page just now and it made me chuckle because i'm currently binging on the hatred of vessel dlc from diablo 4. this game holds a special place in my heart. 

i advise against buying transactions. it is against the guidelines and would put your account at risk. gold isn't difficult to come by in the game. do the quests, whispers, helltides, etc.. and it will pile up. 

image attached is of my beloved character with their adorable pet tiger cub and its mama <3

good game, everyoneby oksonowimangry


so that's it, then. millions of my countrymen couldn't be arsed to show up on election day, and that's ballgame.i'm hearing people talking about how to get through the next 4 years, how we're going to take it all back in 2028, how we're going to reverse all of his damage. i've been hearing people at risk talking about getting out, to canada or perhaps overseas.Â 
Â  Â  problem is, there's nowhere to go. nowhere to hide. we're years, perhaps months away from irrevocable permanent harm being done to the ecosystem. and he's been perfectly clear that he wants to do as much harm to the environment as possible. hell, if he could figure out a way to require everyone to drive coal-powered cars he'd jump at the chance. there's not going to be any "going back" or fixing it. we're cooked. literally. well played, folks. but hey, maybe eggs will be a little cheaper for a month or two. that was worth it, right?
Â 
and yeah, i know that the majority of people on this long-forgotten site are below the legal voting age. and i'm sorry that the older generations, mine included, have failed you so very badly. i just have literally nowhere else i can express this stuff. feel free to just move along and write me off as another elderly wackadoo.Â
