brower

browerâ® manufactures quality, innovative equipment for animal agriculture.  our products find their way into some substantial enterprises but traditionally most of our sales have supported the efforts of hobbyists.   now in our market, there is an intersection of hobbyists and those of you serious about locally grown food.
we have multiple feeding and watering options for locally grown poultry and eggs, swine, beef cattle, sheep and dairy.  we do a superb job for poultry incubation and brooding as well as for equine and wildlife enthusiasts.   in recent years, we have substantially added to our egg nest offering including cage free colony nests which can be automated.   our game bird feeder used in flight pens still dominates this niche.   we have the usa's broadest line of equipment for small scale poultry meat processing.  our swine feeders are popular for local food production but are also very prominently used for show pig, 4h and ffa projects.   we have the usa's top selling outdoor mineral feeder.  our energy free drinkers sport the superior feature of the flapâsuperior because our flaps work in the severest conditions.  are they really energy free?   one hundred percentâand you get the opportunity to use a product which works in sub zero temperatures with a zero carbon footprint.
we very much enjoy doing business with all of our customers.  we have known many of you for years as customers and as friends.  welcome to all new comers.  thank you for the opportunity of serving you.
sincerely yours,
tom wenstrand,    president
cindy wellman,     vice president
