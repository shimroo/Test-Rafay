	 3 songs about sexing up females...
	 
    


its was long weekend but today i got to relax and got do cool things like go to traffic court for 4 hours. saw some cool shit over the weekend though. stopped by the banksy piece down in the village. pretty cool shit but was packed with tourists. i liked the hotdogs in the glass cases. so check that out. its only going on till halloween. todays music has to do with sexing the ladies. i have been bumping some real chill indie hip hop shit as of late so thats the style. first joint is "lovely" by phat kat out of detroit. i really like his album carte blanche so go pick that shit up. ronnie cash has been killing it over the dilla beats.next up is from gift of gab's (blackalicious) solo effort, "4th dimensional rocket ships".  the track i picked is "to know you". im loving this beat. i dont really care about gift of gab, dude is kind of annoying after a while, but jake one owns the track with the production. check for jake-one's producer album, "white van music" which was released recently. its real good.last track is 9th wonder and buckshot's track "throwing shade". real nice beat with great buckshot rhymes. buck still remains raw after all these years. i check for everything this dude puts out. i advise you to do the same. i like the "shadey hoe" message of the track. brooklyn raise up!!!! thats it. gotta go apartment hunting out in harlem tomorrow. peaceeeeeee

so who remembers this blog?a lot of things happened to me since the last post.i finally got the hell out of pennsatucky, pa and moved out to nyc to work in film and audio. i have been working like crazy doing studio recordings, making lots of beats, djing clubs, doing audio work in movies, all kinds of shit. lifes been crazy for a while so blogging hasnt really been on my top priorities. but im finally settling into being a new yorker have the urge to share my taste in music, production, other useless trivia to the blogosphere once again. its been a long time and lots of things have changed, but i think this will be a good time. just give me a few posts to somewhat re-learn the wheel on how this blogger shit breaks down. i dont have any clue about half this shit anymore.the low end theory is getting its grown man on.to start things out i have some "im back, motherfucker!" music for you.bush babees - remember wepeter rock and cl smooth - back on the block (thes one remix)das efx - i shine

	 dennis coffey and the  detroit guitar band - scorpio
	 
    


when i first got into digging for records i came across a busted 45 of dennis coffey's scorpio. scorpio side was all fucked up, but it still kinda played. i was like "damn this is some hot shit". the more i got into records i learned that this is a b-boy staple and for a damn good reason. there is some dope breakdowns on this shit, where a bass line, coffey's guitar, and the drums will just swing for a few measures.  giving dj' something to juggle and the breakers something to dance to. anyways, just recently i was digging in a salvo down in central jersey, and came across a nm copy of the whole lp. coffey was a pretty bad motherfucker on the guitar. dude really had chops and fucked a wah peddle up. i found out that he was a session guitar player for motown records all throughout there golden years. he had tons of classics under his belt out of that camp. coffey also did the score to black belt jones which was a cult classic back in the day. he also pulled mad session work at ric tic records which housed acts like edwin star.  and he even started the sunliners with mike theodore which later on became rare earth. dude has a history. now in the hip hop scheme of things, this record i'm featuring here, has been straight raped to death. cats have not slept on this at all. i think it would be a little bad taste to even sample it now. you really gotta flip that shit now and days or you will play yourself like an asshole. if you do find it out in the field though or on the reissue tip, dont sleep. its just one of those joints you need in your collection.aight today imma post up the b-boy jam scropio, a led zep cover that alot of you will recognize, and a nice slow heady guitar jam. oh and im pretty fucking pissed i missed the wilkes barre record fair today. i had to do a recording today and i couldn't make it down to that shit. thats the only show that really comes around these parts of pa, so i try to get out there and get some heaters. ah welllllll. im broke anyways so i would have to had brought a bag of change to coin star to get some loot. i should just pay for records in change anyways. spice up the transaction part a little.scorpio whole lotta lovegarden of the moon

	 raekwon and el michaels affair
	 
    


i got a promo from scion a few weeks ago for this new album/tour that el michaels affair and raekwon are doing. ive been a fan of the affair for a little while now after i heard a track off rewind vol. 5  which had them covering walk on by. i thought that was pretty cool how they reinterpreted it. after that they did an album on truth and soul records, sounding out the city. they have that raw vintage sound that is very familiar to what producers and djs are digging up to make there own tracks. you would swear that this shit was recorded in 1972.  the affair though is embracing the hip hop cats like the wu which i think is a great match up. they are bringing that live band aspect to gritty rugged, hip hop which needs to be done a lot more. some real good shit coming out of brooklyn. so check truth and soul's myspace (some sick wu covers on there)  and check scion's site for more info on the upcoming album.i got that promo joint up today for download so check that shit, its in .rar format so use winrar to extract it. they do a real dope cover of the pj's produced by pete rock which is butta. i also included a track from there first album. so check the links, buy the albums, and goto the shows. help these dudes out cause they are bringing some new shit to the table and need the support.el michaels affair and raekwon - scion promo

	 hey remember me
	 
    


well god damn. its been a long time since ive done this shit. ive been enjoying life lately and have really had no time to do the whole blog thing. im going to school to become an audio engineer now, work for npr, been making some dope beats, record orchestras, and about to get into the record dealing biz. i really dropped the ball on this blog shit though, but im trying to work back into it. so bear with me till i get this shit back up to where it used to be. now with youtube and other ill shit at my disposal, we gonna tear this shit up.today imma post some shit ive been feeling lately. get your feet wet with some funk bangers today.1. the whitefield brothers - the donthis shit right here is dope. real funky groove and just has that grit to it. and that real "shut yo mouth" bassline going it. i like when the guitar comes in for the solo and rips it up. and when they flip the delay effects on the bridge, it really makes a nice switch up. i just got one of there albums on reissue. uh this shit here2. al green - lets stay together damn man this shit takes me back. i used to sit around and write love notes to my girl in highschool while bumping this in the background. thats how i roll. nah but rev. al is a legend. he just played up here recently and i missed his ass. it probably was a mediocre show,  cause  he found jesus, but shit its fucking al green for chrissake.3.  giant panda - one timeaight, now i really am not a fan of cats rapping in foreign languages. i know i shouldn't be shallow and should strive to move past the language barrier, but fuck all that shit. if i cant understand you, i cant fucking understand you!!!!! how the fuck do i get down to some asshole rapping in japanese when he could be advocating silly shit like wearing pink and punching nuns in the teeth? now this shit here is an exception to the rule. on the 3rd verse this dude just rips it up tokyo style (i think - its a shot in the dark- could be chinese, and if it is, im sorry for the mixup) i like this album fly school reunion so check for that shit. this beat is bananas so i keeps it on rotation.4. del - made in americaman the first time i ever heard about del was in an issue of high times when i was like 14. been a pretty big fan after that. as ice cubes cousin, he got started with the lynch mob and then went out and did his own thing. i wish my brother george was here was ill, both sides of the brain, deltron 3030, the goriallz shit, and no need for alarm, were all pretty decent albums too. im not really a big fan of the recent hiero shit, but he still is a dope motherfucker.5. skee-lo - i wish i was a little bit tallerthis was another jam of mine from back in my youth. i used to rock this shit non stop. i just found it last night and ive had it on lock reminiscing about my adolescence. the lyrics are kinda doo doo,  but the hook is tight and the vibe is right. blaow, now im rhyming like skee-lo. but the video is my fondest memory of this shit. by the way, what ever happened to this dude? im too lazy to give a shit and look it up my damn self, so if anyone knows drop it in the comments.and thats it. so tell ya friends, send ya promos, and come on back tomorrow. i should be putting mad shit up fast to get this shit operating again so keep an eye out. and this time im serious. tomorrow ill drop the raekwon/el michaels affair promo on all yall, so be ready.  peace-djhaze

	 top 10 list of stuff i want to see happen & also go away in 2006
	 
    


what the deal people? i'm back with another blog post. on this installment i'd like to speak on some things that simply need to happen this year and also reflect on some shit that needs to f'n stop. drum roll please...........10. i prefer my hip-hop with 50 percent less beefok, i'll admit it's humorous at times, but this dude is ridiculous with this. we've seen just about everything the past few years: **we had the annoying beef with ja rule (that no one really cared about)...**the jada & fat joe beef aka (double cheeseburger beef) both of which 50 can't compete with lyrically...**the "when will this ever go away" beef with game (i'm kind of happy about that one happening cause i'd rather see game on his own anyway)...**beef with nas (i wish nasty nas would just "ether" him already)...**one of his latest is with singer robbie williams. wtf??! i don't know what to say about that one...**even his own family members (doesn't really surprise me)**and lastly (for now), the next on going beef would most likely be with the dipset (especially with the signing of murder? mase to the g-unit)fiddy needs to spend less time worrying about who he's not going to like next and more time on making better records-9. burn the white teesi'm not sure who came up with the idea that the giant sized t-shirt a.k.a. man dress was a good look. oh and they definitely look even sillier on short dudes. i'm hoping this one goes away in '06. for fuck's sake they even made an equally bad song about it.8. dr. dre.....detox please! ok doc, it's been long enough. i know you have plenty of hot beats and plenty of emcees that want to be on your next album. for all i know the shit might already be done or at least partially finished. the bottom line is the people, no matter if it's east, west, south, or anywhere in between, want this to be released. just one request: please go light on the g-unit and heavy on the real west coast cats that will help make the album sound the way it should.7. more well known rappers tapping into quality "undergound" producersthe best example of this would be the upcoming ghostface album, "fishscale" on def jam (latest release date feb 28th). we've already heard the first single, the pete rock produced "be easy," which is a dope way to start it off. how bout this lineup: a few joints by mf doom, and at least a track or two from madlib and j. dilla. who knows what other surprises p. tone will have in store. can't wait to hear it! another example: i would also like to give jay props for bringing the much deserved 9th wonder into the mainstream scene.6. chapelle's show - the lost episodesit would truly be a celebration....bitches (i just had to). according to comedycentral.com, the 3rd season is supposed to be airing at some point. i surely hope it does. there is not enough good comedy out there. we need as much chappelle as possible.5. some long overdue albums that hip hop needsfirst, there's more signs that the new redman album is finally coming out in '06. we just have to hope funk doc makes an album the way he wants to and that his fans want to hear. he's always on point with the rhymes but we need production like the "muddy waters" days. i can understand if he has to put 1 or 2 club joints on there but we need grimey redman to make his return. next... talib kweli needs to get together with hi-tek and give us another reflection eternal album. their chemistry has always been wonderful, from back in the lyricist lounge and soundbombing days right through to "train of thought" (which is one of my favs of all time). i'd also ask for another black star album but i know that's too far fetched with mos def more concerned about trying to win anoscar than a grammy. last for this one would be the major label debut on atlantic for apathy. atlantic made a huge move by putting out the little brother album (one of my favs of '05), but they have been stalling for quite too long with the major-label debut from ap, "the bearer of bad news." this cat has put out many dope 12"s over the past several years and some indie releases that have not disappointed. he would definitely bring something different to the most of the garbage that the majors mainly put out. check his myspace page4. no more chopping or screwing of any kindi don't get it and never will. i can understand if it's part of the south style these days to have slower beats than normal....sometimes they work. this method was developed by the late dj screw but then really brought into the mainstream by another houston dj, michael watts. as far as bringing the pitch on the turntable all the way down and then occasionally doubling up the records for the repeat effect....i don't see the creativeness or skill involved. the past year was filled with special chopped & screwed versions of mike jones (mike jones, mike jones, he's mike jooones), ying yang twins, three 6 mafia, etc... are people really buying this stuff??? unless the senior citizen population is in need of rap music that's so damn slow even they can dance to it, please let there be an end to this nonsense.3. the only thing more horrible than the passing of odb is how long it's taking dame dash to release his albumearly reviews i read of this were very positive. i don't know what kind of problems dame dash is having with his damon dash music group, but i haven't heard a word or single in a while. there have been about 6 biggie & 12 tupac posthumous releases, but we cannot get one official ol' dirty album that he at least recorded while still alive??? so what i'm a native staten islander and my love for the wu is insane...the fact of the matter is you can't deny this cat was one of the most unique, charismatic, crazy, and ill mother fuckers to hold a mic. he deserves better than this. 2. the next nas albumif you have been following nas since the classic illmatic like me, you know ever since that gem he has not exactly been an expert at picking the best team of producers on his next 6 albums. don't get me wrong, there have been several dope songs and the majority have been good albums...but every release after his debut was lacking something. it was never in his rhymes. in my book nasty nas is one of the top 3 emcees in the history of hip-hop. it's just there has always been a handful of cuts on most of the albums that made you think..this shit could have been produced much better or this track doesn't really fit the album. i have to admit i still do not own nastradamus....but i do own nastradoomus (which is a remix of the album by mf doom that is much better than the original...you need to peep that!) this is also is the same reason beatsmith 9th wonder flipped the god's son album with his own beats (another must own). with all that said what will the future hold? here's how i want it to turn out.... he doesn't need to over-do it with the amount of songs on the album. 12 would be just fine, but no more than 14. here's my picks for producers and a short reason why: the most obvious--dj premier. if you look at nas's career starting with illmatic, almost always the hottest song on the album would be premo's. these two have an amazing chemistry. so, i want at least 4 tracks from premier. next i'd need to see 2 pete rock joints. some of the best songs over the first two albums were definitely coming from the legendary soul brotha #1. keepin' it with the older cats i'd have to give 1 to large professor, who is another reason why illmatic is a classic. now getting into the new generation...without a doubt 9th wonder would have to provide 2 beats. the proof here lies within 9th's history thus far as well as that god's stepson album. next would be 2 tracks from salaam remi. this dude isn't necessarily one of my favorite producers but it's almost a given that nas would go to him for a beat or two. he has supplied some of the best production for nas over the past few albums [see "made you look" & "what goes around (poison)"]. he's pretty nice producer but he doesn't make beats for hardly anyone but nas. i'd have to finish off the list with 1 track from kanye west. you know there is a possibility this can happen especially with nas being featured on late registration combined with him making up with jay-z. i know mr. west would make a dope beat for him cause kanye is a genius like that. if there had to be a couple more tracks i'd say he would have to look to another from large pro, premier, or maybe one from l.e.s. we all have to accept at this point there will not be another illmatic...but with the list i got goin' on here it would come pretty damn close.and for the #1 thing i want in 2006.....1. this bullshit "war" to endthis motherfuckin unecessary oil war must end this year...sooner than later. our dumb fuck of a president needs to stop sending more innocent people to their death for no good reason. it makes me sick.there you have it people. i hope you found this interesting or it got you thinking. please leave your comments on anything you've read here or something you would like to add to the list. oh and make sure you add this site to your favorites list.a few good site links:the best hip-hop lyrics site out there ohhla.coma nicely done site with hip-hop from the mainstream to the underground, including new songs, reviews, news, etc. hiphop dx.coma lot of dope shit to buy the giant peach.comwww.myspace.com/evil_bee
