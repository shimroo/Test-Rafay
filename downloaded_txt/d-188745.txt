saturday august 23 at 8pm412.818.3817 for details$5 suggested donationthree penny opry is only one of many things that robert wagner has started. he has fronted two great bands, the little wretches, and the mercenes. and he has been a driving force in the pittsburgh music scene. his craftsmanship, honesty, and intensity have been inspirations to me, and he remains one of the standards against which i measure my fumbling progress as a songwriter, and as a performer.i always think of robert as the singing poet laureate of pittsburgh. he paints startling portraits of pittsburgh's people, history, and places. if you've heard him, i need say no more. if you haven't, you're missing more than you can imagine.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~t. mitchell bell is also a great singer-songwriter. he brings an expansive conscious-ness, compassion, and soul to his craft. i've shared stages with him a couple times and have always been impressed by his style and capacity.he has a new cd, recorded and mixed in nashville, called the ballad of philo paul, and i hope it'll be available for sale at the show.

saturday april 12 at 8pmgeorge kantor & dave larose plussteve vesolich412.818.3817 for details$5 suggested donationgeorge and dave are wonderful songwriters/performers full of melodic and lyrical surprises. i find them both to make music that is like comfort food with an edge. their styles are different enough to lend a nice dramatic tension, but compatible enough to get everybody wondering how these magical combos find each other. they'll be doing covers by pittsburgh singer-songwriters, so ego and curiosity ought to bring us out. their deft musicality ought to bring everybody else.steve vesolich blew me away when i first heard him at club cafe playing gospel, country blues, americana, and just a touch of grunge sensibility in some of his vocals. i thought, "where'd this guy come from?" you'll ask yourself the same. and you'll be, as i was, eager to hear him again.please join us.www.myspace.com/3pennyoprywww.myspace.com/jackpittsburghwww.myspace.com/stevevesolich

[todd's] music is unmistakable. the very best songwriters share a common trait: they all have a great, ironic sense of humor. todd is west virginia's contribution to this tradition." -- larry groce, host of pbs's mountain stagewww.toddburge.comyou won't believe you paid so little and received so much. you'll hug yourself for not going elsewhere and paying a prince's ransom to receive so much less.

	 return of son of 3po!!!
	 

    


on saturday, september 22, the year of discord 2007, three penny opry gets back to doin' what it always did best: giving you modern music in touch with its roots.this time, it's a leaner, hungrier show. two hours tops.  you're in, you're out, your head is spinning, heart's brimming... you want more.  the show starts at 8pm, 8:05 at the latest. if you're not there, you miss out on a song or two.  it ends at 10pm, 10:05 at the latest.  you want to hang afterwards and swap songs, fantastic.  everybody who doesn't want to commit a huge chunk of their overtaxed weekends can go home, humming, drumming, and eager to come back.mike strasser will play first.  he came into moondog's with anne feeney and the otherwise oblivious crowd hung on his every phrase.  he's been in sacramento for 28 years, but he's a 'burgh native, and we're lucky to have him back.then jack erdie will play with his band, the insubordinates.  most of you haven't heard the insubs since the release party for jack's pumpkin cd.  they fully intend to rock the house in a rootsy way, with a surprising cover song.as always, there'll be a $5 suggested donation, but feel free to give more. how much has music done for you???come out and help start the new season off proper.  we promise to make it a night for you to remember, and want to relive.

	 we like big buts
	 

    


robert writes . . . our controversial 42nd president turns 60 years old on saturday, august 19.  and we're celebrating with song at the starlite lounge.at 9:00 pm, jack erdie, sue gartland, kate snow, van stragand and robert wagner will be performing in the round in the back room of the starlite.  if you want to join the circle, bring your guitar.  well have some cake and ice cream, and maybe some chicken wings.  feel free to bring your kids.when nba superstar charles barkley said, if ifs and buts were beer and nuts, wed have a hell of a party, he was not talking about bill clinton.president clinton is considered by many to be among the most intelligent and charismatic men of the twentieth century (and now, the twenty-first), but . . .was there ever a guy who so polarized the public?  leftists accused him of acting like a republican.  rightists accused him of being a closet socialist.  people doubted his sincerity, his honesty.  a cottage industry of conspiracy theorists made big bucks of his alleged misdeeds.  if hed have kept his zipper zipped if, if, ifmaybe eight years of relative peace and prosperity wasnt enough.wouldnt it be cool if presidents were like professional wrestlers and they never really retired?  wouldnt have been cool to see bill clinton square off against ronald reagan to settle once and for all who was the real great communicator?  how about clinton versus fdr?  roosevelt retired with the belt, like rocky marciano, but he never had to square off against a guy like bill clinton.  clinton would have been the heavy in the match, having had to turn republican just to get a chance to get in the ring with the champ.  maybe clinton would overturn the wheelchair while the refs back is turned, get the pin on a fast count and run for the exit, waving the championship belt in the air while pelted by debris from the angry mob.clinton would proceed to defend his title against richard nixon, a fighter so dirty and vicious that even bill clinton would come out as the good guy.  nixon would tear him to shreds but get himself disqualified by using foreign objects and refusing to break a choke hold by the count of four.the biggest showdown of all, of course, would be clinton versus jfk.  jfk would show up with jackie and marilyn and all that glitz and panache.  clinton would enter the ring with an entourage of trailer park hairdressers and truck stop waitresses.  a huge battle royale would erupt, and in the confusion, one of clintons floozies would seduce kennedy, allowing clinton to steal a thrilling victory.anyhow clinton wasnt a wrestler, just another might have been..calliope

(an) amazing singer and songwriter and guitar player who has songs that are somehow complex and simple at the same time and of the heart."  - larry berger, the saturday light brigade"...goodman's vocals are gentle and unassuming, yet there's a rock-ribbed confidence under the surface....her strength lies in her straightforward poignancy."  - kris fell, the boston phoenix"...goodman sings like a seasoned blues performer, squeezing and wringing the words from her throat....her (guitar) style is as unassuming as her personality...graceful and effortless playing that could have entertained on its own all night."  - madeleine g. eno, south end news"...my thoughts, my feelings, reflections of parts of myself that i try to keep hidden -- somehow i find them revealed in the songs of eve goodman and realize that i no longer have to feel that way alone.".  - john hayes, staff writer, pittsburgh post-gazette"...the music is top notch".  - bill jackson, boston rockwww.calliopehouse.orgwww.evegoodman.com
