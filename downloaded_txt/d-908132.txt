the uber oscars






every year the oscars hand out an award for best actor. but since they also hand out awards for best actress, best supporting actor, and best supporting actress they still leave the most fundamental question unsettled: who gave the year’s best acting performance. 



well (now that the dust has finally settled form this year’s crazy oscars) i’m here to retroactively answer that question for every year dating back to 1990. welcome to the uber oscars!



2016

casey affleck

emma stone

mahershala ali

viola davis



if viola davis had competed in best actress like she should have she would have won it easily. i’m starting the exercise with a gimme putt. 



2015

leonardo dicaprio

brie larson

mark rylance

alicia vikander



time changes how art is perceived, and this feels too recent to really have a clear perspective on it. i would wager that 5-10 years from now brie larson’s work will be considered the best of the bunch, but leo so thoroughly dominated last year’s award season and his win loomed so large in the popular consciousness i gotta give him the nod here for now.



2014

eddie redmayne

julianne moore

jk simmons

patricia arquette



i remember being blown away by julianne moore in still alice, but the movie came out only three years ago and yet i barely remember a single thing about it. jk simmons’ performance in whiplash on the other hand was instantly iconic to everyone who saw it and will define his entire career. so, sorry julianne, but you’re lagging every so slightly.



2013

matthew mcconaughey

cate blanchett

jared leto

lupita nyong’o



screw your mcconaisssance, this is cate blanchett all the way. leo should have beaten mcconaughey anyway, and then we could have had a real debate. great year though overall.



2012

daniel day-lewis

jennifer lawrence

christoph waltz

anne hathaway



another great year. anne hathaway is now officially underrated and jennifer lawrence is one of the most memorable winners of recent years. but one of my rules in life is that in an acting-related contest between anyone and daniel day-lewis, the winner is always daniel day-lewis.



2011

jean dujardin

meryl streep

christopher plummer

octavia spencer



uh, well someone has to win, so using the daniel day-lewis rules, this one goes to meryl streep, i guess? says a lot about the 2012 oscars that one of the hardest trivia questions in the world is “who won best actor six years ago”



2010

colin firth

natalie portman

christian bale

melissa leo



at the time it was probably christian bale. now it’s probably natalie portman. but it’s close.



2009

jeff bridges

sandra bullock

christoph waltz

mo’nique



i might be biased here, but i think christoph waltz in inglorious basterds is an all-timer. if you wanted to talk me into mo’nique though i’d be willing to listen.



2008

sean penn

kate winslet

heath ledger

penelope cruz



really strong year. any of the other three could have won most years. but heath ledger’s joker is arguable the single best performance of the 2000s. it’s certainly the most iconic.



2007

daniel day-lewis

marion cotillard

javier bardem

tilda swinton



if heath ledger’s joker isn't the best acting performance of the 2000s then daniel day-lewis’s daniel plainview is. so, sorry javier bardem, but you're gonna have to settle for being the strongest uber-oscars runner-up of them all. and tilda swinton, any day now feel free to give cate blanchett the oscar you stole from her.



2006

forrest whitaker

helen mirren

alan arkin

jennifer hudson



as much as i want to try and argue that it’s jennifer hudson, i think it’s pretty clearly actually helen mirren. 



while we’re here, 2006 best supporting actor is on the shortlist for weakest oscar acting category of all time.



2005

phillip seymour hoffman

reese witherspoon

george clooney

rachel weisz



fun fact: even george clooney can’t totally remember what movie he won an oscar for. anyway, this was the easiest call on the whole board. not so fun fact: this was the crash year.



2004

jamie foxx

hillary swank

morgan freeman

cate blanchett



oh god…is it jamie foxx for ray? it’s jamie foxx for ray isn't it? ugh. i hate this game, why did i make it up?



2003

sean penn

charlize theron

tim robbins

renee zellwegger



why does it feel like charlize theron’s performance in monster doesn't get its proper due? it’s profoundly great work and should be talked about way more. is this how think pieces get started?



2002

adrien brody

nicole kidman

chris cooper

catherine zeta-jones



can i pick none of the above?



2001

denzel washington

hallie berry

jim broadbent

jennifer connelly



if you want to really get me talking, ask me about how art carney’s 1972 win for harry and tonto led to denzel beating russell crowe out for this oscar. i’m fun at parties.



2000

russell crowe

julia roberts

benicio del toro

marcia gay harden



if kate hudson hadn't been upset by marcia gay harden i would have given this one to her. but you have to actually get the oscar to be eligible for an uber oscar.



1999

kevin spacey

hilary swank

michael caine

angelina jolie



we have winner from the supporting actress category! full disclosure: i’ve somehow actually never seen boys don't cry. but angelina jolie is not only incredible in girl interrupted, it’s the performance that made her into a superstar. it’s impossible to overstate how famous angelina jolie was overnight in the wake of this oscar win. that counts for something.



1998

roberto benigni

gwyneth paltrow

james coburn

judy dench



i’m a big shakespeare in love fan and defender and even i refuse to give this to gwyneth paltrow. also, the only thing that has aged worse than roberto benigni’s win is this poster: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71st_academy_awards#/media/file:71st_academy_awards_poster.jpg



1997

jack nicholson

helen hunt

robin williams

kim basinger



would you like for me to quote the entirety of good will hunting for you? because i can. have i mentioned yet that i’m fun at parties?



1996

geoffrey rush

francis mcdormand

cuba gooding jr

juliette binoche



this basically comes down to what you value more in a performance: craft or charisma. although craft seems like the obvious answer, in this case cuba gooding jr. basically invented an entirely new character archetype through sheer force of personality. so let’s call it a tie for now.



1995

nicholas cage

susan sarandon

kevin spacey

mira sorvino



yes that’s right kids, nicholas cage not only has a best actor oscar but he’s actually one of the most deserving oscars winners of the 1990s. the 90s were a weird time man. 



speaking of which, here are actors who won oscars in 1996 for things other than acting: mel gibson, emma thompson and christine lahti. as i said, the 90s were weird.



1994

tom hanks

jessica lange

martin landau

dianne wiest



here’s the thing, this should be martin landau. he's incredible in ed wood. it’s one of the best supporting actor performances of all time and definitely one of the best overall performances of the decade. 1994 best supporting actor is one of the strongest categories of all time and he won it easily. but that said, no one is beating tom hanks for forrest gump. is it great acting? i genuinely don’t know. but off the top of your head name 10 performances in the history of film that are definitely more iconic than tom hanks as forrest gump. i’m not saying i feel great about it, but for better or worse, right or wrong, this completely meaningless made-up award is his.



1993

tom hanks

holly hunter

tommy lee jones

anna paquin



holly hunter winning acting awards is so 90s. and i hear your arguments for tom hanks in philadelphia, but so much of the esteem for that performance came from “straight man plays gay and has bravery to depict aids”. nothing against tom hanks and the great work he does, but you don’t brownie points for that in 2017. plus, although people sleep on it now, the piano is actually straight fire son.



1992

al pacino

emma thompson

gene hackman

marissa tomei



i really really really want to give this to marissa tomei. but i recognize that it actually belongs to emma thompson. however it definitely does not belong to al pacino. scent of a woman wasn't even his best oscar nominated performance of 1992.



1991

anthony hopkins

jodie foster

mercedes ruehl

jack palance



hey, remember a few seconds ago when i asked if you came name a more iconic acting perforce than tom hanks in forrest gump? well here’s your answer. this probably the uber oscar winner of the whole decade.



on an unrelated note, i kinda miss the days when people like jack palance, marissa tomei, and dianne wiest could win oscars for comedic roles. #makeoscarsgreatagain



1990

jeremy irons

kathy bates

whoopi goldberg

joe pesci




if anthony hopkins isn't the overall uber oscar winner for the 1990s then joe pesci is. in fact i extended this meaningless exercise all the way to 1990 just to include him. and now that i’ve reminded you of the greatness of joe pesci in goodfellas we can finally draw this to a close. congrats to all the fake winners on your fake awards!

grammys 2017: adele's revenge






who gives a damn about a grammy? other than chance the rapper hopefully no one. but what i do give a damn about is the grammys telecast. it’s great! sometimes for the wrong reasons, but whatever! i love watching it. so, as always, here are some thoughts on each of this years performances: 



adele (hello)

“heeeellllooooooo from 12 months ago” - adele



nothing like showing how you have your finger on the pulse of music like starting your music awards show out with a song from 2015. keep up the good work grammys!



james cordon opening

james cordon is the best case scenario for a musical theater kid.



the weeknd

the weeknd is the best case scenario for selling out.



also, the weeknd is great in any situation, but definitely the situation the weeknd is best in is when drake cancels on your awards show last minute.



keith urban/country music barbie

is this country music is now??? if so i guess it’s true what they say: one generation’s dance-influenced guitar pop is the next generation’s country music. 



either that or genre is now officially dead.



ed sheeran

fun game i like to play: former harry potter actor or ed sheeran

fun fact that is definitely true: no one over the age of 26 can name a single ed sheeran song

fun thing to watch on the grammys: not this performance



lukas graham/kelsea ballerini

it’s been fun not knowing you kelsea ballerini. best of luck with everything.



hot take so hot that it’s on fire: “7 years” is a good song and i enjoy it.

(feels good to get that off my chest)



beyonce

in retrospect destiny’s child is the most fitting name possible for a young-beyonce fronted group. this beyonce is where the last 20 years of popular music have been building to. if 1998 lauryn hill, 2008 lady gaga, and 2010 kanye had a daughter, that daughter would want to be 2016/17 beyonce when she grows up.



having the platform, permission, vision, and talent to give this performance is really the final level possible of popular artistic success. clearly beyonce is there and it’s awesome to see. but mostly i just enjoy how solange beyonce is now.



bruno mars

bruno mars paradoxes:

-bruno mars remains somehow both incredibly overrated and incredibly underrated at the same time.

-bruno mars is one of the most charismatic performers in history, yet also somehow has no discernible personality.

-pretty much everyone would agree that a bruno mars concert seems like it would be awesome, yet i doubt there’s a single person i know who would ever actually want to go to one.



bruno mars remains a great live performer and an even greater enigma, and the earth will now die and crash into the sun before the grammys will ever again happen without a bruno mars performance.



katy perry

i don't know if its acceptable to ironically love katy perry yet or not, but regardless, i audibly expressed excitement when her performance was introduced. listening to new katy perry singles is my heroin. i know i’ll never get back that original high of “teenage dream” but i’m addicted to trying anyway. it just makes me feel so good inside. and it will somehow probably lead to my death.



also, how quietly katy perry is winning the perry/swift civil war is so katy perry. and as much as i like taylor swift i’m gonna be one of the first people off the boats at normandy



gary clark jr.

gary, you're great and i'm sure that was lovely, but i gotta be honest, i was still perry drunk for your whole performance.



alicia keys/maren morris

i feel like we as a society have failed alicia keys. she’s some parallel universe’s beyonce.



and i had no real idea who maren morris was coming into tonight but i have a strong feeling her album sales just picked up significantly. so way to ricky martin that thing maren!



adele (george michael tribute)

in an existential twist, messing up made that way better than it would have been had everything gone according to plan. (wake up sheep! adele’s sound issues were an inside job!)

and the in-the-moment confusion over how much of adele’s post-song emotion was about george michael and how much was about the restart is why there's still nothing quite like watching live tv.



lady gaga/metallica

wow lady gaga’s country phase sure just took a dramatic turn.



pretty sure lady gaga is the first person to perform on the grammys with both metallica and tony bennett, but i’ll have to check on that. all i know is i’m looking forward to next year when she performs with wu-tang clan.



sturgill simpson

dwight yoakum introducing sturgill simpson feels even more on the nose than beyonce being introduced by her own mother.



after that performance sturgill simpson easily retains his title as my all-time favorite live performer that i had never even heard of two months ago. also there's literally nothing in life the dap-kings don’t make better.



the bee gees tribute

i know that literally no one in the world needed or wanted that, but hey, good news, little big town covering “how deep is your love” is now the official theme song of cbs. so there’s that.



a tribe called quest and friends

my review

1st half: ….honestly? kind of a mess.

2nd half: all the fire emojis!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



can you kick it? i’m pretty sure you just did. the only bright side to the next four years is the hope that we might get to experience even more shit like that.



prince tribute

bruno mars and the time doing the grammys' prince tribute is the occam’s razor of prince tributes. it also feels like the last word. although i also think we’d all be totally fine with just continuing to do prince tributes forever.



chance the rapper

there was a 100% chance that was going to be transcendently great and indeed it was. i don’t believe in god, but chance the rapper is so great that he makes me think that i do.



john legend/cynthia erivo

hot take so hot it can melt steel beams: i’m over awards shows doing solemn in memoriam segments.



neil portnow
neil portnow bitches!!!!! james cordon thought he could upstage neil portnow with his neil portnow intro but nothing can upstage neil portnow! 



real talk: at this point i legitimately don’t know if my excitement about neil portnow is even ironic anymore. this is my cry for help.



the fact that the grammys ended the performance section of the night with in memoriam and neil portnow

the 20 best things of 2016






fun fact: many good things actually happened in the year 2016. it’s true! it wasn't all death and trump, although as you’ll see, those two factors hang heavy over even the best of things. but just like every year, 2016 still managed to produce its fair share of great art, cultural triumphs, and viral delights. leaving out, obviously, things from 2016 that it seems like i’ll probably love but have yet to experience (oj: made in america, search party, 20th century women, fences, etc.), and tv shows i’ve already written about in years past (oitnb, transparent, you're the worst, veep, etc) here are my top 20 favorite things from 2016, listed in no particular order:

1. beyonce - “formation” video

how upset old white people were about this should give you some idea of just how great it is.

when i was growing up, the biggest music video from the biggest female pop star of the day involved her dancing around suggestively in a catholic school girl outfit. trump may have won the election, but progress still remains undefeated.

2. kendrick lamar’s grammys performance

(of course this isn't anywhere on the internet for me to link to. because neil portnow.)

kendrick’s performance was the performance that kayne always thinks he is giving. it’s a performance that made everyone else who took the stage on music’s biggest night seem like talent show contestants.

i don’t want to tell artists how to use their fame, but this is how they should use their fame. 

3. last week tonight - #makedonalddrumpfagain

spoiler alert: he didn't make donald drumpf again. in fact the viral success of this piece and lack of any resultant effect on trump whatsoever does raise some big questions about the effectiveness of comedy in actually changing anyone’s mind about anything in 2016. but yet, like death from a thousand paper cuts, it definitely drew a little blood. and even though i really wish john oliver had stuck with guns and only referred to trump as drumpf for the rest of the year, it was still a more thorough and effective attack ad than anything the clinton campaign managed to put together, and that was basically their whole job. john oliver can never be president, but the world is going to be a better place as long as he keeps trying to help decide who will be.

also, says everything about 2016 that this piece now feels like it came out ten thousand years ago.

4. la la land

hey, remember joy? and love? and having hopes and dreams? well la la land sure does! the best and worst thing you can say about it is that it’s a pre-trump movie. maybe the last one ever in fact. but for my money, damien chazelle’s quest to make musicals great again is exactly the tonic we need right now. and it seems fitting the oscars after the death of debbie reynolds are going to be headlined by a colorful and happiness-inducing musical about show business, complete with its own dream ballet. sometimes the best way to reinvent an art form is to just do it the same way its always been done, only better and at the right time.

5. olympic swimming

when the olympics began i barely cared. i was raised on the olympics, but in 2016 there’s so much else going on it felt like maybe time has passed the olympics by. and then the swimming started. and ledecky destroyed all challengers. and phelps proved that calling him the greatest swimmer of all time is still underrating him. and simone manuel made history. and lochte lochted. and anthony ervin spun an all-time olympic athlete backstory into olympic gold. and for a week there was nothing in the world more compelling than watch people swim laps in a pool.

so turns out the olympics are the michael phelps of sporting events - the second you think they’ve slipped a bit is when they have you right where they want you.

6. lvl up - “pain”

point: rock and roll is dead

counterpoint: “pain” by lvl up

7. stranger things

i hate the 80s. i hate supernatural shows and horror-based shows and “genre” shows in general. i hate homage as the starting place for a work of art. i hate culture’s obsession with nostalgia and youth. and yet i loved stranger things. it felt like nothing else on tv while feeling like so many other things all at once. it’s the show lost wishes it could have been, and what jj abrams wishes he had made instead of super 8.

also: i hate that there’s going to be a season two. i hate that dialogue around the show seemed so #teambarb when clearly any sane right-thinking person is #teamnancy all the way. i preemptively hate all the imitators stranger things is going to spawn. and i hate the stranger things backlash that’s inevitably coming and coming hard. but right now, in this moment, let’s all embrace a wonderful television ride and not worry about the demigorgons in the woods coming to put slugs in its mouth.

#keephawkinsweird

8. flossie dickey

sometimes you find true love where you least expect it. like in an interview with a 110-year woman at a nursing home.

9. sam donsky on the ringer

(speaking of soul mates…)

in the age of trump it’s more important than ever that we have writers brave enough to ask the tough questions. like: who would win the oscar for best baby? what is the best night any celebrity has ever had at madison square garden? and why does david benioff always thank his wife by her full name? 

from analyzing the kim/kayne/taylor tapes like they're the zapruder film, to asking 74 questions about a film no one saw or liked, 2016 was the year sam donsky officially made himself into this generation’s woodward and bernstein, if woodward and bernstein were mostly known for dissecting dumb pop culture on the internet. we may never fully understand why trump won, but, also, what’s up with chris pratt’s vests?

10. black-ish - “hope”

a perfect piece of writing and a perfect argument for the continued existence of network tv. 

that being said though, 40 years ago this would be a classic tv episode people would talk about for generations. now, it didn't even get nominated for an emmy. maybe network tv is just beyond saving.

11. the people vs. oj simpson

it’s almost a cliche at this point to point out how many societal issues the oj simpson case touched on, but watching this miniseries unfold was a great reminder that looking at the the past is usually the best vehicle for exploring the present. to choose just one example, the scene where the jurors argue over what to watch on tv is a perfect encapsulation of how something like a trump victory could some day be possible. and if marcia clark isn't a perfect hillary clinton avatar then i don’t know who is. my only complaints about a perfect eight hours of television are that it wasn't longer and that sarah paulson and courtney b. vance aren't eligible for oscars.

12. samantha bee’s donald trump conspiracy theory

look, i don't want to say that full frontal with samantha bee is the best and most important show on tv. that is has the best joke writers in the business. that it has the righteous anger and indignation that this year called for. that it’s going to be our guiding light for the next four years. and that it’s proof that giving the daily show to trevor noah was one of the dumbest decisions in recent television history. all i’m saying is that some people are saying that, and who am i to disagree? if i was going to make claims that outlandish, i guess the first pieces of evidence i would direct you to are this already iconic donald trump conspiracy and the show’s harriet tubman segment. but i’m not one to make accusations about things using facts and evidence. i’m no expert; i’m just a guy. a guy standing in front of samanthabee.com asking it to to love him.

13. david bowie - “lazarus” video

the ultimate mic drop.

they say native americans used to make use of every part of the buffalo. david bowie was like that, only the buffalo was his life.

14. snl

“farewell mr. bunting”

having enough trust in your audience and your vision to attempt this sketch is super inspiring. getting people in 2016 to wait through two and a half minutes of build up in a viral video before it pays off feels like a miracle. and getting the feeling back in my face when i finally finish laughing at this is going to be really great.

“black jeopardy”this is what comedy can do when its at it’s best. it cuts to truths about america more clearly and cleanly than 1,000 think pieces ever could. are comedy sketches eligible for the nobel prize in literature now?

“hillary clinton/hallelujah”and this is what comedy can do when it’s not comedy at all. when historians 200 years from now want to know what the days just after the election of donald trump felt like all they need to do is watch this. the best thing snl has ever done.

15. songs that made me unsure whether i should be sad, dance, or both

christine and the queens - “it”

i have absolutely no idea what this song is about. all i know is it sounds like the feeling of being alive. between this song and marion cotillard’s eyes the french really continue to have the whole beautiful sadness thing figured out.

eleanor freiberger - “my mistakes”the best rilo kiley song of 2016. the world can change however it wants; as long as it keeps giving me new versions of the exact song i’m totally good.

mike posner - “took a pill in ibiza”the exact opposite of me is an edm-influenced song about taking drugs in a nightclub in ibiza. yet here we are. turns out that existential melancholy translated into douche from the original neurotic intellectual is still pretty damn relatable. and yes i realize this song came out in 2015, but this will always be the sound of 2016 to me.

16. moonlight

moonlight feels like a miracle. that a serious drama without any name stars about a poor, gay, black man coming of age could be made at all, yet alone breakthrough into the popular consciousness. that a cast this natural and flawless could be found, like an album where every song that comes on makes you go “no this one is my favorite!”. that there are two different sets of three actors so similar and so good that when i see them together doing press it hurts my brain because i can’t process that they were not actually the same person at three different ages. that two people making small talk at a table in a diner could have a whole audience on the edge of their seats. that a no-name director with one prior little-seen credit could create the most powerful and well-made movie of the year. none of these things seems possible or plausible, and yet they're all true. this movie is a miracle. and its success gives me hope. to quote critic dana stevens, in the pitch-black year of trump, moonlight was a “crack in the wall that allowed light to shine through”.

17. atlanta

in 2016, what even is tv? it’s basically anything now. and it’s everything. it’s whatever it wants to be. and no artist has yet risen to meet the challenge and possibility of our post-louie world better than donald glover has. in 2016 atlanta is tv, and tv is atlanta. there are no rules. there is only what you can dream up.

what will season two of atlanta be? it could be literally anything and no one would bat an eye.

18. chance the rapper - coloring book

chance the rapper is so millennial it hurts. chance the rapper definitely has strong feelings about safe spaces and bernie sanders. chance the rapper has never even considered doing something ironically. chance the rapper makes lin-manuel miranda look like a cynical pessimist. hell, chance the rapper named himself chance the rapper. and as a millennial, chance the rapper is the future.

and the future sounds amazing.

the future is like if old kanye had been raised on new kanye and was actually good at rapping. (as the old saying goes: every generation gets the late registration it deserves) the future is like if picasso painted with emojis. the future is earnestness being the new aggression. the future is future being the past.

hip-hop is dead, long live hip-hop.

19. “a closer look” on late night with seth meyers

i almost left this reoccurring segment off my list of the best of 2016 because it’s become such a constant part of my life that i assumed it had been around longer than just this year. who knew when jon stewart retired that the new iteration of the daily show would be called late night with seth meyers? or as i call it: essential.

20. revisionist history podcast

facts and knowledge really took a beating in 2016, but turns out both are still great if you just re-examine them rather then throw them out all together. perhaps looking more deeply into our assumptions about the world can help us better understand human nature and the reality we all share. who knew? 

of everything i experienced in 2016 this podcast is the thing i reference most frequently. i’m fun at parties.
