parent comments 
“i absolutely recommend this program. my son loved it last year and is excited to be returning this summer - he even said that he would like to be a counselor for the camp when he is older. they had lots of guest speakers and had various competitions going on every day. my son’s team won the gold medal for his grade in the team competition. the college is also very nice and the kids are well supervised the entire time. my son’s roommate last year was from shanghai, which was very interesting. i think it’s a great experience and it looked great on my son’s application for the stem academy high school that he was accepted into and will be attending next year. if you have the means, i say definitely send your child. it’s worth it. it’s made up of all of the smart kids from all over the world. it’s a great honor for him to be accepted as the test requirement is not easy to achieve.”
