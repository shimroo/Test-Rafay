  experience mayan beach garden
  mayan beach garden serviced apartments has 5 studios and two 1 bedroom  units that are designed for independent travelers who are looking for extended stays on the beach in comfort and tranquility. if you like the idea of caribbean waves lulling you to sleep, our serviced apartments are for you. our boutique style hospitality and seclusion can't be found in cancun or the riviera maya. the owners live here and personally answer all reservation inquiries from the  beach in costa maya (the area in the southern part of quintana roo) note: we are 20 km. north of mahahual (not in mahahual town). those looking for a bar scene won't find it in this quiet and rustic area. however, we have a very nice
restaurant  where dori serves up some of
the best food
on the costa maya.
