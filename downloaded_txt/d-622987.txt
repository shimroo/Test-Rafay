puzzling evidence radio show links - oh joy and fun, i am so lucky because i get to be one of the regular special guest stars on this world famous, award-winning radio show. this is the most famous of all the subgenius radio shows except maybe hour of slack. this show has been on kpfa 94.1 in berkeley ca for over 20 years. mind expanding free form concept extension word jammers rap and spin and take on all callers at 3:00 to 5:00 am friday mornings also streaming at www.kpfa.org.  completely un-grok-able in small doses. requires multiple exposures in order to "get it". rarely constrained by theme or common sense. sometimes we'll have special guests visitors, famous weirdos or naked women or gorillas or naked women gorillas. serpent x is kind enough to host some of earlier shows. of course, don't forget to set up your podcast at higher quality stereo mp3s podcasts for those technologically illiterate luddites out there, copies can be obtained on cd from me if you ask me to and i'll slavishly make them and procrastinate and wait a really, really long time to actually mail them to you but will eventually get them to you if you make me feel really guilty. but anyway just e-mail me at philo@quiveringbrain.com.
