"all scripture is given by inspiration of god, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (ii timothy 3:16).the bible is the only god-given authority which man possesses; therefore, all doctrine, faith, hope, and all instruction for the church must be based upon, and harmonize with, the bible. it is to be read and studied by all men everywhere, and can only be clearly understood by those who are anointed by the holy spirit (i john 2:27). "...no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost" (ii peter 1:20-21).the one true godwe believe in the one ever living, eternal god: infinite in power, holy in nature, attributes and purpose; and possessing absolute, indivisible deity. this one true god has revealed himself as father, through his son, in redemption; and as the holy spirit, by emanation. (i corinthians 8:6; ephesians 4:6; ii corinthians 5:19; joel 2:28). the scripture does more than attempt to prove the existence of god; it asserts, assumes and declares that the knowledge of god is universal. (romans 1:19, 21, 28, 32; 2:15). god is invisible, incorporeal, without parts, without body, and therefore free from all limitations. he is spirit (john 4:24), and "...a spirit hath not flesh and bones..." (luke 24:39). "...the first of all the commandments is, hear, o israel; the lord our god is one lord" (mark 12:29; deuteronomy 6:4). "one god and father of all, who is above all, and through all and in you all" (ephesians 4:6). before the incarnation, this one true god manifested himself in diverse ways. in the incarnation, he manifests himself in the son, who walked among men. as he works in the lives of believers, he manifests himself as the holy spirit.the son of godthe one true god, the jehovah of the old testament, took upon himself the form of man, and as the son of man, was born of the virgin mary. as paul says, "and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: god was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory" (1 timothy 3:16)."he came unto his own, and his own received him not" (john 1:11), this one true god was manifest in the flesh, that is, in his son jesus christ. "...god was in christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them..." (ii corinthians 5:19).we believe that, "...in him (jesus) dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily" (colossians 2:9). "for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell" (colossians 1:19). therefore, jesus in his humanity was man; in his deity was and is god. his flesh was the lamb, or the sacrifice of god. he is the only mediator between god and man. "for there is one god, and one mediator between god and men, the man christ jesus." (i timothy 2:5).jesus on his father's side was divine, on his mother's side, human; thus, he was known as the son of god and also the son of man, or the god-man."for he hath put all things under his feet. but when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him" (i corinthians 15:27). "and when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that god may be all in all" (i corinthians 15:28)."i am alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the almighty" (revelation 1:8).the namegod used different titles, such as "god elohim," "god almighty," "el shaddai," "jehovah," and especially "jehovah lord," the redemptive name in the old testament."...unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: ...and his name shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty god, the everlasting father, the prince of peace" (isaiah 9:6). this prophecy of isaiah was fulfilled when the son of god was named, "and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins" (matthew 1:21). "neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved" (acts 4:12).repentance and conversionpardon and forgiveness of sins is obtained by genuine repentance, a confessing and forsaking of sins. we are justified by faith in the lord jesus christ (romans 5:1). john the baptist preached repentance, jesus proclaimed it, and the apostles emphasized it to both jews and gentiles. (acts 2:38; 11:18; 17:30).the word ârepentanceâ means a change of views and purpose, change of heart, change of mind, change of life (and or) transformation, etc. jesus said, "...except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish" (luke 13:3). luke 24:47 says, "and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at jerusalem."water baptismthe scriptural mode of baptism is immersion, and is only for those who have fully repented, having turned from their sins and a love of the world. it should be administered by a duly authorized minister of the gospel, in obedience to the word of god, and in the name of our lord jesus christ, according to the acts of the apostles 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; thus obeying and fulfilling matthew 28:19.the baptism of the holy spiritjohn the baptist, in matthew 3:11, said, "...he shall baptize you with the holy ghost, and with fire." jesus, in acts 1:5, said, "...ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence." luke tells us in acts 2:4, "...they were all filled with the holy ghost, and began to speak with other tongues (languages), as the spirit gave them utterance."the terms "baptize with the holy ghost and fire," "filled with the holy spirit," and the "gift of the holy ghost" are synonymous terms used interchangeably in the bible. it is scriptural to expect all who receive the gift, filling, or baptism of the holy spirit to receive the same physical, initial sign of speaking with other tongues.the speaking with other tongues, as recorded in acts 2:4; 10:46, and 19:6, and the gift of tongues, as explained in i corinthians, chapters 12 and 14, are the same in essence, but different in use and purpose.the lord, through the prophet joel, said, "...i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh..." (joel 2:28). peter, in explaining this phenomenal experience, said, "...having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost, he (jesus) hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear" (acts 2:33). further, "...the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the lord our god shall call" (acts 2:39).arrow leftbackfour ways to givegiving at church:most meetings the ushers will collect an offering. offerings may be designated by placing your offering in an envelope (available on the back wall of the sanctuary) and marking the designation on the envelope. also, there are offering boxes on the back wall of the sanctuary. you may at any time drop your offering in one of the two boxes.giving by mail:southern oaks united pentecostal church 6501 s. walker ave. oklahoma city, ok 73139please designate to one of the following ministries: tithes general offering global missionsgiving through text:dial: 1(405)725-2655 text: offering giving portal will open on your phone.click heregive onlinearrow leftbackarrow leftgo backsouthern oaks united pentecostal church6501 s. walker ave oklahoma city, ok 73139arrow leftgo backlivestream times: sunday: 10:45am, 6:30pmevent calendararrow leftgo backministerial staffpastormark h. parkerbiographical informationassistant pastorandrew parkerbiographical informationassistant pastorrandall d. hughesbiographical informationannual business meetingjanuary 25, 2025 @ 6:00pmto be heard on high3 day prayer and fastingjanuary 27-29missionary servicefebruary 9, 2025 @ 6:30 pmsouthern oaks united pentecostal church is please to welcome the matthew nash family who are missionaries to french polynesia.go backgrasp the word is a discipleship initiative of southern oaks united pentecostal church where we plant the word of god in our heartshow tograspthe wordhearreadstudymemorizemeditategrasp schedule 20251st quarterjanuary--genesis 1--the creator 1. scratching the surface: genesis 1:1 2. digging deeper: genesis 1:1; genesis 1:26-28 3. striking it rich: genesis 1:1,2; genesis 1:26-31; genesis 2:1february -john 1 - the word made flesh 1. scratching the surface: john 1:1, 14 2. digging deeper: john 1:1-5, 14 3. striking it rich: john 1:1-18march -exodus 20 - ten commandments 1. scratching the surface: exodus 20:3 2. digging deeper: exodus 20:3-6 3. striking it rich: exodus 20:3-172nd quarterapril - matthew 5 -beatitudes 1. scratching the surface: matthew 5:16 2. digging deeper: matthew 5:3-12 3. striking it rich: matthew 5:3-16may - deuteronomy 6 - the shema 1. scratching the surface: deuteronomy 6:4 2. digging deeper: deuteronomy 6:1-5 3. striking it rich: deuteronomy 6:1-15june - acts 2 - pentecost 1. scratching the surface: acts 2: 38, 39 2. digging deeper: acts 2:1-4; acts 2:37-40 3. striking it rich: acts 2:14-403rd quarterjuly - psalm 96 - praise the lord 1. scratching for the surface: psalm 96:2 2. digging deeper: psalm 96:1-5 3. striking it rich: psalm 96:1-13august - hebrews 11 - faith 1. scratching the surface: hebrews 11:1 2. digging deeper: hebrews 11:1-3; 12:1-2 3. striking it rich: hebrews 11:4-30september -isaiah 40 - none like god 1. scratching the surface: isaiah 40:25 2. digging deeper:isaiah 40:12-18 3. striking it rich: isaiah 40:12-314th quarteroctober - romans 6 - freedom from sin 1. scratching the surface: romans 6:4 2. digging deeper: romans 6:3 -11 3. striking it rich: romans 6:1-18november - ezekiel 18 - individual opportunity 1. scratching the surface: ezekiel 18:20 2. digging deeper: ezekiel 18:20-24 3. striking it rich: ezekiel 18:20-32december - galatians 5 -fruit of the spirit 1. scratching the surface: galatians 5:22, 23 2. digging deeper: galatians 5:22-25 3. striking it rich: galatians 5:16-25in grasping the word 2025, southern oaks is going for gold! psalm 19:10 states that the word of the lord is more desirable than much fine gold. in 2025 we are digging deeper and striking it rich with deeper love for truth, greater knowledge of god and increased understanding. for the first time in this the 6th year of grasping the word, we have different levels of learning, based upon a single passage of scripture for each month. it is a huge challenge to learn a passage of scripture, yet these are so fundamental in scripture and apostolic doctrine that they are worth every effort. hereâs the plan:each month there is a passage that is the focus of our reading, hearing, memorization, meditation and study. from that passage there are 3 levels of memorization: 1) scratching the surface (consists of one or two verses that would give a concise summary of the passage itself), 2) digging deeper (consists of a portion of the passage) and 3) striking it rich (consists of all or most of the passage).children and adults alike will scratch the surface each month. the children will work on these verses during their memory time in sunday school. we believe it could perhaps be the most memorable year in their learning up to this point because of the context of these key verses.youth and adults should be able to dig deeper each month seeing there are usually at least 30 days (except february) to learn the material. in most instances, this will encompass 4 to 6 verses from the passage of the month.youth and adults will be encouraged to select a passage each quarter in which they will âstrike it rich,â by memorizing the entire passage. for example, in the first quarter the passages scheduled regard, âthe creatorâ, âthe word made fleshâ and âthe ten commandments.â the participant will choose one passage to commit to memory and use the entire 3 months to memorize that passage along with monthly verses from the respective months of january, february and march. you will cherish these passages for the rest of your life. you will continue to pray it, praise it, meditate upon it and teach it through all your days.godâs word is to be desired more than much fine gold. how deep will people dig to gain this worldâs goods? how much more should one apply themselves to âhiding godâs word in their heart (psalm 119:11)?the result will be this testimony: psalms 119:13-16 13 with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 14 i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. 15 i will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. 16 i will delight myself in thy statutes: i will not forget thy word.grasppodcastin the grasp podcast, pastor mark parker expounds on the verses of the month. join in and subscribe to this exciting journey into the word of god!checklisten here!spotifyspotifyfeedfeedgo back
