baby number 4





this baby is supposed to come anyday, and all i can think about is how i'm going to a.  get through it with four kids under five, and b.  how i'm going to get this 40 lbs off of me.  i've been eating just to eat, but also feeling pretty hungry.  what i know though is that i need to get after it right away, becuase i sort of left 15 lbs hanging around after number 3.
