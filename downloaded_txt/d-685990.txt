teach the whole childour approach to children is as much about their sense of adventure and community as it is about their academic potential. kazoo school is more than just a place to learn, it is a way of being in and interacting with the world around you. situated on the edge of kleinstuck preserve, we partner with nature in all that we do. 






  









  









kazoo school’s mission is to prepare children to be confident critical thinkers, lifelong learners, and engaged citizens by providing a progressive educational environment that nurtures, empowers, and inspires. 

 

kazoo valuesrespecting and honoring the voices of childrendiversity of backgrounds, identities, and perspectivesacademic, social, emotional, physical, and creative developmentpartnership between school, family, and communitycollaborative, project-based learningenvironmental stewardship


















“all three [of my kids] love to learn. specific skills with which kazoo school helped them include practice speaking in front of the class, doing group projects, emphasizing physical education, being comfortable in their own skin.”-shirley freeman | kazoo school alumni parent 1991-2007

“learning at an individualized pace allowed room to excel and room for some extra help where needed. sharing an environment with people of all backgrounds also helped me learn to  appreciate differences.”

— lori castello | kazoo school alumn 1978-1980
