k193 is a smart sealed lead accid (sla) battery charger 
          with current limiting. the charger uses a two step process for charging 
          sla batteries - a current limited 'fast' mode followed by a constant 
          voltage 'float' mode. maximum charging current is 1 amp. an onboard 
          led indicates when the charger is in 'fast' mode. when the led goes 
          out the battery is charged and the charger has switched to 'float' mode.

k190 - 4 channel temperature monitor & controller 
             
 the kit has been updated to include a ds1820 sensor plus extra components 
          for use when using sensors on long cable lengths. updated documentation 
          also. 
 this kit is an 'extension' of the k145 temperature logger kit. like 
          the k145 it features four (4) temperature inputs using the ds1820 digital 
          sensor. in addition four (4) relays have been added to provide output 
          control. supplied with plastic case and front/rear panels for a professional 
          looking finish. commands for reading temperatures or controlling relays 
          are sent via the rs232 interface using simple text strings (see documentation 
          for details). the kit can be controlled using a simple terminal or communications 
          program (such as hyperterminal) or via a freeware windows application 
          written by john gray. click here for kit features and specifications 
          and further details of freeware software. 
 
note: kit requires connection to a pc running software for temperature 
          monitoring and/or control.

introducing a new kit :

kit190  4-channel temperature monitor and control
functionally, it's a very nice little unit -- easy to communicate 
          with (a simple command structure, and simple data structure), and easy 
          to do hookups.  internally, the relay channels are independent 
          of the sensor channels.  so, in your software you can set up linkage 
          in any way you like.  the k145 is constantly pushing data out the 
          serial line.  with the k190, you have to poll the board for temperature 
          data.  the board will work with the same ds1820 and ds18s20 sensors 
          that the k145 uses, but can handle the ds18b20 sensor as well.  
          



7th of august 2008
 
we have updated the entires for kits 108, 134, and 145. please check

rohs (lead free) regulations 

          from july 1st 2006 all electronic devices and components, including 
          kits, imported into the european union must comply with rohs legislation 
          governing the amount of lead content. a number of other countries around 
          the world are also considering or have already implemented similar legislation. 
          as a result the kit manufacturer, diy electronics, is slowly changing 
          over to use lead free pcbs and components in all kits. this will be 
          a gradual change but should be complete by the end of 2006.

          these changes will affect the price of the kits as leadfree components 
          and pcbs are more expensive than the 'normal' type, in some cases by 
          as much as 50%. unfortunately these costs will have to be passed on 
          to the end user so the cost of kits will slowly increase as each kit 
          becomes 'lead free'.

          the other change for end users will be solderability. lead free components 
          and pcbs cannot be soldered using current 'normal' soldering irons and 
          solder. lead free soldering requires higher temperature soldering irons 
          and lead free solder. a lot of information regarding lead free soldering 
          is available on the internet - a google search will turn up many hits. 
          it is highly recommended that users familiarise themselves with leadfree 
          soldering techniques before assembling any kits.

diy electronics is pleased to announce the launch of 
          a new kit, diy kit 187, the stepper motor chopper driver
diy kit 187:  stepper motor chopper driver
the stepper motor chopper driver is a bipolar stepper 
          motor drive with easily adjustable current control up to 2a, based othe 
          sgs-thompson l297 and l298 stepper motor controller and driver ic’s.  
        
stepper motors are rated by current and and not by 
          voltage.  a chopper driver because it is  switching on and 
          off current allows a set current to be fed to the coils and not be dependent 
          on the voltage of the power supply.  the chopper driver also allows 
          for the use of higher voltage power supplies (up to 36v) to overcome 
          the effects of the inductance of the coils giving better performance 
          and a higher top speed.
features include:

easily adjustable motor current (0.a to 2a)
full and half stepping mode
step and direction inputs
synchroniseable when using multiple drivers
enable input can be connected to ground to disable motor
connections via screw terminals


available now!
23rd of july 2007
we will be closing shortly on the 1st of august for 
          two weeks, until the 15th of august 2007.

i've deleted the new forums and reverted back to the 
          old one - this was due to complications in trying to set up tough anti-spam 
          filters, which stopped anyone from posting on the boards. i apologize 
          for any inconvinience caused,

25th january 2007
introducing new diy kit 187 "bipolar chopper 
          stepper motor driver kit"
description: 
 our new bipolar chopper drive allows you to get 
          better performance from your stepper motor.
          it uses a dual full bridge motor driver based on sgs thompson chips 
          l297 & l298. motor current for each phase is set using an on-board 
          potentiometer and the controller is capable of 
          handling motor winding currents of up to 2 amps per phase. 
          it operates from a dc supply voltage of 9-36v. the drive provides all 
          basic motor controls, including full or half stepping of bipolar steppers 
          and direction control. works with our range of large bipolar stepper 
          motors mo-101, mo-102 and mo-103
          all signals (step, direction, enable) can be interfaced to external 
          logic or a microcontroller. you can easily control the motor from your 
          computer's parallel port or our serial stepper controller card! 
          this controller is perfect for desktop cnc applications. 

          finished dimensions (mm): 88wx105lx35h

available soon!

to all our customers,

          there are some rumours getting around that diy electronics (hk) ltd 
          has been sold or taken over. this is not true. 
          it is still owned and operated by ladda, the wife of the deceased founder 
          peter crowcroft. also, there are no intentions to sell the business 
          either.

8th of january 2007
we at kitsrus would like to wish everyone a prosperous 
          new year! and we are back in hong kong and everything is running smoothly.

just a bit of clarification - we have received some 
          emails about the "small order via paypal" topic. i would like to clarify 
          that we are not selling kits directly to customers, but rather, we are 
          selling small components, resistors, ics, etc etc for people who want 
          them - not full scale completed kits that we sell to distributors. we 
          apologize for any confusion this might have caused. edit: we will put 
          up a page on the website soon relating to excess and stock components 
          that we wish to sell.
