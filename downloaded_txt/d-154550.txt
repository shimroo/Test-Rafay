the impact of a ut tyler education



ut tyler feels like a small school in that almost every professor i’ve had has been
                              genuinely interested in helping me to succeed not only in their classroom but in my
                              career as well.

a big part of being at ut tyler is getting exposure to fantastic instructors and teachers.
                              a lot of times, college is about figuring things out, but you will never have to do
                              that alone at ut tyler.

i am beyond grateful to my professors for ensuring that students had every resource
                              to be successful. professor aws al-shalash was always encouraging and pushing me to
                              new levels.

my career counselor for the mba program helped me every step of the way and provided
                              great advice for completing the curriculum according to my schedule.
