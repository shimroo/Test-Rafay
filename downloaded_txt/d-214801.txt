keeping families close®
ronald mcdonald house charities® of the philadelphia region supports families on their children’s medical journey with a community of comfort and hope. our programs include two ronald mcdonald houses in west and north philadelphia, three ronald mcdonald family rooms at local hospitals, ronald mcdonald camp, and a ronald mcdonald care mobile, operated in partnership with st. christopher’s foundation for children.
what does a community of comfort and hope mean to us?
at the core of our mission, comfort and hope means that every family we serve, and every staff member, volunteer, and supporter who is part of our community feels respected, cared for, and trusted. the individuals who make up our community represent rich cultural and ethnic backgrounds from around the world and this diversity helps make us stronger. we continuously learn from each other while sharing meaningful experiences every single day.
