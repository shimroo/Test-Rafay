if it's possible to love a septic company, i do.  the night before thanksgiving we had a major problem.  casey and adam showed up and dug way past dark and worked until they solved our problem and emptied the tank as well.  kind, thoughtful, interesting guys who know their stuff and do great work.  it really doesn't get much better.

i asked the company to check if the septic tank of my house need to be pump out. when they came and checked it, the tech told us that the house does not have septic tank, but the sewage attach to city sewage system. their service is good and quick.
