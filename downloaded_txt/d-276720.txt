who we are


craig peterson,founder
since the late 1980s we've been the premier source of information about radar detectors and speed enforcement technology. our staff has conducted more tests of radarâ detectors and laser countermeasures than any group in the world.
the leader of our pack is craig peterson, perhaps best known asâ the author of two books and hundreds of magazine stories onâ these subjects. he's an iptm-certified police radar instructor and a nationally-recognized expert on radar, lasers and radar detectors. no surprise that radartest.com isn't the typical web sales site: we testâ every product we sell.
