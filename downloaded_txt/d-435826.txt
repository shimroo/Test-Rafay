art brut celebrate 15 years of their critically acclaimed debut album bang bang rock and roll.

			the hit album which featured the tracks emily kane, formed a band and my little brother will be performed live in all its glory by the british/german punk rock quartet in berlin and hamburg this coming april.

"15 years old! bang bang rock and roll is now as old as i was when i met emily kane! it is a teenager! if it was a person it would be drinking cider down the park and trying to sneak in to bed without its parents realising that it is drunk! this is definitely something to celebrate. so come and wish bang bang rock and roll a happy 15th birthday with us"
