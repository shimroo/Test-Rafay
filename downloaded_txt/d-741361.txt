he was active in linuxfocus for many years and was a very reliable translator.
our sympathy goes to friends and family.


goodbye guido


              2005-08-20
            

 after many years of very interesting work with linuxfocus i (guido socher) will 
 leave the project. it is difficult step because linuxfocus was once my passion and hobby,
so there are a lot of feelings involved, but i can't do it forever.


i will move on to http://tuxgraphics.org.
the recently started series on microcontroller programming will
continue at tuxgraphics.org.


there are a number of people who are willing to continue linuxfocus. write
to new(at)linuxfocus.org if you want to join them. they need both people
and hardware.


during the transition linuxfocus will stay online. to avoid that the existing 
site becomes unavailable while possible restructuring is ongoing the new
team will settle first at new.linuxfocus.org
.
linuxfocus has 12964 files therefore this seems the best solution.


i wish the new team good luck and a problem free start

regards 
guido socher
