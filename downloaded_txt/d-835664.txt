jeff has bionic ears, he hears things in a mix that i didn't know were there. he has not only elevated all of my mixes to new heights but he also has made some very needed suggestions along the way that has made my album really standout and shine. i've worked with many masterers throughout my 20 year career from la to new york and jeff by far is the best. and he cares.
