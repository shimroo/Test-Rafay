environmental


since poly-america was founded in 1976, recycling and environmental stewardship have played major roles in our products, operations, and philosophy.
all of our state-of-the-art facilities feature equipment, procedures and training that exceed environmental and safety regulations. our plants have received numerous awards in recognition of our water and air discharge programs.
additionally, poly-america is an active member of operation cleansweep, which is committed to preventing ecological damage that can result from plastic resin discharge into the environment. indeed, we have taken the lead in voluntarily implementing training and accountability for spill prevention, containment, and cleanup.
since the mid-1980s, poly-america has ranked as one of the largest recyclers of polyethylene in the world. our infrastructure as a plastic recycler has contributed to the success of numerous local, regional, and national recycling efforts.
products & packaging
for more than 30 years, poly-america has been recycling plastic and incorporating reprocessed material into a number of the film products we produce. one hundred percent of the scrap generated during our manufacturing process is incorporated back into film products. we also purchase polyethylene scrap for use in a number of our products. several of the products we produce, including t-shirt carry-out bags, are made with post-industrial recycled material.
our clear and blue trash bags are used in many municipalities' recycling programs to help identify recyclable waste.
the corrugated boxes that package our products are 100% recyclable and are comprised of a minimum of 35% post-consumer recycled content.
facilities
in 2010, we replaced all of the metal halide lighting in our manufacturing plants with energy-saving fluorescent lighting. the fluorescent fixtures use as few as 190 watts compared to the 450 watts used by metal halide fixtures. over the past several years, we have systematically upgraded the electric motors that run our manufacturing equipment to reduced energy consumption units. additionally, we have tracking systems in place at all of our facilities for the recyclable materials used in our processes to measure the success of our waste diversion programs.
goals
at poly-america, we are constantly seeking to become a more efficient and sustainable company. by integrating sustainability into our business, we can improve our products and processes to create a more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective footprint for the future. we strive to minimize waste in packaging, manufacturing, energy and transportation. from new product development to routine review of existing products and processes, we seek sustainable solutions.
