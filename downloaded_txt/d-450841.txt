so.... the guy at blowout video asked me out. =(and i said. ok. but see, hes like, probably late 20's or early 30's. sorry but thats a little too old for me... he asked me if i liked coffee. when he said that, i was thinking "oh crap. hes going to ask me out. i should say no." so i did. but i still agreed and gave him my number. =( i called michelle and told her, and sha said that i should have said i had a girlfriend. because that would have been hilarious.im working on a poster for my drama class and i have to find pictures... kinda hard... why does this episode of thats so raven make me sad? its the one about racisim. um..... it got really foggy tonight. and hopefully ill be detting drunk off my ass soon. yay for michelle!:: share :: flag :: 2 replies :: reply

music: the radio.

mood: content  
let me say that louis xiv was amazing!!!ok... so we were walking to the stage, and we walked by this really hot guy. i saw to my friends, "that guy is really hot. i like the way he dresses." then i turn to my friends and ask whos the biggest louis fan. to see if they know what they look like. well, (this is crazy!!!) when the show started... guess who the hot guy that we passed and walked by was... he was in the band!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omg!!!!!!!!! and when we were driving to del mar, there was this, again, hot guy in a car next to us. well, when the roadie or something was testing to guitars and stuff, i was like, "thats the guy from the car!!!" hahahaha. it was cool. i have to get my hair cut soon if i ever plan to go to another show. i got my hair pulled so many times! and it really hurt :( there were so many smelly sweaty guys. ew. louis xiv is not really a mosh type of band, but there was... haha. i was jumping around and by the end of it, i was so sweaty and smelly. : / hehe. i got up really close to the front. me and angelique were connected at the arms so we wouldnt lose eachother. there was this crazy asina girl who was just... crazy! i was pushing people, and i almost fell. and died. haha no. jk. ^-^  it felt like sardines in a can it was so packed in the front. i hate it when guys bring their girlfriends and put them in front of them. its really annoying because youre trying to get up front and well, they wont move out of the way!! stephanie said that the bassist winked at her. i dont believe her... he could have winked at anyone who was near her..... lol. but, the guy who was playning the keyboard and sings too was looking at me. :) seriously! not kidding! ok. here are pics. they arent very good cuz my camrea sucks. but there are ok ones... then more about after!!!( louis xiv pictures!!!!!!!!!collapse )then we were just hanging around michelles house. oh, well we got jack in the box and ate it at michelles because her parents wanted to say bye to angelique. i guess this was the last time our 'group' (consisting of about 4-5 of us) would all be together until xmas... then chavon was driving me home to get my stuff,and we were at a stoplight, and we saw this gorgeous guy at the bus stop. we said 'hey, youre cute!' he said thanks and giggled. hehe. we were gonna go back and see if he needed a ride. (yes, we are that crazy...) when we got back, he wasnt there. :( oh well. but he was really cute. then back at michelles, we nair'd my legs, haha. and michelle painted my nails and tonails. then we went to sleep. [this is where i need to vent] this morning we were all waking up and stuff. i really hate it when my friends make fun of me. i seriously hate it. theyre supposed to be my best friends. chavon was doing it too. she does that whenever shes around michelle and stephanie. they do it too... arg!!!!!!!! lsdukhfy ieuhrfai;hs da!!!!!!!!!!!!! fuck all you guys!!! i hate you!!!!! ok, not really. just when youre like that. heres another picture...( at michelles housecollapse )i have no place to write personal stuff. i have 2 ljs, one for everyone, then another for private stuff. then i have a xanga cuz i dont know people on there, but now i do, so i cant say really personal stuff. then i have a blog, but my cousin reads that. so.... i dont know what to do....... i hate this too... grrr!!!!!!!anyway... i love this new show on vh1. gene simmons rock school. i know its a total rip off of school of rock, but i saw the first episode today, and i love it! that and trailer fabulous. omg! i <333333333 johnny hardstey!!! he is gorgeous!!! ah! ok. i think thats all now. i might have more pics that my friends took later. :)oh, when we were leaving this guy came up to us and wanted to know if anyone had a lighter cuz his friend was drunk and he needed a ciggarette, so michelle gave him matches and wanted then back. so when he came back, he was like "me and my friend are going to go have a drink and mabye dance. i wanted to know if you guys wanted to come." michelle was like "how old are you? [he answered] "how old are we?" [we answered] "were really underage." it was really funny. he was like, oh. and then he said have a good night. we drove off and chavon was like "youre hot!!!" and he was really ugly. haha. we were all singing to the darkness. i had so much fun last night...... :):: share :: flag :: reply
