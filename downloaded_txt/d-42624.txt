beautiful morning







yesterday i woke up for breakfast and saw this outside of my front door.  it was a pretty cool way to start the day.  did a chest workout by myself early afternoon.  pretty simple, just flat bench, reverse-grip bench, incline db flys and weighted dips.  a few hours later i went back to the gym with christian just to work on some lifting technique for crossfit.  we're calling them skill development days.  we worked on different ways of doing weighted pull-ups, dumbell and kettlebell cleans/snatches, and more handstand push-ups, including handstand walks.  nothing crazy, but all that practice helps a lot when it comes time for the actual crossfit workouts.

the bear







 
this wasn't a workout for time, but for max weight.  with each round you are supposed to increase the weight so that your last round is about as heavy as you can manage.  these lifts in order, seven times: power clean, front squat, push press, back squat, push press.  then up the weight again for 4 more rounds.  during a round, you are allowed to rest anytime you want as long as the bar isn't on the ground.  so you basically rest while you're holding the weight somehow.  here's how i did:
round 1: 65lbsround 2: 75lbsround 3: 95lbsround 4: 115lbsround 5: 125lbs -only completed 5 of 7 sets before failure  on this one :(
unfortunately, the good people at youtube, cut the sound out of my video for some copyright reasons, but it should have been "dani california - red hot chili peppers", and "final countdown - europe".  so enjoy the video with no music!

my tummy hurts.







this crossfit workout simultaneously smoked my core, while reminding me that my core is weak and pathetic.  my core bowed down to this workout as its superior.  basically, it was bad.  it was me, jason, matt and christian.

my first crossfit video...sort of.








this is only half of the total workout from he last post.  the video only shows the handstand push-ups.  every time one of us left the room, we went to complete a set of pull-ups.  there's a video from tonights workout that i'll try to post tomorrow that shows a whole workout with power cleans, push-ups and squats!

the proof is in the pudding







the standard 1mi. warm-up run in(10:00) that i've started doing every time.

crossfit wod, for time:
30 handstand push-ups
10 pull-ups
20 handstand push-up
20 pull-ups
10 handstand push-ups
30 pull-ups
time:10:11, vf:1

tricep workout:
weighted pull-ups: 12/45, 10/70, 8/90, 10/70
skullcrushers: 15/55, 15/55, 15/55, 15/55
overhead tri ext: 15/40, 12/50, 10/60, 10/50

we had the whole gang together for today's workout.  we knew this one would be awful, considering how hard the handstand push-ups(hspus) had been for us the first time we did them.  we had a much better experience this time around, but we also knew what to expect and approached it a little differently.  i smoked the hspus this time and finished first by about 4min., which i was excited about, since i haven't come in first in a while now!  after that, christian and i did our planned tricep workout, and jason worked back/choulders again.  we had christian's camera this time and took a bunch of funny photos during the workout:

scar tissue that i wish you saw...









jason and matt pretty much took the day off, but christian and i decided to make it a light day just to stay loose and work on "the situation" if you habla jersey shore, or just abs if not.  i don't have much of a situation as yet though.  turned out to be a good idea because we've been pretty tender the past few days, especially in the upper-body region...like, all of it! 
 




stationary bike: 10mi. in 30min.ghd sit-ups: 15, 15, 15, 15
kb side raises: 15/60, 15/60, 15/60, 15/60
roman chair leg raises: 15, 15, 15, 15

we finished up with 20min. of stretching and practiced some different techniques for the handstand push-ups we'll be doing with tomorrows workout.  hopefully it'll pay off.fyi, the post title is from red hot chili peppers-scar tissue
