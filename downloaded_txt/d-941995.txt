introduction to the naskapi nation of kawawachikamach
we, the naskapi people have occupied the land of what is now northern quebec and labrador since time immemorial. our ancestors were nomads, living off the land and following the caribou herds on which they depended for resources. in the 1950s, our way of life changed when most of the naskapi people moved from fort chimo to the schefferville region. the move to our actual location of kawawachikamach took place in the early 1980s. 
the naskapi band of québec was created in 1984 by the naskapi act, making us and cree communities the first self-governing bands in canada. our name changed to the naskapi nation of kawawachikamach in 1999. the naskapi nation of kawawachikamach has the mandate, through its council and employees, to govern, manage, offer services to its members and promote development while preserving a unique culture and language. our history is an important part of our identity and we must continually work on preserving our culture by practicing it and ensuring that we pass it down to our future generations.
