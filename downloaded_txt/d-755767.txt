client reviews

 




 elegant images was fantastic! they take amazing pictures. it has been difficult to choose which ones to frame, because there are so many great shots! i would recommend them to all couples looking for a wedding photographer. christina & scottto have these two photograph your wedding will help make your day more relaxed and enjoyable. their work is amazing and with the two of them they captured every special moment that i wanted photographed! -melissa & johnhiring ross and kammi is probably one of the best decisions we have ever made regarding our wedding planning! our pictures are gorgeous even our family and friends all agree that their work is one of the best they have seen.

it was such a pleasure to work with them. love their laidback attitude and the way they handle their business. their customer service is so personal that once you meet them you know you are in good hands. -mic & justinross and kammi were awesome! i had innumerable compliments on how beautiful our wedding photos were, and kaidan and i are both incredibly pleased with our album. ross and kammi did an excellent job of learning our personalities and following what was important to us in photographing our wedding and our family portrait. they even got to know our dog so she could be in the photos. our guests at the wedding came away commenting on how fun and professional our photographers were.

i would highly recommend them to anyone who wants their wedding photos to be something to be treasured for the rest of their lives.
