when st. ignatius and his followers founded the first jesuit schools almost 500 years ago, they challenged the prevailing norms that offered a top-tier education only to those who could afford it. instead, the society of jesus mandated that jesuit institutions be open to all qualified students, regardless of socio-economic circumstances.
as a 501(c)3 nonprofit which receives no diocesan funds, brophy depends on fundraising to support the school’s annual financial aid expenditure — almost $6 million in 2021-22, and to grow the endowment to ensure future financial aid needs can be met.
