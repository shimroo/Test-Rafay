reviews for serenade:a balanchine story

 










"in this beautiful, affecting book . . . an unabashed, heartfelt love  letter to balanchine . . . â bentley, a poetic writer, eloquently  captures the essence of serenade . . . [which] sheâ describes as a map  of balanchine's soul . . . she dissects this 32-minute ballet in  precise, unflinching detail, interweaving reminiscences of her time at  the school of americanâ ballet, which she attended from the age of 10,  and life inside the new york city ballet . . . this moving â book will  not only appeal to lovers of ballet, it will make wistful readingâ for  those dancers who will never have the good fortune to work with such a  genius as george balanchine."â

"bentley, who danced under balanchine's direction at the new york city  ballet for a decade in the 1970s and 80s, tells a history that is as  vivid and poetic as the dance itself . . . serenadeâ is about more  than the making of a single ballet; it is an introspective nod to the  life lessons taught through movement . . . i felt the spirit of the  movements throughâ bentley's descriptive prose. she weaves in impressive  detail about the actual technique of ballet, articulating the dancer's  physical experience for the reader . . . readingâ bentley'sâ serenadeâ made  me feel as alive as i felt on the stage the moment that i fell in love  with ballet: with its grounded fantasy, physical demands, intellectual  challenge,â structure and beauty . . .â serenadeâ is a book that  will delight balletomanes for generations to come; but it will also  appeal to those newer to the dance world, with its delicateâ balance of  personal memoir, rarefied elegance, history of the arts and pure human  interest."

"taking its title [serenade] from that of george balanchine's  first american ballet, which premiã¨red in 1934, this personalâ history by  a former new york city ballet dancer blends various accounts of the  work'sâand the company'sâcreation and evolution. in addition  toâ providing a wealth of ballet lore, trivia, and insightful  interpretation, bentley is not afraid to get technical; she describes  steps, combinations,â entrances, and exits from the perspective of the  corps. in endeavoring to conjure the transcendent lyricism of  balanchine's vision and tchaikovsky'sâ score, the book goes further,  touching on deeper, stranger ideas about the symbiosis between life and  art."

"at 8:04, everything is secure, in place. it’s all i’ve got, all i can control. once the ballet begins, who knows? the variables are endlessâthe tempos, the new girl, a blown light in the fourth wing, a slip. a slip that could end in tearful embarrassment, or end your career completely with a torn achilles tendon, or a chipped hip bone. we were dancing on the edge before we knew what it was. but we knew where it was. and so i learned early on that everything, anything, that is beautiful is perched on a precipice. mr. b just placed us there, and it was trust in him that gave us balance."

"i was mourning my capacity to read in the way that i did when i was teenager, when i would devour books like food. when i was a ballet dancer i would walk to lincoln center with a book in front of me and read. i wondered if i could get that back. the pandemic provided a perfect opportunity to try. i set time aside every day to read. then it was question of what i would read. i never had read edith wharton . . . “

"written from the heart as much as the head...serenade:â a balanchine story,  [bentley's] brilliant new book-length meditation on balanchine's  greatest ballet . . . is ultimately farâ more interesting than just  another cultural history: with her rare combination of access to  balanchine and her genuine literary ability . . . she writes with grace  and gratitude . . .â it's [her] personal voice that makes this book  consistently engaging, and her enthusiasm is catching . . . bentley is no  longer a young girl, but her love for balanchine hasâ remained true, and  with this splendid account, she has honored an incomparable artistic  romance."

"beautifully composed [serenade] provides a three-dimensional  experience of balanchine's titular ballet: historical, artistic and  personal. between chapters narrated inâ the first personâputting readers  onstage within the ballet's split-second timing and exact  positioningâbentley provides fascinating background onâ balanchine . . . as in all her books, she gives generously of her finely tuned emotions, her experience and her own polished opinions.â in short,â serenade: a balanchine storyâ has earned a place on the shelf." â

"as a thin, athletic girl with a springy jump and “not-so-great feet,” toni bentley was 11 when she entered the school of american ballet; she was invited into the new york city ballet company by george balanchine at 17, and she performed with them for 10 years, until a hip injury cut her career short. with her prolonged devotion to balanchine as the backdrop, it is their shared passion for the art form that drives the plot of her new book, serenade." â

"serenade is bentley’s sixth book, and her fourth dealing with the new york city ballet. she started writing it in 2007, and originally intended it to be about balanchine and his !rst american work, serenade. but between that time and its release this spring, it grew into what it is today: part memoir, part history, and part love letterâto balanchine, to serenade, and to a life given to ballet." â

"serenadeâ is toni bentley's intelligent, expansive, and beautiful exploration of george balanchine's signature ballet...toni's ability to convey what it was like to work with him is part of the joy of readingâ serenade. she takes us deep into his personal history, and his spiritual connection with tchaikovsky....aâ writer of exquisite sensitivity and talent, toni's latest contribution gives breadth and depth toâ serenadeâ as a ballet of great significance."

“toni bentley’s serenade is in a category all its ownâat once an ode to the rigor and passion necessary to create great art and a pointillist description of its making. it is also the story of the embracing yet exacting balanchine lending his genius to a young woman’s life. it will consume anyone interested in the generative force that comes from the devoted pursuit of a vocation; you needn’t know the difference between a tendu and an arabesque, a prima ballerina and a member of the corps, to be captured by its poetic prose and ingenious structure. this is a transporting reading experience, written with fervor and discernment, and a moving testament to the possibilities that lie within each of us.”
- daphne merkin, literary critic, memoirist, and novelist

"bentley writes as she once danced, with grace and elegance, asâ she captures the haunting beauty of an art form that exists to beâ seen and experienced . . . [she] saves her effusive descriptions forâ the dance, for her very personal experiences in the 10 years sheâ spent with the company (from the mid-1970s to the '80s), and forâ the brilliance of balanchine . . . a touching tribute to a master, thisâ work will delight balletomanes."
