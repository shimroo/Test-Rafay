a life beyond fearthursday, september 117:00 - 8:30pmwith gen-la kelsang dekyong, spiritual director of the new kadampa traditionthe town hall123 w 43rd stnew york, ny 10036in times as stressful and uncertain as the ones we seem to be experiencing more and more often, we may ask, is a life beyond fear even possible?in truth, fear arises from our mind, not from our environment. the fear and the anxiety that so many experience is not inevitable. if we come to recognize their underlying sources, we can learn to change our relationship to them.through the practice of meditation, we can learn to work skillfully with our fear. instead of allowing it to overwhelm us, we learn to redirect it, so that it moves us towards developing those states of mind that naturally give rise to peace, confidence and a strong sense of purpose.based on her nearly 40 years of experience of meditation, buddhist nun gen-la kelsang dekyong, senior disciple of the great buddhist teacher, venerable geshe kelsang gyatso rinpoche and spiritual director of the new kadampa tradition, will guide us into recognizing our potential for a meaningful and joyful life truly beyond fear.
