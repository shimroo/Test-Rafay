about the department
the study of antiquity is full of surprises. we constantly learn new things about the ancient greek, hellenistic, and roman worlds, and their interactions with multiple other cultures. our work is inherently interdisciplinary: we use historical, linguistic, literary and archaeological methods to understand ancient societies in their entirety.
