it was the texture 

sarah: why did we come into the mall?
sean: because we hate people?
steve: hating people burns a lot of calories. look at hitler, he wasn’t overweight. 
sean: wasn’t he a vegetarian though?
steve: that may have had something to do with it.
sean: i wonder why he didn’t eat meat. it certainly wasn’t for moral reasons.

cuddle hamster monsters 

(the rat pee talk continues)
jen: seriously tho, rats do that. remember to wash your hands the next time you cuddle a hamster.
sean: i will remember that, next time i cuddle a hamster. which will be never.
i hope
jen: i used to cuddle our hamster. but i always washed my hands.
sean: or wore mittens
jen: no, because then you have to wash the mittens
sometimes it is just better to get the pee all over your hands.
sean: you’re right, that’s a pain. and then they’d be all faded when they’re pinned to your jacket
jen: no, hamsters don’t enjoy being pinned to a jacket
sean: “now jen, don’t forget your hamster for show and tell.” *pinned*
jen: it’s nicer to tie two hamsters to a long string and then feed them through the sleeves of your jacket

don’t pee in the gatoroid 

(discussing debbie gibson and tiffany starring in a new movie called “mega python vs. gatoroid.”)
sean: the title is dangerously close to getting me excited about buying some electrolytes tho
jen: wouldn’t a gatoroid be a smaller version of a gator?
like a meteoroid?
sean: good question
jen: or a metroid?
sean: it could also be a gator on steroids
or a gator/android
or a gator who drank too much gatorade
jen: i dunno about the steroids
a gator who has to pee like, all the time
“i had the flu last week and now i can’t stop peeing, chomp chomp”
sean: “it makes me so angry i could stomp on this stupid town. also, i hope my human enemies don’t use this trail of pee to track me.”
jen: i find it interesting that you interpret gators as rodents in this scenario, peeing in trails all over the place
sean: everything pees, not just rodents. but yes, my closest gator association is the batman villain who lived in the sewers. so, close enough
jen: i know everything pees, but rodents pee all the time to mark their way around
i mean, do you pee all the time so you can find your way back to your burrow?
sean: no, i have gps for that
jen: hahaha
p.s.
global peeing system

torrell: marine 2.
jen: who’s in it?
torrell: i don’t know. you might recognize him, though. he looks like the kind of action-type actor that white people would like.
(after careful consideration of the main character.)
jen: nope, sorry. i don’t recognize that guy. he must not have been at the last white peoples’ meeting.
torrell: you’re talking about the klan, right?
