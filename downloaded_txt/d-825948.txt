here's the car that started it all for me, my 1958 edsel citation convertible. ford's infamous flop almost sunk the company, but today edsels are proudly owned by collectors like myself. you can watch a quicktime clip of the oldest existing video tape recorded in 1957 at cbs television city, "the edsel show" starring bing crosby, frank sinatra, rosemary clooney, and louis armstrong.

this 1959 olds ninety eight holiday sportsedan is an unrestored original with only 6,800 miles on the odometer. loaded with working options, it looks new, drives new, and still smells new! finding an unmolested beauty like this is a collector's dream.

ford motor company made a valiant effort to outdo arch rival cadillac in every way in 1958. the luxurious continental mark iii was longer, lower, wider, more powerful with daring new styling. i found a mint low mileage unrestored original convertible.

as if the gargantuan '58 continental convertible above wasn't enough to overfill my garage, this "little old lady from san bernardino" autumn rose coupe found its way to my collection through an ad in the local penny saver.

the 1959 continental mark iv is modestly changed from the '58 mark iii. the controversial canted headlamp design and the dramatically sculptured front fenders were modified as well as the rear panel and tail lights. i was lucky to recently acquire a 40,000 mile coupe in beautiful unrestored condition.

the 1958 pontiac bonneville was one of the flashiest cars of the 1950's. with chrome dripping from every nook and cranny and "three deuces" under the hood, the sport coupe offered high style to the up-and-coming "sportsters" of the late 50's. lots of details and photos of my bonneville and even a quicktime movie of the incredible tv commercial "the gm five for 1958."

the oldsmobile toronado is one of the proudest creations of famed gm stylist bill mitchell. my 1967 toro deluxe is one of the nicest originals around. with only 17,000 original miles, this beauty is unrestored and doesn't need to be. this was a very lucky find.

i purchased this 1957 bmw isetta in 2019 from
															the 92 year old man who bought it new in 1957.
the isetta saved bmw from financial ruin in the 1950's when the company was nearly bankrupt. the little
															1 cylinder, 13hp coupe was a huge success.

volkswagen's campmobiles were the predecessors to today's rv's, minus the frills. my 1967 model so-44 is a one-a-kind. not only was the deluxe so-44 campmobile not available in the u.s. market, this one was custom equipped to accomodate the original owner's wishes at the westfalia factory in germany. my so-44 has only 48,000 original miles and is in excellent unrestored condition.
