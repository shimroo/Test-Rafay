<p></p>
<p>first up, eb and mike are joined by kevin and jonathan, the coaster radio correspondents from ohio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>kings island just unveiled plans for <a href="https://www.visitkingsisland.com/banshee"><b>their new 2014 attraction</b></a>!  it will be named "banshee" and it will be the world's longest inverted roller coaster.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>there were many things to see there... some amazingly cool and others amazingly strange.</p>
<p></p>

<p>we were watching "jurassic park" on tv the other night and laughing at the part of the movie where paleontologist dr. grant has just seen the dinosaurs. he says,</p>
<p><i><br /></i> <i>"i think we're out of a job."</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>and ian malcolm (played by the totally awesome jeff goldblum) says,</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>"don't you mean extinct?"</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>so many of the things we do here at coasterradio.com are inspired by pop culture and this week's show is no different.</p>
<p></p>
<p>this week, we ask the audience to pick one type of ride that they would like to see leave the face of the earth.  we're not looking for specific rides... only ride types.  some of the answers (especially from e.b.) are shocking!</p>
<p></p>
<p>we also have a live trip report from magic joe!  joe is normally part of the window to the magic podcast, but this week, he brought his binaural audio gear to california's great america to record an audio treat for our ears on their new coaster "gold striker." you'll feel like you're on the ride with him!</p>
<p></p>
<p>the show then goes live to orlando, florida to talk with mike's wife molly.  she's down in the theme park capital of the world visiting mike and colleen (who have been featured on the show several times.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>they'll talk about the latest testing going on with mymagic+ and some of the strange rumors floating around the walt disney world resort!</p>
<p></p>
<p>and, don't forget to take our <b><a href="http://survey.coasterradio.com/">listener survey</a></b>! we're working on season eight of coasterradio.com and want to hear from you guys about how the show is doing!</p>

<p>eb is still on his massive three week road trip with his family.  so, that leaves mike without anyone to co-host this week's show.</p>
<p></p>
<p>it's up to you guys to bail him out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>during this week's "first drop" segment, mike turns to the coaster radio audience for their opinions on a new rumor out of universal orlando.</p>
<p></p>
<p>listeners from all over the world chime in with their opinion and commentary as they become "virtual co-hosts" with mike.</p>
<p></p>
<p>and, since no proper episode of coasterradio.com would be complete without an appearance from e.b., we dig deep into the show's archives and play a long-lost, never-aired segment where the guys discuss "dual-coast rides" that can be found at both walt disney world and disneyland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>for instance, you can ride the "jungle cruise" in both orlando and anaheim... but is one ride better than the other?</p>
<p></p>

<p>during this week's "first drop" segment, mike turns to the coaster radio audience for their opinions on a new rumor out of universal orlando.</p>
<p></p>
<p>listeners from all over the world chime in with their opinion and commentary as they become "virtual co-hosts" with mike.</p>
<p></p>
<p>and, since no proper episode of coasterradio.com would be complete without an appearance from e.b., we dig deep into the show's archives and play a long-lost, never-aired segment where the guys discuss "dual-coast rides" that can be found at both walt disney world and disneyland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>for instance, you can ride the "jungle cruise" in both orlando and anaheim... but is one ride better than the other?</p>

<p>as summer 2013 rolls along, there's a lot to get excited about! (and we talk about a lot of it on this week's show!)</p>
<p></p>
<p>for instance, <a href="http://seaworldparks.com/en/buschgardens-tampa"><b>busch gardens tampa</b></a> just unveiled plans for their new 2014 attraction... it's a 335-feet tall drop tower named <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ukosogphs"><b>"falcon's fury."</b></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>the new ride will drop riders at 60-mph, but with a new twist.  the riders' seats will pivot 90 degrees so that they are facing straight down! insane!</p>
<p></p>
<p>we'll also take a look at the new fast-food area themed to the long running animated series <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/the-simpsons-theme-park-at-universal-studios-is-the-coolest"><b>"the simpsons"</b></a> that just opened at universal studios florida.  will it be worth the price of admission to visit moe's tavern to have a pint of duff beer?</p>
<p></p>
<p>we also have live trip reports from the newly refurbished <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkdsyniqic"><b>timber mountain log ride</b></a> at <a href="https://www.knotts.com/"><b>knotts berry farm</b></a> and the crazy new roller coaster at <a href="http://www.altontowers.com/"><b>alton towers</b></a>,<b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlip9t7kuh0">"the smiler."</a></b>  the english ride has 14-inversions! insane!</p>
<p></p>
<p>finally, we talk with steve vandis from indigo films.  he's the co-executive producer for the popular travel channel show <a href="http://www.travelchannel.com/interests/family/articles/insane-coaster-wars-goes-international"><b>"insane coaster wars: world domination."</b></a></p>

<p>this week, disney's animal kingdom celebrated its 15th anniversary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>it's fair to say that of all the disney theme parks, animal kingdom has the greatest divide between people who like and dislike it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>some people claim it's the best designed, most well-themed park in the disney chain.  others feel that it's a complete miss and not worth spending one of their precious vacation days there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>on this week's show, the coasterradio.com audience steps forward to tell us about their favorite and least favorite aspects to the controversial park.  you'll be surprised at some of the responses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>we'll also talk about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151618409980539&set=a.160886830538.152877.73769440538&type=1&theater"><b>the strange new signs</b></a> appearing around the former "son of beast" area at kings island.  the signs warns that they've had to shut down a section of park because of "mysterious, bone chilling screams" and an "evil phenomenon."</p>
<p></p>
<p>of course, the park is gearing up to promote their 2014 attraction.  but what could it be and is the park making the most of this "paranormal pr?"</p>

<p>every now and then, a theme park attraction comes along that makes you remember why you liked this stuff in the first place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>and sometimes that same ride is so ahead of its time, you realize you've sort-of seen a glimpse into the future of the amusement industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>this week saw the unveiling of <a href="http://www.insidethemagic.net/2013/04/video-ride-through-mystic-manor-at-hong-kong-disneyland-taking-the-haunted-mansion-in-a-totally-new-high-tech-direction/"><b>"mystic manor" at hong kong disneyland</b></a>.  and for the most part, every disney fan is in agreement that it is one of the finest attractions ever created by imagineering.</p>
<p></p>
<p>on this week's show, we'll discuss the new attraction, what makes it special and why there are no <i>(at least announced)</i> plans to bring a copy of it to the us parks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>we'll also talk with steve fielding, the president of pantera entertainment about his highly-anticipated new game <a href="http://www.themeparkstudio.com/"><b>"theme park studio."</b></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>the new title will allow players to create their own steel coasters, wooden coasters, dark rides and flat rides with a level of authenticity and realism never before seen in a theme park simulator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>steve will tell us about some new surprises we can expect to see and how listeners can be a part of the development process!</p>
<p></p>
<p>plus, we'll have live trip reports from busch gardens tampa, disney california adventure and silver dollar city.... plus a whole lot more!</p>

<p>anyone who considers themselves a fan of theme parks probably has spent a lot of time analyzing them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>we marvel at how attraction designers use technology to bring the our favorite stories and characters to life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>but, fans can also take the analysis a step further and take a look at the parks from a literary and social angle as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>for instance, what does "it's a small world" have to do with the civil rights movement of the 1960's?</p>
<p></p>
<p>on this week's show, we welcome the author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937011240/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=utf8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeasin=1937011240&linkcode=as2&tag=coasterrcom-20"><b>the thinking fan's guide to walt disney world: magic kingdom</b></a>," aaron wallace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>while most travel guidebooks are aimed at first-timers, aaron's book is aimed someone looking to find  information beyond wait times and ride ratings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>aaron takes a scholarly look at each attraction in the magic kingdom and the stories behind them.  on this week's show, he'll share some of what you'll find in his new book.</p>
<p></p>
<p>we also have two live trip reports this week.... one from the opening day of <a href="http://www.sixflags.com/greatadventure/index.aspx"><b>six flags great adventure</b></a> and one from the opening day of <a href="http://www.lunaparknyc.com/"><b>luna park</b></a> on coney island.  both of these reports have an authentic "jersey" feel to them!</p>
<p></p>
<p>plus, mike just got back from a unique trip to walt disney world where he got to explore new fantasyland and try out the upgraded test track at epcot.  plus, he has some stories about chaperoning 30 high school students who were set loose on the walt disney world resort.</p>
<p></p>
<p>all this, plus a whole lot more on this all-new episode of the original theme park podcast!</p>

<p>here at the show, we're curious to find out what what the new <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-orders-big-thunder-mountain-416634"><b>abc television pilot "big thunder"</b></a> is all about.</p>
<p></p>
<p>in the past, there have been movies based on classic theme park attractions (pirates of the carribbean and the haunted mansion), but to our knowledge, this is the first television show based upon a theme park ride.</p>
<p></p>
<p>so while we wait for the show to premiere, we came up with a fun contest idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p>we asked listeners to pick any theme park attraction in the world and turn it into a television pilot of their own.</p>
<p></p>
<p>not surprisingly, the audience delivered some excellent and creative ideas! wait until you hear them!</p>
<p></p>
<p>mike and eb also get into a good "first drop" segment where they discuss the decline of the classic dark ride.</p>
<p></p>
<p>this year, only six dark rides are being built across the world and the majority are being constructed by disney and universal.  what happened to the dark ride and why aren't regional parks like six flags and cedar fair dedicating some capital to building new ones?</p>

<p>we'll talk with tyler currie, director of park operations for california's great america about the new ride and their big announcement.</p>


<p></p>


<p>we'll also discuss some rumors coming out of walt disney world in orlando.  word is leaking out about a possible re-imagining of the entire downtown disney complex.... complete with a new name, layout and a five-level parking garage.  interesting stuff... but maybe mike and eb have a better idea of what can be done with the area.</p>


<p></p>


<p>all this, plus a live trip report from kings island, the return of "off topic" and a visit from everyone's favorite dutch performance artist!</p>

<p>the best thing about this show are the people who listen to it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>they are all fun, passionate people who share a love of theme parks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>they are also one of the most engaged audiences out there.  when we have asked for listener interaction in the past, we always receive interesting and energetic responses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>that's why we love our yearly "listener question shows."</p>
<p></p>
<p>we received a ton of great questions this week.  actually, we received so many from you guys... we're breaking this show into two parts!</p>
<p></p>
<p>this week, we'll answer questions like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>* if you guys were still bachelors and had your pick of the girls of any of the countries in world showcase who would you choose?  (extra degree of difficulty:  no norway.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>* if you guys could punch one person in the theme park industry who would it be and why?</p>
<p></p>
<p>* what was the most embarrasing thing to happen to you in high school?</p>
<p></p>
<p>* was the disney podcast guy character based on anyone specifically?  and if so, who?</p>
<p></p>
<p>we'll also spend our "first drop" segment discussing the best attractions created during the career of disney imagineer tony baxter.  he announced his retirement last week, so we'll spend some time talking about his legacy and his classic disney rides.</p>
<p></p>
<p>plus, we'll have a live trip report from disney's animal kingdom and the return of the greatest amusement industry game show ever: theme park smarts!!!</p>

<p>week after week, we get a lot of interesting feedback from you guys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>one listener will write in and say that we need to focus on the regional parks more and less on what's happening at disney.</p>
<p></p>
<p>an hour later, we'll get an e-mail from someone wanting more talk about the disney parks and less about six flags and cedar fair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>it's impossible to come up with topics that please everyone, but this week we might have one that comes close.</p>
<p></p>
<p>on this week's show, mike and eb will take a look at things that the regional theme parks can "copy" or "outright steal" from disney to make the guest experience better for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>the audience steps in with their ideas, as we discuss ways our local parks can improve the family experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>we'll talk about ride capacity, front-of-the-line programs, food quality, attraction diversity and a bunch of other ideas that might make a trip to six flags a little more like a trip to disneyland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>plus, we'll have a live trip report from verbolten at busch gardens williamsburg and the return of "off-topic!"</p>

<p>with all due respect to other theme park companies, no one does this better than disney.</p>
<p>the story and immersive atmosphere of the "haunted mansion" attractions captivate guests around the world.</p>

<p>we'll talk to them about the creative process behind the film, what is was like to shoot at disneyland during normal park hours and how fans have reacted to what they created.</p>
<p>and speaking of creative things....</p>
<p>we'll talk about the mysterious creature that has been flying in the skies over the magic kingdom this week.  curious fans have been staying up late, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever has been flying over cinderella castle each night.</p>
<p>mike and eb will break down what information is out there and possibly get the official answer to what the creature could be.</p>

we've all been at the park and seen a parent or other adult forcing a kid onto a roller coaster or other intense thrill ride.
maybe the kid is just a bit scared... but other times the kid is shrieking in sheer terror.

<p>sometimes there are big stories in the amusement industry...</p>
<p>maybe a new roller coaster is announced or a new park is being built somewhere.</p>
<p>but sometimes there are stories that come along that entirely change the landscape of the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>one of those stories happened this week.</p>
<p>the walt disney company announced that it would be purchasing lucasfilm for $4.05 billion.</p>
<p>this includes all of the star wars properties, technical companies such as industrial light and magic, lucasarts, plus anything else that george lucas created over the last four decades.</p>
<p>disney also announced that fans can look forward to star wars: episodes 7, 8 and 9, with the next installment due in 2015. (nerds rejoice!!!)</p>
<p>but what does this all mean for the disney theme parks?</p>
<p>are we going to see new attractions and themed areas based on the hundreds of characters and locations in the star wars universe?  could we see more rides based on the adventures of indiana jones?</p>
<p>or, might be actually see an entire park based on all that george lucas and his team created?</p>
<p></p>
<p>the possibilities (and the conjecture) are unlimited!!!</p>

<p>all hallows eve is almost upon us....</p>
<p>this week, we have the perfect show to get you in the "spirit" of halloween.</p>
<p>mike and eb start this week's show with a bit of talk about whether or not walt disney world and disneyland should consider an "adult-oriented" halloween event at their parks.</p>
<p>universal studios has pretty much cornered the market in orlando and southern california... but could disney come up with something even better?</p>
<p>after that, mike reveals that he has spent $199.99 on a "seance school" and wants to attempt contacting one of his heroes who has passed on to the afterlife.  will he be successful?  and who is the spirit that he wants to contact?</p>
<p>finally, after a live trip report from busch gardens tampa, the guys sit around the fire pit with their marshmellows and s'mores to begin the 2012 halloween campfire show.</p>
<p>this is an annual tradition where the guys take actual back-stories from halloween haunts across the country and bring them to life on-the-air.  you'll want to darken the room, light some candles, grab some candy (and your headsets) to join in on the fun!!!</p>

<p>after the guys have a few minutes to process what happened, they discuss a story in the news about a man who died after partipating in a roach and worm eating contest.  the contest was very similar to what many parks do during their hallowen haunt events.  will this have any affect on what the parks do thoughout october?</p>

<p>mike also has a trip report from howl-o-scream at busch gardens williamsburg.  he also had a chance to talk with scott gasparich, the vice president of  entertainment for the park about what it takes to put on a massive halloween haunt like howl-o-scream.</p>

<p>what makes a roller coaster legendary?</p>
<p>there are probably a lot of good answers to that question.</p>
<p>but when a roller coaster is dismantled before it has a chance to grow old, odds are is going to be talked about and remembered for a long time.</p>
<p>on this week's show, we talk about kings island's son of beast... a ride that is scheduled to be dismantled to make way for something new.</p>
<p>the ride was groundbreaking, but troubled.</p>
<p>however, over the next few years will it become legendary?  will people remember it for being a better coaster than it actually was?</p>
<p>what other roller coasters shared a similar fate, but also went on garner "legendary" status?</p>
<p>we'll also hear from mike about his trip to busch gardens williamsburg.  he tried out their quick queue system and finally had a chance to ride mach tower!</p>
<p>plus, we'll have a live trip report from michigan's adventure plus a few surprise guests and drop-ins!</p>

<p>as theme park fans, we've all done marathons on our favorite rides when the lines aren't long.</p>
<p>maybe we've been lucky enough to stay on our favorite roller coaster for several laps in a row on a slow day at the park.</p>
<p>but most of us haven't had to endure staying on an amusement park ride for more than 24-hours in a row.</p>
<p>on this week's show, we'll talk to robbie gibson... he's better known as "robbie the intern" on <a href="http://edmonton.virginradio.ca/shows/morningshow.aspx" target="_blank"><b>104.9 virgin radio</b></a> in edmonton, canada.</p>
<p>last week, he set the guinness world record for the <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/2000/longest-ride-on-a-fair-groundtheme-park-attraction" target="_blank"><b>"longest marathon on a fairground/theme park attraction"</b></a> at 30 hours and 30 seconds!</p>
<p>we'll find out all about his record-setting attempt and what challenges he endured along the way.</p>
<p>plus, it's possible that robbie might have inspired one of the coasterradio.com guys to break the record in 2013!</p>
<p>we also go to the coasterradio.com voicemail line to hear from listeners about their encounters with rude guests at the parks.  from line jumpers to people who want to fist-fight... we'll cover it all!</p>
<p>and, we have a live trip report from six flags great america in chicago plus much, much more!</p>

<p>this week's episode is sort-of a sequel to last week's show.</p>
<p>and, in the tradition of <b>star wars</b>, we've given this episode a very special title.</p>
<p>last week, we got into a big discussion about the relationship between george lucas and the walt disney company.</p>
<p>we wondered why disney hasn't done whatever it needs to get mr. lucas to agree to building a gigantic (potter-defeating) land or park based on the star wars empire.</p>
<p>on this week's show, we asked the coasterradio.com audience to step up to the microphone and tell us what attractions they would like to see in a disnet-built star wars park.</p>
<p>we received a lot of good answers, but any one that mentions the awesomeness that is billy dee williams gets my vote.</p>
<p>we also have a rather vocal debate with the audience about the pros and cons on on-board audio on roller coasters.  mike and eb have very entrenched feelings about the subject, but will the coasterboys be able to change their minds?</p>
<p>we'll also hear about mike's trip to pennsylvania and his visit to knoebels! did the new "black diamond"dark ride-coaster hybrid live up to the hype (and history?)</p>
<p>plus, we have a live trip report from hershey park and their new rollercoaster "skyrush" and several surprise visits!</p>

<p><i>when you first look at it, it does sound a little bit strange... you know, an entire radio show dedicated to roller coasters and theme parks.  </i></p>
<p><i> but there are shows dedicated to all types of things, like sports.  people talk for hours and hours about sports... why not talk for hours and hours about theme parks?"</i></p>
<p>this is what i said on the very first episode of our show to explain what coasterradio.com set out to be.</p>
<p> we wanted to create a fun, accessible show about theme parks and thrill rides that was for the average fan... but could also be enjoyed by even the most hardcore enthusiast.</p>
<p>back in 2005, i don't think anyone (including us) expected the show to go past 20 episodes.</p>
<p>now, here we are seven years later celebrating the 200th!</p>
<p>on this week's show, we take a look back at favorite moments from the past 199 episodes and hear from each of the "joint chiefs" who were a part of the show back in 2005.  mario, flava and greg k. return to talk about their thoughts on this milestone.</p>
<p>also, since our listeners are the heart and soul of coasterradio.com... it's fitting that we celebrate by  having our annual "listener question show" this week.</p>
<p>as per tradition, the questions are all over the map!  some are about theme parks and thrill rides, others are about pop culture and some are about mike, eb and the podcast itself.</p>
<p>we also unveil some big news about the upcoming west coast trip and count down the days to the entry deadline for the <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2012/01/reel-design-contest-returns.html" target="_blank"><b>"reel" design contest!</b></a></p>

<p>there were some crazy stories in the press this week... and a lot of them had to do with theme parks.</p>
<p>for instance...</p>
<p>disney decided to drop a decades old rule that walt disney himself instated.  starting next month, workers will be allowed to sport beards and goatees. hipsters rejoice!</p>
<p>thorpe park in england said that their new coaster "the swarm" was apparently having some trouble making its height clearances during testing.  apparantly, some of the test mannequins came back without their limbs.</p>
<p>i like this story for a lot of reasons, but mostly because it gave the the opportunity to post a still from one of my favorite 80's movies ever - mannequin.  emmy was one hot egyptian, man.</p>
<p>the guys also take an opportunity to preview upcoming shows and contests!  you won't believe what is in store for february!</p>

<p>imagine if you had a chance to sit down and talk with walt disney when he started to brainstorm about an idea called "mickey mouse park."</p>
<p>what if you could go back to 1959 and have lunch with angus wynne jr. to hear his ideas about a park that would eventually become "six flags over texas."</p>
<p>building a theme park from scratch is no easy accomplishment.  it takes hard work, a solid business plan and most importantly... a vision.</p>
<p>on this week's show, we welcome a man with a unique vision of his own.</p>
<p>he wants to see a theme park built in his home town of nashville, tennessee.</p>
<p>this week, david webb joins us to talk about his plans for <b><a href="http://www.olesouthusa.com/" target="_blank">"ole south usa"</a></b>.</p>
<p>it would be a theme park celebrating everything that is vibrant and special about the southern region of the united states.</p>
<p>david gives us a "virtual tour" of the different themed lands, including descriptions of some of their innovative rides and attractions.  he also talks about the steps being taken to make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>most importantly, he fills us in on the <a href="http://www.olesouthusa.com/index.php/theme-park/funding-levels" target="_blank"><b>pioneer club</b></a>, which gives 3,500 people a chance to take part in the birth of this theme park.</p>
<p>we also have an update on the <b><a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2012/01/coasterradiocom-valentines-day-charity.html" target="_blank">valentine's day charity song auction</a></b> and we announce the first coasterradio.com listener meet-up of 2012.</p>

<p>the guys had planned on producing a regular show this week, but mike came down with a pretty bad case of the flu.</p>
<p>so, after some thought, they decided to enlist the help of clint novak from <a href="http://www.coastercrew.net/" target="_blank"><b>the coaster crew</b></a> and dig out an episode of the show that has never been heard on our podcast feed before!</p>
<p>let me explain....</p>
<p>back in 2007, after coaster radio 1.0 had gone off the air, mike, flava and mario formed a team to compete in the first ever "single riders marathon" at kennywood park.</p>
<p>now, the marathon had nothing to do with being single.  instead, it meant that each marathon rider would fill an empty seat on a coaster and complete as many laps as possible during the day.</p>
<p>people would then pledge a certain amount of money for every coaster lap counted.</p>
<p>as part of this event, flava , mario and mike produced an episode of "the coaster crew's guide to the midway" on-location at the park.</p>
<p>we thought this show was lost forever, but will holder was able to dig it up out of the archives this week!</p>
<p>so, since mike is sick, we decided to play this show for the first time ever on our podcast.</p>
<p>for all of you who have missed flava and mario... this one's for you.</p>

<p>happy halloween!</p>
<p>throughout the month of october, we've been getting in the <i><b>spirit</b></i> for the world's spookiest holiday by visiting the parks and other events to partake in their haunted mazes and attractions.</p>
<p>we've been stalked by demonic clowns and aggressive werewolves.  we've been chased by hungry zombies and thirsty vampires.  we've even had a few brushes with the paranormal... perhaps witnessing a ghostly apparition.</p>
<p>but now that the big day is here, everyone here at the original theme park podcast is ready to celebrate halloween in a new way.</p>
<p>this week, eb and mike start a new tradition on the show.  they tell creepy stories from some of the most popular and inventive haunted attractions in the united states.  these haunts use state-of-the-art technology to scare their guests, but more importantly, they also use engaging storylines to pull people into another world.</p>
<p>using some "radio magic," the guys will pull you into the stories as well.</p>

<p>we all have them.  and we've probably spent hundreds of dollars on them.</p>
<p>yes my friends, i'm talking about theme park souvenirs.</p>
<p>from on-ride photos to disney vinylmations to the dozens of park shirts you have in your drawers, the amusement industry makes a ton of money off of us and our need to commemorate our visits to their parks.</p>
<p>but some of the souvenirs we by hold a special place in our hearts (and in our homes.)</p>

<p>on the next episode of coaster radio, we bring you the final chapter in our own "time travel trilogy!"</p>
<p>on our last show, we left you with a cliff hanger... eb and mike were stuck somewhere in the space time continuum.</p>
<p>this week, we find out where they have been and if if they can successfully get back to 2011.</p>
<p>but, since they're travelling in time anyway, they decide to stop in 2006 to listen in on an old episode about going to the parks alone.</p>
<p>the coasterradio.com audience also chimes in to tell their own stories about going it alone during a trip to the park.  plus, mike has a run-in during his recent solo trip to hersheypark with the wannabe cast of "jersey shore."  you'll hear how mike channeled his "inner-nph" to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>we'll also have a live trip report from six flags america and an update from "the little mermaid: ariel's undersea adventure" at disney california adventure.</p>
<p>and... we also celebrate a very usual milestone in the show's history!</p>

<p>a few weeks ago, we celebrated the 6th anniversary of this crazy podcast.</p>
<p>eb and i got a little nostalgic for the old days.  so, after a movie marathon where we watched back to the future parts i, ii and iii while drinking nothing but diet mountain dew, we had an inspiration!</p>
<p>we would build our own time machine and go back to listen to a show featuring a past version of ourselves.</p>
<p>this week, eb and i head back to september 26, 2005 to hear a show featuring flava and greg k.  the topic that week, was "dating at the theme park."</p>
<p>we'll listen to our 2005 commentary on the topic and then go "back to the future" so we can give you our 2011 take on things.  let's just all be careful we don't cause a temporal paradox, ok?</p>
<p>we also hear about eb's opening day trip to holiday world and listen to a live trip report from the santa cruz beach boardwalk!</p>

<p>sometimes, the very best ideas for this crazy show of ours come from the listeners.</p>

<p>she said the best money she spent was when she and her husband bought the "bride and groom" mickey ears to wear during their recent honeymoon at walt disney world.</p>
<p>she said that throughout the trip, they were given free food, free gifts and other special treatment from the cast members at disney.</p>
<p>when eb and i heard this, we hatched an evil plan.  we asked our listening audience for two volunteers who would go to walt disney world and pretend to be honeymooners (complete with the mickey ears) to test this theory.</p>
<p>derek and trisha from southern california answered the call and what followed was <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>"the trip of lies!"</b></span></i></p>
<p>on this week's show, we hear about their trip and find out if the hypothesis was true.  do you get tons of free stuff just for wearing "bride and groom" mickey ears?</p>

<p>the <em><strong>tower of terror</strong></em> at walt disney world's hollywood studios is one of my favorite theme park attractions anywhere.</p>
<p>i love it so much, that i totally don't mind waiting in line for  it.  just being around the spooky ambiance is a thrill almost on par  with the big drop that is to come.</p>
<p>when the ride is though and i've checked out my on-ride photo and  am exiting through the gift shop, i sometimes wish that i could just  hang out there for awhile... almost as if i were a guest.</p>
<p>well, it turns out you can make this happen.  you can even have a romantic dinner just steps away from the ride's entrance.</p>
<p>on this week's show, we're joined by someone who <a href="http://disneytravelbabble.com/disney-weddings/our-wedding/tot-anniversary-party/"><strong>made this dream a reality.</strong></a></p>
<p>carrie hayward is the host of <a href="http://www.insidedisneyweddings.com/"><strong>“inside disney weddings”</strong></a> and the author of passporter's <a href="http://passporter.com/weddings.asp"><strong>“disney weddings & honeymoons.”</strong></a> </p>
<p>carrie  knows everything there is to know about the wonderful world of disney  party planning.  you'll be amazed at some of the things you can do at  walt disney world and disneyland.  you'll also be amazed at how  relatively inexpensive it is! (she'll even tell us how much it costs to  have disneyland all to ourselves!)</p>
<p>carrie will also tell  us about some of her other disney adventures... like the time she rode  the haunted mansion in florida and the haunted mansion in california in  the <a href="http://disneytravelbabble.com/trip-reports/free-dining/day-8/"><em><strong>same day!</strong></em></a> </p>
<p>make sure you check out this show and visit her website, <a href="http://disneytravelbabble.com/">disneytravelbabble.com</a>, to learn more!</p>
<p>plus, we'll have an update on the <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2011/02/what-is-neil-patrick-harris-project.html"><strong>neil patrick harris project</strong></a> and next week's launch of <a href="http://www.themeparkchange.com/"><strong>theme park change!</strong></a></p>

<p>this week, for the first time ever, we're taking your live phone calls!</p>
<p>many members of the coaster radio audience joined us during our  "live look-in" webcast where people could watch the show being  produced.  listeners were able to call-in to the show and make this  year's edition of the listener question show one of the best ever!</p>
<p>in addition to the live questions, we'll be joined by derek and  trisha, a couple in southern california who are making their way to walt  disney world in orlando next week.  they have agreed to wear bride and  groom mickey ears to test our theory that anyone wearing those "magical  caps" will get a ton of freebies (even if they aren't exactly  newlyweds!)</p>
<p>join us to find out what to expect in <em><strong>the newlywed game: the trip of lies!</strong></em></p>
<p>plus, we'll have some news on the <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2011/02/what-is-neil-patrick-harris-project.html"><strong>nph project</strong></a> and an update on the <a href="http://blog.coasterradio.com/2011/02/day-at-park-with-neil-contest.html"><strong>"day at the park with neil"</strong></a> contest.  don't forget, you only have one more week to enter! the contest ends thursday, march 17th!</p>

<p>each episode of coaster radio is unique.</p>
<p>sure, we carefully outline each episode and decide what we're going to talk about weeks in advance.</p>
<p>but each episode seems to take on a personality of its own.</p>
<p>having  said that, i'm not exactly sure how our episode about romance at the  theme parks turned into a love-fest for the 1975 classic "jaws."</p>
<p>but  regardless, in honor of valentines day we asked the audience to tell us  about their favorite romantic things to do at the parks.</p>
<p>we heard about favorite places to cuddle, to eat, to ride and yes, favorite places to make out at the parks.</p>
<p>yes, it's sort of gross, but it's also facinating to hear!</p>
<p>we  also have a live trip report from tokyo disney sea and a newcomer from  beyond tries to ensure a place among the rest of the characters at  coasterradio.com.</p>

<p>this  week, listeners from around the globe call in to tell us about the  iconic food treats that can be found at their local parks.  we're gonna  talk about everything from the <em>"dole whip"</em> at disneyland to the <em>"chip twister"</em> at walibi world!</p>

<p>surprisingly, this is a topic people are passionate about!</p>
<p>you'll be shocked at some of the rides people want to dismantle.</p>
<p>we'll  also have a live trip report from australia, a new idea for  coasterradio.com day and a visit from everyone's favorite crustacean.</p>

<p>depending on where you live, there's anywhere from 70 to 90 days before the regional parks open their gates for the 2011 season.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>so for the title of this week's show, we averaged it out to 80 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>here  at coaster radio, we're pretty excited about the 2011 theme park  season.  so, we're spending this week talking about the new attractions  we think are going to make some noise this summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>to help us out, we're joined by long-time friend <a href="http://themeparks.about.com/"><strong>arthur levine</strong></a>, the theme parks guide from about.com!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>he'll  help us figure out which attractions and going to be hits and which  ones might be duds.  he'll also let us in on the details behind <strong><a href="http://themeparks.about.com/library/bl-readers-choice-awards-2011.htm">the 2011 readers' choice awards on about.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p><br /> we'll also look ahead to 2012 and talk about what walt disney world has  planned for the magic kingdom.  this week, disney unveiled plans for <strong><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/19/2022899/disney-unveils-new-fantasyland.html">"new fantasyland,"</a> </strong>the largest expansion in magic kingdom's 40-year history!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>plus, we'll have a live trip report, tons of calls from the audience and a plea for a <strong>"coaster radio day"</strong> at <a href="http://www.quassy.com/"><strong>quassy amusement park!</strong></a></p>

<p>on this week's show, we take a break from our usual craziness to pay tribute to will koch, the president of holiday world who passed away on sunday at the age of 48.</p>
<div></div>
<div>will has always had a special place on this show because he was one of the first "big" guests that agreed to come on when we were first starting out back in 2005.</div>
<div></div>
<div>back then, not many people in the amusement industry wanted to deal with "the podcast guys." but will came on coasterradio.com and was funny, candid and extremely interesting.</div>
<div></div>
<div>this week, we're replaying that interview as a tribute to will.</div>
<div></div>
<div>it's wonderful to hear him talk about the park that was his life and the creation of roller coasters that everyone knows and loves. his enthusiasm is contagious and the interview is one of our all-time favorites.</div>
<div></div>
<div>as a way to say thanks, we're donating all of the website profits for the month of june to the <strong><a href="https://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=100903&sitereferer=1%20">juvenile diabetes research foundation</a></strong> in his name.</div>

we launched coasterradio.com on april 25, 2005 with a podcast that was frankly a liitle rough around the edges.

but what followed has been three years of good times on-line and at the parks.

a lot has changed in three years, but we're back today with a brand new podcast to celebrate the occasion.

mario, flava and i don't spend a lot of time looking back, but we do spend time talking about some of the latest stories and trends in the amusement industry.

we also talk about some of our upcoming podcasts and events for summer, 2008.

thanks to all of you who have stuck with us during the past three years.

https://sites.libsyn.com/21641/coaster_radio_com_228_series_finale
dear listeners of coasterradio.com,
<p>
thank you so much for being a part of our lives during the past two years. it was a great experience producing the show and we couldn't have done it without the support of the thousands of you who came along for the ride every week.
<p>
working on this show reminded us of how much fun it is to go to an amusement park with your friends and forget about everyday life for awhile. we hope that listening to this podcast did the same thing for you.
<p>
there were a lot of great moments both on-air and off-air, but here are some of the highlights:
<p>
* we produced 80 original shows (about 48 hours of podcasting!)
* we produced 13 on-location shows at the walt disney world resort, holiday world, hersheypark, six flags over georgia, kennywood, busch gardens europe, knoebels, paramount's kings dominion, six flags great adventure and dorney park.
* we were the only non-official podcast invited to the grand opening of expedition everest at walt disney world's animal kingdom.
* we were commissioned by the state of pennsylvania office of tourism to produce a "road trip podcast" to four of its amusement parks.
* we interviewed disney imagineers joe rohde (expedition everest), eric jacobson (rock 'n' roller coaster) and mike lentz (mission: space).
* we interviewed holiday world's will koch and several of the designers from the gravity group (the voyage / hades).
* we were featured on adam curry and itunes' podfinder podcast.
* we were featured in a july 2006 article about theme park podcasting in the amusement trade publication funworld.
<p>
all of these things happened because we were able to point to an large, active and loyal group of listeners. without you guys, the show would have never taken off.
<p>
this week, we present our series finale. it clocks-in around two hours long because we wanted to get in as many of your e-mails, voicemails and questions as possible.
<p>
we also have a few surprises in there for you as well, including an original song written for the end of our show by deidre rodman of the lascivious biddies.
<p>
even though this is the end of the weekly version of coasterradio.com, we're hoping to keep this site alive to continue the friendships we have made while doing the show. we'll probably even produce new "special" episodes of the show during holidays and other times when it makes sense. so make sure you stay subscribed to our rss feed! 
<p>
we're also working on a new podcast that will hopefully premiere sometime in 2007. while it won't be strictly about coasters, i'm sure we won't be able to go very long without mentioning them once in awhile.
<p>
thanks again for listening! we'll see you at the parks!
<p>
your friends,
mike, mario, flava, eb & greg

this week, we had originally scheduled our series finale.  but so many of you have been sending in messages and other things for our final show, we decided to bump it back one week so we could fit everything in.
<p>
so for this week's bonus episode, we're going to talk about our last-second trip to "hersheypark in the dark".  it was the first time in over two years that we've been to an amusement park without taking along all of the audio equipment.
<p>
we'll also be joined by mike and greg's brother ryan, who spent the weekend at busch gardens europe's howl-o-scream.  he'll tell us what the event was like from a "general public" perspective.
<p>
after the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions.
<p>
you can also record your thoughts on the coasterradio.com voicemail line at 206-339-ride (206-339-7433).
<p>

we've all had the experience of standing in line at a park and having to wait an extra cycle while a disabled guest is loaded into the row for which you were waiting.
<p>
most of us have no problem with this.  but have you ever wondered how the parks decide who gets to jump to the front of the line and who doesn't?  what constitutes a reasonable accommodation?
<p>
this week, we'll talk about the different physical and mental challenges that people face and how it affects their trip to the theme park.  we'll also talk about how some people try to abuse and cheat the system.

if you're a fan of theme parks, october is one of the best times of year.
<p>
halloween is right around the corner, and most parks are open for special "scare-fests" where you can ride all day and scream all night.
</p>
<p>
most parks have to create artificial ghosts, but it turns out one park doesn't have to.  six flags over georgia recently played host to the atlanta-based ghost hounds, who spent several hours after the park closed searching for signs from the beyond.
</p>
<p>
guess what... they found something.
</p>
<p>
this week, christy poore from six flags over georgia joins us to talk about what they found.  she'll also tell us about last week's "ticket to terror" promotion where 28 lucky guests volunteered to eat a live hissing madagascar cockroach in order to skip to the front of the line of their new roller coaster, goliath.
</p>
<p>
we'll also have a series of reports from eb, who spent the weekend at knoebels phoenix phall phunfest.  it's one of the most anticipated coaster enthusiasts of the year and eb was there!  he'll give us his unqiue spin on what he saw.
</p>
<p>
plus, we'll  tell you about our upcoming shows, all leading up the the big series finale on october 30th.

mario faces his fears on tv (video)
sun, 24 sep 2006 15:18:00 +0000
http://coasterradio.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=133532#
https://sites.libsyn.com/21641/coaster_radio_com_222_mario_faces_his_fears_on_tv_video_

back in december of last year, we did a show about extreme rides where we talked about the different attractions that truly frighten us.
<p>
one of the best stories to come out of that show is when we talked about how mario had to ride drop zone on a cold, rainy april day...several times... alone!
<p>
we were all working on a washington, dc based television show for kids and this particular episode was about new thrill rides.  drop zone at paramount's kings dominion had just opened, so they invited the host of our show to give their new ride a try.
<p>
mario was the host of the show, but is very afraid of heights.  however, he but on a brave face and took the ride on.
<p>
but during television shoots, you often have to videotape the same action several times from different angles to make sure you have enough footage to complete the segment.  so, mario had to ride drop zone four or five times for us to get all the shots we needed.
<p>
also, since the show was produced daily, we had no choice but to shoot on a rainy friday afternoon, before the park opened to the public the next day.  that helped to add to the fear.
<p>
this week, we present a video podcast where you finally get to see what that segment looked like!
<p>
don't forget to nominate your favorite park or attraction in our 2006 coasterradio.com awards!

this is the time of year when many of the different theme parks and amusement parks all over the country announce their new attractions and additions for the 2007 season.
<p>
during this week's show, we'll talk about two of the most recent announcements:
<p>
maverick at cedar point - the point's 17th coaster will be a terrain-hugging ride that features a 105-foot drop at 95-degrees, three inversions and a 70 mph launch through a dark tunnel
<p>
griffon at busch gardens europe - the 205-foot floorless dive coaster will be the tallest ride of it's kind anywhere in the world.  it will feature a 205-foot, 90-degree drop, two immelmann loops, a second 130-foot dive and a water splashdown effect.
<p>
these rides sound pretty cool. right?
<p>
well, there are some members of the coaster enthusiast community who aren't very happy.  they expected more and are disappointed that we're not seeing more height and speed out of this year's crop of announcements.
<p>
this week, we'll talk about the hype surrounding new and future announcements.  can anything  satisfy us anymore?
<p>
we're also looking for stories from cast members about their time working at a park.  if you have a funny or shocking story from your days on the job at a theme park, e-mail us at feedback [@] coasterradio.com.

fried oreos, fireworks and jack sparrow

on this week's show, we'll celebrate the 4th of july by shooting off some of the lamest legal fireworks that the commonwealth of virginia allows.  our fireworks display isn't gonna be like what you'll see over cinderella castle, but it's better than nothing.
<p>
we'll also fire up the deep fryer and pay homage to the greatest theme park food ever made - fried oreos!
<p>
yes, we know this is a theme park podcast and not a cooking show.  but when we were at holiday world a few months ago, we were blown away by this strange dessert.  so, after a lot of testing in the kitchen, we have come up with what we believe is a very close version of our own.
<p>
we'll also bring back bryan temmer to the show.  long time listeners will remember bryan from a show we did last november.  bryan is a normal guy, with a normal job and a normal family.  but he has a dream that is far from normal.
<p>
bryan has a dream of building his own theme park and he's making progress!  we'll check in with bryan and find out what's been happening since we spoke with him six months ago.
<p>
we'll also hear a live trip report from lee in los angeles, ca.  he recently had a chance to experience the new story overlay at pirates of the caribbean at the disneyland resort in anaheim.  we'll find out if captain jack sparrow fits in with the older pirates who have been in the attraction since the late 60's. 
<p>
we'll also announce the winner of the on-line sign generator contest and give you another clue in our soundwave contest!
don't forget, next week we begin our 4-week long pennsylvania amusement park road trip brought to you by visitpa.com.
we'll start the road trip by visiting hersheypark and experiencing their new attraction for 2006, reese's xtreme cup challenge!

as most of you know, coasterradio.com is not our full-time job.  sometimes, the show has to take a back-seat when professional disasters strike!

throughout the past two months, mike collins has been working on a major television project at his job.  earlier this week, the storage system that held all of his video files crashed.  so, it's taken a lot of extra hours to bring the files back online so that the project stays on schedule.

unfortunately, this means that we were unable to produce a new show this week.

but, we're going to re-post one of our most talked about shows - the podcast from kingda ka's grand opening at six flags great adventure.

this was one of the most technically demanding shows from season one.  not only did we have a live call from sheikra's media day at busch gardens africa in tampa, fl, we also had an on-ride segment where eb rode kingda ka during the show.

for newer listeners, this is a show you might not have heard before.  but for long-time listeners, we want to make downloading the podcast worth your while.

so, we'll also include the clip for our first soundwave contest of the year.  if you check out the end of the show, you'll hear an easter egg that contains the clip.  the first clue will be given out during next week's show.
after the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions.

back in the late 70's, people were crazy for disaster films.  there were movies about earthquakes, airplane disasters, war and even one about roller coasters.
<p>
in 1977, universal studios released a film about a madman (played by timothy bottoms) who was crisscrossing the country to set off bombs at amusement parks.  he wanted the theme park chains to give him one million dollars or he would continue to blow up roller coasters and dark rides.  it turns out that the only guy smart enough to stop him was a chain-smoking safety inspector (played by george segal) who gets on the case after the madman destroys a coaster that he personally inspected.
<p>
the plot is a bit laughable, but most theme park fans watch this movie for the scenes that were shot at paramount's kings dominion, six flags magic mountain and the now defunct ocean view park.  three of the major on-ride sequences take place on pkd's rebel yell, sfmm's revolution and the rocket at ocean view park.
<p>
on this week's show, we'll be joined by a washington, dc film commentator who will give us his professional take on the film.  we'll also give you the scoop on the fun things to look for the next time you watch the film.
<p>
if you do happen to own a copy of the 1998 dvd release, you can now download a full-length commentary where we point out interacting facts and trivia about the movie in real-time.  such as:
<p>
who shot the film's producer jennings lang and why?
what's the deal with the singing mushrooms at pkd?
what is vitamin f and how does it relate to sfmm?

hitting the parks alone

https://sites.libsyn.com/21641/coaster_radio_com_146_hitting_the_parks_alone
theme parks are designed as a place where friends and family can go and have a good time together.  they really aren't set up for people to visit alone.
<p>
for instance, there aren't any one-seater roller coasters out there. most times if you're by yourself, there's always that huge empty seat next to you.
<p>
so, while most people would never consider visiting a theme park alone, there are a lot of advantages to taking a trip by yourself.
<p>
on this week's show, we'll talk about the pros and cons of hitting the parks alone.
<p>
next week, join us as we talk about the universal studios 1977 classic "rollercoaster".  we'll be joined by a washington, dc film commentator and we'll give you the scoop on the fun things to look for the next time you watch the film.
<p>
if you do happen to own a copy of the 1998 dvd release, you'll be able to listen to a full-length commentary where we point out interacting facts and trivia about the movie in real-time.  if anyone actually does this, we'll be amazed.

theme parks are designed as a place where friends and family can go and have a good time together.  they really aren't set up for people to visit alone.
<p>
for instance, there aren't any one-seater roller coasters out there. most times if you're by yourself, there's always that huge empty seat next to you.
<p>
so, while most people would never consider visiting a theme park alone, there are a lot of advantages to taking a trip by yourself.
<p>
on this week's show, we'll talk about the pros and cons of hitting the parks alone.
<p>
next week, join us as we talk about the universal studios 1977 classic "rollercoaster".  we'll be joined by a washington, dc film commentator and we'll give you the scoop on the fun things to look for the next time you watch the film.
<p>
if you do happen to own a copy of the 1998 dvd release, you'll be able to listen to a full-length commentary where we point out interacting facts and trivia about the movie in real-time.  if anyone actually does this, we'll be amazed.
<p>
after the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. you can also record your thoughts on the coasterradio.com voicemail line at 206-339-ride (206-339-7433).

we had a topic lined up for this week's show, but a post on the  coasterradio.com forums caught our eye. so, we decided to bump our planned show and talk about the debate.
<p>
one of our listeners was looking into joining ace, the american coaster enthusiasts. while he was reading their code of conduct, he came upon one part of the code that said...
<p>
"when interacting with the media, members are expected to speak enthusiastically about all parks and roller coasters. while members may have strong opinions about parks and roller coasters, they are to avoid negative criticism to the media."
<p>
the listener was upset by this because he feels that he should be able to voice his opinion however he wants, whenever he wants. he brought the topic up on our forum, so now we're bringing it up on the show.
<p>

if you're a weekly listener to this podcast, odds are you're passionate about theme parks.  you might be a fan of the roller coasters, the scenery or the general ambiance, but most likely your love of theme parks is a big part of your life.
<p>
some people are so passionate that they include a theme park experience as part of their wedding.
<p>
we've all seen video of people "taking the plunge" on board a roller coaster; saying their vows in the front seat with a minister and the entire bridal party in tow.  but these days, there are ways to enjoy an elegant wedding while including tasteful theme park aspects.
<p>
on this week's show, we'll interview colleen and mike.  they got married at the walt disney world resort in 2004.  they'll tell us about their entire experience from planning the wedding all the way up to the activities on the big day.  they'll even tell us about how they were able to take pictures inside the magic kingdom at 4:30 am!
<p>
then we'll talk with deidre rodman of the lascivious biddies, a band the washington post calls "manhattan's hippest girl group".   deidre is the group's keyboardist and one of their songwriters.  she'll tell us about her theme park and circus-themed wedding as well as stories from when she worked at a small park in idaho.

theme parks seem to be a popular place to shoot movies.  they're colorful, loud and full of perpetual motion.
<p>
roller coasters, in particular, seem to be something that hollywood likes to use in its films because of the perceived danger and what seems like out of control speed.
<p>
we haven't had a major studio thriller based around a roller coaster since the 1977 classic "rollercoaster" (which we'll talk about in a few weeks.)
<p>
so this week, we're going to spend the show talking about the new horror/suspense film from new line cinema - final destination 3.  for those of you who don't know, it begins with a roller coaster disaster.
<p>
we'll explain the plot, talk about how it relates to the previous two films, discuss the technical aspects of shooting a coaster disaster scene and we'll talk about how a film like this might affect the theme park industry.
<p>
this week, we are also unveiling our first video podcast.  in this special video episode, we'll show you some behind the scenes footage of the film, interviews with the actors and director, plus a preview of one of the scenes from fd3.
<p>
on friday, february 10th, we'll release a 2nd audio podcast that features our review of the film.  we'll let you know whether it's worth heading out to the theaters or if you'll want to wait for this movie to arrive at the video store.  during that show, we'll be giving away final destination "scared 2 death" dvd packs.  (if you're under 17, you can't be considered for this contest.  sorry dudes.)

let's face it, one of the worst things about visiting a popular theme park are the long lines.  unless you're lucky enough to be waiting in a well themed queue like the one for dueling dragons at islands of adventure, you're probably going to be miserable.
<p>
but one of the newest innovations in the amusement industry has been the how the various theme park chains have introduced ways that guests can reduce the time they wait in lines.
<p>
some of these programs, like disney's fastpass are free with your admission.  others, like six flags' lo-q can be used for an additional fee.  there are even some programs like universal express at universal orlando where you can go directly to the front of the line at each attraction if you are a guest at an on-site hotel.
<p>
this week, we'll talk about the pros and cons of the different systems and how they have changed the way we experience theme parks.

but one of the newest innovations in the amusement industry has been the how the various theme park chains have introduced ways that guests can reduce the time they wait in lines.
<p>
some of these programs, like disney's fastpass are free with your admission.  others, like six flags' lo-q can be used for an additional fee.  there are even some programs like universal express at universal orlando where you can go directly to the front of the line at each attraction if you are a guest at an on-site hotel.
<p>
this week, we'll talk about the pros and cons of the different systems and how they have changed the way we experience theme parks.
<p>
after the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. you can also record your thoughts on the coasterradio.com voicemail line at 206-339-ride (206-339-7433).

one of the fun things about having an on-line community of theme park fans around the world is that there is an abundance of information about current parks and attractions.  what's even more fun is that there is also a lot of information about proposed parks and attractions that never quite made it to the construction stage.
<p>
on this week's show, we're going to talk about the rides and attractions that allegedly made it to the drawing boards, but never made it to the parks themselves.
<p>
for instance, one interesting rumor says that in the very early planning stages of walt disney world's tower of terror, disney imagineers gave some thought to turning part of the attraction into an actual, working hotel.
<p>
who knows if there is any truth to this rumor, but is is definitely fun to talk about what might have been.

this week, we bring you a very special podcast as mike collins sits by the fire, sipping brandy and smoking a pipe, while he reads passages from the immortal charles dickens classic "great expectations".
<p>
actually, as fun as that sounds, it's not what we're really going to do this week.
<p>
instead, each of the coasterradio.com guys will pick one thing that we absolutely expect when we visit a theme park.  we'll also pick one thing that we absolutely do not want to see when we visit a park.  so, that's why we called this week's show "great expectations".
<p>
this week, we'll talk about virtual lines, the cleanliness of park restrooms, rude employees, efficient (or non-efficient) operations, and many more topics.

the year 2005 was pretty good for theme parks across the world.  we saw the premiere of record breaking attractions, new high tech thrill rides and traditional forms of amusement park entertainment.
<p>
we'll take a look back at the highs and lows of 2005 with arthur levine from about.com.  we'll talk about the attractions that were big hits and some of the ones that missed the mark.  we'll also preview what could be big in 2006.
<p>
we'll also talk with ian clark from ozcoaster.net.  he was one of the very first people to ride superman escape, the new intamin launch coaster at warner brother's movie world.  he'll give us a review of this new attraction that opens this week.

<p> 
we'd like to wish each of you happy holidays and a successful 2006.
<p>
when we started the show back in april, we had no idea what the reaction would be to a bunch of unknowns talking about theme parks and roller coasters. we figured that a couple hundred people would listen each week at best.  but now, here we are eight months later, and a couple thousand of you are listening to the show each week. that totally exceeded our expectations.
<p>
as cheesy as it sounds, we're really honored that you invite us into your lives (ipods, computers) each week. like we've said on the show, we're not theme park or coaster experts. most of you out there know more about this stuff than we do. but the people who truly "get" the show understand that coasterradio.com is simply a show celebrating the fun that we all have when we visit the parks. that's all it is and all it ever will be.
<p>
we appreciate the e-mails we get every day and the many posts on the forums. we appreciate the people who have added themselves to the frappr map and the people who have left messages on our voice mail line. but we also appreciate all of the people who listen each week that we have never heard from personally. hopefully we'll get to meet some of you this year.
<p>
2006 should be fun and we're glad you're along for the ride.
<p>
have a wonderful and safe holiday with your family and friends.

if you've every spent any time watching espn, you've probably seen a program called "pardon the interruption" (pti).  it's a daily show where washington post columnists tony kornhsiser and michael wilbon debate the the biggest stories in sports for exactly one minute at a time.
<p>
in these days of short attention spans, it's the perfect format.  so, we decided to follow the homage "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery" and do a direct rip-off of pti.  so, that's why this week's show is called "pardon the ripoff".
<p>
we'll discuss 5 different topics for exactly two minutes each.  once the buzzer sounds at the end of the two minutes, we have to move on or else eb will throw a fit.  it's the fastest theme park talk out there.
<p>
after the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions. you can also record your thoughts on the coasterradio.com voicemail line at 206-339-ride (206-339-7433).
<p>
also, don't forget to check out our coasterradio.com holiday gift guide.  it's filled with ideas to find the perfect gift for the theme park enthusiast in your life.  we've searched the internet for the most interesting toys, gadgets, dvds, books, calendars, posters and other gifts that are made specifically for a fan of theme parks.  we'll also found some outrageously expensive stuff that you can buy to bring the theme park experience into your home.

this year, hades, the monstrous wooden roller coaster that opened at mt. olympus water and theme park in wisconsin dells, wisconsin won the amusement today golden ticket award for best new ride in 2005.
<p>
riders were amazed by it's steep drop (140-feet at a 65-degree angle), two underground tunnels (one of which was the longest underground tunnel on a roller coaster ever), and the extreme 90-degree banked turn.  the ride was designed by the gravity group.
<p>
one of the most anticipated rides for 2006 is the voyage at holiday world and splashin' safari in santa claus, indiana.  this wooden coaster will thrill park-goers with a 154-foot drop at 66-degrees, five underground tunnels, three 90-degree banked turns and a total of 24.2 seconds of airtime.  this ride was also designed by the gravity group.
<p>
so, it goes without saying that the designers at this young company are pushing the evolution of wooden roller coasters.  we're happy to welcome gg designers korey kiepert and chad miller to coasterradio.com this week.
<p>
we'll talk to the guys about their design philosophies and how they are trying to take the development and technology of the wooden roller coaster to new heights.  we'll also talk about the pressures of designing a roller coaster in the age of the internet, where hype knows no bounds.  korey and chad will also tell us some behind-the-scenes stories about hades, the voyage and other projects that they have worked on during their careers.

<p>
next week, the entire coasterradio.com gang will be back with a special show dedicated to theme park and roller coaster related gifts.  we'll talk about the toys, gadgets, dvds, books, calendars, posters and other gifts that you can buy for the coaster nut in your life.

if you're a theme park enthusiast, you've probably had a dream of building and owning your own theme park.  but odds are, unless you're very well connected or a multi-millionaire, you'll never get to see your dream come true.
<p>
if that isn't discouraging enough, most people would probably tell you that your dream was crazy anyway.  heck, people even told walt disney that his plans for a new type of amusement park were a horrible idea.  they even went so far as to call it "disney's folly".
<p>
but that folly eventually became disneyland and those critics had to eat their words.
<p>
so in that sprit, we welcome brian temmer to the show.  brian is a theme park fan just like all of us.  but he's doing whatever he can to bring his dream of a new type of theme park to life.
<p>
he'll give us a behind the scenes look at what it takes to push an idea like this from a dream to reality.  he'll also give us a few hints as to what this new attraction might be and where it might be located.  it's a chance for us all to watch an amusement industry project from it's conception to it's completion.

there really aren't many rides or attractions that theme park fans won't try at least once.
<p>
but there are a few rides out there that even the most hardcore enthusiasts think twice about before riding.
<p>
some people won't ride certain types of freefall rides while others won't ride attractions that spin you in circles.  some people won't ride skycoasters and some people could never bring themselves to ride any of the attractions on top of the stratosphere tower in las vegas.  (that picture over there on the right is x-scream.  you can read our review to find out what it's all about.)
<p>
we'll spend this week's short "off-season" show talking about the different theme park attractions that freak people out.  we'll talk about the attractions that scare us the most and we'll also hear about some of our listener's picks as well.  you'll be surprised at some of the responses we got.

<p>
we'll ask him about the attraction's storyline, the immersive theming and how the legend of the yeti will come to life.
<p>
we'll also talk with joe about and how he and his team of imagineers are embarking on a real-life trip dubbed expedition everest: mission himalayas in the search for new species and ancient legends. the scientific and cultural journey to china and the eastern himalayas began in august and continues though october 2005. we'll find out how this trip to the everest region will help to create an extremely authentic experience for park guests. don't worry, we'll ask him about the roller coaster too.
<p>
we'll also talk with eb about the annual halloween extravaganza that he puts on at his house. we'll talk about the process of backyard imagineering and go into detail about the unique setup at eb's house. we'll also provide you with some links to other "home haunts" so you can get a few ideas for your own house.

this week, we're on-location from fear fest at paramount's kings dominion. it's the 3rd stop on our month-long coasterradio.com halloween terror tour.
<p>
since paramount is a movie company, kings dominion uses film-like storytelling to create their haunted mazes and attractions.  when the sun goes down, they specialize in delivering intense environments that make you scream as much as they make you laugh.
<p>
we'll talk about the evil carnie folks running amuck in freakshow in 3d, the insane residents of the maze of madness,  the carnage caused by the headless horseman in the curse of sleepy hollow and the terrifying drive you can take on r.l. stein fearstreet.
<p>
in this week's great debate, we'll talk about what horror movies would make excellent theme park rides.  then, we'll talk about new attractions coming to paramount parks in 2006.  of course, we'll highlight the new "family-thrill" coaster coming to kings dominion - italian job stunt coaster.
<p>
after the show, join us in our forums to talk about your opinions.  you can also record your thoughts on the coasterradio.com voicemail line at 206-339-ride (206-339-7433).
<p>

<p>
why interview joe on a halloween-themed show?  well, the new expedition everest attraction brings guests face to face with the mysterious (and terrifying) yeti!
<p>
we'll ask him about the attraction's storyline, the immersive theming and how his team of imagineers are visiting the everest region to create an extremely authentic experience for park guests.  don't worry, we'll ask him about the roller coaster too.
<p>
we'll also be revealing your picks for the best spooky/haunted/scary themed attractions at theme parks around the world.  if you want to participate, post a message in our special forum topic or leave us a voicemail message at 206-339-ride.

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">have you ever been riding on a roller coaster for the first time and sworn that you've ridden it before? it probably wasn't deja vu (the feeling, not the coaster).</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">most likely, you were riding an exact duplicate of a roller coaster from another park. you were probably riding a coaster clone. (actually, the roller coaster deja vu is a coaster clone!)</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">sometimes if a theme park or a ride designer has a proven coaster design on their hands, it's less expensive for the parks to build more of the same instead of paying for new design. the general public hardly cares, but the important question is... do theme park enthusiasts care?</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">sometimes if a theme park or a ride designer has a proven coaster design on their hands, it's less expensive for the parks to build more of the same instead of paying for new design. the general public hardly cares, but the important question is... do theme park enthusiasts care?</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">but are they romantic?</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">this week, we'll talk about whether or not theme parks are a good place to start up a romantic relationship. when you think about it, there are plenty of similarities between a theme park trip and an average date. instead of having awkward conversation over dinner, you can have awkward conversation while standing in a line. instead of holding hands while watching the latest thriller from wes craven, you can hold hands while you ride the latest thriller from b and m. (ok, that was totally lame. but you get my drift.)</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we decided to put you in charge of this week's show.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">over the past few months, we've received hundredsof e-mails and forum postings from listeners all over the world who want us to talk about specific topics. since there isn't time to get to all of them during our regular podcasts, we decided that we would use the show before our summer season finale to answer as many as we could.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">this week, we'll answer your e-mails about cedar point, looping water slides, on-ride video replacing on-ride photos, smoke-free parks, and annoying park guests. we'll also answer some of your questions about the show itself. have you ever wanted to know the types of things e.b. says that eventually get cut out of the final show? well, this might be the show where we tell you. we'll also give you some behind the scenes info about how the podcast is created.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">next week is our summer season finale. we'll be presenting the 2005 coasterradio.com awards! it will be a star-studded event live from the coasterradio.com amphitheater in washington, dc.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">by the way, some of you have asked if we will be going away and not producing new shows during the fall and winter. that was the plan originally, but now we're all set to produce one regular show a month and then produce shorter 5-to-10 minute shows during the other weeks. we're planning on getting a lot of input from our listeners to make those shows interesting.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">so we hope to hear from you though e-mail, through our forums and on the coasterradio.com voicemail line at 206-339-ride (206-339-7433).</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we'll also spend some time reviewing their new attraction for 2005, tomb raider: firefall. this floorless top spin from huss is further enhanced by some amazing fire, water and music effects. but will it impress the coasterradio.com team?</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we'll also review the new "school of rock" show. we've always said that shows are a waste of good riding time, but we'll make an exception to check this out. especially if the band is going to play "hot for teacher" by van halen.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">no one has guessed correctly in our latest soundwave contest yet, so we'll add another prize to the pack and give away another clue. we'll also play theme park trivia and see if the guys can answer a kings dominion related question.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">there won't be a new show next week. the whole team will betaking the week off to spend time with family and friends. but, we'll be back on monday, august 12th with a brand new show. until then, you can visit the coasterradio.com forum to talk with the coasterradio.com guys and other listeners from around the world.</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we'll also review the new "school of rock" show. we've always said that shows are a waste of good riding time, but we'll make an exception to check this out. especially if the band is going to play "hot for teacher" by van halen.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">no one has guessed correctly in our latest soundwave contest yet, so we'll add another prize to the pack and give away another clue. we'll also play theme park trivia and see if the guys can answer a kings dominion related question.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">there won't be a new show next week. the whole team will betaking the week off to spend time with family and friends. but, we'll be back on monday, august 12th with a brand new show. until then, you can visit the coasterradio.com forum to talk with the coasterradio.com guys and other listeners from around the world.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">thanks for listening!</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we'll also talk with rick root from the world waterpark association. rick's organization works with over 1,100 waterparks around the world. he'll give us the inside scoop on some of the new technologies developed to make water attractions more thrilling.</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">when you were a kid, did you ever dream of building a theme park in your own backyard? maybe you turned an old wagon or a big wheel into the roller coaster of your dreams?</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">this week on coasterradio.com, we'll be taking a look at three very different thrill rides that have been built in backyards across the world.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we'll talk about a guy in germany who has created his very own log flume. we'll also talk about the blue flash, a looping, steel roller coaster that was built by a gentleman in indiana.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">but, one of our favorites is the 444-foot backyard wooden coaster built by jeremy reid. jeremy was an engineering student at the university of oklahoma and decided to use his knowledge of physics and mathematics to build his own coaster. after graduating from college, jeremy worked for arrow dynamics before they merged with s&s.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">today, jeremy works as an engineer at tinker air force base in oklahoma. we'll have him on the show to find out all about his coaster and why he wanted to build it in the first place.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we'll also talk about the recent down-time of six flags great adventure's kingda ka. plus, we'll get into a brief discussion about whether or not there is a need for federal oversight of the amusement industry.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">we'll also play theme park trivia and give one of our listeners a chance to win a tomb raider: firefall adventure pack from paramount's kings dominion. we'll also have a phone call from our first "celebrity" listener.</p>

<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;"><b>busch gardens williamsburg</b> has just unveiled their newest dark ride and it looks like it is going to be one of the top new attractions in 2005.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;"><b>"curse of darkastle: the ride"</b> is a dynamic, motion-based, 3d attraction that sends guests on a terrifying, gravity-defying ride through the mysterious corridors of a bavarian castle.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">across the country, teams of animators, engineers and designers worked for 13 months to bring this ride from concept to completion. the result is an amazing attraction that one would only expect to find in orlando theme parks.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">mike collins and flava were on hand at the media preview of<b>"darkastle."</b> instead of using their press credentials to ride the attraction with the rest of the media, they waited to ride with the general public to see what the reaction was like. in this week's show, they'll tell you all about the attraction (without giving too much away) and let you know how average park guests were reacting.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">they'll also talk with brent young of hollywood-based <b>super 78.</b> brent's company created all of the animations for this new attraction. they'll ask him about some of the technical advances that were made in the design of this ride. one of the biggest is that <b>darkastle's</b> animated scenes are digitally projected and stored on massive servers located in williamsburg. brent and his team can update the scenes in hollywood and upload them to the servers at any time. this allows scenes to be tweaked constantly and possibly even updated or replaced in the future.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">the guys also will talk to dave mauck of orlando-based <b>oceaneering.</b>dave and his team designed the motion-based ride system for <b>darkastle.</b>dave will explain how in 13 months, his team had to create intelligent ride vehicles that used "linear, circular and vertical motion" and allowed for "varying rates of acceleration."</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">in english, that means the vehicles have to give perfect rides to 1,450 people per hour all season long.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">not an easy job.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">there was no winner in last week's "soundwave" contest. we received a lot of guesses that were very close, but no one has sent in the correct answer. so, the guys will give a clue this week to help you figure it out. to hear the soundwave, listen to our first show found in the show archive section.</p>
<p style="font-family: times; font-size: medium;">speaking of the show archive, this week's show is a special episode of coasterradio.com. because of intense media demand, the entire crew was not able to attend the media event at busch gardens. so, if you are a new visitor and want to hear the show with all five hosts, head to our show archive section to listen to last week's show.</p>
