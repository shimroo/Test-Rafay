custom rsr
mufflers 

how do you
like the sound of your 993? after months
of searching for a perfect exhaust for my 993, i came to the conclusion
that in order for me to have what i
wanted
i needed to build one for myself.   what i was
looking for in the
993 exhaust in particular was the extra 911 muscular growl
that
was
missing since the introduction of the 993, as you may or may not know
porsche
tried really hard to lower the noise level of their cars with the
introduction
of the 993 model in order to meet strict european "drive by"
standards.  although this is perfect for most yuppies, for an
old fashion 911 enthusiast like me this is a nightmare. but at the same
time i didn't want to deal with
too much resonance and didn't want my car to sound like a modified
"rice
burner" (japanese cars with big exhaust tips). i wanted a sophisticated
mechanical
sound and a muscular sounding idle.......

what is rsr
muffler? the name rsr muffler
is something my friends made up for me for my modified 993 and 996
factory
exhaust. since my name is robin sun, the initials were perfect for what
everyone
calls it. the rsr moniker was originally used by porsche to designate
the
factory lightweight 911, which is still one of the best horsepower to
weight
ratio cars ever made by porsche.
