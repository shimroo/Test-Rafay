to all of you, merry 
      christmas and a happy new year!  another year has rolled by and so i 
      hope that you are all excited about  2004!
it's been a while since i 
      last updated but i've been pretty busy with other items offhand.  
      work on vcdgear still continues though :-)  as you can see, i have 
      managed to give the website a bit of a facelift.  some pages were 
      reorganized and purged so the site should now be a bit cleaner.

today the vcdgear console 
      version has finally gotten a much needed update!  this new version 
      builds upon the same engine used in the successful v3.50 gui release.  
      most features found in v3.50 can also be found in the console release such 
      as svcd imaging, multilanguage support (via the existing v3.5x language 
      sets), and of course the vast conversion/extraction options.
vcdgear is now used in 
      svcd2dvd to extract streams from images. svcd2dvd is written by 
      badger to automate the conversion of vcd and svcd movies to dvd.  
      check out the svcd2dvd homepage for more information 
      on this great tool!
download 
      the vcdgear 
      v1.76 console version.
jimmy chang has 
      also provided a chinese language set.  thanks jimmy!  you can 
      download it here.

        task creation form
fix for decompress and delete rar 
        option failing after first 2 tasks

        saved to task (v2.1 task files )

happy new year and happy 5th 
      birthday to vcdgear!  :-)  to start off this new 2003 year, the 
      web site has undergone a little bit of change.  not only that, 
      vcdgear v3.50 has been released!  here is a quick run down on what's 
      new: 


major 
      rewrite to 1.7 engine and a lot of bugs from previous version should be 
      fixed (hopefully new ones aren't introduced!)

svcd image 
      generation

improved 
      conversion and auto-detection routines

improved fix 
      and padding routines

more task / 
      batch processing options

new options 
      to extract mpegs direct from bin without cue files

fixed some 
      bugs in vcd imaging routines.  can now generate toc/bin files as well

more batch 
      processing option (automatic sfv creation, etc...) to make distribution 
      even easier

svcd imaging 
      supported

image 
      spanning for large mpegs implemented

sample clips 
      of your video can be generated along with your images

language files for v3.50 
      will need to be written.  please download the new 
      english language pack.  the new english pack includes a text file 
      containing the changes needed to update an  existing v3.05 language 
      file.
so happy 2003 everyone 
      and enjoy the latest release! :-)
