soup of the evening
beautiful soup

"beautiful soup, so rich and green,
     waiting in a hot tureen!
     who for such dainties would not stoop?
     soup of the evening, beautiful soup!
     soup of the evening, beautiful soup!
     beau--ootiful soo--oop! beau--ootiful soo--oop!
     soo--oop of the e--e--evening, beautiful, beautiful soup"
[hear 12-year-old michael bannett perform lewis carroll's "the mock turtle's song"]
for centuries, soup has been the first resort of a special dinner and the last resort of weary providers with tired vegetables and hungry children.  and it's a lot more than that.  thackeray has versified on it; queequeg has rhapsodized about it; george santayana has waxed downright proustian for its sake.  in these pages, dear readers, i would sing a song of soup to fill your bellies and satisfy your souls.
