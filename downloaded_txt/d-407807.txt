 welcome to blackdogdualsport.com!
 





 we 
    are an organization that promotes positive & responsible ohv use in our public 
    and private lands. we primarily focus on dualsporting, but promote all responsible 
    ohv use.
 at the present, we host one event per year: 
	the dogface ride.
in the past, we hosted the northwest's
  biggest dualsport ride -  the
   black dog 
    2-day dualsport & adventure
	ride, and the 
	rat dog and scaredy cat rides. these events  took place in oregon. on these
  events our b and c
  courses are incredibly easy, scenic, adventurous and fun, but our motto for the 
  a and aa routes are,
  "your mother didn't lay out these courses!"  we
  pride ourselves on offering an enjoyable ride for all levels of 
	bike & rider, whether
  you're a beginner or an isde veteran.  if you are from 
    out of state, this is an opportunity to ride in one of the most beautiful,
  pristine and historic areas of the northwest. 

if you have any questions that this site does not answer for you, please feel
