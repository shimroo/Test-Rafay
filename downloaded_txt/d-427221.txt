on the bench: illuminor szeras


on the workbench today: illuminor szeras, a necrons character for warhammer 40,000. szeras was the model included with issue 90 of my warhammer 40,000: imperium subscription, which delivered in december 2023. this is part of my effort to begin clearing a pretty crazy backlog of models that i need to build while i hold off on purchasing anything new — and thankfully, aside from the dark angels inner circle companions and the belial and asmodai characters, there just isn’t much that i want. 
so far, the torso is pretty fiddly and there’s no real reason for it to be engineered the way it was, which is typical of a ton of games workshop stuff. but when it’s finished, this is going to be a pretty fantastic model.
