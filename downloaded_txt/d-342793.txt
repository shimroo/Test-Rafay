welcome - and our invitation
while education is itself inherently a values-laden endeavour and forms the beating heart of quality education so also values are an integral and defining aspect of the human being and we extend a warm welcome to this website to all those concerned with the place and extent of values in their lives.
we hope that you will find ideas for quiet reflection and contemplation, inspiration for ways of thinking, being and doing that you would like to adopt and practical resources that you can use for teaching in a wide variety of settings.
values-based education then has an essential part to play in the development of the individual and the path towards a better world for all.

why develop values?
no matter what role we are currently playing, whether it be child in a family, parent, person in business, employee, school teacher, government official, retiree, whatever age, gender, nationality, spiritual belief, we all have one thing in common; a human requirement to meet our basic needs - to be safe, respected, understood, loved, valued.

success stories & testimonials from educators
positive and heart-warming stories from educators as well as educator evaluations have been collected from teachers implementing living values education around the world. the most frequent themes noted in the reports are positive changes in teacher-student relationships and in student-student relationships both inside and outside the classroom.
educators note an increase in respect, caring, cooperation, motivation, and the ability to solve peer conflicts on the part of the students. aggressive behaviours decline as positive social skills and respect increase. living values education helps educators create safe, caring, values-based atmospheres for quality learning.
