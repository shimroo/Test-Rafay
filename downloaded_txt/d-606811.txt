welcome to the planet of

 a 
technical service bulletin tsb was issued by ford in october 2001. the 
bulletin recommended that modifications made to reduce the unlikely possibility 
of a fuel tank puncture during an extremely high-speed rear impact.
 
this planet is very similar 
to the planet earth out there:
it is round (just like a 
disco ball),
it has gravity (john attracts 
you),
it has sunshine (john's 
smile), and lightning (very high voltage),
and it amazes you over and 
over again
so if you feel this could be 
the planet of your dreams -
