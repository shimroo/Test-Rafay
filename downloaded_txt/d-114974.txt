											can morning glory vine be grown as indoor plant?i have cuttings growing in water and they are blooming indoors
									 	

indoor morning glories
it is possible to grow morning glories indoors, but unless there is a specific place for them to continue to grow and bloom, it is not highly recommended. 
morning glory vines thrive while not in direct sunlight and kept in cooler temperatures. thriving morning glories will also grow in any direction they are able, so if the vine is allowed to, it will climb over any object it comes into contact to and can possibly become entangled. 
some people consider morning glories to be more of a weed than a flower because of their excessive growth and tendency to strangle any nearby plants. if you truly want to grow morning glories inside, it is best to give it a specific spot to grow in and an object such as a trellis or even a few poles to wind around. you can trim the vines that get out of control or manipulate the vine itself in directing it where to grow. but keep in mind, continuously winding vines around themselves will cause the plant to become very heavy and may break the trellis or other climbing object, so trimming may become mandatory.

											what should i use to attract butterflies, besides plants.
									 	

unique ways to attract butterflies
flowers with large petals and bright colors are a great way to attract butterflies. but there are other ways to welcome butterflies. shallow trays of sand can be placed in the garden to give butterflies a place to relax and enjoy the sunshine. shallow bowls of rocks give butterflies a place to get a drink of water. butterflies will love small plates of rotting fruit. bannanas, apples and grapes make great snacks for butterflies.
