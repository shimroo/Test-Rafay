            'life-threatening cold' expected as polar vortex stretches across u.s. after deadly weekend flooding


18 hrs ago


harsh weather moved west as a polar vortex was expected to grip the rockies and the northern plains after winter storms pummeled the eastern u.s. over the weekend, killing at least 10 people, including nine victims in kentucky who died during flooding from heavy rains. the national weather service warned of “life-threatening cold” into tuesday, with temperatures in northeastern montana predicted to dip as low as 45 degrees below zero. weather forces in the arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the north pole into the u.s. and europe. in kentucky, gov. andy beshear said sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded by floods had to be rescued.


















        

        
            us, ukrainian officials head to saudi arabia as talks loom on ending russia's war


feb 16, 2025


a ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived in saudi arabia for meetings in preparation for a possible visit by president volodymyr zelenskyy. the comments by ukraine's economy minister on sunday came at a time of intense speculation over planned u.s.-russia talks in the country to end moscow's war on its neighbor. and as a top u.s. envoy revealed that he and a fellow negotiator appointed by president donald trump were heading there. trump earlier this week jettisoned three years of u.s. policy and announced he would likely meet soon with russian president vladimir putin to negotiate a deal to end almost three years of fighting.

            zelenskyy says he will only agree to meet with putin after common plan with trump is negotiated


feb 14, 2025


ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy says he will only agree to meet in-person with russian leader vladimir putin after a common plan is negotiated with u.s. president trump. zelenskyy believes trump is the key to ending the russia-ukraine conflict. zelenskyy spoke friday to the munich security conference. trump this week upended years of steadfast u.s. support for ukraine. zelenskyy is expected to meet with u.s. vice president jd vance later. many observers, particularly in europe, hope vance will shed at least some light on trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war following a phone call between trump and putin this week.

nearly 1,300 employees at the centers for disease control and prevention are being forced out under the trump administration’s move to get rid of all probationary employees. that's roughly one-tenth of the agency’s workforce. the agency’s leadership was notified of the decision friday morning. the verbal notice came from the u.s. department of health and human services in a meeting with cdc leaders. that's according to a federal official who was at the meeting. the official was not authorized to discuss it and spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity.

            treasury watchdog begins audit of musk doge team's access to federal government's payment system


feb 14, 2025


the treasury department’s office of inspector general says it's launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government’s payment system. that's after democratic senators raised red flags about the access provided to trump aide elon musk’s department of government efficiency. the audit will also review the past two years of the system’s transactions as it relates to musk’s assertion of “alleged fraudulent payments.” that's according to a letter from treasury’s deputy inspector general obtained friday by the associated press. the audit marks part of the broader effort led by democratic lawmakers and federal employee unions to provide transparency about doge’s activities under president donald trump's republican administration.

            vaccine skeptic robert f. kennedy jr. is sworn in as trump's health chief after a close senate vote


feb 13, 2025


robert f. kennedy jr. has been sworn in as president donald trump’s health secretary. the senate on thursday confirmed him, voting 52 to 48. it puts the prominent vaccine skeptic in control of $1.7 trillion in federal spending, vaccine recommendations, food safety, and health insurance programs for roughly half the country. republicans fell in line behind trump despite hesitancy over kennedy’s views on vaccines. the gop has largely embraced kennedy’s vision to “make america healthy again” by directing the nation's public health agencies to focus on chronic diseases such as obesity. he's earned a formidable following with his populist and sometimes extreme views on food, chemicals and vaccines.

feb 12, 2025


president donald trump has upended three years of u.s. policy toward ukraine, saying he and russian president vladimir putin have agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war following a dramatic prisoner swap. the republican says in a social media post he and putin held a lengthy phone call on wednesday during which they committed to “work together, very closely” to bring the conflict to an end. it's unclear how closely ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy would be involved. trump held a phone call with him wednesday. a ukrainian presidential adviser characterized it as a “good conversation.”
