king snubbed at republican dinner by newt gingrich





last night the nys republicans brought out newt gingrich at their annual dinner. newt spoke and had this to say about the ny gop future "if we had mayor giuliani for governor and we had gov. pataki for senator, we would be a large step towards the tidal wave which will make 2010 comparable to 1994," he said, referring to the gop electoral sweep in '94. "that should be our goal."hmmm... isn't peter king the one that has been trumpeting his name as a potential winning senate candidate?this is one heck of a slight.is newt still holding a grudge against king for calling him "political road-kill" back in the 90's?

king goes to gitmo part 1; apples and oranges edition





king has an op-ed in today's nypost extolling the virutes of the gitmo facility and attacking president obama for preparing to close it. there are many points to look at in the op-ed so i'll do them bit by bit.king says that at gitmo "detainees at guantanamo are treated far better than most american prisoners in the us jails and prisons i've inspected over the years."umm.. peter..... the prisoners in us jails have all faced a judge and jury and have been found guilty of a crime. the detainees at gitmo have not had a trial. that is the problem.it's fairly simple; have a trial and either find the detainees guilty of terrorist acts or send them back to thier own countries.here is a scenario king ought to think about:when king went to northen ireland years ago as an ira supporter and agitator, he stayed with and spent time with murderers and assorted criminals. if the british forces did a sweep and arrested king along with the other terrorists would king think that it is okay for the british to hold him indefinately without trial?  would king feel good about languishing in prison for 4 or more years without contact with family and friends or a lawyer to represent him?

wavering king may lose chance to run for senate





according to an ap story, republican senate campaign committee head john cornyn is looking to former governor george pataki to run for senate against gillibrand in 2010.king has consistantly performed extremely poorly in match-up polls against gillibrand. and he hasn't been as gung-ho to run as he was against caroline kennedy."a person who spoke to george pataki says national republicans have approached the former new york governor about running for the senate in 2010.the person confirmed tuesday's meeting in new york city between pataki and sen. john cornyn, a texas republican who heads the party's national senate campaign committee. the person spoke on the condition of anonymity because he isn't authorized to comment.the person says pataki, now in private law practice, hasn't yet accepted or rejected the idea. the race would be against democrat kirsten gillibrand, who was appointed to succeed hillary rodham clinton and said she will run.pataki didn't respond to a request for comment.cornyn's office referred questions to the committee, which didn't comment."the journal news gives a reason why pataki would be the better choice..."a marist college poll last month found gillibrand and pataki in a statistical dead heat in a hypothetical matchup, with gillibrand at 44 percent and pataki at 42 percent."what he brings to a candidacy in a very blue state is name recognition, a proven statewide vote-getter, an ability to raise money, candidate experience. and those are many of the ingredients for success," marist pollster lee miringoff said."king can always run against schumer..... nah..... he doesn't have the guts to try.

business paper calls king a 'loser" on his vote against the stimulus





crain's new york listed 'winners and losers' from the stimulus package vote."congress is closing in on a stimulus package. last week, the house passed a bill worth $819 billion. the senate still has to pass its own version, and a compromise bill must be drawn up. but the differences are not vast, and the legislators have reached consensus on many of the main elements. here are some early winners and losers"losersrep. peter king the long island republican toed the party line and voted against the stimulus package—even though it included $80 billion in new medicaid funding, something mr. king has long pushed for. the vote could hurt him in 2010, when he may challenge sen. kirsten gillibrand or make a run for governor."
