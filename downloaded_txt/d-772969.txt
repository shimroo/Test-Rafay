lab grown
igi certified laboratory grown diamonds

perfect for the budget& socially conscious buyer





	            						lab grown diamonds are identical to mined diamonds sharing the same physical, 
                        	chemical and optical properties as their mined counterparts.    
                        	the only difference is the origin.  they are grown in a lab.  
                        	all are igi certified, and laser inscribed with certificate numbers.
