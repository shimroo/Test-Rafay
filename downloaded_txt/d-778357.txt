take five fairs











end of an erait is with regret that john slade, proprietor of 'take five fairs', has to announce that sadly - with dwindling numbers of stall holders and the reduced public support - he has been forced to make the decision that he can no longer continue to run his events. john wishes to thank all the stall holders and members of the public who have supported him over the years.
