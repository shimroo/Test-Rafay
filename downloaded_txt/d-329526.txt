the source of official information for ncalc
welcome to the north carolina association of launderers and cleaners (ncalc)!  started in 1907, we are one of the very few single state trade associations representing and supporting our statewide  industry.  this is a source of pride for us and we will tell you why.   what it means is that due to the long standing commitment and passion of our members, leadership and sponsors, we have been able to consistently provide meaningful support and value to our industry for over 100 years.
membership comes with a host of benefits:

joint membership for cleaners in ncalc and the drycleaning and laundry institute (dli)
exposure to a wide variety of educational outreach to improve your business
multiple occasions throughout the year to join in professional networking and fellowship with other cleaners from around the state and with suppliers to our industry
legislative support and updates


if you are already a member, thank you very much for your support!  if you are not a member yet, we welcome you to learn about us throughout our web site and urge you to consider the many benefits of membership. click here for more info about membership.
