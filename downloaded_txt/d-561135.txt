patient testimonials

“the best decision  i ever made!"













1 / 8




“mommy makeover- my experience at austin weston was life-changing. …dr. george weston
                  gave me the confidence i needed to go through with this, and it was the best decision i made! he is
                  brilliant, and i am so thrilled with the results :) the staff ensured i had a smooth preoperative
                  prep, surgery, and follow-up. dr. kochuba, who assisted dr. weston, was very meticulous about my
                  post-operative care. the staff goes above and beyond for their patients. wonderful experience from
                  start to finish. i highly recommend dr. weston and his team at austin weston.”
–anju m., reston, va, mommy makeover patient.


“i had a rhinoplasty done in 2016 when i was 19 by dr. poindexter at austin-weston and it was one of the most life-changing moments for me. i’ve never once regretted it and am so glad he was my surgeon as he really listened to what i wanted, and made natural changes that still allowed me to look middle eastern. although it had been many years since i had been to the center, i always remembered dr. poindexter being so warm, welcoming, and having great bedside manner, and knew if i ever wanted more work done, i would go back. all the staff was also so nice and friendly. fast forward 7 years, i began thinking more about getting laser hair removal but was skeptical on where to go/how to proceed. i randomly remembered meeting shima at the clinic from 2016 and how friendly and sweet she was. i immediately knew i needed to go back to austin-weston to see if she was taking clients. over the past several months, i’ve been doing laser hair removal as well as diamondglow facials with shima, and again, another great decision that i’m glad i didn’t wait longer on. shima is amazing! she is so nice and easy to relate to, makes you feel comfortable and at ease, and very knowledgeable. she always answers all my questions and you can tell she knows what she is talking about. she practices evidence-based which i appreciate as a healthcare professional myself. i have seen real results and am so excited to continue working towards my skin health goals! thanks so much to the austin-weston clinicians and staff. happy to be a client here! :)”


“i am four months post-procedure, and i couldn’t be happier with my results. dr. weston did amazing work and was a pleasure to communicate with throughout the process. the entire staff has been so friendly and efficient. i highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for a cosmetic surgeon.”
–jordan, reston, va, cosmetic surgery patient.


"“my transformation with austin-weston has been nothing short of exemplary. my journey started with wilma, who was attentive to what i was looking to achieve, helped to customize a plan for me, and really felt like a true friend as she recalled personal details i shared with her every time we met. when i met dr. weston at my first consult my immediate impression of him was he's a kind individual who is honest and wants to provide the best results he can. we worked together as a team to make a plan and i felt comfortable every step of the way. we decided on an extended tummy tuck, liposuction to the upper back and flanks, breast lift, and silicon implants. i was never pushed or urged in any direction and was provided all the options so we could make the best choice together. the team made me feel comfortable the day of surgery (i was very nervous as i'd never had surgery before) and were extremely attentive with all my needs and concerns. dr. kochuba assisted with my post operative care. his gentle demeanor and transparency with all the questions i had helped affirm my healing was going just fine and i was doing incredibly well."


"i highly recommend the team at austin-weston center for cosmetic surgery in reston, va for any cosmetic procedures. i had done 5 or 6 other consults before coming to this center. none of them compared in regards to the level of trust and expetise, attention to detail, and genuine care i received from the whole team from consult to final result assessment. should i need any future services, i wouldn't consider going anywhere else but here.”


“dr. weston and dr. k took great care of me!! i would recommend this practice above anyone else! all the staff is very helpful and understanding. they make you feel like part of the family! i have had a reverse tummy tuck, and my arms and my upper body taken care of by them, and i am now looking forward to having my legs taken care of as well! would not trust anyone else but them!!” 
–anthony m., reston, va, reverse tummy tuck patient.


“i am currently 4 months post-op from my breast augmentation with dr. andrew kochuba and have nothing but positive things to say. i had no idea what to expect when i walked through the doors at my first consultation but instantly felt comfortable. …as an rn and coming from a medical healthcare background myself, i am extremely impressed with dr. kochuba's bedside manner and professionalism.” 
–claire k., reston, va, breast augmentation patient.


“shima is the best, i’ve seen shima at austin weston for 2 years, and she just did my halo (resurfacing laser), and i love it. my skin is glowing and feels a lot nicer and healthier. she made me feel very comfortable and explained the post instructions clearly, and follow up with me. i had the best experience and can’t wait to go back and see her. highly recommend shima.”
 –nirmin j., reston, va, laser resurfacing patient.


“austin weston, and more specifically dr. sigal and his supporting staff were absolutely amazing. from my consultation appointment to scheduling, pre-op, surgery, and post-op… i couldn’t have asked for better care. i had four-year-old implants where i developed severe capsular contraction in one breast. my upcoming wedding placed an urgency on fixing my breast, and the whole team was phenomenal in getting me scheduled and creating the most perfect results. i can’t thank dr. sigal and the office enough.”
–lindsey y., reston, va, breast revision patient.

body sculpting after weight loss in reston, va

take the final step of your weight loss journey








significant weight loss is an accomplishment that should be celebrated and
            enjoyed.
            however, many patients find that loose skin after weight loss can affect confidence, comfort, health, and
            overall wellness.
chafing and rubbing can be a source of constant discomfort, shopping for clothes can
            be difficult, and loose skin can conceal the full effects of your hard work and dedication to a healthier
            life. after-weight loss surgery allows you to show off your hard work by eliminating excess skin and refining your body’s contours. our expert plastic surgeons specialize in body contouring after weight loss, helping
            patients achieve their most enjoyable treatment experience, exquisite results, and the life they have
            envisioned. for the best body sculpting after weight loss on the east coast, schedule your consultation with
            one of our world-renowned surgeons.
