 on may 1, 2024, the centre for the study of living standards in collaboration with the ymca released the report entitled "addressing the early childhood educator labour shortages in canada: challenges, solutions and impacts "  by alisaleh shariati. based on the review of the literature related to the labour supply of eces, it finds that 25 per cent increase in ece wages would bring sufficient eces to support the expansion of the child care system in canada. 
the report then employs two methodologies to estimate the potential increase in maternal labour force participation that could be forthcoming from expanded child care and estimates that higher ece wages could increase the labour force participation of mothers with children 0-5 by an annual average rate of of 1.51 to 1.68 percentage points. this increase in labour force participation can boost the canadian gdp by $2.25 to $2.48 billion per year. at a price tag of $1.2 billion, this represents a benefits-to-cost ratio of up to 1.88 to 2.06.  moreover, the report discusses the potential long-term effects of an adequately staffed universal child care system on children's development, quality of care and fertility rates.

 on dec 14, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards released the report entitled  "a detailed analysis of canada's post-2000 productivity performance and pandemic-era productivity slowdown" by chris haun. this report contextualizes canada's productivity performance and leverages recent statistics canada and oecd data to identify the sources of the post-2000 productivity slowdown in the country. through comparisons with the united states and other peer countries in the oecd, canada's productivity performance is characterized as relatively poor but hardly exceptional. by utilizing the csls's own decomposition framework as well as statistics canada growth accounting estimates, the report finds that a) the post-2000 slowdown has been driven primarily by trends in within-sector productivity and b) the slowdown reflects broad deterioration in all three primary sources of growth (multifactor productivity, capital intensity, and labour quality). given the persistent challenges facing the canadian economy like enduring supply chain constraints and fading investment (particularly in ict), the path back to 1% annual productivity growth is framed as a narrow one.

 on dec 5, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards released the report entitled  "an econometric analysis of the impact of broadband internet on productivity" authored by csls deputy executive director dr. timothy sargent. the study was commissioned by telus. spanning 116 countries over the period 2009-2019, the report reveals the substantial role broadband internet plays in driving productivity across nations, both developed and developing. in canada, broadband internet is estimated to have contributed 0.16 percentage points annually to productivity growth. this accounts for a notable 17% of canada's aggregate labour productivity growth over the decade. the press release is available here.

 on november 17, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards (csls) released the report by adriana suuronen  "a detailed analysis of labour productivity development in new brunswick, 1997-2022". this report analyzes labour productivity developments in new brunswick at the aggregate level and for two-digit naics industries between 1997 and 2022. total economy labour productivity increased in new brunswick by 1.05 percent per year over the period, similarly to canda's growth rate of 1.12 percent per year. nevertheless, the level of labour productivity in new brunswick was only 80.5 percent of canada's value in 2022.

 on october 6, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards (csls) released the report by adriana suuronen  "the recovery of the new brunswick provinical government fiscal situation". this report describes the trends of the fiscal situation in new brunswick between 1990-1991 and 2021-2022 and explores how policy decisions regarding the revenues and expenditures of the provincial government have led to the recovery of the new brunswick fiscal situation since 2009-2010. this report also analyzes the debate on how new brunswick should move forward concerning their budget balance. the overall findings indicate that the recovery of the new brunswick provincial government fiscal situation was largely due to an increase in equalization payments and a decrease in expenditure in the province.

 on september 28, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards (csls) deputy director tim sargent gave a presentation entitled "twin transitions and inclusiveness" in the closing panel of the oecd global forum on productivity which took place in santiago, chile. the presentation explored the challenges facing governments in addressing the trilemma of ensuring economic growth and at the same time promoting the green transition and social inclusiveness. the presentation is available  here.

 on september 15, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards (csls) released the report  "literature review of the economic impacts of broadband". this comprehensive literature review examines the economic impacts of broadband, with a focus on productivity and economic growth. the report explores various measures used to quantify broadband impacts, including penetration rates, speed, and technology adoption. overall, findings indicate a generally positive association between broadband penetration and output and labour productivity, despite some mixed results from earlier studies. more recent studies with improved methodologies consistently demonstrate a positive impact. similarly, studies on tfp and employment reveal a positive influence of broadband.

 on september 6, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards (csls) and the centre for international governance innovation (cigi) released the report  "valuing data: where are we and where do we go next?"  written by csls deputy executive director tim sargent. this report looks at measuring the value of data in national accounts using three different categories of data-related assets: data itself, databases and data science. the focus then turns to three recent studies by statistical agencies in canada, the netherlands and the united states to examine how each country uses a cost-based analysis to value data-related assets. the report concludes with recommendations that include widening data-valuation efforts to the public sector, which is a major holder of data. the social value of data also needs to be calculated by considering both the positive and negative aspects of data-related investment and use. appropriate data governance strategies are needed to ensure that data is being used for everyone's benefit.

 on national indigenous peoples day, june 21, 2023, the centre for the study of living standards (csls) and the indigenous education organization indspire released the report  "the contribution of indigenous people to future labour force growth in canada: an update".the report finds that if labour force participation rate gaps between indigenous and non-indigenous groups do not change, indigenous people, who were 4.6 per cent of the labour force in 2021, will be responsible for 10 per cent of total labour force growth in canada to 2041. if the participation rate gaps were to close, this contribution would rise to 15 per cent.

on august 21, 2018 
the centre for the study of living standards (csls) released the report 
âlong-term fiscal and economic projections for canada and the provinces and territories, 2017-2038: an update.â 
this report updates economic projections for canada and the provinces from a csls 2015 study (drummond and capeluck, 2015) 
with new data from 2015, 2016 and 2017. the csls projections are based on a supply-side methodology where potential real 
output growth is determined by trend labour productivity growth and potential labour supply growth, expressed in terms 
of total hours. the csls currently projects real output growth of 1.6 per cent per year for canada for the 2017-2038 period, 
based on labour productivity growth of 1.0 per cent and labour input growth of 0.6 per cent. for ontario, the csls projects 
real output growth of 1.5 per cent based on 0.9 per cent labour productivity growth and 0.6 per cent for labour input growth. 
in both cases, the csls projections are less rosy than other forecasters due to more pessimistic outlook for labour productivity growth. 





on august 16, 2018 
the csls released a report prepared by myeongwan kim for innovation, science, and economic development canada 
entitled âweak ict investment in canada and the united state: the role of cloud computing.â


after robust growth in ict investment in canada and the united states during the 1980s and 1990s, 
growth in ict investment started to slow after 2000 and its share in gdp entered a downward trajectory. 
to explain this trend, we focus on two facets of the changing ict spending pattern driven by the rise 
in cloud computing starting in the mid-2000s. instead of investing in ict capital goods, organizations 
now purchase cloud services from cloud service providers that appear to be more efficient in producing 
computing services. second, cloud service providers undertake substantial own-account investment in 
ict equipment which is not counted in official statistics. we find that spending on cloud services 
in both canada and the united states rose substantially from the mid-2000s. also, adding own-account 
ict equipment investment by cloud service providers results in additional 1.7 percentage-points 
in annual growth for nominal ict investment in canada and additional 1.1 percentage-points in the united states.


a press release is available. 





on august 15, 2018 
the csls released two reports prepared by myeongwan kim for global affairs canada entitled 

ârising import competition in canada and its employment effect by skill 
group: evidence from the china shockâ and  

ârising import competition in canada and its employment effect by gender: evidence from the china shock.â


it is well known that there has been a secular decline in the manufacturing 
share of total employment in canada, with the decline accelerating after 2000. 
among the factors that contributed to that trend, this report focuses on rising 
chinese import competition in canada, which also accelerated after 2000. 
we find that the trade-induced job loss in manufacturing amounts to 113.5 thousand 
during the 2001-2011 period but the loss was not equally distributed across skill groups. 
we estimate that the loss was largely driven by: low-skilled occupations (89.8 thousand) when analyzed by skill level; 
and occupations in services (57.6 thousand), technical/paraprofessional (12.1 thousand), and production (51.8 thousand) 
when analyzed by skill type. a trade-induced job loss in manufacturing is also estimated by gender. 
we find that females had a larger loss than males did in relative terms in all skill groups. 
lastly, the labour reallocation in response to a trade shock is found to be important in offsetting 
the negative employment effect, but the degree of reallocation varies across skill groups and genders.
