 chamber of commerce chair 








as we step into 2025, i am both humbled and honored to serve as your chamber of commerce chair.  as we get rolling into february, i would like to reflect on the achievements of last year and look ahead to the opportunities that await us.this past year, we witnessed the strength, innovation, and resilience that define our local businesses and the chamber. from the small startups to the long-established enterprises, each of you plays a vital role in shaping our local economy and enriching the lives of our community.  your hard work and commitment inspire me, and it is a privilege to represent such an outstanding network of professionals.   a few of the major accomplishments of the chamber in 2024 were:hiring our new ceo, jim ponek, to replace the long-time face of the chamber, donna tucker (happy retirement donna!!!!)re-establishing the chamber’s amazing website (which had been hacked)big and better events! – 31st annual golf classic, 4th annual casino night, military appreciation picnic, riverfest)graduated leadership santa rosa class 37chamber secured a new 15-year loan on our building with united bank!as your chair, my vision for this year is simple yet powerful: growth, impact, and collaboration.growth – with the continued growth of santa rosa county, it is imperative the chamber continues to grow- both in membership numbers and in the services that it provides to its membership. your success is our success, and we will prioritize initiatives that drive sustainable growth across all sectors.impact – the chamber and its committee’s spend countless hours planning, reviewing, and executing the numerous events that promote the chamber membership and the body of work the chamber performs throughout the year. these include leadership santa rosa, the ambassadors program, networking events (chamber breakfasts, business after hours), ribbon cuttings, business of the month, weekly chamber calendar, rise grant, the santa rosan newsletter, and countless other benefits that enable membership to promote their business and meet leaders of county businesses.   2025 will also open the possibilities of your chamber building on avalon blvd – various events will be held on site that will showcase the chamber, and a new meeting room/rental space is available to members.collaboration – together, we are stronger. deeper partnerships between businesses, local government and community organizations are needed to keep moving the chamber forward.  let’s break down silos and work together to tackle challenges as they arise and seize opportunities.none of this will be possible without your involvement.  your voice, ideas, and passion are what make the santa rosa county chamber thrive.  i encourage each of you to engage, participate, and share your vision for what we can achieve together.little shout out to frank hoskins, the outgoing chamber chair.  thanks for your service and guidance as i move into this position.  i look forward to serving as your president and working alongside each of you to make this a remarkable year.here’s to a prosperous and inspiring year ahead!
