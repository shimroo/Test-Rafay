      busy week.went to las vegas thursday - sunday with jeff. we stayed at bellagio! he still has to upload pics, so ill just post pics later.  wax museum was fun, nyny rollercoaster (he doesnt like them or heights and rode it with me!!), saw an awesome cirque de soliel show love (all beatles music) eyes wide and mouth agape the whole time, (skating, bungees, trampolines all sorts of crazy shit!), didnt lose too much money (mostly played penny and nickel slots)then on monday went to a super great show with brent and jeff at bottom lounge. stereo total, leslie & the lys, and pure magical love (local band)pure magical love was awesome!!!  girls dancing around in panties and electrical tape, acting out a whole story and then killing a guy at the end. (and local!!)leslie & the lys so much fun, i like her raps.  she had a few fans that dressed like her. one girl was super intense and was so honored she was given the tiger shoulder pad to fix the fringe on...she took her job very seriously...i could just see it all over her face.i love stereo total. fun, happy music...and featured in the latest dell commercial.  i like to try to sing along even though i dont know french or german, i know some of the choruses.  i got pulled up on stage to sing and dance along to l'amour a trois!!  i felt so bad i didnt know more lyrics to it!!  but i had the chorus.  i froze when she asked me up but luckily brent started pushing my ass up there and i just stared and focused on her the whole time as we sang (and i tried to keep up)  no pictures of that, cause i had the camera, but i got some pics with her after the show.great great show!!my building brought in contractors to fix a bunch of stuff and its been awesome for me.  got my tub leveled, bathroom painted the most beautiful glossy blue (i smile as i look in everytime i walk by...i really love blues), put in a trap that was missing attached to the tub, and they are coming back monday to caulk and grout the bathroom tiles, then sometime fix some water damage and a tuckpointing issue over my front windows.jeff is in ohio this weekend, so i am holing up.  got 5 movies from blockbuster, a bunch of crosswords, the latest issue of time out magazine to go through, and a beautiful blue bathroom.  i have been hiding in my bedroom, eating, tv, movies everything all in bed.  its been very luxurious!  bought some pound cake to toast and some cook and serve chocolate pudding to put on it.im going to stay in bed all weekend!pure magical loveleslie & the lysstereo total

      ok so i been super busy with work, having lots of people staying over my place..dogs too.and when it starts getting dark at 3:30 and it super cold..and from thanksgiving on seems to be such a blur of doing so many things and so many things still to do.been run downjust tiredi keep real busy, cleaning a lot, like vacuuming 5 times a day, laundry, at least 3-4 grocery store trips a week, plus i dust 2-3 times a week, clean floors once a week etc etc, then i work all hours and all days very often, then thrown in some social obligations on top...jeff had plans to go to indiana for work, to do some installs, and asked if i wanted to go with him.stay in hotels with wifi, so i could work from the hotel room. no chores, laundry or grocery shopping to do.  just a pool, hot tub and a big fluffy bed.  bliss!!nevermind the fact that i hate indiana. its just gross and depressing there.  people always say "well what about indianapolis" thats like people in flint saying "well what about detroit".  gary is the armpit of indiana, so that makes me in the belly button right now which is terra haute.  there is nothing here, places are empty.  but the hotel is really nice and so is the hot tub...so i am happy.

      been busybeen run downbut i'm resting nowright nowso anyways, last tuesday was jeff's big birthday. i wanted to make it special.his brother helped me by supplying some old pics of him so i could make him a special cake, and i made reservations at chuck e cheese!it was a great party, we all had a wonderful time.did the cokes, pizza thing, and we all got tokens as a part of the birthday package, and i used some coupons so we could get more.after we ate for a bit, they brought chuck e cheese out!!  we sang happy birthday, did a birthday parade around the table area then lined up in front of the stage for the finale.jeff got birthday bot balloons, and a gold medal.then we spent the rest of the night spending our tokens and playing games.  my favorite is the sketch machine in the kiddie area, better and cheaper then photo booths!!!thank you everyone for coming out that snowy weeknight and making it really special for jeff!

      omg i so freaking hate that "im joe the plumber" commercials.what fucking idiots!!you are all unlicensed, non-tax paying people worried about being the 5% of all people that will get higher taxes??!!unless you are super super rich...your taxes wont go up.  small business...not likely.no plumber, carpenter, teacher, fireman, cop, etc will ever make enough that their taxes will go up!clean out your fucking ears!!

fatburger finally came to the midwest!!!yesterday jeff and i took a mini road trip to orland park to visit the fatburger that just opened there this week.  i was worried it wouldnt be as good as the one i went to in las vegas but it was!! milkshake, fat fries and a fatburger (no relish, no pickle)  so good. i was hamburger giddy the whole time i was therethank you kanye west for bringing us fatburger!! this is the first in a chain of them he is bringing to chicago.had food coma for awhile after that, but then got it together enough to get together with a group for rollerderby.  chicago outfit vs hammer city roller girls.  we won! last game of the season.

      had a good weekend. hung out with friends saturday and sunday.  concert last night.date night friday night with jeff, crashed an art show that had open bar. (and some really neat art!!!)i still feel bad about jesus. i failed him. i love him and miss him and it hurts, but i know i made the right decision.  i just feel really bad for letting him down.  but...that's for me to beat myself up about not some anonymous person that wasn't with me scrubbing my floors at 1am, and washing rugs everyday.  you pay to get my car detailed cunt!anonymous said..."maybe you should consider not having a dog. considering they are a lot of responsibility....instead of taking one in and then sending it back to the shelter because it's "too much work" " i said..."easy to say when you are anonymous, not cleaning up barf and pee 5 to 8 times a day and spending $3000 in 3 months at the vet to get a dog in good health that you just got from a place that didn't say the dog was a special needs dog when that sure as hell is special needs.dont think you are superior and don't fucking judge me cunt."
