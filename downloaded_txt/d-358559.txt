welcome to the website of pulitzer prize-winning author edward humesi'm a southern california journalist and author of 17 nonfiction books. my passion is narrative nonfiction and immersion journalism— writing it, teaching it, and spending days, weeks, months or more immersed in hidden worlds researching it. burrowing deep to uncover the humanity behind the headlines—stories of crime, injustice, and the environment—is what i call the art of being there. i’m happiest when i’m the fly on the wall in the most fascinating places and moments. but when i need to be, i can be the fly in the ointment, too. you can read more about me and my work here. find my substack newsletter here. thank you for joining me.















total garbagehow we can fix our waste and heal our worldtotal garbage is my latest deep dive narrative, exploring the hidden world of the biggest thing we make: waste. it has a cast of characters you’ll love to meet—chefs, students, urban farmers, trash geniuses, thrifters, and whole communities. they’re pioneering an astonishing range of commonsense waste solutions anyone can embrace. they’re showing the rest of us that being less trashy isn’t about giving up what we love. it’s about upgrading to stuff we’ll love more. their story beings with a simple question: what if the looming calamities of climate change, plastic pollution, the energy crisis and our whole environmental doom-scroll are symptoms of just one disease, and it’s something we can actually fix? our planet, in short, has an archvillian called waste. we live in the most wasteful civilization in history. this goes way beyond what we roll to the curb each week. it’s rooted in what we eat and drink and how we cook. waste is the main thing you pay for in your utility bills and at the gas pump. forty percent of our food becomes garbage. micro-plastic trash now in everything around us as well as in us— we are consuming a credit card’s worth of plastic every week! and yet, thinking of such seemingly unsolvable earth-destroying crises as byproducts of waste is powerful and hopeful. there’s no partisan divide where one side says, “yay waste!” instead there are ordinary blue state and red state people at work in our neighborhoods right now, showing us how to tackle waste and the catastrophes it drives — and saving, even making money while doing it. they have grasped the truism at the heart of total garbage: what we choose to use is important, but it’s what we squander that’s killing us.total garbage new paperback edition—order from your favorite booksellerwhat you need to know about plastic pollution, a total garbage excerptmore total garbage links, an excerpt, 5 waste warrior tips that are upgrades, not sacrifices

the art of being theremy new narrative nonfiction newsletterin my new substack newsletter, “the art of being there,” i write about the importance of narrative journalism right now, the latest on total garbage, and the perils of flying with night-vision goggles:journalism in a time like no otheras trump and his regime gut our freedoms, government, democracy and decency, i've been trying to figure out how to adapt my teaching to meet the moment for aspiring journalists in my narrative nonfiction class. lesson plans and writing exercises on foreshadowing and character development suddenly seem a pretty fragile bulwark in the face of unfolding threats to journalism and its practitioners. just this week the ap has been banned by the white house simply for how it refers to a geographic location – the gulf of mexico. the job of journalist has not been this perilous for generations, nor less appreciated. a big part of me just wants to warn my students away.and yet…. i keep coming back to two core beliefs. first: that journalism is a vital calling and part of democracy’s critical safety net–a sacred mission i’ve embraced since my freshman year at hampshire college. second: narrative storytelling….read the rest of this newsletter, and keep up with my books, events and the world of narrative nonfiction and literary journalism, by signing up for a free subscription to the art of being there.

from the prologue of ‘total garbage’the credit cardyou swallowed 285 pieces of plastic today.you will do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. you’ve been doing this for years, and you will likely continue doing it for the rest of your life, like it or not. (spoiler alert: there’s nothing about this to like.)this involuntary seasoning of plastic waste particles is in the food you eat and the water you drink—tap and bottled water alike. it’s in the air, it’s in the dust on your bookshelves, it’s in the soil. your salt shaker has plastic mixed in with the grains. even your favorite ipa or sour ale gifts you with a little bit of plastic with each sip….

 

how this happened and why—and what’s being done to fix it—is just one mystery i unravel  in total garbage. there’s the crazy fact that   two-thirds of our national energy supply is wasted, which means when you pay your monthly electric bill, you're mostly paying for waste. it gets worse: $4 out of every $5 you pay at the gas pump is…. waste. from our trash cans to our tail pipes, our soda bottles to our stoves, from our power plants to what we plant, we are the most wasteful civilization in history.













in total garbage, you’ll find the story of game changers and ordinary people doing extraordinary things to tackle waste and all the health, environmental and economic costs it drives. and they’re showing the rest of us how.you’ll meet residents of a community where people rarely use their gas-powered cars, because they have something better, cheaper, less wasteful, more convenient… and way more fun (and no, this is not about simply swapping gas tanks for batteries). then there's the farm town in front minnesota that has partnered with the local university to go all-in on renewables, making wind and sun one their most important cash crops. they even power the local liquor store with solar (“we chill your beer with the sun!”).you’ll meet the restaurant chefs in pennsylvania and california who are championing a more efficient, healthy, less wasteful way to cook, and the former financier in los angeles who wants to turn your water-wasting lawn into an urban microfarm. and you’ll also meet the single mom in maine who has taken on multinational beverage and snack food giants to reinvent our broken recycling system and force producers of plastic pollution to clean up their mess instead of making taxpayers foot the bill. and she’s just getting started.their collective message: we can do this. we can fix this. it’s not about giving up thing things we love. it’s about upgrading to things we’ll love more. and all it starts with being less trashy. 

 

 what people say about total garbage“this brilliant book will first make you angry and then motivated to do more. there is hope in these pages, something those of us on this warming planet need now more than ever.” —bart elmore, professor of environmental history at ohio state university & author of ‘citizen coke’ and ‘seed money’”our system produces waste almost as if that was its intent; but there are always people thinking deeper and more clearly, and their stories will help you see the possibilities for a very different world!”—bill mckibben, author of ‘the end of nature’“engrossing… convincing… compelling stories of people working successfully to rein in america’s wasteful habits.”—kirkus reviews “you'll be inspired by the ordinary people filling “total garbage”—young and not-so-young, rural and urban, red state and blue—using creativity and common sense to tackle waste in all its forms, and thus tackle the biggest challenges we face. i love this book!” —anne-marie bonneau, author of ‘the zero waste chef’’

 













about edward humes

i’m a southern california journalist and author of 16 nonfiction books, with the latest, the forever witness, coming nov. 29, 2022. my work has earned a pulitzer prize and a pen award, among other honors.as a narrative nonfiction writer i spend months, sometimes years, immersed in the lives and worlds of my characters. i gravitate most often toward human stories about the justice system, science, nature and sustainability. sometimes these subjects intersect in the same book. the forever witness is about the disappearance and murder of a young couple, a 32-year-old cold-case investigation, and the emergence of a revolutionary new crime-fighting science, genetic genealogy.right now i’m deep into a follow-up book to my campus-read favorite, garbology: our dirty love affair with trash, a story about how wasteful americans are without knowing it. garbology has been a “one book” community read at 30 campuses, cities and towns across the country.meanwhile, my bestselling mississippi mud, a true-crime murder mystery set in a historic gulf coast city steeped in corruption, is being developed as a series by immersive pictures. no matter how loud i shout takes readers inside the secretive world of juvenile justice and the lives of young people trapped in a dysfunctional system. shout received a pen award for research nonfiction and the investigative editors and reporters book prize. after publication, i was invited to testify before the u.s. senate and the california legislature about my year of immersion in the juvenile system, which included teaching a writing class to teenagers on the high-risk offender unit at central juvenile hall. a poem by one boy inspired the book’s title—and won a city-wide writing contest.often the stories continue after publication. my book burned, about flawed forensic science that sent a los angeles woman to prison, helped lead to her release, and took readers inside the world of the california innocence project. here’s are some previously untold stories and new happy endings from some of my books. some background: for the past few years i’ve divided my time between seattle and our long-time home in southern california. i grew up in philadelphia and graduated from hampshire college in amherst, mass. i had no pets growing up but have made up for that shortcoming by having a family home filled with a variety of critters, including rescued greyhounds.i volunteer with the greysave rescue group, and during the pandemic, my family fostered seven dogs coming off the racetrack. the latest additions to my office staff are valiant and dottie, the two greyhounds pictured above.

the forever witness

the forever witness: how dna and genealogy solved a cold case murder, by pulitzer prize-winning author edward humes, is the new true crime book about one of the pacific northwest's most enduring mysteries, the disappearance and deaths of tanya van cuylenborg and jay cook.











in this brilliantly told, addictively readable book, edward humes reminds us that the term “cold case” is misleading, that unsolved murders simmer for decades with angry life, grief and the long shadow of justice denied. and he also reminds us to hope that the answers to our most stubborn mysteries can yet be found if we simply refuse to give up on them.  — deborah blum, nyt bestselling author of the poisoner's handbookengrossing…. humes' writing is suspenseful yet also journalistic, providing fascinating details about the case, technological advances in police work, and genetic genealogy. a winner for any fan of true crime.   — booklist starred review in november 1987, a young couple on an overnight trip to seattle vanished without a trace. a week later, the bodies of tanya van cuylenborg and her boyfriend jay cook were found in rural washington. it was a brutal crime, and it was the perfect crime: with few clues and no witnesses, an international manhunt turned up empty, and the sensational case that shocked the pacific northwest gradually slipped from the headlines. in deep-freeze, long-term storage, biological evidence from the crime sat waiting, as detective jim scharf poured over old case files looking for clues his predecessors missed. meanwhile, 1,200 miles away in california, cece moore began her lifelong fascination with genetic genealogy, a powerful forensic tool that emerged not from the crime lab, but through the wildly popular home dna ancestry tests purchased by more than 40 million americans. when scharf decided to send the cold case’s decades-old dna to parabon nanolabs, he hoped he would finally bring closure to the van cuylenborg and cook families. he didn’t know that he and moore would make history.genetic genealogy, long the province of family tree hobbyists and adoptees seeking  birth families, has become a cold case solution machine, exposing the darkest secrets of seemingly upstanding citizens. in the hands of a tenacious detective like scharf, it has solved one baffling killing after another. but its sheer power has sparked a national debate: can we use dna to catch the murderers among us, yet still protect our last shred of privacy in the digital age—the right to the very blueprint of who we are?

common read favorite, garbologywe are the world's trashiest people. waste is america's leading product and largest export. each of us is on track to toss 102 tons of trash in life—7.1 pounds a day, every day. the epic waste embedded in our daily lives not only leads the world, it drives many of the era's greatest crises—in energy, climate, pollution, security and the economy. the good news? garbology is also the story of families discovering the joys of zero waste. artists producing masterpieces at the dump. businesses being less trashy to serve both profit and planet. it turns out waste is the one big problem each of us can do something about—if we remove our blinders and take some simple steps to lead less wasteful lives.i have found these issues resonate deeply with many, especially young people. over the past year i have visited schools from coast to coast, meeting students and innovators of all ages who are coming up with fresh ways to turn trash into treasure. "fascinating… zestful in his curiosity and irrepressible in his vivid chronicling."           — booklist (starred review)more reviewspenguin random house speakers bureauread more, including garbology tips & readers guides















monstrous killer or innocent mother?introducing burnedread this book now. not only because ‘burned’ is one of the most important critiques of forensic 'science' ever written but because it will shock, move and enlighten you. explosive but sobering, ‘burned’ plows through decades of received myth and junk science to reveal the sometimes tragic mistakes in our criminal justice system. humes, as always, is humane and provocative. reporting like this is a big reason our republic is still mostly in one piece.— t. jefferson parker, bestselling author of “swiftvengeance” and “the room of white fire” on an april night in 1989, three small children perished in a los angeles apartment fire. their twenty-three-year-old mother, jo ann parks, escaped unharmed, the sole survivor and only eyewitness. though they at first believed the fire had been a tragic accident, arson investigators soon decided that parks had sabotaged wiring, set several fires herself, and even barricaded her four-year-old son inside a closet to make sure he could not escape the flames. authorities  pronounced parks one of the most monstrous killers in los angeles history, motivated by a desire to be free of parental responsibilities and eager to cash in by suing her landlords. convicted through the power of forensic fire science, parks remains in prison to this day, sentenced to life without possibility of parole. more than a quarter century later, however, there has been a revolution in the science of fire. much of what was thought to be gospel in 1989 has been revealed to be myth and guesswork disguised as science. now the parks case has been reopened and re-investigated, the subject of an intense legal battle stretching over ten months of  hearings in los angeles county superior court. lawyers at the california innocence project are trying to prove that false assumptions, tunnel vision and outright bias infected the parks case from day one. they argue this not only led to the wrongful conviction of an innocent mother, but also turned a terrible accident into a triple homicide case —condemning parks to life in prison for a crime that never happened. will jo ann parks be exonerated? should she be? is she “patient zero” in an epidemic of wrongful arson convictions waiting to be overturned? or can prosecutors come up with enough evidence from the ashes to make sure she dies in prison? no matter how it turns out, someone will be left burned. read an excerpt of burned.read original burned case-file documents.about edwards humes, including links to articles and reviews
