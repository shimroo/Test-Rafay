computational science and engineering (cse) is a rapidly developing field that brings together applied mathematics (especially numerical analysis), computer science, and scientific or engineering applications. cse focuses on developing problem-solving methodologies and robust tools for numerical simulation. to understand phenomena and processes in science and engineering, we no longer have to rely solely on theories and experiments, but can also use computations. numerical simulations can complement experiments and can even enable the study of systems and problems that would be too time-consuming, too expensive, or too dangerous (if possible at all) using experiments alone.
the high level of detail and realism of these simulations requires advanced skills in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, efficient algorithms, computer architecture, software design and implementation, as well as validation and visualization of results. this program equips engineering, science, or mathematics graduates with the skills needed for a successful professional or academic career in cse.
for more details: the talk on "computational science education at the technical university of munich" by the cse program director prof. hans-joachim bungartz (from 2016) provides a broader perspective on the cse study program. the ted talk about computational science and engineering by karen willcox (from 2022) provides a more up-to-date view.

					how is the program structured?
				







turbulent flow around a cylinder



the master’s program in computational science and engineering is a multidisciplinary program where the first three semesters focus on lectures, tutorials, and seminars, and the fourth semester is reserved for the master's thesis.
the program covers a wide range of subjects and research areas, including numerical analysis, computer science, scientific computing and various applications such as computational physics, computational fluid dynamics, visualization, and many more. to ensure a broad range of topics as well as excellent expertise in each area, the cse program is offered in cooperation with several tum departments across three tum schools (cit, nat, and ed).
all mandatory modules of the program are taught in english, but some modules within the application areas may be offered bilingually (german lectures and english course material, or vice versa) or be conducted in german, which would allow a broader choice of application areas.










					what further expertise and skills will i acquire?
				



with the degree in m.sc. in computational science and engineering, you will have a comprehensive portfolio of skills in computer science, numerical analysis, scientific computing, and their relevant applications, methods, and techniques.
the computer science curriculum includes the core subjects advanced programming and parallel programming, as well as a choice between computer architecture and networks, basic algorithms, scientific visualization, and patterns in software engineering.
in numerical analysis, the focus is on numerical programming and numerical algorithms for high performance computing.
in addition, you will have acquired both theoretical and practical skills in scientific computing and will be able to apply your theoretical knowledge to current research questions in your individual area of focus.








					what career opportunities do i have afterwards?
				



graduates of the master's program in computational science and engineering can look forward to inspiring careers in this important and dynamic field. computational science and engineering is an emerging discipline that spans all the fields from which it evolved – applied mathematics, engineering and science applications, high-performance computing, and many more. consequently, the employment opportunities and career paths available to graduates of the program are diverse, constantly exploring new areas of application, and typically characterized by a high degree of interdisciplinarity.
thanks to their computational skills, advanced programming skills, and understanding of sophisticated models and algorithms, graduates in computational science and engineering are in demand to solve large-scale problems that were once considered unsolvable.






				disclaimer: university semester fees
			
please be aware that starting from winter semester 2024/25, tuition fees will be charged for students from third countries (outside the european economic area). merit- and need-based scholarships/waivers for these fees will, however, be available. for more information, please refer to: www.tum.de/en/studies/fees/tuition



				application and admission
			




partitioning of the surface of a hammered shark



the program is open to students with a bachelor's or master's degree in a science or engineering discipline. graduates in computer science, applied mathematics or similar areas can also apply, if they followed a suitably interdisciplinary study program.
please note that cse is not a computer science program, and students who wish to pursue such a program are not encouraged to apply to cse. if you are interested in computer science or computer engineering, the informatics master's program is for you. the same is true if your primary interest is robotics or machine learning, as these other programs would likely be a better fit for you.
if you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you will need to demonstrate sufficient expertise in an engineering or science subject. this can be accomplished, for example, by completing an appropriate minor.
in addition, you will have to demonstrate the following skills a solid understanding of mathematics at an advanced level (see "solid basic knowledge of mathematics" below). knowledge of a modern programming language, e.g. c++, java, python, fortran (see "solid basic programming skills" below) very good english language skills (see here) the aptitude test assessment the m.sc. computational science and engineering is a two-stage process in which we assess your qualifications with regard to the special qualitative requirements of this master's program. depending on the results of the first stage, you may be accepted directly, rejected directly, or invited to a telephone interview for the second stage of the selection process.






				application periods
			
winter semester: 1 february – 31 may
note: international applicants are advised to apply early (e.g. by 31 march) to avoid delays in visa procedures and other formal processes. you can still apply by the usual deadline, but risk missing introductory events (if further steps take longer).






					how do i apply?
				





you have to apply for the master's degree via tumonline. after you have created your account in tumonline, please enter the requested personal data and information about your education, and upload the required documents. the application is completely electronic.
prospective students with a bachelor's degree from outside the european union have to request a preliminary examination documentation from uni-assist (vpd) in advance.
only in case of admission you will have to submit some additional documents as certified copies for enrollment.

the following documents have to be submitted for the application (the required documents may vary depending on the applicant):a personal statement (letter of motivation) explaining why you have chosen this particular master’s program and tum specifically. please use this form.analysis of curriculum. please use this form.module descriptions for the courses listed in your transcript and/or analysis of curriculum. your cv/résumé (europass and other formats are accepted)bachelor's degree certificate, including a list of courses and grades or an official transcript of records. documents not issued in german or english must be translated and notarized by a sworn translator.proof of your english language proficiencya passport photoa copy of your passportrequired admission documents for some applicants:gre or gate score for applicants with a b.sc. degree from bangladesh, china, india, iran, pakistan (original scorecard or have the score transmitted directly via ets)preliminary documentation from uni-assist for all applicants with a bachelor's degree from outside the eu/eeaaps certificate for applicants with a bachelor's from china, vietnam or india (as part of your preliminary documentation and later on for enrollment)optional admission documents:
the following documents are not mandatory but help us to get a better impression of the applicant:up to two letters of recommendation. please use this form.a statement certified by your university to confirm your ranking on your former program  (e.g. 3rd best student in a class of 50 graduates)certificates from professional training or additional qualifications related to the program (e.g. participation in research competitions, internships, etc.)description of the grading system of your former university (appended to your transcript)certified copy of university entrance qualification (appended to your additional qualifications)international applicants:
attention: if you did not obtain your bachelor's degree in a country within the eu/eea, you have to upload a preliminary documentation from uni-assist (vpd). in order to get the vpd, you must send the required documents (some as notarized copies!) to uni-assist via post! uni-assist still needs the documents in paper. as the issuance of the vpd usually takes around 4 weeks (but is known to take longer at times!), we highly recommend sending the necessary documents to uni-assist very early. more information on preliminary documentation (vpd) by uni-assist.
also, candidates from specific countries are subject to additional requirements (as indicated above). for more information, check this page.
please do check the requirements for notarization, especially for translations!special requirements for documents apply for certain countries.
the admissions office checks whether your uploaded documents are complete and correct. if this is the case, the department can view your application and forward it to the admissions committee. the admissions committee decides whether your application will be admitted, rejected, or forwarded to the second stage of the aptitude assessment.
for your convenience, a checklist of all documents which are required to apply for cse can be found here. please use it, and do not forget any mandatory documents, because this hinders the processing of your application (i.e., it will not be forwarded to the admission committee until complete).
we have also created a detailed application guide which should answer the most common questions. the guide can be downloaded here. please read it carefully.
note: all fields in the forms provided are digitally fillable, except for the signature fields. if the fields do not display properly or behave unexpectedly (values disappear or are duplicated), please download the file again using a different browser: firefox is known to work, while there are problems with chromium-based browsers.
if you have any trouble, please check our faqs.








					what do i have to consider if i come from abroad? (vpd, gre, aps)?
				



preliminary documentation from uni-assist (vpd)
applicants who have not acquired their qualification for postgraduate studies (usually bachelor) in a country within the eu/eea must apply for a preliminary documentation (vpd) at uni-assist, in addition to the tum application.
which documents have to be submitted to uni-assist?completed application form for vpd (see downloads)a copy of your degree certificate (if available)a copy of your transcript of recordsa translation, if the original documents are not in german or englishif required: certificate of the german academic evaluation center (aps)you do not have to submit a complete application for a specific program to uni-assist, you only have to apply for the general preliminary documentation (vpd).
an application for a vpd via uni-assist alone does not qualify as an application for a degree program at tum.
gre and gate
applicants with a degree from bangladesh, china, india, iran or pakistan have to submit a gre (general) test. we have defined required minimum scores, lower scores will not be accepted.
the required scores are:verbal reasoning: (will not be taken into account anymore)numerical reasoning: 164 (effective 1 september 2022)analytical writing: 4.0 (effective 1 september 2022)institution code: 7806, department: 5199 ("all other departments").
for applicants from india:
as an applicant from india, you can submit a scorecard of the indian gate test (in an engineering field!) as an alternative if you are not from an iit. the minimum qualifying score for the relevant year is required. students from an iit can directly upload their transcript in the application portal instead of gre or gate.
certificate from the german evaluation center (akademischen prüfstelle, aps)
applicants with an undergraduate degree from china, india and vietnam have to submit a certificate from the german evaluation center (aps).








					qualification requirements and assessment process
				



the program is open to students who have earned a bachelor's or master's degree in one of the following disciplines:engineering (e.g. mechanical, civil, electrical, etc.)science (e.g. physics, biology, chemistry, etc.)informatics / computer science (be aware that cse is not computer science, m.sc. informatics)applied mathematicsan equivalent subjectif you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you must demonstrate sufficient knowledge in an engineering or science subject. this can be done, for example, by taking the appropriate subject as a minor.
in addition, you will need to prove you have the following skills:
solid basic knowledge in mathematics
solid basic knowledge in mathematics is indispensable for participation in the cse master's program. you should be able to demonstrate good knowledge in the topics taught in the mathematics courses of a german bachelor in engineering, i.e. linear algebra and integral and vector calculus, in the best case also numerics and stochastics.
solid basic programming skills
besides the solid basic knowledge in mathematics, skills in a modern (object-oriented) programming language (e.g., c++, java, python, fortran, julia, rust, etc.) are needed. these need to be demonstrated by courses taken as part of your previous degree program(s). you may also point out respective experience in your cv or via additional certificates.
solid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciences
depending on your specific course of study, you should also have solid skills in engineering fundamentals (technical mechanics, materials science, circuit theory, etc.) and/or natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biophysics, etc.), typically within the first 4-5 semesters of your studies, as well as advanced knowledge in the specific area of specialization corresponding to your course of study (generally, courses from the latter semesters). this could, for instance, comprise: thermodynamics, heat/mass transfer, mechanical processes, hydro-mechanics, thermal processes, reaction engineering, power engineering, control systems, communications engineering, sensor technology, theoretical physics, nuclear physics, quantum physics, statistical mechanics, biotechnology, organic chemistry, etc.
please have a look at the bachelor programs at tum and the corresponding number of ects in mathematical, programming, fundamentals and course-specific subjects:mechanical engineeringcivil engineeringelectrical and computer engineeringphysicsbiochemistryif you graduated from a different program, please compare with the program which is closest to your program in terms of competences. as a rule of thumb, you should roughly have at least 25 ects in mathematics, 10 ects in programming, 50 ects in fundamentals, and 30 ects in your specialization. in any case, make sure to list all relevant courses in the curricular analysis document!
assessment process
the assessment process for cse is described in detail in the program-specific academic and examination regulations (fpso). a brief summary of this process is provided here for convenience.
assessment runs in two stages:
stage 1: we assess your application documents based on the following criteria:academic background and relevant competencies (max. 40 points) (*):solid basic knowledge in mathematics (10 points)solid basic programming skills (10 points)solid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciencesfundamentals (10 points)subject-specific knowledge (10 points)grade point average (max. 15 points) (*)motivational letter (plus cv and additional documents) (max. 25 points)≥55 points → admission (✓)40–54 points → proceed to stage 2<40 points → rejection (✗)
stage 2: you'll be invited to an admission interview where we will ask about your motivation, background, previous experience, etc. (max. 45 points)
the scores from (*) and stage 2 are then added together:
≥60 points → admission (✓)<60 points → rejection (✗)

				during your studies
			
all important information for the start of the program will be covered in the informatics-wide orientation program.
for the successful completion of the master's program in computational science and engineering, 120 credits are required: lectures, exercises, and practical courses from required and elective modules (90 credits) master's thesis (30 credits) detailed information can be found below. for more information, see degree program contents.





					required modules
				



 computer science, required (section a): 10 credits scientific computing (section c): 31 credits 	this includes a seminar (5 ects) and a practical course (10 ects) which can be chosen according to your interests.   list of required modules








					elective modules
				



to complete the cse program, you must attend 49 ects of elective courses. the area of elective modules is split into 4 parts: computer science – electives (section a) applied mathematics (section b) application areas of cse (section d). this section is further split into 6 different catalogs other electives (section e) a minimum number of ects must be obtained from each of the first three sections: 10 for computer science, 16 for applied mathematics, and 8 from a single catalog in section d. the remaining (up to 15) ects can be covered by elective modules from any section or catalog.
thus, the above can be summarized as follows:
you must earn a total of at least 49 ects from elective modules, subject to the following rules. you must earn at least 10 ects from the section a electives. you must earn at least 16 ects from the section b electives. you must earn at least 8 ects from one d catalog. remaining ects (up to 15) can be earned from any section or catalog. overview of the elective modules








					advanced practical course cse
				



the advanced practical course (lab) is a mandatory module in which cse students choose a practical lab course with a topic suitable for cse. students then usually work in groups on a larger project. such a lab course has 10 ects and provides a large amount of practical and social skills.
registration for practical courses typically follows the matching process. read more about this under "course registration".








					cse seminar scientific computing 
				



the seminar scientific computing is a special type of module, different from usual lectures or lab courses: it involves studying a selected topic with the individual guide of a tum researcher. students are then usually asked to write a scientific report and give a talk for the rest of the seminar participants. the grade is often determined by both the report and the talk.
registration for seminar courses typically follows the matching process. read more about this under "course registration"








					course & exam registration
				



registration for courses is usually done via tumonline. there you can look up lectures, tutor/exercise groups and exams – and register. information about tumonline can be found here. please note that registering for a lecture does not automatically mean registering for the corresponding tutor group, exercise group or exam. the same applies to retakes of exams: each process is completely independent of the others. this means that you have to register separately in order to participate in the tutor group or the exam. especially for exam registration, a late registration is not possible!
please note that the registration modalities for certain courses might be slightly different: seminars and lab courses, for example, may require participation in the matching process. in addition, a mandatory kickoff session is often offered. this usually takes place at the end of the semester prior to the semester in which the course is offered. this means that if you plan to attend a seminar in the summer 24 or winter 24/25 semester, you should find out how to register for the seminar and plan your studies one month before the end of the class period of the winter 23/24 or summer semester 24 respectively. if you miss the kickoff session, it may no longer be possible to register for the course or you may already be missing important information. in any case, please contact the course organizer directly instead of us, since we play no role in the matching process.






				cse-specific processes
			





					honors program
				



the bavarian graduate school of computational engineering (bgce) is an association of three master’s programs: computational science and engineering (cse, i.e., this program; taught at tum) computational mechanics (come, taught at tum) computational engineering (ce) (at university erlangen-nuremberg) the bgce honors track, an elite program within the bavarian elite network, offers additional courses to the most capable and dedicated students in each of the partner's degree programs. the honors track program aims to enhance both the academic training and personal skills of the selected students. the additional effort, in addition to outstanding performance in the regular master's program, is rewarded with excellent networking opportunities and the designation "with honors," a hallmark of academic excellence.
the following documents contain the regulations for obtaining the "master of science" with honors degree:     valid since... german english   examination regulations (fpso) may 02, 2019 pdf -   examination regulations (fpso) apr 07, 2016 pdf -   examination regulations (fpso) aug 23, 2012 pdf -   examination regulations (fpso) apr 07, 2005 pdf -    the examination regulations from 2019 apply to students who started the honor's program in 2019 or later. the examination regulations from 2016 apply to students who started the honor's program in 2017 or later. the examination regulations from 2012 apply to students who started the honor's program in 2013 or later. the examination regulations from 2005 apply to students who started the honor's program in 2012 or earlier. for more details on the honors program and its curriculum, please see the program website.








					examinations and regulations
				



detailed information can be found under examinations.
the following regulations apply to all students:the general examination and study regulations of tum (allgemeine prüfungs- und studienordnung, apso - latest update from feb. 13, 2024, latest full version from aug. 08, 2022)the program-specific academic and examination regulations (fachprüfungs- und studienordnung, fpso - latest version from feb. 19, 2024)the applicable version will depend on when you started:starting ws 2024/25: pdfafter ws 2021/22: pdfafter ws 2017/18: pdfafter ws 2012/13: pdfplease note that the german versions of each set of regulations are the official documents; only the german text is legally binding. where available, english translations of the regulations are provided for your convenience.
for the full list of examination regulations, please check statutes & regulations on tum.de.








					recognitions
				



it is possible to transfer credits from your previous studies (or from an exchange program) to your cse degree plan. recognition is regulated by apso §16. there are three types of recognition: recognition of examinations taken at a higher education institution abroad, e.g. from your previous studies. recognition of examinations taken during a stay abroad during your cse studies. consecutive recognition of examinations taken during a bachelor's or master's program at tum. the following information holds true for the first type of recognition. if you want to transfer examination results according to point two or three, please see below.regulations for recognition (from previous studies)
it is only possible to apply for a recognition during the first year of your cse studies.
documents for recognitionto obtain a recognition, you should submit the following four documents: the application form for recognition. please complete it and sign it. detailed descriptions for the content of each examination from your previous degree program (ideally, an official course syllabus). a transcript of records verifying that you have successfully taken the exam and listing the grade you received in the exam. a grading table specifying the maximum possible grade and the minimum passing grade for the course. this will be used to transfer your grade into the german grading system. in the application form, please specify which cse modules you would like to get recognized. you should also indicate which previous examination results you would like to be considered. it is possible to combine several previous examinations to fulfill the requirements of one cse module. it is also possible to apply for more than just one module recognition. please submit a form for each cse module you wish to obtain recognition for.
the most important documents are the descriptions of the examinations from your previous studies. these should be as detailed possible to ensure that the contents of the examinations (lecture, exercise, seminar, practical course, etc.) cover all the contents of the cse module. if your former university does not provide such a document, you will have to write the description yourself. you should sign the document to confirm that the description is accurate. the more detailed the description is, the greater the chances that it will be approved.
to prove that you actually passed the examination you want to get recognized for cse, you must provide a transcript of records that includes the title of the exam, the scope of the course (amount of credits and/or duration) and the grade you received in the exam. the transcript must be either the original or a certified copy.
to transfer your previous grade into the german grading system, we need a grading table. this grading table must provide at least the following information: best possible grade, worst possible grade, and minimum grade to pass the examination.
process of recognition  fill out the application form completely. provide all required documents listed above and submit them to the cse coordinators. to get an acceptance or rejection as soon as possible, please submit the application within the first four weeks of the winter term.   after checking the formal requirements for the documents, they will be forwarded to the lecturers responsible for the respecitve module. they will check whether the content and scope of your previous examinations cover the content of the tum module.   you will be informed by the secretary of cse about the result and the transferred grade.   finally, you can decide whether to accept the recognition or not, e.g. to get a better grade in the tum module. once you have accepted the recognition, you cannot retake the tum module exam to improve the transferred grade.  regulations for recognition (from a stay abroad)
the recognition should be discussed individually with the cse coordinators before the planned stay. otherwise, chances are that the modules taken might not be recognized for the cse.
regulations for recognition (from another study at tum)
free/additional courses (not used in the previous study's curriculum) or mandatory cse modules (which have already been passed) can be transferred 1:1, meaning that you transfer a module from the former study program at tum into the same module from the cse program. in this case, please only fill out the application form for recognition.








					thesis
				



please be aware that cse has its own examination board and, as such, some regulations differ from other informatics' programs. most importantly, registration, submission, and (when applicable) extensions are processed via the cse coordinators and not via the servicebüro studium (sb-s-in).
the master's thesis should preferably be started after all other program courses have been completed, but this is not a must. however, if the number of missing credits is too high, registration can and will be declined. as a policy, a person at tum always defines the topic officially, but you can conduct your thesis in a variety of settings and get advice from people outside tum:under the supervision of a tum chairthis is the most common choice for cse students. visit the website where tum thesis offers are published to have a first idea of what topics exist. however, not all thesis offers are posted on this website, and not all offers on the page apply to cse! another option is to visit the websites of the research groups that interest you (or the lecturers/tutors of your courses) and contact them directly: it never hurts to ask!at another university or research institutevisit the university's or institute's website to search for a topic of interest.at a companymany of our students start their thesis at a company where they have worked as an intern or a werkstudent, for example.in the last two cases, you will have to make sure that you still find an examiner at tum from one of the cse-related schools (formerly, one of the 7 related departments):tum school of computation, information, and technology (cit): comprising the former departments of informatics (in), mathematics (ma), and electrical and computer engineering (ei)tum school of engineering and design (ed): comprising the former departments of mechanical engineering (mw), and civil, geo and environmental engineering (bgu), andtum school of natural sciences (nat): comprising the former departments of physics (ph) and chemistry (ch).they will process your registration form and grade your thesis. in such a setting, often an external person acts as an assistant advisor/supervisor.
the cse program coordinators often receive thesis offers from institutes at universities, various companies, or former cse students. external offers for theses are usually sent by email, and/or posted at the bulletin board in front of the chair.
each thesis must be examined by one (or two) professor(s) (with “prof.” or “pd” in their title), at least one of whom must be a faculty member at tum. if you wish to complete your thesis at an external company, please make sure to find suitable examiners in time. past students have experienced that it can be difficult to find professors willing to act as examiners for the master's thesis if they did not propose the topic.
the master's thesis should be written in english. the examination board may accept another language (specifically, german), but a summary in english must be included in that case. the summary should not exceed one page (15–20 lines are sufficient).
need help writing in english? the english writing center offers free one-on-one english writing consultation to all members of the tum community. this is a great offer that can improve the quality of your final thesis. take a look at their website and feel free to book an appointment!
for a general overview of all formalities regarding the master's thesis, refer to this information. in particular, note that you must be enrolled throughout the working time of the thesis, up to the moment you submit (see thesis).
the aforementioned portal also includes a collection of tips and tricks regarding theses.
thesis registration
thesis registration defines the topic and the intended start date, and should be submitted as soon as the topic and schedule are decided: this helps narrow the content of the project and sets a deadline for submission. we highly recommend that you submit an abstract of the thesis before officially registering for a topic, in order to ensure that the topic is appropriate for cse. this is especially important if the thesis will be written at an external university, a company, or a non-cse chair at tum. only topics that are related to cse will be accepted!
as of the 15th of january 2024, theses are handled via the koinon-school portal to unify and digitize processes at the school of cit, as well as ensuring that all involved parties are properly informed of any updates in the status of the thesis from registration through submission and final grading.
for consistency, we use the terms supervisor (betreuer in german) -- sometimes formerly referred to as advisor, and examiner (prüfer in german), corresponding to the evaluating prof. or pd -- sometimes formerly referred to as supervisor.
to register for your master's thesis, your supervisor will need to enter your registration on the portal up to two weeks before the official starting date at the earliest (and max. two weeks after start at the latest). you will then be informed via email about the entry, which you have to confirm is correct. this includes theses examined by professors in other departments.
if there are issues with this workflow, please contact us and send your thesis proposal to the examination board (via email or in person to the secretary of the cse examination board) using this registration form. (if you have two tum examiners, please use this form instead.) the form ensures that the examiner(s) agree(s) with supervising the thesis, as we will have to register you manually (in place of the supervisor).
submitting your master's thesis
submission deadline
the master's thesis must be submitted no later than six months after the start date.
note: please make sure in advance that the chosen topic can be handled within the required timeframe. this is especially important if you plan to write your thesis at another university or an external institution, as they may be used to having more time to complete a thesis project.
submission requirements
the use of a proper typesetting system like latex is strongly recommended. please refer to the thesis guidelines and rules for form and delivery while you are working on the thesis. since these thesis guidelines hold for theses of the depts. of cs and ce programs, make sure you adapt them for cse. most importantly, ensure that all relevant information appears in the title pages, and make sure to include the signed declaration of own work. 
an unofficial template that fulfills all formal requirements for cse can be found here (provided by walter simson). feel free to use templates from other departments (particularly if writing a thesis with them), but make sure to adopt changes to conform to the cse requirements!
submission will now take place digitally via the koinon-portal. the deadline includes the specified day: i.e., deadline applies at 23:59 ce(s)t. most importantly, make sure to indicate when your submission is final!
thesis grading
after you submit your thesis, the examiner(s) will receive a grading request. the examiner(s) usually need a few weeks for reviewing and grading. when having more than one examiner, the thesis grade is calculated by averaging the value of the two grades given by the examiners.
thesis presentation
cse regulations before winter semester 2024/25 do not require thesis presentations, but some examiners choose to make them mandatory. students starting from winter semester 2024/25 do have a mandatory presentation. if you are required to present your thesis, the examiner(s) will determine the presentation format, and you will be responsible for finding a date and room for the presentation. you are welcome to use the sccs colloquium for this purpose.
please note: the submission date of your thesis is the official last date of your thesis work. even if your presentation takes place after this date, the submission date will still be used for official purposes.
extension of deadline
if you are unable to meet the submission deadline for any reason outside your control (i.e. access to resources/facilities, software/hardware failure, medical conditions, ...), you can request an extension adding appropriate documentation supporting your issues on the koinon-portal as well. your examiner will be able to add a comment as well to confirm agreement with extensions for reasons other than health-related requests.
please note that requesting additional time to improve results or polishing the work is not a valid reason for extension! results deviating from expectations are, up to a point, also something which should be considered during topic definition, and therefore usually not a valid reason for extending the working time.
in general, if you are ill and prevented from working on the thesis, the working period will be paused according to the received medical certification. please refer to the following link describing what the medical note must include in order to be considered valid.
please send any extension request as soon as issues arise, and at least one week before the deadline, so that the extension can be processed in a timely manner. in addition, you should check, well in advance of the submission deadline, whether any circumstances that demand an extension have occurred.






				graduation
			
after successfully completing the course requirements and master’s thesis, you will graduate with a master of science (m.sc.) degree and begin your professional life. for tips and advice on graduation and your next steps, see graduation.
