welcome to maryland motocross.  you 
          line up to the gate within inches of 41 other riders.  engines 
          over- rev, elbows high, blue smoke, and then an awesome roar,  in 
          something that resembles  a swarm of angry bees you race to be 
          first around a sharp turn just 100 yards away.   are you 
          nuts!!!




okay maybe "nuts" isnt the right word but 
          you need nerves of steel and a passion for winning to put yourself 
          through it every weekend.




at maryland motocross we showcase the 
          fearless riders who week after week push their machines and themselves 
          to new limits.




we thank you for visiting and hope that 
          youll find our site informative and entertaining.
