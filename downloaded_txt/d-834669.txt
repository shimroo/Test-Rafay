whale watching – 
embark on an unforgettable whale watching experience with our premier depoe bay whale-watching tours. during the winter months of december through february and the spring months of march through may, our vessels venture into the open ocean to witness the majestic migration of gray whales. in the winter, these magnificent creatures travel south from their alaskan summer feeding grounds to the warm, shallow lagoons of northern mexico, while in the spring, they make their way back north to alaska.
but the excitement doesn't end there! in the summer months and well into the fall, we are thrilled to have resident gray whales that call depoe bay their home, providing fantastic whale watching opportunities almost year-round. these magnificent residents feed right here in depoe bay, and we've even given names to our beloved local gray whales.
with a remarkable 98% sighting success rate on our cruises, you'll be sure to hear exhilarating cries of "thar she blows!" echoing around the boat as we bring you up close and personal with these awe-inspiring giants of the sea. experience the best whale watching on the oregon coast and create memories that will last a lifetime.
