hypnosis and health
 
	              imagine you are relaxed and stress free. your mind clear of any worries about the future and you are physically in the best shape you can be. you are sitting at a table on a restaurant terrace that looks out over the ocean. you take a few deep breaths and enjoy the moment. you can smell the sea and feel the warmth of the sun. you drink from the cool glass of water before you and take in the smile of the waiter, sensing that everyone around you feels your calm and peaceful nature.
 
your imagination can take you on journeys whenever you wish and your imagination is far more powerful than most people would believe.
 
hypnosis is a way to control and use that imagination and create ideas in your unconscious that will be there permanently to guide your thoughts in new ways. with hypnosis, you can make changes that might never happen otherwise or at least take a long time and a lot of effort to achieve.

hypnosis is a skill that you develop, like any other. you learn to put yourself into a hypnotic trance, usually with the help of a trained hypnotherapist, although a proper audio recording can be just as effective. the best way to learn about it is to experience it.
