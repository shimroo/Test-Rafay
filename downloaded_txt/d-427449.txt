education equity80% of nycdoe schools rely on cultural organizations like free arts nyc to provide quality arts programs.we prioritize individualized attention through 1:1 mentorship, designed to support students’ interests and goals for an experience that is academically enriching.















community resourcesreductions in arts funding fall disproportionately on the city’s lower-income neighborhoods.our programs prioritize equity. we cover transportation costs, provide students with technology and equipment, offer meals, art supplies, and allocate stipends for additional materials.
