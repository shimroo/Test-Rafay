not only are their products wonderful and authentically maryland, their customer service and commitment to excellence go above and beyond! their communication is always on-point and they were able to accommodate last-minute special requests with my order and resolve unforseen issues with the post office that came up. ginger is the best!















google review by lori







we absolutely love j.o. spice! their assortment of spices are amazing. they are a family owned business for over 75 years located in baltimore maryland. when you order steam crabs in a restaurant, that’s the spice that most restaurants use “jo spice”. their online store offers so many unique items great for gifts for any occasion. we have been buying our crab spice from j.o. for over 35 years. we are proud to say that ginger, brittney and all the gang are like family. thank you for always taking care of us.
