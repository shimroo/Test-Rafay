check it out - komeda
the old navy "make it madras" commercial features the song "check it out" by komeda,  which is available on their kokomemedada album, specifically the u.s. may 4 2004 release with bonus track.amazon doesn't list the bonus track, but i'm in the process of verifying the u.s. release of the kokomemedada album they sell does have the bonus track.update 2006-06-02i've purchased kokomemedada from amazon, and it does indeed have the bonus track.other sites list the u.s release as having the bonus track. you can check a list of retailers here: http://www.google.com/musiclp?lid=eqtyo-y1bvgsome of them such as barnes and noble list the bonus track.i've also sent a request to itunes to add the song. you could do the same if you want, because i think the more requests they get, the more likely they'll try to add it. http://www.apple.com/feedback/itunes.htmlupdate 2006-06-02who's the blonde in the old navy madras commercial?according to a comment at a blog for a different old navy girl, the madras actress is new view model autumn armstrong.

song in the budweiser select commercial - galvanize
the song from the budweiser select commercials - galvanizei received an mredkj.com feedback asking about a song in a budweiser select ad, and the writer said some of the lyrics were "don't give up...there's a partyover here...don't give up world..." i did a little research and found the song lyrics are "the world is holding back" the song is "galvanize" by the chemical brothers (featuring q-tip from a tribe called quest), which is available on the album push the button.for more information about the ad, refer to my mredkj.com page about the bud select commercials.2006-03-11. i decided put up a page about the commercial at mredkj.com. it's against the rules to have adsense ads on a page that includes "sales or promotion of beer or hard alcohol". but i should be ok since i'm not putting their ads up on that particular page. i'm basing that on a response i got from google adsense support.
