regarding the concerns you mentioned about the chemical smell and the eco-friendliness of the materials, i’d like to share some details about our products. the poi weight balls are made from a soft shell fabric, and the inner filling is 100% recycled rubber, sourced from materials like used tires. the carry bag is sublimated to give it a fancy look.

we understand the importance of ecological responsibility, and we’re continuously exploring ways to improve the environmental friendliness of our products. your feedback is invaluable in helping us make these advancements."
