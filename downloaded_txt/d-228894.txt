designing for community: the future of build-to-rent


 



as the housing crisis in australia continues to intensify, the build-to-rent (btr) sector has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate pressure on the rental market. with btr poised to become the most significant asset class in new property development by 2030, this growing sector offers an exciting opportunity to redefine the rental lifestyle. at the forefront of this transformation are two key principles: community-centric design and sustainable living. 











prioritizing longevity in btr developmentsbtr developers are committed to creating buildings with enduring appeal and strong sustainability credentials, often retaining these properties for over 30 years. understanding sustainable design now extends beyond energy efficiency and carbon footprints; it encompasses designing precincts that foster vibrant communities, which is essential for the long-term success of btr developments.designing for community interactioncentral to community-centric design is the creation of purpose-built spaces that nurture a sense of belonging among residents. this is crucial for tenant retention and the long-term success of btr projects. one of the main challenges for designers, developers, and operators is establishing a sense of community in high-density btr precincts, which host a diverse range of residents, including students, retirees, young professionals, and families. 

















transitional spaces that support incidental interactions are just as important as designated community areas for social activities in btr developments. spaces like the mailroom, lift lobby, and waiting lounges can become places where neighbors greet and check in on one another, fostering rapport and kinship. these moments not only enhance the btr experience but also encourage tenants to stay longer and renew leases, thereby reducing turnover.community-centric design should extend beyond the confines of the development itself. effective btr precincts should seamlessly integrate with surrounding neighborhoods, inviting the wider community to enjoy the amenities and spaces, such as parks, cafes, and retail offerings, with easy pedestrian and road links.incorporating intentional placemaking design elements that encourage interaction is key to achieving a community-centric btr development. this includes communal spaces like lounges, co-working areas, outdoor recreation spaces, fitness gyms, and community gardens. great btr developments also feature programmed social events and workshops within these spaces. for example, when i moved interstate, btr accommodation alleviated a significant portion of the stress for me as it was fully equipped and furnished for maximum comfort. my particular btr accommodation arranged events such as cat parties, which would have been a great ice-breaker event for me. leading btr operators now maintain this social connectedness through apps that keep residents engaged with an ongoing program of community events.while you can’t force a neighborhood, moments of social interaction can foster one. our liv aston btr project in melbourne exemplifies this approach with amenities such as a dog park, bookable dining rooms, theater rooms, lounge rooms, and shared terraces.by meticulously incorporating these elements into the building’s design, moments of social interaction can be fostered, enabling residents to build bonds with their neighbors and the broader community.sustainable living for a greener futuresustainability is not just a priority for architects and designers; there is a growing awareness among renters about their environmental impact, driving demand for more efficient homes that support an eco-friendly lifestyle.the location of btr sites is fundamental in supporting sustainable living. developments that offer easy access to public transportation, safe pedestrian routes, and cycle paths enable residents to live without reliance on cars.energy efficiency is another cornerstone of btr sustainability. installing five-star energy-rated appliances across large-scale projects delivers significant cumulative energy savings.the industry-wide sustainability rating tool, green star, is now seen as the benchmark in the commercial sector. we are noticing the importance of these accreditations within the btr market as operators aim to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable performance.fk’s hamilton btr development in brisbane targets carbon-neutral operations with features like car share schemes, electric vehicle charging facilities, and dedicated solar panel zones on rooftops to supply power to common areas.as the btr sector continues to evolve, so too will the standards for excellence in sustainable design. by prioritizing community-centric design and sustainable principles, btr developments can redefine the rental experience, putting people and human connection at the forefront.setting a new benchmark for australian rentalsin a time where demand for sustainable and community-centric living is on the rise, btr developments that embrace these principles will be well-positioned to attract and retain discerning residents. this approach will set the benchmark for australian rentals, built with longevity at their core.
