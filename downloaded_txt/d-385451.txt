the new ways of regenerative medicine 

stem cell therapy
if you’re looking for natural ways to alleviate pain, chances are you’ve encountered many accounts of people who have attained their wellness objectives through the use of stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine.
stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine both use stem cells to improve the body’s natural healing capabilities to help heal degraded or missing tissues. however, there is a lot of confusion and misconception over what “stem cell therapy” is and what procedures are qualified as “stem cell therapy.” there is also some misconception about the less invasive and less painful regenerative medicine, and how it uses more than simply stem cells to help heal your body.
what is stem cell therapy?
first, let’s explain what a stem cell is. a stem cell is an undifferentiated cell or a blank cell. these undifferentiated cells have yet to take on a role as a specific cell. stem cells have the potential to become many different types of cells. for example, an undifferentiated stem cell may become a muscle cell, a cartilage cell, or bone cell. when introduced into the body, stem cells take on the role of cells the body needs to help heal and repair itself. for example, if an individual is seeking stem cell therapy for knee pain, injections containing stem cells will be injected in the knee. if the knee pain was due to degraded cartilage, the newly introduced stem cells can home in the bodies need for this tissue. the undifferentiated stem cells may then be designated as cartilage cells to help heal and repair the degraded tissue.
here’s the kicker…. stem cell therapy refers to treatments that use the patient’s own stem cells or cells from a family members body.
two common stem cell therapies are:
adipose tissue stem cell therapy: adipose is the medical term for the fat deposits that are stored within our bodies. adipose tissue stem cell therapy is a procedure where a small amount of fat is suctioned out of the body. the process is similar to liposuction. however, unlike liposuction, after the adipose tissue is extracted from the body, the tissue goes through a process where its stem cells are harvested. the harvested stem cells are then reintroduced into the area of the body that needs healing. adipose tissue, while in abundance in the body, stores toxins. these toxins may affect the quality of the stem cells.
bone marrow stem cell therapy: this stem cell therapy requires the harvesting of bone marrow from the pelvis or femur. a hole is drilled through the bone to access the bone marrow. the marrow is then removed and goes through a process to isolate the stem cells, which are then reintroduced into the body in areas of focus. bone marrow stem cell therapy can be very painful. this stem cell therapy may also open the patient up to infection.

is stem cell therapy the best option?
stem cell therapies use the body’s own stem cells. stem cells are located throughout the body. but, as we age, these stem cells age with us, possibly making these stem cells less proficient. our doctors do not perform stem cell therapies. instead, we prefer regenerative cellular treatments.
much like stem cell therapy, regenerative cellular treatments use the body’s natural healing capabilities to heal underlying conditions. regenerative cellular treatments use wharton’s jelly derived growth factors, cytokines, proteins, and mesenchymal stem cells. these young growth factors and stem cells are harvested at the time of birth from donated umbilical cord tissue. the consenting mothers are carefully screened and neither the mother nor child is harmed by donating this tissue that is traditionally disposed of. these stem cells are young and vibrant with many healing and growth potential.
choosing regenerative medicine over stem cell therapy?
regenerative medicine utilizes donated umbilical cord tissue and therefore does not require the painful harvesting of stem cells from the patient. this young tissue has not yet developed an immune system so there is virtually no chance of rejection. the age of the growth factors and stem cells is indeed a factor. once your body reaches 30 years of age, your stem cells begin losing their regenerative capabilities. each year after 30, the percentage of stem cells in your body decreases, leaving you more susceptible to injury and disease. if you think about it, how much faster does a young child heal from an injury than does an older person? this faster healing in the youth is due to the high level of young, effective stem cells, cytokines and growth factors in the child’s body. regenerative treatments that utilize these same cytokines, proteins, growth factors, and cells can be like turning back your biological clock.

is hormone therapy beneficial? 

hrt specialists reject the notion that you are doomed to feeling tired and like a worn version of yourself as you age. declining levels of testosterone are a normal part of aging, but if you have symptoms that disrupt your life, we have a treatment that may help. 
hormone replacement therapy (hrt) is a common treatment for women who have decreasing levels of estrogen because of menopause. men may experience a similar phenomenon, called andropause, which causes lowered production of testosterone. testosterone replacement therapy (trt) can be helpful in relieving symptoms such as erectile dysfunction (ed) among many others that are a result of andropause. 
testosterone and your body
you may be surprised to learn that women’s bodies produce testosterone, because it’s sometimes described as “the male hormone.” during adolescence, men’s bodies begin to produce substantially more testosterone, and as adults, men have substantially higher levels than women. 
as the hormone messenger that triggers male physiology and function, testosterone plays a significant role by: 
deepening your voicecausing the growth of body, facial, and pubic haircontributing to increased bone and muscle massinfluencing sexual developmentincreasing libidocontributing to memory development and reasoning ability 
testosterone continues to regulate your sexual function and physical condition throughout your life. this important hormone even plays a role in keeping your heart healthy because it helps your body produce red blood cells. 
after about the age of 30, testosterone levels begin to decline at the rate of roughly 1% per year, frequently leading to a lower libido, decline in physical condition, and other negative effects. 
how you feel with less testosterone
the loss of 1% of your testosterone each year means that you may not notice any changes for a long time, but once your production reaches a certain point, you may begin to notice effects on your health and wellbeing. when you see a specialist, they will first rule out other potential underlying causes of your issue. 
if your physician thinks your problem may be low testosterone, a blood test can confirm it. some symptoms include: 
low libidoerectile dysfunctionincreased body fatloss of muscledecreased bone densitychanges in your cholesterol compositionlack of focusmood changes such as depressionloss of energy
some of these symptoms can impact and worsen others. for example, when you lose muscle mass, you may see an increase in body fat because your body doesn’t burn calories as efficiently. 
testosterone replacement therapy 
once an hrt specialist has determined that low testosterone is causing your symptoms, he may recommend trt. five improvements you’re likely to see include: 
1. increased energy levels
rather than fatigue and listlessness, you’re likely to feel invigorated and witness your energy level increasing along with your endurance. 
2. renewed sex drive
if you’ve felt the effects of lower testosterone in the bedroom, you may find that your libido returns with trt. 
3. rebuilt muscle mass
if your efforts at the gym weren’t providing the expected results, trt may help. weight and resistance exercises produce better results when your testosterone levels are balanced. as a bonus, trt helps boost your metabolism. 
4. goodbye, body fat! 
more muscle mass, increased energy levels, and a boost to your metabolism combine to make it easier to lose excess weight — especially the so-called “spare tire” that may have accumulated around your waist. 
5. more focus and better concentration
once you begin trt and your hormone levels reach a more optimal balance, you may find that you can think more clearly. you may also enjoy a more stabilized mood and better sleep! 
you don’t have to live with flagging energy and a diminishing muscle mass. book an appointment with an hrt doctor, and find out if you’re a good candidate for trt. you can schedule an appointment online, or you can call the location that’s most convenient for you, and we’ll be glad to help.
