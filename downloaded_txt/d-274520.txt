	groups, special workshops, our business meeting, and, of course, a party to 
	catch up on what all our colleagues have been doing for the past year! 

anyone interested in the archaeology of the area from new york to virginia, 
and from the atlantic coast to west virginia, is welcome. you do not have to be 
a member to register for the conference and hear about the latest of a wide 
variety of archaeological sites dating from the earliest paleo-indian sites to 
20th-century sites, and of all site types, from small single-use native american 
procurement sites and large village sites, to historic period urban, rural, 
industrial, diverse ethnic and immigrant sites, and underwater sites. come join 
us! 

mission statement

to provide a yearly conference and a professional journal for archaeologists, 
both avocational and professional, working in the middle atlantic area: a place 
to meet, discuss problems and issues, present recent work, and socialize with 
our colleagues.
