the illinois conference of the united church of christ is blessed to be woven from strands of a vast variety of rich traditions that make up the ucc, both those that represent the historical denominational merger of 1957, and many that have added vibrant threads and emerging patterns to who we are, racially, ethnically, socially and liturgically. formed in 1964, the illinois conference came into being through a consolidation of the north illinois synod of the evangelical and reformed church and the congregational christian conference of illinois.
