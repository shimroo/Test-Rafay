at gable we have put our 30+ years of experience in milling log homes to work in perfecting several new log profiles that do not require exposed caulking or chinking to seal between the logs. this was accomplished by developing unique tongue and groove log systems with overlapping log joints similar to the time-proven joints used in lap siding.

our logs are finely crafted from "deep swamp red cypress" harvested primarily from the piedmont and coastal regions of south carolina. these very same timberlands provided cypress that was used in centuries past to build old historic homes located in charleston and the "low country" of the carolinas.their longevity in such a hot and humid region is a true testament to the enduring beauty and durability of cypress "the wood eternal."
