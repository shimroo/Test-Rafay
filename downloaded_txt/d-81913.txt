netanyahu to nasrallah: you're fired

											starting on october 8th, just one day after the horrific surprise attack by hamas on israel resulting in 1200 deaths, many sexual assaults, and the kidnapping of 251 israelis and foreigners, hassan nasrallah, leader of the terrorist organization hezbollah, ordered an unprovoked launching of thousands of missiles against israel and its people. the attacks continue unabated to this day. israel finally responded with severe rocket attacks against hezbollah targets and among the leaders killed was nasrallah, the architect of these heinous missile bombardments against israel.
