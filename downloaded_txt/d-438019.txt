eleven out





in the waning days of the biden administration, we have seen some remarkable movement on the gtmo front, as eleven prisoners (of the fourteen remaining who were cleared for transfer) were abruptly transerred to oman. these prisoners were yemeni nationals who because of the security situation in their home country could not be transferred there, and so, were sent to oman, a nation with a supposedly successful record of “rehabilitating” former guantanamo prisoners (notwithstanding that most of them never really had any actual connection to terrorism or islamic extremism). as we approach some of the coldest, darkest weather of the...

the end[?]





2024 has been quite the wild ride. if the democratic establishment is to be believed, it featured an election that represents the execution of an existential threat to american democracy, with the trump restoration all but assuring, well, that. mr. trump managed to secure reelection either despite, or because of, the democratic establishment’s decision to time various criminal charges against him for maximum electoral impact, although only a new york county criminal prosecution over the stormy daniels “hush money” payments went to trial (and resulted in conviction). [as a long time practicing attorney in this city, albeit not specializing in...

a pre-festivus miracle





my friend andy worthington gives us the details of the abrupt release of three prisoners from gtmo, bringing the total number of muslim men and boys held at our military’s great experiment in made-up-justice-to-cover-up-torture down to 27. it’s been quite a while since any prisoners were released, as andy notes, the second longest period in gtmo history without a release. that may be about to change when donald trump returns to the white house. frankly, despite my longstanding interest in the subject, it’s been a long time since i did an interview, or frankly, much of anything. for personal reasons...

we should have seen it coming [or forget it jake, it’s 2024]





as some of you know, 2024 had already been a difficult year here at stately dog manor. in may of 2024, we lost our beloved cat, whom we will call “mr. s,” to an awful disease. ironically, this occurred when the loquacious pup, only 24, was herself fighting a similar disease. i am somewhat pleased to report that her fight, which involved well over a month as an inpatient and many months of other treatment, appears to have gone successfully, and she will soon be advancing her education in another city (alas, in a red state). and of course, td...

a little late





as i frequently do, i missed the anniversary of this here blog, which turned 23 on the 18th of september. we kind of have other things going on at this time of year, and of course, this has been an eventful year here in stately dog manor for lots of other reasons that need not be discussed right now. the world continues rolling on; things look “ok” as far as the united states not making the fatal mistake of a trump restoration, though this should be a foregone conclusion and it clearly is not at a mere 6 weeks before...

and we’re back





yes, it’s 23 years after september 11th. for those who don’t know (and why don’t you?) my venue that day was at an office building on church street in lower manhattan, at the job i lost that day after the building was closed for business for an inordinate period of time following the 9-11 events. i, of course, viewed the festivities from a 16th floor window. the easiest explanation for what happened is blowback from having armed islamic militants to take on the former soviet union who eventually settled in perennial failed state afghanistan, along with islamist grievances associated with...

freedom delayed is freedom denied… but we’ll take it





apparently a plea deal has been reached between the united states department of justice and julian assange, under which assange will plead guilty to a single count of something or other involving classified documents and be sentenced to five years time served. assange will plead guilty to this in the u.s. district court for the northern marianas, in the middle of the pacific ocean, but evidently, one of the closest american jurisdictions to his native australia, to where assange will promptly return. assange has essentially been out of circulation for over a decade between a lengthy sojourn in the ecuadorian...

2024 keeps giving





it’s certainly been a while since i’ve posted anything. so we’ll post today, on this, what would be the 87th birthday of td dad of blessed memory. of course, there’s an explanation for the long reticence, besides overall existential angst associated with a planet insanely and dangerously out of balance and, despite his “legal troubles,” the probable coming restoration of mafia grover cleveland, which is of a very personal nature. unfortunately, the loquacious pup is suffering from a rather serious illness, from which we have every confidence that, surrounded with unbelievably wonderful and generous friends and her loved ones and...

22





i confess to being exhausted after all these years. but imagine if you were a guest of our military and intelligence services at guantanamo bay, cuba. inconceivable that a human being could stand the overt torture, punctuated with the boredom, and overlaid with the uncertainty of whether you will leave the place in a coffin, as nine men have. and yet, 30 men are still there. and have been for decades. 22 years as if today. and 16 men have been cleared for transfer by our national security services. the reality is that most americans accepted barack obama and his...
