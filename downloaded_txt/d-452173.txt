our story







king’s leaf cigars is the premier cigar retailer in the charleston, south carolina metropolitan area. boasting walk-in humidors in all four locations, king’s leaf cigars is uniquely focused on bringing to our customers the best of what the cigar world has to offer.
we started our cigar journey in 2015 with our first store, located in downtown charleston. we spent considerable time cultivating our humidor to ensure that we had exactly what we wanted to offer: a large variety premier cigars at reasonable prices. couple that with our unwavering customer service, we found the magic that allows everyone that stops in our lounge to feel like a king.
in 2017, we acquired our next shop in goose creek, south carolina. this was a fantastic opportunity to bring some of the love for cigars that we brought to downtown up the highway to goose creek. we immediately expanded the store’s selection, added shelf space in the humidor, reinvented the lounge, and made a particular effort to ensure that our local customers were as well taken care of as our visitors downtown.
