  the wasp and the snake 


  a wasp seated himself upon the head of a snake and, striking him
unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death.  the snake,
being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his
enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and
purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, "at least my
enemy and i shall perish together."
