orienteering - the thinking sport.orienteering is the competitive sport of navigation. using a detailed map (and occasionally a compass on advanced courses) participants try to find the quickest route through a series of marked checkpoints. orienteering can be enjoyed at a relaxed walk or a cross-country run; the essence of the sport is you finding your own unique route.the columbia river orienteering club offers orienteering events year-round in the portland oregon area. beginners are welcome at events, and you do not need to be a member of our club to participate.learn more and read some faqs at our "new to o?" page.
