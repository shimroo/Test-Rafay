what exactly is taxidermy? 
                                                     
                taxidermy is actually the preservation of an animal's body by mounting for

                animals are usually, but not at all times, made to look they

                the word itself means the preserving of an animal. however,                                                      
                taxidermy as a word in and of itself is often substituted for or                                                      
                the end product if you will is often called a "mount".                                                      
                from ancient greek it actually means to "arrange skin"                                                      
                as odd as that may sound.
