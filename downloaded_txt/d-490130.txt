what are cold calls?

a cold call is when a client is not expecting our call. that is, in theory, he or she may be interested in our service, but we still need to try to get to the point of discussing that service.

what does a cold call mean? the call is called a "cold" call because more often than not, clients treat these calls "cold". those who have regularly had to pick up the phone and hear in it joyful or monotonous: "good afternoon, i am from the company "horns and hooves", we are a manufacturer of the best gizmos since 1900 …" - are much more aware of what cold calls are than those who make them. imagine, you're waiting for an important call and a cosmetics consultant calls you and offers you lipstick, first of all, it's distracting, secondly, you don't use lipstick and thirdly, you're a man in general. how many "nice things" do you want to say to this man? clearly he is not looking forward to a warm, cordial conversation with you.
