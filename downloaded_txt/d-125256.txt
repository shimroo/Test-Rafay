this is one of the great 
            classic websites. it's a history of the internet and what led up 
            to it, told in hypertext, both eloquently and chaotically, as 
            strange in its own way as the mel brooks movie, history of the 
            world, part one. but it's one [redacted} of a lot more accurate than 
            the brooks movie. all internet users, even those of you who just 
            signed up for web-tv or aol last week and are still fumbling around, 
            should check out this site.
when you jump into this online story, 
            make sure you have a couple of hours free. it takes that long to 
            read. imagine a collaborative writing  project that tells you 
            more than you ever wanted to know (and more than probably thought 
            there was to tell) about the internet, starting with the laying of 
            the first telegraph cable across the atlantic in 1858 (which was not 
            a success, btw).
you'll learn why the www consortium 
            [w3c] is based at a physics lab in switzerland called cern, instead 
            of at a computer research center where you'd logically expect it to 
            be, and why cern doesn't even stand for the lab's real name -- in 
            either english or french, along with lots of other neat factoids 
            that'll come in handy if you ever find yourself playing trivial 
            pursuit: the internet edition.
