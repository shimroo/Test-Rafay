welcome to the official website of the kenya high commission in ottawa, canada
the aim of this website is to link the mission to the public with a view to providing information on issues pertaining to consular services such as passports, visa applications and other related matters.
the website will in addition provide information on trade and investment opportunities available in kenya. tourism is also showcased so that visitors to kenya can take full advantage of the flora and fauna and all that this beautiful country has to offer to those visiting whether for business or leisure.

another important function of this website is to create a link between the mission and the kenya diaspora. kenyans living in canada will be updated on political, social and economic developments in kenya through the website on a regular basis. this, we hope, will enable for effective participation by all in the affairs of our motherland.
