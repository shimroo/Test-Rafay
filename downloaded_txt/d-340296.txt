our mission and vision 



our mission
the hyams foundation is a private, independent foundation with a mission of increasing economic, racial and social justice and power within working-class communities in massachusetts.
our vision
our vision for the future is a society in which systems and structures are transformed to create the conditions for increased collective well-being and produce equitable power, access, opportunities and outcomes, regardless of race.
our goal
our overarching goal is to dismantle persistent, racialized economic disparities in massachusetts.
while we recognize that this may be an ambitious objective for any foundation to pursue, we believe that being aspirational is critical to addressing the racial equity challenges of our time.  as in the past, we also plan to carry out our work in close collaboration with others.

 






about uswe strive to increase economic, racial and social justice and power within working-class communities in massachusetts.
