testimonials
hear from our residents
see what residents are saying about bermuda village.







the most rewarding benefit from our community is the resident camaraderie. we have a wide breath of activities so you will be forced to choose each week on what you miss because you can’t do them all. for those with limited mobility there are plenty of things to do here on campus and we do have transportation that is ada compliant.  i can’t count the times new residents say they feel like they are on a cruise ship all the time.

bermuda village is a fun active retirement community.  i’ve met many wonderful people who have a variety of interests and backgrounds. i’ve lived here for 16 years and have enjoyed participating in a number of the many activities offered.  some fun things i enjoy are: singing with the village voices, exercising in the life fit area, tap dancing, the pool, wine club, restaurant and cultural outings and so many more.

the size of bermuda village lends itself to making it a pleasure to live here.  it is small enough to be able to really know fellow residents but still have the caregiving, dining, activities, and fitness functions needed to provide a great retirement experience.  residents here interact with each other in a very caring manner.
