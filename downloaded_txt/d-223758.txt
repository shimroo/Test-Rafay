pege - planetary engineering group earth
since 1991, striving to lead humanity into the solar age. a civilization has tasks that can be clearly recognized with the game theory of mathematics.



  
gemini next generation ag



creating a basis for worldwide wealth that is easy for everyone to grasp: everyone has a need for housing, and everyone should generate electricity:


gemini next generation ag (inc.)




we improve the world through climateâprotectionâsuperiorityâhouses.
our mission statement: planet renovation back to 350 ppm co2, we contribute house by house.






  
presentation of the environment of the gemini next generation project


the 1000 mâ² civilization




more space for nature, more space for humans, stop wasting land through inefficient use, stop destroying nature for the nonsensically inefficient.



ubi - universal basic income




ubi is becoming increasingly necessary, but is not compatible with the current system. creating the foundations of a ubi compatible society.



-250% co2 emission until 350 ppm are reached again




less co2 emission is much too little, even zero emission is insufficient. only a planet renovation with large-scale co2 filtering and splitting from the atmosphere will help.



climateâprotectionâsuperiorityâhouse cpsh




an enduring civilization with respect and space for nature requires that housing, energy production and food production be combined in a space-saving way.



land for energy: affordable housing, efficient energy transition




and cheap electricity for worldwide wealth. resolutely stop the economic decline caused by exploding housing costs and skyrocketing energy costs.



change of earth orbit because the sun gradually releases more energy




the sun's energy output has been rising since its inception 4.6 billion years ago. this increase will be critical for life on earth in the next half-billion years.



taxes steer




just as a sculptor can use a chisel to form a wonderful statue from a block of wood, you can use the tax system to form a real civilization.



levels of civilization and the status of the civilization on planet earth




without knowing it, mankind has been on a civilization jump for a 1/4 millennium. this must now be completed as quickly as possible with the urgently needed planet renovation.

presentation of the gemini next generation project before the ag foundation


gemini next generation - energy + food + living comfort




what can housing cost? where can you build? how much energy should a house produce? how much building material is needed? gemini n.g. is looking for completely new answers to these questions.



investing in disruption for survival




humanity has several existence-threatening problems, we offer to invest in a multiple disruption, which can solve several of these problems.






  
books


advance to solar age




the founding book of pege written 1992 and published 1993. the book of basics for a durable society with a high living standard.



calculation error




why is humanity not half the way to solar age, like it was intended 1991 as pege - planetary engineering group earth was founded? there is a deadly calculation error!






  
political initiatives



the new policy initiatives since 2021:


land for energy: affordable housing, efficient energy transition




and cheap electricity for worldwide wealth. resolutely stop the economic decline caused by exploding housing costs and skyrocketing energy costs.



the 1000 mâ² civilization




more space for nature, more space for humans, stop wasting land through inefficient use, stop destroying nature for the nonsensically inefficient.



taxes steer




just as a sculptor can use a chisel to form a wonderful statue from a block of wood, you can use the tax system to form a real civilization.



ubi - universal basic income




ubi is becoming increasingly necessary, but is not compatible with the current system. creating the foundations of a ubi compatible society.






it is up to policymakers to set and enforce building standards:


climateâprotectionâsuperiorityâhouse cpsh




an enduring civilization with respect and space for nature requires that housing, energy production and food production be combined in a space-saving way.






policy initiatives through 2021:


www - worldwide-wealth movement




mankind has the technology for a lasting paradise, but a policy for hell on earth. our mission is to change that.



politics - political targets of pege




nonpolitical, pragmatic, on the other side of ideologies counts in our politic only one target: a long time lasting civilization able to develop further on a stable base.






  
philosophy


paradigm infinitism




can a civilization develop an unlimited ability to survive? we think so! thus, worldwide wealth and a limitless future is possible.



levels of civilization and the status of the civilization on planet earth




without knowing it, mankind has been on a civilization jump for a 1/4 millennium. this must now be completed as quickly as possible with the urgently needed planet renovation.






philosophy has consequences. from insights of philosophy about the levels and the tasks of a civilization, real actions for implementation must arise:


-250% co2 emission until 350 ppm are reached again




less co2 emission is much too little, even zero emission is insufficient. only a planet renovation with large-scale co2 filtering and splitting from the atmosphere will help.



change of earth orbit because the sun gradually releases more energy




the sun's energy output has been rising since its inception 4.6 billion years ago. this increase will be critical for life on earth in the next half-billion years.






  
the old magazines of pege



a great deal of knowledge is required for a comprehensively new view of the world. the advertising-financed activity as a science journalist made it possible to accumulate this knowledge.


car traffic magazin of pege




themes around cars and traffic. tests, technic and concepts for the future. the joice of the right car and how to move it more fuel efficient.



live, building, houses




the architecture and solar architecture online magazin of pege shows problems, ideas and solutions around houses, building and live in general.



notebook - laptop - notebooks - laptops - lifestyle




the laptop is a central element for a high life standard and it's an enviroment friendly device. the energy saved can be used for other electrical devices.



roland mã¶sl - founder of pege




roland mã¶sl - the founder of planetary engineering group earth dedicates his life for new concepts and inventions to lead humanity to the age of solar energy.

support for a better future


please enhance pege's ability to lead humanity into solar age with your support.



archive of the pege - planetary engineering group earth


since 1991, a goal, but increasingly better ways to be able to implement this goal. the technology is getting better, the production of required technology is increasing.
