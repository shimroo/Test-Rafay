we need you. because they still need us.
on september 11, 2001, the unthinkable happened, and our scholarship was established to protect the dreams of students whose families were directly impacted. but today, because of unforeseen and growing illnesses caused by the rescue effort, many more students need our help—and yours.

more than 20 years ago, we made a promise.your support helps us keep it.
since 2001, we’ve awarded $190 million to 3,849 children whose parent was lost or severely affected by the 9/11 attack and rescue mission. we’re proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish together. but more students still need our support.

about the fund

it’s more than a fund. it’s a family.

 

the generosity of donors is crucial for students still working towards their goals. i lost my dad in 9/11, and my sister and i were raised by our mom in connecticut. the families for freedom scholarship fund meant that cost was not a prohibitive factor while looking at colleges.
