summer camp destinationswith our summer camp and summer teen travel program, we help teens discover the joy of cross-country biking, camping, experiential travel, and hostelling in the traditional style that dates back to the 1930s. we encourage teens to be ambitious, but also to slow down and enjoy scenery or stop for ice cream during our summer camp, balancing challenge with comfort. teens visit beautiful wilderness areas, world-class cities, and intriguing historical sites with us while learning backpacking, camping, and travel skills.
summer campers who bike with teen treks get to have a say in what the group does. if the campers want to bike hard to get in more time swimming and boating at a lake, or if they want to rest at a cafã© in a picturesque downtown, our schedules give them that flexibility. our summer camp leaders have the training and the resources to keep teens on schedule while making the most out of every trip.
summer camp safetyour summer camp leaders get intensive training in first aid, safety, and bicycle repair at our headquarters before they get to lead one of our teen summer travel programs. we pair two camp leaders with ten teenagers per trip, ensuring that each camper gets plenty of attention. each tour begins with safety training for the teen campers, including biking safety, rules of the road, basic bike repair, and travel safety tips.
from beginning to end, our trained, trusted camp leaders have charge of the teen campers. we donât subcontract any camping or travel activities to outside organizations, so we maintain a direct line to the action every day of our summer camps and teen summer travel programs.
