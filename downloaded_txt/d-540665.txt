home to the largest african american congregation in the state of washington, mountzion baptist church was organized in seattle on february 18, 1894.  led by reverend hesekiah c. rice, eightfounding members initially met in a rented hall on the campus of the universityof washington, which was in what is now downtown seattle.  although many churches in seattle were raciallyintegrated during this period, some black parishioners wanted a more expressiveenvironment within which to worship.mount zion experienced tremendous instability in its leadership and locationbetween 1894 and 1907.  numerous pastorspassed though the church, sometimes as frequently as one each year.  in addition, mount zion’s address changed no fewerthan five times during this period. finally, a church building was constructed on land purchased at thecorner of 11th avenue and union street in 1907.  in 1918 the church bought a parcel of land at19th avenue and east madison street. construction began in 1920 on the building that still houses mount ziontoday.church leadership, which had been transient for years, stabilized as well.  mount zion had just six pastors between 1912and 1957.  they were reverend w. d. carter (1912-1925), reverend j. sterling moore(1926-1932), reverend taylor m. davis (1932-1940), reverend fountain w. penick(1940-1942), reverend f. benjamin davis (1942-1954), and reverend gil b. lloyd(1955-1957).  many of these ministersplayed an active role in the larger community. rev. penick was considered an early civil rights activist and rev. daviswas a candidate for the seattle city council in 1946, garnering 27,000 votes inhis losing bid, which took place in an era when there were fewer than 3,500black voters in the city.during world war ii seattle’s african american population grew rapidly as laborshortages forced companies like boeing to integrate their workforces.  the corresponding growth in mount zion’smembership made space an issue, and would eventually lead to additions to andredesigns of the original sanctuary.in 1958

born chloe anthony wofford on february 18, 1931 in lorain, ohio to parents george and ella ramah wofford, novelist toni morrison grew up in a working class family.  she received a b.a. degree from howard university after majoring in english and minoring in the classics.  wofford earned an m.a. degree in english from cornell university and then taught at howard university and texas southern university, before entering the publishing world as an editor at random house. she married (and later divorced) harold morrison and gave birth to sons ford and slade kevin. morrison taught at yale, bard college, rutgers university and the state university of new york at albany.  she later held the robert f. goheen professorship in the humanities at princeton university.recognized internationally as a major american writer, morrison is the author of eight novels, including the bluest eye (1973)—the story of a little black girl’s quest for identity and acceptance in a world that privileged whiteness; sula (1973), which celebrates friendship between women and the complexity of black womanhood; song of solomon (1977), which follows its male protagonist, milkman dead, on his quest for cultural heritage; and tar baby (1981), which explores a love affair between a couple from radically different socio-economic backgrounds. morrison’s early works received critical acclaim, including national book awards nominations and the national book critics’ circle award for song of solomon.   morrison’s fifth novel, beloved (1987), a haunting story about the atrocities of slavery and a black slave mother’s effort to protect her children against its dehumanizing effect through infanticide, won the pulitzer prize, and was instrumental in her receiving the nobel prize for literature in 2003. in 2006, beloved, made into a movie starring oprah winfrey, was named the greatest work of american fiction in the past twenty five years by the new york times book review.  in her subsequent novels jazz (1992), paradise (1998), and love (2003), morrison
