updates a plenty





of course plenty has been happening in the year or more since i've really blogged. we bought a house, we got a new imac, we went to europe (i know, i should put up some pictures.), and we got a new puppy (wembley). and thats only the things i can think of right now. i'm currently studying for my apple certified systems administrator tests. more updates to come. hopefully sooner than later.

nyc/philly trip





i'm finally posting about our nyc/philly trip from about a month ago. what can i say, it was just so crazy it took a little while to sink in. mind you, the new york city leg of the trip was 2.5 days and then the philly part was another 2.5 days.it was insane.nycof course, we caught up with lou and his girl suzie. there was a comfortable spot near lou's place where we played pool and threw back some drinks both nights we were there.we also hung out with lou's friends bro and brian.needless to say, we had to take lou home and put him to bed that night.we went on a food tour of greenwich village, which was really cool. this is melissa in front of murray's cheese shop. greenwich village has a real old neighborhood feel to it. there's no grocery store that has everything, instead you have to visit the baker and the butcher and the cheese monger to get your groceries.here i am inside chumley's speakeasy. this is still a functioning bar right out of prohibition times. chumley's still operates without a sign out front or any advertising. you just have to know where it is. some of the prohibition features still there are the secret back door hidden by a bookcase, and the zig-zagging front entrance only wide enough for one at a time (so that the cops couldn't rush the place).for melissa, we had to visit chelsea market, home of the food network.and since it was melissa's first trip to nyc we had to visit times square.we also saw the statue of liberty, central park, and ground zero.this is a place on the lower east side called donut plant. we found out about it on food network. they have some awesome donuts. i highly recommend the "blackout" chocolate donut.on the way back from the donut plant, we took an accidental trip to brooklyn.we caught the museum of modern art before heading out of town.it was really amazing.phillythis is the reading terminal market in downtown philidelphia.it's a huge open market.we bought some cinnamon rolls from the pennsylvania dutch working at the market.we visited the mutter museum. it's a museum dedicated to medical history and anomalies. there's all kinds of stuff there, from conjoined twins to crazy surgical instruments to 60 pound colons. unfortunately, you can't take photos inside.here's melissa and jackie (her friend whom we stayed with) at capo giro gelateria. they make the most amazing flavors of gelato. their dark chocolate gelato was to die for.we went back both days.and finally, we passed by liberty hall and the liberty bell before leaving town.

mask/job, maskjob





a lot has happened since i've posted. i started graphic design classes. i'm taking graphic design i, and computer art studio. so far they're both pretty cool, but i see the computer art studio getting boring really soon. we're working in illustrator now, but we're about to move to photoshop, and all i need is more photoshop classes.this is what i've made in class so far:also, i got a new job. i'm so happy to be out of national electric, my grandpa's company. i worked with both my uncle's and my grandpa. it was mostly pleasant, but boring as hell. and i really don't get along with my uncle robert. in fact, he told me "come the end of the month, there won't be too much more to do" there (and there's always something to do if you want to organize piles of junk). that was the friday before my last day. that same night i got a call back from an interview earlier in the week offering me a job. i started a little over a week ago at computer solutions as an apple technician. compared to national electric, i love it. it's a good job, pays well, and i'm learning alot. i just took out the processor of a pm g5 and put in a new one the other day.
