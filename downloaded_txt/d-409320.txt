  world turtle trust - saving sea turtles worldwide 








 see our projects here  welcome to  the world turtle trust  linking people and sea turtles  around the globe  the world turtle trust serves as a link between sea turtle conservation projects around the world and people like you who wish to help them. often, these organizations don't have the resources to communicate their mission to the world, nor do they have the financial resources needed to fulfill their sea turtle conservation goals.   the world turtle trust selects turtle conservation projects in various parts of the world, operated by dedicated, committed people with the vision and determination to create change. we select projects that we believe will have the greatest impact on saving sea turtles, and we monitor their work and keep you informed about their progress.   please join us in reaching out to these dedicated groups of people that would otherwise not have the means to make their visions of saving sea turtles a reality. your donation will make a significant difference to their success.  help hawaii and the environment!  adopt a koa tree from the big island of hawaii  adopting a koa tree offsets your carbon footprint, and makes a  unique environmental gift or memorial  world turtle trust  po box 297  kailua, hi 96734 usa  privacy policy     terms and conditions     e-mail:  worldturtletrust@gmail.com  photos without credits courtesy of dave schrichte  web design by  neostudios
