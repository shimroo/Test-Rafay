moving upon june 4, the middle school community celebrated the class of 2028 at 8th grade moving up. the class of 2028 has greatly enriched our middle school community; they have worked hard academically and developed into thoughtful individuals with an inspiring range of passions and talents. we look forward to watching their continued impact on the holy child community as they transition to high school.















class of 2024 graduationon june 1, the holy child community gathered on campus to celebrate the class of 2024 at our 114th commencement exercises. the class of 2024 has achieved much during their years spent in the upper school at holy child. their talents and contributions inside and outside of the classroom have left a tremendous impression on our school.
















 the all-girl advantageat holy child, every girl is known and valued and encouraged to be her best self within the classroom and beyond. girls occupy every role: every seat in the classroom, every part in the school play, every position in student government, and every position on every team.research shows that all-girls school graduates are more academically engaged, demonstrate higher self-confidence in stem subjects, and are more likely to seek leadership opportunities compared to their co-educated peers. 



the holy child advantagewe capitalize on girls’ unique learning styles with an emphasis on cooperation, hands-on learning, discussion, and experience. we create a culture of achievement in which highly motivated girls are empowered to become the next generation of courageous and compassionate leaders.girls’ school grads are 6x more likely to consider majoring in math, science, and technology, compared to girls who attend co-ed schools.3/4 of girls’ school grads consider college a stepping stone to graduate school.93% of girls’ school grads are very or extremely satisfied with their school’s ability to provide individualized attention.research provided by art & science groupe, llc and the national coalition of girls' schools



what the research showsaccording to recent research, graduates of all-girls schools have a definitive edge over their co-educated peers, including:having stronger academic skills;being more academically engaged;demonstrating higher science self-confidence;displaying higher levels of cultural competency;expressing stronger community involvement;exhibiting increased political engagement.research provided by higher education research institute (heri) at the university of california-los angeles (ucla); dec. 2018.
