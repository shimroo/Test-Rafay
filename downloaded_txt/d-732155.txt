	 joe's cable car
	 
    
joe's cable caroriginally uploaded by ivymikea few years ago, hamburger blog "a hamburger today" recommended joe's cable car in san francisco.  i happened to be taking a trip out there to visit my sister, so one night i convinced her to drive across town so we could try the burger.  it was awesome.it's become my san francisco trip tradition to eat there, so hopefully i'll get a chance when i go out there for christmas.one thing i find fascinating is the way the reviews on yelp are so polarized.   there are a ton of people who are outraged that it's so expensive, and i'll grant that it is quite pricey.  but it's also perfection, and how can you put a price on that?tip: i also enjoy the root beer freeze, which is a vanilla milkshake with a hit of root beer!labels: joe's cable car, restaurants, san francisco

	 bullit telecopier suspense
	 
    
up until last week, i had never seen bullit.  i knew about the famous san francisco chase scene (where one of the cars loses six, count 'em, six hubcaps!) but i think that people have failed to recognize the brilliance of the rest of the movie.for example, this scene, where steve mcqueen, robert vaugnn, norman fell, and some other dudes stand around in rapt attention for a minute as the high-tech telecopier delivers a fax.what a classic moment of cinematic suspense!  it's the little touches--look at how eager the turtleneck-clad mcqueen is-he almost jumps the gun and looks at the fax before it's done drying.  i think norman fell's look at the end says it all: "what the?!"labels: bullit, fax, movies, norman fell, robert vaughn, steve mcqueen, suspense, telecopier
