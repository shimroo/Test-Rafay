it's beautiful, in a quaint sort of way.





we recently visited new york and i had the opportunity to see a roy lichtenstein up close. it's fascinating to see how much effort he put into replicating a mechanical process (four color process) using oil on canvas.it's important to concentrate on the end goal. fetishizing the process is all well and good, but doing is important.this is me, forcing myself to do.
