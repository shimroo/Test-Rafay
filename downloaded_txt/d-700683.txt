news
warlley cunha, ms, an mgg phd student in dr. cristina espinosa-diez’s lab was recently awarded the histochemical society 2024 cornerstone grant. this grant will support mr. cunha’s project, “investigating the role of casc15 in vascular health and ckd progression.” his research proposal aims to elucidate the role of specific isoforms of casc15 in vascular remodeling and ckd  progression through optimized rnascope-based multiplex rna in situ hybridization. this project has the potential to uncover critical insights into the mechanisms driving microvascular remodeling and senescence in ckd and to identify novel therapeutic targets for preventing or mitigating the vascular damage associated with this disease.
cristina espinosa-diez, phd, assistant professor of molecular medicine and genetics and of physiology received the stephanie watts career development award from the american heart association's hypertension council conference. this award supports early career investigators working in hypertension and cardiovascular research who show exceptional promise.
