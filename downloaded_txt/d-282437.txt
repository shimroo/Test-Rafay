this site describes some of the many waterfalls 
i have visited, most of which are located in the great lakes region.
the great lakes contain roughly 20%
of the world's fresh water.  the lakes cover a total of 94,000
square miles (244,000 square km) and over 200,000 square miles
(522,000 square km) of land drain into the lakes, including parts
of ontario, illinois, indiana, michigan, minnesota, new york, 
ohio, pennsylvania and wisconsin.  hundreds of waterfalls
can be found in the area, ranging from large heavily trafficked tourist 
falls, to small roadside falls, to remote wild waterfalls which wait 
at the end of a long hike.  


i hope you enjoy the pictures, and 
someday get a chance to visit 
some of the waterfalls.
this map shows the general
area containing
most of the waterfalls described on this site.  however waterfalls
know no boundaries, and neither does this site.  several of the falls
listed are hundreds of miles from the lakes.
