st mark's episcopal church


st. mark's is a vibrant and welcoming episcopal church serving the greater springfield, massachusetts area. 
the community of st. mark’s episcopal church is made of people of all ages and backgrounds who come together to worship god, experience love, grow in faith, and serve others.

as part of the episcopal church, we teach that christ calls us to welcome all people, to look for the face of god in all we meet. we give ourselves to outreach and service of those in our midst and those who live in the broader world because we have experienced god’s love and grace made known to us in jesus christ.

christ welcomed all, we welcome you!
