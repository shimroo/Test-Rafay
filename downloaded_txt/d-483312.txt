in a world where most
churches and people are driven by selfish desires, lusting after more things
to put in ever growing thing-silos, and in contrast to those who are
fighting over doctrinal minutiae, we want to lead people by example to
simpler and happier lives of love and justice as god has taught and
exemplified.  we invite you to join us.





 














































 










imagine.... ...a ministry
with total transparency...         ...where the missionaries are held
accountable....   ...where you know what they are doing because they daily post
pictures of their activities.... ...where they write
clearly on a website what they believe and are teaching...         
...where they don't have hidden agendas or grudges, but instead respect
people with different opinions...  ...where they care about your ideas
enough to ask your opinion in surveys... ....liv-n-letliv...a
different way of ministering...as you always imagined it could be. if you have
been abused by the religious leaders and pharisees, the one who suffered their
abuse has comforted us through that so that we can comfort you.  2 cor. 1:3-4
