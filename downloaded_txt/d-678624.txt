kosheen : damage (2021 remaster)

posted on 29 july 2021  by  moksha 


out now
we’re pretty chuffed to be re-presenting the kosheen family with “damage (2021 remaster)”  from 29/07/21.

sonically referencing both the electronica of “resist” 🦌 (their debut lp) and the creativity and darkness of “kokopelli” (their second) 🎶, with “damage (2021 remaster)”, 🌾, kosheen created🎙🎚💻  a subtly futuristic soundtrack for the 21st century. lyrically, changes and struggles in both relationships and landscapes are recurring themes. life and beauty still flourish,
it was their ‘biggest’ and most beautiful record to date. includes ‘overkill’ & ‘guilty”.
remastered 🎛 for 2021 
👉 play now

kosheen : kokopelli (2021 remaster)

posted on 22 july 2021  by  moksha 


out now!

kosheen’s second album “kokopelli”, continued the evolution of kosheen’s sound, an original hybrid informed by their diverse musical roots, their personal experiences from performing live across the world, and all elements of contemporary music. “kokopelli” brings together sian evans’ emotive vocals and traditional song writing techniques to darren decoder’s and markee substance’s dark electronica and guitar-driven riffs. “kokopelli” went gold, and includes the chart hit “all in my head”. 
lovingly remastered for 2021
listen to it now on all super streamer outlets

kosheen : resist (2021 remaster)

posted on 15 july 2021  by  moksha 


out now!

after a hugely influential, independent singles (‘hide u’, ‘catch’ & ‘(slip & slide) suicide’), kosheen achieved massive club , critical and chart success. their much loved lp ‘resist’ presents yet more dimensions of kosheen, with sparkling electronic breakbeat, deep chilled drum ‘n’ bass torch songs and achingly beautiful downbeat melancholia allowing sian’s emotive voice full range. ‘resist’ won various awards and hit platinum stats.  
this is a killer debut.
fondly remastered for 2021
stream now here …
