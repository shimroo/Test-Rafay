in the heart of kachemak bay



our headquarters is situated on the shores of kachemak bay, a coastal estuary teeming with wildlife. with more than 320 miles of shoreline, this coastal inlet contains every marine ecosystem in the gulf of alaska.the remarkable diversity of intact ecosystems, all within a relatively small area, positions this inlet as a beacon of inspiration for coastal education and research. 



a 30-foot tidal range provides critical habitat for intertidal species, and more than 244 species of shorebirds have been identified in this region.diverse forests, wetlands, and meadows surround the inlet, providing wildlife habitat to a wide array of species that call this place home.
