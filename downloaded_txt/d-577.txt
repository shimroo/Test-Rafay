here you will discover remarkable scientific data, and intriguing stories about the people and times of long ago.  

there are two main areas to explore:

the sources provide two searchable databases including  a searchable bibliography of archaeological references  inclusive of the three focus areas, and a searchable bibliography of environmental references relative to the areas.  supplementing these sources are selected downloadable documents for those who choose more detailed information.
