that's what she said...





so i had the kids in the back seat of the car after we went for ice cream at mcdonald's. the girl (age 7) had the hot fudge sundae that came with a little baggie of peanuts, and the boy (age 11) had a cone. the boy had his window down while we were driving. and she was mad because his window being down made for too much wind in the car while she was trying to enjoy her ice cream. she yells to the boy, "put your window back up! the wind is blowing my nut sack!!!" oh my goodness, that just cracked me up.

tv opinions





  have you seen american idol this time around? i love the new judge, kara, she has her own opinion. unlike paula that seems to agree with everyone else's opinion for the most part. and paula is all smiles this time, so big to show off how white her teeth are? her teeth are glowing white! they are blinding the contestants and that is what is making them sing off key! maybe it's to see how they perform under bright lights? the first night there was this cute little 16 year old girl with dark hair and she her voice was so beautiful! she is my favorite so far this year. she is my pick. she will make it to the top ten for sure. are you watching true beauty? produced by ashton kutcher. i love this show! i have only seen the first episode. have i already missed the second episode? i wonder if they have them to watch online? i'll have to check this out. these people think they are so beautiful and that it is their right to be that way and everyone around them should appreciate it. one even said that she was so thankful to be beautiful.  what? does she sit around the thanksgiving table when everyone says what they are thankful for? and other people say things like for my health and my family, but she says for her beauty? how wrong! comments?

someone always has it worse





if someone always has it worse than you do, then eventually someone must be dead or something.  i imagine it would go something like this: someone has a headache, but someone else has a headache and is throwing up, so they have it worse than the first person.  well someone even worse off is homeless; okay someone else is homeless and has no legs; even someone else just lost someone close to them in a horrible accident and they also lost their legs and nearly died and they have no money to pay all the doctor and funeral bills so that makes them end up homeless.  who is worse off than that?  who is at the end of the list of "someone is always worse off than you?"  it would suck to be that person.

thoughts about parenting





so i understand that parenting isn't easy.  kids are getting bigger, they are testing their limits constantly, trying to take on more responsibilities.  but we must encourage them to learn and grow without tearing them down by name calling or demeaning them in any way.  we need to make sure that we support them in learning new things.  they need to know to follow the rules, but if they mess up, they are not stupid for it.
