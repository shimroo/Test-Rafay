                      all good things have an end... the website was launched 
                      just 9 years ago this month. it's been almost a year that 
                      i did not update it, only a few facebook posts sometimes 
                      here and there. it's been a great adventure, especially 
                      on the early years. i've met a lot of people and had the 
                      honor to meet and speak to great people, and some count 
                      amongst my best friends. and i'm sorry to announce that 
                      as of today i decided to put a closure to this adventure. 
                      not a full closure, because the website will stay as it 
                      is now, but it just won't be updated anymore. you are free 
                      to visit my personal site and like my facebook page if you'd
