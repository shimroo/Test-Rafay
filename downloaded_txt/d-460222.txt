so lately...nervnerdjanuary 10th, 2011current location:schoolcurrent mood:bouncycurrent music:fight for justice~tetra-fangi have had this strange urge to make a pokemon challenge.the challenge would be a gym leaders challenge.here is what i have going so far:   each player has to have 6 pokemon   both players are only allowed to switch either on a knock-out or by use of a move that allows for switching (such as baton pass or u-turn).   gym leaders must pick a theme and stick to that theme (such as typing, color or height).   only one of each speies per player, no doubles of the same pokemon (pre-evos allowed).   only one uber per team and the challenger may at his choice refuse to allow the gym leader to use that chosen uber. the player may use any ubers for his challenge, but the following are disallowed due to unfair advantages: mew-two, deoxys (any), shaymin-sky.    a gym leader must have a replacement for his/her uber in the case that it is disallowed by the challenger.   a gym leader can not refuse a challenge made by any challenger. an exception is allowed if the challenger is not following the rules of the challenge or is abusing a cheat or glitch with the game (ie acid rain or similiar).   all moves are allowed.   all status effects are allowed.  an aforementioned clause, every pokemon must be checked by someone watching the battle (here after referred to as the ref) to make sure that no pokemon is a hacked or edited pokemon. the ref is also to make sure that no edited device or cheats are used during the battle. the ref also reserves the right to call a battle in the event of a glitch being used and can modify the battle with a restart only allowing the active pokemon still in each player's party to be allowed to enter the battle.  a further exception to the rule of ubers, is any uber who you have not legally obtained can not be used. this means if you have an arceus he must either be the event one from nintendo's pokemon center jpn or be caught from the hall of origin in p/plt/d pokemon games.any other ideas for this challenge?

zeitlos, the king of neamnervnerdnovember 10th, 2010current location:homecurrent mood:???current music:lightning to heaven~tetra-fangzeitlos has also aged in his time away from the group, considerably faster than even the other human members that where his friends. the powers that he had earned long ago have taxed his body and his mind has become hardened to the evils or perceived evils of the world.      zeitlos is still blessed by many of the heavenly beings that he sealed away, currently favoring tenebrous. though he is currently favoring tenebrous, he is still loyal to his original benefactor, amon the lord before the void, but due to his condition he is only able to bind one heavenly being. it is said that when he was younger he could bind many and multiple heavenly beings to himself and his will could control them to great effect, but sadly this is no longer the case.even though he bears the coat of neam, a legendary suit of armor, and the nibelung, another legendary item, they have lost a considerable amount of power and are honestly mere shadows of their former selves. the coat at one time was said to be unbreakable and protect its wearer from all but the most devastating of assaults, now it is a shell of its former self, able to absorb large amounts of punishment but not nearly as well as it used to. the nibelung, has waned in power almost as useful as any common magical blade honed to fight evil outsiders, but there was a time when all but the toughest of outsiders would almost appear as if they were destroyed just by unsheathing this former legendary blade.  many of these items powers where lost due to a difficult battle that zeitlos endured, a battle that cost him most of his powers and his allies.         the final adventure of the riders was after recovering and sealing away all the heavenly beings and him finally achieving the title and mantle as king of neam, the riders confronted the aeon: graz’zt, the dark prince. graz’zt planned on using the heavenly beings and the lesser keys with his aeon army to wage a war on the mortal world through his avatar, ephel. the riders fought bravely against ephel’s legions and armed with the powers of the heavenly beings, they made it to ephel’s hideout at the center of the kujata sea, the tower of dispater. upon reaching the top they confronted ephel, during their battle, graz’zt uses ephel to eventually enter the mortal world only to be forced back once defeated. in order to seal him away and bind him from just re-entering the world, zeitlos uses his powers as the king of neam to seal away the lesser keys of the gotei and thus the heavenly beings became the locks to graz’zt’s prison this caused zeitlos’ weaning effect. zeitlos furthered reinforced the seals, due to a fear that graz’zt could enthrall some other poor fool into just releasing the heavenly beings again, and used other pieces of his power to further bind the seals, as well as hiding the keys in hard to reach places. he even went as far as to use his own life force to act as a binding and placed several seals that could only be broken by his blood or the blood of his descendents. because of this last seal, he has refused to father any children for fear of something happening to them. 	shortly after placing these seals and binding much of his former powers, zeitlos begins to weaken terrible fast. still able to bind many of the heavenly beings, only within spirit instead of drawing upon their full array of powers, he is confronted by yami and attacked. she had taken control of the other riders and usurped control of the organization from zeitlos. zeitlos weakened by this past year of events was quickly over-powered and force to retreat. yami seems to be searching for the seals and keys to break the prison of graz’zt, the dark prince and undo all the hard work that their group and zeitlos had done.         zeitlos currently is traveling the lands in hopes of finding a way to cure his former allies of their madness and hopes that he may also find out the cause of this insanity as well as exploring rumors of some new cults and organizations that seem to be springing up around the world hunting for artifacts and attempting to take power for themselves.       zeitlos does not like talking about his former allies, the riders, due to feelings of hurt that they would betray him in the way that they have. he even refuses to go by his former titles as king of neam, king of fangs and zeitlos of the iron maiden which many have taken as meaning that he has given up on his former glory or as a way of saying that if he doesn’t have his friends with him then all his past glory is meaningless.this is a starting point for him, any thoughts?

game idea part 2...nervnerdoctober 28th, 2010current location:school library current mood:wake up!current music:supernova, tribute to the emperor form ~ tetra-fangthe main plot for this game is that there is currently a growing group in the world known simply as bound. this group is made up of members of the former group of adventures known as ride the wind, except for one of the members, simply known as griever who has disappeared. the group is going around fighting against an organization known as shocker, which many of the peasants and the upper class feel threatened by. the world’s governments are currently also trying to via for more power and control as they feel a war is close to breaking out. the nations currently holding the most power are orn’s gideon, tra’ans rheaonda, and cele’s holy moon empire. each nation is currently trying to compete with each other in gaining the favor of these legendary heroes for their own purposes. the group is lead by a woman by the name of ronove’ and is currently the most powerful group of adventures outside of the former knights of bor-ghideon, which existed hundreds of years ago and are famous for their heroic sealing of the 64 demons of sans-baal.ronove’ is currently known as the queen of fangs and is an experienced druid and bard from the small town of phangs on the phangs river south of gideon’s capital, basil. she is considered the leader of the group and as such can choose how to devote its vast resources. lavi the shadow of lavastius, is the twin brother of ronove’ and is considered one of the last dukes of phangs. he is trained in the use of sword and sorcery combining both into fluid death, but is loathed to actually entertain the idea of fighting, rather leaving it to those he deems better fit to that class of representation. considered a noble among the group, but is often at odds with his sisters an order, begrudgingly follows her orders because that tends to be the path of least resistance and keeps him from having to deal with the unwanted stress she would place upon him otherwise.jenn stevens, also known as calamanity, is considered the back-bone of offense amongst the group due to her thirst for challenges and thrills. she tends to be poor or rather lacking in funds due to her nature of sharing most of her rewards and treasure with her poor family. she secretly wants to rule a small thiftdom somewhere, were she can lead her peoples and family in a peaceful existence.axel anguish, also known as anguish, is a man of few words. not because he is stoic or reserved, but rather for the simple fact that he does not want to express him. though he is a founding member of the group and one of it’s’ leaders, he is unremarkable. axel would rather lazy the day away then focus on something meaningful or waste his days being antisocial, but when pressed he claims this is due to the fact that he is treated as an outsider instead of taking the risks to nessacitate the interaction to not be antisocial. axel is slightly skilled at the use of his heavy blade; gaia’s cradle and is prone to flights of rage when presented with what he perceives as disrespect and the mere mention of one of his former friends or his actual name.kathrine noh, a member only by her marriage, is a skilled cleric of war, destruction and protection. while she is perfectly skilled at fighting with her magics and enchantments, she prefers to wade into battle with her troopers and her husband. trained in the use of the bastard sword and shield, this young woman has been thru much in her short amount of time, some saying the she herself has actually died and that is how she met her husband. kathrine can be very cruel and calculating, but at times can be one of the most compassionate peoples whom you will ever meet. kathrine is not opposed to the use of force to solve an issue and at times this has gotten her into more trouble than her husband would like to admit. kathrine fears that one day her husband will leave her to go on some damned quest or adventure with one of his best friends and as such tries to control or go on whatever mission he leaves on.ryou noh, or rather called mercy, is a brilliant leader and general. he has been trained by some of the greatest swordsmen and warlords of his time, plus he has personally seeked out several masters from the planes beyond the material world to further improve his mastery. ryou prefers to let diplomacy work things out, but is not opposed to the show of force when it is needed. ryou though will only excise enough force to get the point across, he does not believe in senseless violence or killing. he has purposely sealed away portions of his power and refuses to release it unless something he cares for is in trouble, something those who challenge his wife quickly learn. ryou is skilled in the use of the demon sword, byoukotesui. this sword is passed from master to student and only the most powerful of swordsmen have ever welded it. the last master of the sword was a half-fiend by the name of alastre kroryly. they say that each master leaves a bit of themselves within the blade and pass that piece onto the next wielder. ryou is also skilled in the use of twin swords named midnight and midlight, swords crafted specially for ryou before he came to posse the byoukotesui, which he still uses more often than his demon blade. ryou is said to command a vast legion of troopers and treats each of them with respect and is saddened if anything happens to even one of them. ryou though he is considered the most powerful of all the group is the least likely to be sent on missions involving the use of force and even then is still less likely to resort to the use of force, even more so then lavi. the only times ryou throws away this idea is when his wife, kathrine is in danger, in which case feel sorry for those poor souls.“noh mercy,” is ryou’s alternate personality inn which he has cast off his normal persona and is a mindless engine of destruction. while in this state, he blindly destroys and kills all that is in his way, there is no controlling him once he achieves this state of being. though it is rare for him to enter this state, it is most commonly achieved by something happening to kathrine. while in the state of “noh mercy,” his eyes change to a greenish glow, his hair bellows as if the wind is blowing (even if there is none), his teeth change from normal into what seems to be fangs, a feeling of great dread fills all around him, vision becomes impaired, a dark aura seeps from him in all directions and the eye on the byoukotesui opens up all the way. finally the former leader and true founder of the group, dwyne zeitlos holland, also more commonly known as griever the lion of neam, has become a vagabond. cast out of the group for unknown reasons, the former king of fangs is a skilled magician and swordsman, having proved him in countless adventures and earning the respect there in of the three great nations. while griever is a vagabond he seems more interested in hunting down a group known simply as the lords of nightmare and the council of akarat, while protecting himself from his former allies and team members where ever he may be roaming. he wields the sword, legend and calls it to him by the command word, “my legend” and also wields the power of a great unknown being. he also can at times call upon various mystic armors each of which enhances him in special ways, his favorite he calls paladin. he is skilled mainly in enhancing and fire/thunder magics. his favorite attack is beat fang, which enchants his sword with the power of flames before which he throws at the enemy.  he is aided by his friend zexus of the nightfall and an awakened black lion name burakkuraion, whom was awakened by ronove’.  some of the most remember able adventures griever has completed where his taming of the dragon, doran; fighting the dark elves of llindor; fighting his way through the first layer and defeating the eidolon of taimat; and finally binding the 64 heavenly beings within the gotei or the lesser keys of neam. they say he received his name, the lion of neam, because of his binding of the lesser keys of neam.griever also used to command a legion of warriors and mages while he lead the group before his being cast down, but after him being forced out, his legion left and reformed together calling themselves the silver sentinels of basil, stating that if they could no longer follow their one true master or rather leader, then they would rather serve the nation that was his home. joining the silver sentinels is a rather difficult process both physically and mentally, due in part the discipline that the instill in themselves and trying to up hold the lofty ideals of griever himself and priding themselves on being great exemplars of justice and virtue.  there are also a group within the sentinels called “super-nova,” which further try and exemplar their former leader by not only studying and speaking of what he teached, but also try to practice his fighting style and way of combat as a means of keeping him around for future generations.  many members chosen for super-nova are former ranked troopers within his command structure, but as new members are inducted, this changes.

long story short...nervnerdoctober 25th, 2010current mood:energeticcurrent music:rind the wind~kadoya tsukasaafter some long needed inner reflection and thought, i have decided that what others think about me is not nearly as important as what value i place upon myself.long am i tired of hiding who i am and what it means to be dawayne.while it is true that i will never escape the judgments and ridicule of others, what is important is that i understand who i am and what it is that i truly value in this life.as such i am tired of running around pleasing those who do not matter to me and that truthly value me, aswell am i done trying to help those that do not truly value themselves. so for now i'm just going to enjoy this ride and be pleased by the visions of that which passes by.who will enjoy it with me?in other news, i really wish i could find a copy of the kamen rider decade ost that happens to have all the tracks, mainly the track they play when tsukasa is in hibiki's world and they are all fighting the giant crab kaijin.that song was so fricken awesome.

concept for game #1nervnerdmay 18th, 2010current location:schoolcurrent mood:hmmm...current music:freedom~la-viea thousand years after a war between the gods and a group of beings called eidolons. while this war raged on many deities are slain by these strange beings and it isn't until the gods enlist the aid of the mortals and their creations, called the aeons. the gods imbedded the aeons in to their choosen mortals, who would then use the aeons to challenge these odd beings.after the length of the war the gods feared the aeons power and the humans who housed them. so great was their fear that they banished these mortals from the cosmology and hoped that they wouldn't be able to return. then eight-hundred years later these mortals returned with the spirits of the aeons. the strongest of them started a war with the gods for using his brothers and sisters and then just tossing them aside like they were trash. they took up the name the 8 immortals and proceeded to challenge the gods openly, trying to steal converts from the gods. this fight lasted for a hundred years with the aeons and the 8 immortals being sealed away, but not before the most powerful of the immortals used what was left of his immense powers to leave a curse on the world. this curse cut the gods off from the world, no longer able to actively interfer with the events of mortals anymore, only able to watch their children from afar and hope for their children to make it on their own. the other part of the curse released a massive surge with in the world that caused several eidolons who where sealed durning the great war to become released into the world. these eidolons became known as the lords of nightmares and quickly took over the northern continent and frozen lands of vereist. after taking over this area, the eidolons erected a border around it preventing anyone from entering or leaving that area.the game would have several chances for challenges and would also have many different adversaries as well.one of the main issues would be in handling healing and holy powered players. i think i would simply say healers ala clerics would just be white mage like and the others would just be like some other magically powered archtype. the gods would be more like moral guides in this world instead of activately shaping it like in most games and could be a plot point for some to prove if the gods even truly existed or maybe trying to bring about the return of the gods.by being vague with the number of released eidolons, i make it so i can make several weak eidolons with a couple of powerful ones who would be the leaders of this cult. this would allow for me to always have a decent challenge for the party and to also make sure that i would have an unlimited villian supply at anyone time.by having one of the 8 immortals, the strongest one, killed off before the story beings, i can make it so that if the party does get involved in an open conflict with one of this beings they will truly wonder how powerful the most powerful one is and how strong the gods must have been to repel them.wondering what races would be acceptible for this, as well what would be acceptible for classes and if i really should just ban the divine power source or just refluff it.hmmm...

gunblade, bitches and hoes.nervnerdapril 23rd, 2010"firearm" weaponsfor "firearms," i will use plain ol' crossbow stats.  essentially then, "guns" are just refluffed crossbows, which actually works out pretty well.  to make them a bit more distinct, i have a few feat options that players can select.  the idea with these is that, while "guns" are easy to pick up and use (simple ranged weapons), it takes a bit of training to eke out their full potential.arcane firearm channellingprerequisites: any arcane classbenefit: you can use crossbows as implements with any arcane class.  you do not gain the weapon's proficiency bonus to attack rolls when using a crossbow as an implement.deadly firearmbenefit: you treat all crossbows as high crit weapons.[note: i wonder if this one shouldn't be bumped up to paragon, like deadly axe.  the drow racial feat that gives high crit to hand crossbows is what makes me want to keep it here.]scatter shotprerequisites: 11th level, dex 15, con 17benefit: if you miss with a ranged attack with a crossbow and you wouldn't otherwise still deal damage on the miss, you deal damage to your original target equal to your constitution modifier.  this damage receives no modifiers or other benefits you normally gain to weapon damage.[note: instead of having 'blunderbuss' weapons on their own, i just went the easy route, since the "damage on a miss" quality fits them well in the first place.  con as the requisite stat is representative of, say, being able to better control the kick-back of the weapon - better control, more miss damage.  that's the theory anyways.  con also makes the feat mesh well with the careful shooter feat, and with dwarves as a race.]the only "unique" weapon i've statted out thus far is the "gunblade" (or, in d&d terms, the crossbow sword).  no other "guns" really require new stats.double weaponcrossbow sword          +3     1d10     -----     40 gp     10 lb.     heavy blade     stout     - secondary end      +2     1d6       10/20    -----       -----      crossbow         off-hand, load free[note: as was pointed out in the prior thread, very few characters will actually take this weapon, or be able to truly benefit from it.  ranged and two-weapon rangers would both be better served with other superior weapons.  rogues would get no benefit from the heavy blade end.  heavy blade fighters are the best bet, though beastmaster rangers could also benefit (if they select ranged ranger powers as well).  the heavy blade fighter is my favorite option; he can multiclass to glean some significant benefit from the secondary end.  ranger gives him some skirmishing options, if he picks ranged powers.  rogue gives him a 1/round sneak attack, which he can trigger with the secondary end, as well as the skirmishing options.
