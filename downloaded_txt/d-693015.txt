meet our senior pastor


































rev. ann willet longs for a church — and a world — that recognizes the presence of god in all creation.  “each one of us is created in god's image, with the ability to show love and compassion planted deep within.” ann has a heart for people who have been harmed by traditional christianity, and she strives to make northaven a safe space for those deconstructing their faith. “authentic faith includes questions and doubts. your questions are welcome here.”
