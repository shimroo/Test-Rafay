                                        wow!  i just got the ring in today and it looks great!  my dad came over to see it and was amazed how the diamond looks like it is floating.  he tried to get me to let him give it to her now instead of waiting for their anniversary but i wouldn’t let him. ha!  he said he is going to die if he has to wait until july to give it to her.  i know she will be jumping for joy!

thanks again for all of your help

                                        i received both my diamonds and we are very happy about them. 
both diamonds are truly outstanding as compared to those inside the local jewellery store in hong kong.
to be honest, buying a diamond online is a difficult decision for most of us. at first i really afraid if that's a good decision to choose a online shop. but that feeling was gone once i revived the diamond.
whiteflash provides such excellent service in answering my questions. their expert opinions helped a lot in choosing the right diamond. the shipping was fast and the packaging looks amazing.
i will definitely recommend whiteflash to my friends. thank you so much for helping me during the process
