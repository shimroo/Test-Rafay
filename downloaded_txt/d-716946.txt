point hopethere are a half-million kids in foster care throughout america; less than five percent who will ever have permanency through adoption. our points of hope chapters host programs that raise awareness and donations for local foster kids as well as events to lift their spirits and inspire them to dream big.i founded point hope, ghana after discovering that 60,000 liberian refugees were living on 140 acres, equipped to handle only 4,000. it lacked clean water, food and every other basic necessity. it's an understatement to say it broke my heart; i was motivated to take action and help.in the years of its existence point hope has saved countless lives, brought clean water, sanitation, nutritional and agricultural programs, women's training and education to these refugees. we've barely begun.if you are looking for a life-altering experience, become involved in point hope! your life will never be the same.
