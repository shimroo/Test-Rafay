client testimonials


















jody is the best realtor i have ever personally dealt with. she is very knowledgeable about the home search and purchase process and if there is something she doesn't know she will get you an answer just as fast as she can get it. she has an amazing personality and willing to help with anything you're uncertain about. we sold the first home we owned through her and she made sure to go over every detail with us to get our house sold in a timely manor.
we then used her to purchase our second home and she was amazing at helping us find our new home and with getting our closing done as quickly and easily as possible. i would absolutely recommend jody to anyone looking for a realtor!

jody went above and beyond to help us buy our lakehouse. she provided names of local
contractors, was incredibly responsive to all inquiries and was with us through the entire
process through closing. i give her our highest recommendation as an agent.

jody showed us several properties. once we identified the property we wanted, she
accompanied us on several visits to answer our questions. she was very involved ensuring
we closed the sale on time. i highly recommend jody.
