		caring for a loved one with dementia comes with unique challenges, especially in public spaces. as a society, we tend to think if someone is diagnosed with dementia, they just stop doing things. and especially in the early stages, that’s not true. they’re still shopping, getting their car washed, and doing all these normal activities of daily living that we all do.caregiver companion cards offer a simple yet powerful way to foster understanding—helping caregivers navigate social interactions with ease and dignity. these discreet cards gently communicate a loved one’s needs, encouraging kindness, patience, and a more dementia-friendly community.at empath health, we support caregivers with resources that align with our mission of full life care, ensuring every individual is met with compassion and respect.learn more about this thoughtful tool on abc action news - wfts - tampa bay: ow.ly/mxfo50uzmzu #empathhealth #fulllifecare #dementiacare #caregiversupport
