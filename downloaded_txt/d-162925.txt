												welcome to psychologicaltesting.com											

psychological testing techniques are a crowning achievement of scientific psychology. best known clinical instruments include the wechsler iq tests, the mmpi-2, and the rorschach test. testing can be used to quantify almost any psychological construct, including personality, psychopathology, skills, and attitudes. this website has been online for over 25 years and reflects my passion for psychology, testing, and psychological assessment.
