right side auger grain carts
for over 30 years j&m has listened to their customers to continuously improve their trusted line of grain carts and provide the features they demand. once again, j&m has taken the feedback from farmers to create a right-side unload auger on select x-tended reach grain carts, further increasing operator visibility and efficiency.
the biggest benefit of a right-side auger is that it makes unloading easier and more comfortable. tractors are designed with controls and monitors on the right side of the cab. compared to a traditional left-side auger grain cart, putting the auger on the right side makes it much easier to watch the grain cart unload, use the tractor controls and track monitors at the same time. this reduces the risk for mistakes especially during stressful moments and greatly diminishes the amount of twisting and turning while operating the grain cart.

grain carts


since j&m's first patented front-folding corner auger grain cart was introduced in the late 1980s, weâve been designing and building innovative grain carts that help farmers maximize their operating efficiency. j&m offers classic front fold, x-tended reach single auger, or x-tended reach dual auger grain carts to give you, the farmer, options to suit your needs.

lc series speedtendersâ¢


j&m's premium "lc series" self-filling bulk tender design offer a larger capacity tank, luxury controls, lower center of gravity and longer conveyor compared to competitor models. these features allow you to arry more seed with a lower center of gravity for safer transport over the road. the patented v-belt conveyor design transfers seed quickly and gently with greater efficiency, while the longer conveyor lengths can reach the tallest and widest planters with ease.

stabilizer trax2 track system


j&mâs new stabilizer trax2 system provides superior performance while reducing maintenance and increasing cart life. the stabilizer trax2 system features raised idler wheels under light loads, while making full contact under heavy	loads to utilize the entire track footprint to minimize compaction. raised idler wheels reduce tread wear, require less turning force and can easily climb over uneven terrain. the new trax2 system also has improved bogie wheel spacing to distribute the load more evenly for uniform tread wear.
