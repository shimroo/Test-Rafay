where laughing aloud is allowed.



not just a restaurant, it’s an adventure.at magic time machine every seating area is an adventure. will you dine on a carousel, cozy up at the sweethearts table, relax in a thatched hut, or perhaps even kick back in an old refrigerator? the true magic of the magic time machine lies in our cast of characters. our servers bring beloved pop culture icons from the past, present, and future right to your table. the fun is in the playful banter and family-friendly antics. will your server be a daring pirate or a regal princess? a brave hero or a sneaky villain?

dine laughing.
at the magic time machine, we’re all about more than just laughs. enjoy slow-roasted prime rib, hand-cut steaks, fresh salmon, chicken, pork, and a variety of fresh seafood dishes. and don’t miss our specialty of the house: the roman orgy. it’s a feast of roasted delights, fresh fruit, vegetables, and more, all brought out with a lively song and celebration. here, we believe the food should be as special as the occasion!



menu


















serving up fun and flavor.
there’s one constant amidst all this whimsy: our salad bar. and it’s no ordinary salad bar—it’s a gleaming red 1952 mg-td roadster, retrofitted to serve up the freshest salads. every meal comes with a pit stop at this vintage car!
