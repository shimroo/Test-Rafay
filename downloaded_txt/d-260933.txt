when i travel i always call martha!  i tell her what im looking for the price range i need to stay in and what time of year i would like to go!  using her many years of experience she will help me plan my trip!  she does so much more that just book it she may reccomend that time of year is more expensive or that this place is running a special so i get the most for my buck! i am always open for tips! with this day of computers everyone can just go on and book themselves but who is there to help u when things go wrong! we went away on one of our trips ans we had to get my sister in law back home in a medical emergency one call home to martha and she was in contact with the people who got my sister in law home safe . that meant flight change transportation ! it was so comforting not to feel alone in a place where we didnt know a sole!  thank you martha! i credit you for amazing travel experiences for many years now! you rock!!

it was a pleasure working with kim sgambato when planning a few vacations, in the last year.  kim provided great options that met my budget.  she works at your pace when planning, so not to overwhelm you.  she is patient and professional. 

last spring we bought my in laws and families to nyc.  kim found great affordable options for accommodations (that everyone finally agreed upon) and provided lots of extra insights to attractions and the area where we were staying.

this past summer, kim put together a stress free last minute vacation for my family.  i gave her the perimeters i was looking for and my budget and the trip was booked that day.  she even checked us in on our return flight, so i never had to look at my watch! 

no worries - no stress traveling

dealing with matt was the absolute best!  he was very attentive to our needs and matched our desires for accommodations, transportation, and tours perfectly.  matt was always either available or very responsive to our inquiries pertaining to the travel plans.  i would absolutely recommend him to anyone needing travel arrangements, particularly in italy.  my wife and i look forward to working with matt again!
