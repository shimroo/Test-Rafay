trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.proverbs 3:5-6he has shown you, o mortal, what is good. and what does the lord require of you?to act justly, love mercy, and to walk humbly with your godmicah 6:8even though i walk through the darkest valley, i will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff comfort me. psalms 23:4but he said, “my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” therefore, i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that christ’s power may rest on me.2 corinthians 12:9finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things. philippians 4:8give thanks in all circumstances, for this is god’s will for you in christ jesus.1 thessalonians 5:18and he said to them all, if any man comes after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.luke 9:23
