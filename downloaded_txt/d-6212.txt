    we had a great experience purchasing a new hot springs spa from scott horton at olympic. he answered all of our questions and being first time hot tub owners made sure we understood all of the functions and requirements to use and maintain the tub to get the most out of our investment. even after the sale he stayed in regular contact with us as the delivery date and set up approached ensuring everything was on time and went smoothly, which it absolutely did! we had a great experience with olympic and you will too! thank you scott for the great sales experience, the delivery team which took great care of the hot tub making sure it was set in place without a scratch exactly where i needed it, and their technician neil who did our final set up and orientation, we were hot tubbing in no time, well done olympic!!

    i recently went to the everett store to learn everything about my hot tub’s features and  maintenance requirements.
scott horton was so patient and answered all of my questions. he methodically walked me through the many features, and thoroughly discussed how to best care for the hot tub.
he also recommended a few products tailored to my specific needs. i definitely left more confident in knowing that i could manage this investment. scott also said he was available should i have additional questions.thanks scott!

    wonderful sales room experience.  helpful employees.  great product (freshwater salt sysytem spa). delivery was a bit wonky do to staffing issues they're trying to overcome.  on that end it was sometimes difficult to reach someone for help. hope they get that fixed to match with the higher quality sales experience.

    stopped in with my wife to olympic hot tub and really wasn’t considering buying. scott h. suggested we give the jetsetter saltwater spa a try.  borrowed the swim trunks and suit and stepped in… sold!
it’s been almost a year and the only time it isn’t used is when i’m out of town.  102 degrees on the coldest nights is amazing!  great therapy before bed and more solid sleep.  should have done this years ago!  thank you!

    we love our hot tub, purchased grandee model. we just got it but have been used more times than the days we’ve owned it. sales, delivery, post delivery were all excellent. thanks to gil ortiz @ everett for all the help and letting us know step by step of the process and was always available if we had any questions.
