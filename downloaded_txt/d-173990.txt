our brand is
love




every man, woman and child wants to feel accepted in this world. we all have a need to be a valued member of a community, a member who is confident, always curious and compassionate. at st. genevieve we nurture an environment where children, teenagers and adults feel valued, loved and worthy.
a top priority for our leadership team is to hire teachers and coaches who love children, love teaching, and love being a learner right alongside our students. we hire knowledgeable teachers who are likable and who will be good role models for students of all ages.
we know that when students feel loved and accepted, they achieve more. this is true academically, athletically and artistically; students reach higher and work harder when they are surrounded with and by love.
