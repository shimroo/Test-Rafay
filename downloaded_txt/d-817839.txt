bluebird, babies & mealworms





this was the first we've seen the babies since they fledged about 2 weeks ago.  we knew they were out there ... somewhere.  the parents have been coming for mealworms each morning, then flying off in all directions to feed the babies.  now the babies are chasing daddy for food.here the fledgling picked up a worm by himself.  looks like he wasn't quite sure what to do with it.

small town sights





driving through littleton a couple of weeks ago, i asked my husband to stop the car so i could take a photo of the horse coming down the road.the horse was not one bit camera shy.  he came right up to the car window for a close up.  i'm glad i hadn't opened the window.
