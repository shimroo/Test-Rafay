when choosing climbing equipment for our garden, we spoke to three different companies, and the response from home front was head and shoulders above the rest.

it’s one impressive playground, it’s something we’re incredibly proud of.  it’s fantastic that it’s open. it is far better than we expected when we first kicked off this programme last year. and the feedback we get, people just think it’s wonderful.

“
very very pleased with our home front play equipment!
we did a lot of research and compared other competitors, but we are so glad we chose home front. the quality of the product is very high - well designed using good materials, nice rounded edges and very strong indeed.

we upgraded our school playground equipment and found, home front. their expertise is second to none and their team were helpful throughout the process. we now have a beautiful new playground for the kids, and even improved surfacing!

“
can’t recommend home front enough, we were looking for a solid climbing frame that was going to last years and years. luke was so helpful in going through all of the configurations over the phone and then sending us drawings of the finalised design. delivery was really quick too.
