wine with laughter
 located in the heart of the finger lakes region, on the south end of beautiful keuka lake.  overlooking the lake you can taste over 40 wines at our tasting bar with energetic and knowledgeable staff.  wine is the perfect complement to incredible food, and our restaurant has been a regional institution for lunch for decades.  enjoy our house dish,  maryland-style crab cakes topped with pan-seared scallops, on our grand deck overlooking keuka lake.  

everyone is welcome to enjoy the winery and restaurant.  for groups of 10 or more, please call in advance to make a reservation. 607-868-3610
