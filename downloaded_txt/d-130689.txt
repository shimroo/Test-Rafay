what is a

shotrock?


a shotrock is a shot glass made out of ice! imagine lifting a solid block of ice to your

lips and drinking a freezing cold shooter...so cold and so good! shotrocks are the best

way to drink jagermeister, goldschlager, aftershock, southern comfort, cuervo, and more.

any shooter which should be served cold, tastes better and goes down faster when served in

a shotrock!
