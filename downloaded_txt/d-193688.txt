quality products
our homes utilize high-quality products from renowned brands such as andersen, merillat, corian, congoleum, formica, moen, schlage, georgia pacific, and certainteed.










02. 



offered programs
for those who prefer to take a hands-on approach, we offer a 'do-it-yourself' program that can save you thousands. we are a full-service builder, capable of managing every aspect of the building project or assisting those who wish to handle the site work and subcontracting themselves. once set on your foundation, your home is 90% complete, reducing the need for additional subcontractors.








03. 



our specialization
are you seeking premium quality housing that is both affordable and rapidly available? we specialize in the construction of off-site, systems-built modular homes, built indoors, in a controlled environment, using premium building systems, without the worry of weather or contractor availability.










04. 



our services
whether you're building your dream home, a vacation residence, or a cozy northern michigan cottage, we offer a range of home styles, including ranch, cape cod/chalet, two-story, and duplex-style homes. we offer over 80 floor plans but can also customize plans to match your unique needs.
