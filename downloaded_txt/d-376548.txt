5 star reviews















"great practice tool with immediate feedback. i changed my swing path when i got my first feedback and found immediate speed improvement."
amazon customer,april 9, 2023











"just started using the speed sensor and it works just as the seller indicated. for a golfer who doesn't need all the data provided by an expensive launch monitor, only swing speed , this tool is useful and more than adequate."
john gmarch 16, 2023











"this product has transformed my game. i’m swinging it faster than ever and had my best ever round a few days after using it. it seems too good to be true but it isn’t."
maneauxapril 15, 2019











"this works great for a coach catching balls from their pitcher during practice. you don't have to worry about aiming a radar tool at the flight path of the ball, since you are catching the ball."
amazon customermay 9, 2013











this device has been an excellent tool to assist in my daughters training in fast pitch softball.
