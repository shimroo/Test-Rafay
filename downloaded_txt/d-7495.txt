scouting is an international, uniformed youth movement. it provides young people, from 6 years of age upwards, a wealth of opportunity to develop and grow.
for more information on scouting in the uk please visit the official website of the scout association:
scouts

free web hosting for scouts
thanks to netweaver
 was recently approached by netweaver, who have hosted my scouting resources site, barking and dagenham district site, greater london north east site, thriftwood site and much more for many years. they had heard about the financial difficulties that scout groups were in and wanted to help.

they have created this page
https://www.netweaver.uk/free-web-hosting-for-scout-groups/


to generously offer free webhosting to scout groups.

they have also asked me to pass this information on as well.

i can only thank them kindly for their generosity and i can highly recommend their excellent service. they have proven to be outstanding in their dedication and response to all types of problems and inquiries from me. they are incredibly patient when it has been my stupidity that has caused a problem as well as providing excellent quality advice.




what can scouting resources do for me?
an overview of what you can gain from the site
scouting resources can provide a useful source of information for scouters and scouts alike. with basic introductions and information on all the major scouting skills and some detailed work and information on specific areas it can form the basis of your own work.
the site offers a good deal of material on the more 'traditional scouting skills such as map, compass, camping, knots and pioneering. these include pictures and 'tutorials' on the major subject areas and the links section can provide an excellent selection of links to further information.
the scouting programme is well catered for with sections on weather, codes, signs, countries, cultures and the jungle book.
part of the unique attraction of scouting are those things that you rarely get a chance to experience elsewhere. remember how much fun your first campfire was? with hundreds of campfire songs and stunts and skits you can keep the campfire magic going. even when you have exhausted these you can get your hands on hundreds more from the links section. this is equally true for games, scout leaders need never be hard pressed for a game idea again.
there is information for the leaders among us too. you can take a look at the downloads section and see what you might find useful in your group. the ideabase holds a few good ideas and the links section links you to thousands more.
if all else fails you can contact us to ask for help from the swapshop or the contact page.

about me


		  i have taken on many disguises during my time in scouting including assistant cub scout leader at the 9th barking & dagenham scout group, adc scouts, activity team leader, district & county webmaster, directory and newsletter editor and such like.  which all means i officially do not have a clue what i am doing!.
i have been in scouting since i was a cub, and was asked to help out whilst in the scouts and never managed to actually get away.
we are an active group, with beaver, cub and scout sections meeting at st. elisabeth's church hall in wood lane, dagenham.
if you want to get in touch with me then you can email 
          me. further information on my scouting background can be found on the 
          about me page.
