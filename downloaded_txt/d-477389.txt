'ohana

there is nothing more important in hawai'i than 'ohana (family). the word "ohana" is translated to "offshoots," meaning the new shoots on the halo (taro) plant. we are offshoots forever connected to each other by our common root. stories and cultural practices were passed down within families so that today we can honor our 'ohana and share its beauty.

            celebrate 'ohana
        
meet our polynesian cousins from samoa, tahiti and new zealand. hear our stories through song and dance as we present the splendor and beauty of this land we call paradise.
