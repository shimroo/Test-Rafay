travel writer reviews: 










						“if cemetery expert and writer rob florence isn’t leading this garden district tour, then one of his very knowledgeable associates will be. the garden district tour hits all the highlights including architecture, celebrities’ homes and a tour of lafayette cemetery #1.”					


- time out guide, new orleans 






						among the high-camp, overpriced and the plain silly, there are nonetheless a few tours worth joining: nola historic tours offers professional, fascinating insights.”					


- rough guide usa 






						“voodoo-oriented tours abound in new orleans, but the one led by writer and former jean lafitte national park ranger robert florence emphasizes the practice’s traditional heritage and history rather than myths and tall tales.”					


- access guide, new orleans 






						“of the many voodoo tours available, voodoo proponents most highly regard the no-hype cemetery and voodoo history tour sponsored by historic new orleans tours.”
					


- lonely planet, deep south 






						"historic tours is the place to go for authenticity rather than sensationalism.”

						i'm so happy we decided to go for guided tours as part of our whirlwind tour de new orleans!  we went on both the scandalous cocktail tour and the haunted french quarter tour.  even though both were in the french quarter, there was almost no overlap in the tours themselves.  as someone who is not that into history, dating someone who is super into history, we were both very happy with the content.  our guide (james!) was extremely entertaining and engaging, very good at giving everyone attention (you know how sometimes tour participants like to take the guide aside and mumble around for 30 minutes while you just plod along behind them...yeah, not the case with our guide), and always checked to make sure everyone could hear.

						the garden district tour that my boyfriend and i went on this past week during our visit to new orleans was really enjoyable. we like our vacations to be a combination of spontaneous exploring and more structured activities, and in terms of something in the latter category, i highly recommend one of these walking tours!

our tour guide was frank currie, and he was great. he mentioned that he had previously taught at tulane. his enthusiasm for the historical information he was presenting was infectious, and he was very knowledgable and approachable if you had any questions. he also genuinely cared about the people on the tour and kept reminding us all to drink water (very important given the 110 degree heat index!).

						highly recommend this company for the walking tours... we took two: the french quarter and the garden district.

on both walking tours we had the same tour guide, dave; he was great.  dave went to great lengths to weave facts, historical stories and anecdotes to create an entertaining tour.  dave made an effort to be in tune with the group and would give a more in depth discussion of what everyone seemed to be more interested in.

in addition, dave was friendly and welcoming.  in the beginning of our garden district tour, a wandering group of people seemed lost.  dave encouraged them to join our group, of course he did collect the proper fees from them (i don't want to get dave in trouble).  i thought this was great customer service when a lesser tour guide could have been rude or handled it improperly.

						wonderful tours and tour guides. we came here in the spring and went on the garden district tour (a must do - the houses are incredible), and the haunted french quarter tour. 

definitely would recommend an early tour for the garden district - it gets hot, the tour is long, and there really isn't any shade. however, it's so worth it. i think our tour guide was angeline, or evangeline? i could be totally wrong - but she was an adorable french canadian woman, and we loved her! so knowledgeable, and managed a huge group flawlessly.

                    great tour of garden district

dave was an awesome guide for the garden district. he has an incredible amount of knowledge and personal experience in the garden district and was generous with his insights into the individual houses and their history.
