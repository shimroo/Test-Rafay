nuthin' in the news (um right*) so here's charlie, metalcore drummer extraordinaire:






(via the daily what)

as a "dog person" part of me was tempted to think "animal cruelty" while watching this but the other, less self-righteous part of me couldn't stop laughing.  actual tears during certain parts.  worth watching all the way through.

indie nerd comedy gold





i was going to post a huge rant about many of the media reactions to last weekend's horrible assassination attempt and murders but i've been too busy -- plus i'm not quite ready to allow my eyes and ears to be exposed to sarah palin's selfish, vain and defensive facebook video response (i'm not sure what i'm going to be able to do about all of the blood that will inevitably gush out of those orifices).  so instead, here's something that made me happy:

(she can dance to any song, no matter the tempo. try it. i pretty much guarantee you won't be disappointed.)



heavy rotation (shuffle mode suggested)



this is the weisnick family's everyday playlist. it changes (somewhat) on a weekly basis as new albums are released (or when my mood shifts). it is fairly eclectic and is reminsiscent of a time when radio was unsegregated.




the first 47 songs on this playlist were originally assembled by musician ryuichi sakamoto for his favorite japanese restaurant in new york city. he loved the food but he hated the music so he created a playlist that complemented the dining experience rather than distracted from it. the rest of the playlist was created by a spotify algorithm that picks songs similar to what has been previously played when a playlist runs out of tracks. beyond dinner, this playlist is highly recommended for chilling, relaxing, and releasing cobwebs from your brain. (more information)



the "best" new music of 2019, updated every friday.



#ones that never were: pretty much what the title implies, if you had my taste in so-called "pop" music. kind of a desert island playlist, for the weisnicks.




music for driving through the fog on mulholland drive or smoking a cigarette in the rain outside a jazz club in nyc.




cover tunes. lots of cover tunes.




just in case you forget to breathe. a perfect antidote for the daily news cycle.




the complete beastie boys masterpiece and most of the songs they sampled.




some of the best music of the last decade was created or fronted by women. it's true. have a listen...




late '70s, early '80s goodness.




may we suggest a decanter of manhattan, martini, or daiquiri?




all things eno-related (his bands, his solo recordings, his collaborations, his productions, his enosification). pretty much the history of modern music.




currently the best soundtrack composer in the business (imho)
