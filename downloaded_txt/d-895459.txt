 three-time grammy® nominee seven-time emmy® nomineecritics’ choice nominee  










        hello & welcome!    hello, everyone—
i’ve completed my new album, the green world. the songs were written with eddie arkin, shelly berg, russell ferrante, michael valerio, and arturo o’farrill. it was mixed by don murray and mastered by bernie grundman.
tgw will be out at the end of march. the public page will be up shortly, but in the meantime, here’s a “making of” video about russ’s and my song “disappearing universe.”


air-edel will be reissuing several of my old titles shortly after the new album release. i’m very excited about that, as some have been unavailable for quite a while.
the musical i’ve been working on with composer  nan schwartz in la and show creator kat de blois, in paris, is still in progress, as is nan’s and my project—a musical theatre version of  the grammarians, by cathleen schine. 
more soon,
