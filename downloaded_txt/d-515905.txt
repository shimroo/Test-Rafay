        should mention that we took the dvds to south africa and they were
amazed.  we also saw some there that had been converted and they were no
where near the quality of yours ...
i just wanted to say a huge thank you for what you have been able to produce from that flooded wedding tape i sent you. it has come out so fantastic i am almost lost for words ...
we wanted to convey how pleased we are to have chosen dvd infinity to transfer our slides and 8mm films to dvd. given some of the material was well over 50 years old, the results exceed all expectation ...
