moorea tattoo: polynesian tattoo master in tahiti

 

















james samuela

 


a native tahitian whose ancestors were among the first tattoo artists in tahiti, james samuela started tattooing professionally in 1996 after studying art at the esteemed l’ecole nationale des beaux arts in paris. following the strict hygiene standards established in the usa, james is accustomed to providing an unsurpassed level of service to his  clients. whether working with a modern machine or the ancient tools of his ancestors, james enjoys bringing a fresh perspective to his work. he remains one of the few tattoo artists in tahiti still practicing traditional tahitian tattoo.  james & his work have been featured in publications such as islands, ink, sportdiver as well as television and radio programs around the world.
