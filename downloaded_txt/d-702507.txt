first-class relic
st. dymphna is the patroness of those afflicted with mental and nervous disorders.  although many have never heard of st. dymphna, she is becoming increasingly popular during these days of worry, fear and anxiety. then, too, there are few people in the world who are not at some time or another troubled with their nerves.

***due to the rise in postage and other expenses, we are forced to raise our annual membership fee from $5.00 per person to $6.00 per person.  we pray this is not a hardship for our members.











the league of st. dymphna comprises members who invoke her intercession that they will be preserved from mental and nervous disorders, or soon recover if now afflicted. the membership in the league is $6.00 per year, and you will share in our continuous novenas, plus the benefits listed on the application. (click here) most members are enrolled and make the novenas with us for a relative or friend who is having a real struggle climbing the hill of recovery. we receive a number of letters expressing gratitude for favors received. many recoveries can be attributed to st. dymphna’s intercession. there are some, however, who must continue to carry the heavy burden of mental suffering and we should not overlook the merit they gain for all eternity.





 






7-day votive candle lighted at the shrine
