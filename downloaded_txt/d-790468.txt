"we believed that we could build a company that would make a positive difference and would be a safe harbor for people who were looking for a permanent home," said faltinsky. backed by 20 investors including famed investment guru, anson beard of morgan stanley/dean witter, and with leading nutritionist, and author of the greatest-selling nutritional book, the vitamin bible, earl mindell on their team in an exclusive relationship, ray and kevin launched freelife international in 1995. a few short years later, freelife was ranked by inc. magazine as one of the fastest-growing, privately held companies in america. further information of goji may be found under the following titles goji juice, goji berries, goji, himalayan goji juice, himalayan goji, berry goji juice, benefit goji juice, goji juice testimonials, freelife goji, freelife goji juice, scientific research goji, goji juice pure, freelife.com goji himalayan juice. 100 goji, goji story, berry goji himalayan, tibetan goji berries, dried goji berries, goji drink, goji berry plant, goji plant, sacred goji waters, goji research,   for more information on this product or the company please follow link below  http://www.mygojisystem.com/jeffdameron or http://www.mygojisystem.com/site/index.asp?dl=132483&ad=0
