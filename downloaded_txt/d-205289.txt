                                        goals

this website began as a simple one-page
                                      site in june 2004, after my initial
                                      research into my father's military
                                      history. however, it quickly and
                                      unbelievably snow-balled into what you see
                                      before you today. i now have a
                                      comprehensive understanding of the 540th
                                      after reading hundreds of pages of sitreps
                                      from the national archives, talking with
                                      members of his unit, perusing through
                                      dozens of books, contacting various
                                      institutions, including the army corps of
                                      engineers' office of history, and meeting
                                      people throughout the world.
this site's main emphasis revolves around
                                      information regarding the vi corps
                                      engineer combat regiments:  
                                      - 36th - 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions
                                      (later renamed the 2826th, 2827th &
                                      2828th) 
                                      - 39th - 1st and 2nd battalions 
                                      - 540th - 1st and 2nd battalions (later
                                      renamed the 2832nd & 2833rd)  
                                      - 1108th - 48th & 235th battalions  
                                      these independent engineer regiments,
                                      bravely fought against the axis powers
                                      beginning with the invasion of north
                                      africa in november of 1942. from there,
                                      their arduous journey led them into
                                      sicily, italy, southern france and central
                                      europe, before ending their tour of duty
                                      in germany and austria in 1945.   
                                      however, these pages now proudly feature
                                      hundreds of links, tidbits and full-blown
                                      accounts of various other units, along
                                      with photos, memoirs, maps, after-action
                                      reports and more.  
                                      if you are a wwii vet or a family member
                                      and wish to include your history or the
                                      history of a loved one, i'd love to hear
                                      from you. my main emphasis is to acquire
                                      the history of the men who served with the
                                      1st, 3rd, 9th, 34th, 36th, & 45th
                                      infantry divisions, 1st & 2nd armored
                                      divisions, 82nd airborne, and any other
                                      unit who fought alongside the 36th, 39th,
                                      540th or 1108th combat engineers in the
