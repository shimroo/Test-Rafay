                that true of any dictator, of any totalitarian society? insofar
                as social development is concerned, nothing is of greater

                                                upon the promontory of a high 
                                                mesa.
mount 
                                                ecclesia was launched in october 
                                                28, 1911, through a ceremony 
                                                of ground-breaking which consisted 
                                                in planting a large cross with 
                                                the initials c.r.c. â meaning 
                                                christian rose cross, the head 
                                                of the rosicrucian order â painted 
                                                in gilt letters on the three 
                                                upper ends and with a climbing 
                                                rose.
the 
                                                healing temple "the ecclesia" 
                                                was erected, for the purpose 
                                                of affording more powerful means 
                                                for the healing of disease, 
                                                and dedicated on december 25, 
                                                1920. spiritual healing meetings 
                                                are held in this holy place 
                                                at a regular time each day by 
                                                the probationers who have consecrated 
                                                their lives to this work.
since 
                                                its foundation, the rosicrucian 
                                                fellowship faithfully observes 
                                                the basic condition, set by 
                                                its founder max heindel, that 
                                                no price, membership dues or 
                                                fees, should be put on its teachings.

                                                mission, is to become a spiritual 
                                                center in the world, as an effort 
                                                "to unite and harmonize 
                                                each with the others by teaching 
                                                a religion that is both scientific

                                                (historical notes: october 28, 
                                                1911 [1])




landscape equilibrium






 



c.r.c., the founder's cross
mount ecclesia landscape, with its 24 man-made structures (23 buildings and the main entrance conic area), the lovely rose gardens and a luxuriant preserved vegetation â in the middle of one of the world's most expensive and intensive real estate development areas, in southern california â has become a paradigm of landscape equilibrium between the development of a built environment and the conservation of the natural environment.
in 1989, the restoration of mount ecclesia "old landmarks" and unreinforced masonry buildings was outlined. in order to comply with oceanside's earthquake secure construction rules, effort is being made, dependent upon donations, to renovate and reinforce the structures.

 temple's architecture
as in all the solar temples, "the ecclesia" portal is facing east (the rising sun). in front of the portal stand two palm trees. the portal is constituted by a triangle structure upon two round columns (pilasters), containing in the centre an equilateral triangle with the 'all-seeing-eye'. the columns fuse greek and roman styles, each one with a capital crowned by a finial globe. the round 12-sided building architecture is composed by round arches and narrow round inward windows. its great dome is composed by a cupola crowned by a golden globe with a finial of lights. the inner portal and the temple's interior is ornamented with alchemical and astrological symbols. it is a solar temple dedicated to the coming age of aquarius..

light to mount ecclesia  o god, increase my love for thee
so that i may serve thee better from day to 
day.
let the words of my mouth
and the meditation of my heart
be acceptable in thy sight,
o lord, my strength and my redeemer,
i ask that christ's light engulfs mount ecclesia 
and the rosicrucian fellowship
so that this holy place will keep on flying higher 
and radiating its light
and healing energies all over the globe, until we 
meet again at the rose cross,
with roses garnished, and our hearts pure, 
untarnished.
 may the roses bloom upon your cross
