dawnbreaker has been monumental in the development of unique commercialization services that are 
responsive to each agency’s unique needs; provide effective business mentoring for the widest array of 
sbir/sttr awardees and  provides lasting business lessons that extend beyond the sbir/sttr program. 







 

x 

the sbir program was introduced via 
the small business innovation development  
act of 1982, an amendment to the small 
business  act. no administrative funds were 
made  available for agencies to implement 
the program, nor were funds made available  
to provide commercialization assistance. 

 







 

x 

the department of energy was the first agency  
to provide commercialization assistance to sbir 
awardees (1990). dr. sam barish and mr. ron 
toms were the programs’ champions. using a 
“tin cup” approach they gathered funds for the 
first phase ii cap.

 

 







 

x 

having been part of the intrapreneurial 
experiment at a fortune 500 company, 
dr. servo knew the importance of having 
metrics to demonstrate the impact of a 
program. the metric selected was 
phase iii $$$ secured within 18 months 
of cap completion.


 

 







 

x 

the first cap was small and focused on 
assisting companies develop business plans 
and bringing them together with potential
partners/investors. dawnbreaker showcased 
the companies at an opportunity forum® 
and took the financial risk to cover venue 
costs. on average 40% of program 
participants secured phase iii funding 
within 18 months.
 

 







 

x 

the small business research and development
enhancement act of 1992 drew attention to 
commercial potential, and allowed agencies 
to spend no more than $4,000 per company 
for commercialization assistance during 
phase i. the small business technology 
transfer program was introduced in the 
same year via the small business technology 
transfer act of 1992.
 

 







 

x 

dr. kesh narayanan and mr. joe hennessey 
were the champions for the nsf phase i 
commercialization planning program which 
began at nsf in 2000 with a focus on both 
commercialization and training.
 

 







 

x 

as nsf modified its requirements for the phase ii 
commercialization plans that companies were to 
include in their proposals, dawnbreaker 
continually modified its program to provide best 
value. innovations included the virtual strategic 
partner introduction (vspi), various market 
research initiatives and webinars.
 

 







 

x 

the committee of visitors noted  an
improvement in the quality of 
phase ii proposals submitted.

x 

the commercialization process within 
mission agencies is different than in the 
private sector. this process referred to 
as “transition” within dod and “infusion” 
within nasa requires an understanding 
of the manner in which technology is 
acquired, technology readiness levels, 
test and evaluation, risk assessment 
and protocols.
 

 







 

x 

mr. vinnie schaper, john williams and 
steve sullivan were the champions for 
the navy transition assistance program, 
while gynelle steele was the champion for 
pilot program at nasa glenn. this phase ii 
program included the development of 
quad charts, narrative briefings, phase iii 
transition plans, market research, 
powerpoint presentations and 
participation in the navy opportunity 
forum.® in addition, dawnbreaker 
developed the newsletter referred to 
as transitions and developed 
success stories.
 

 







 

x 

the primary metric for success was phase iii 
funding secured within 18 months. other 
metrics included the number of attendees at 
the navy opportunity forum and their ratings 
of the event. dr. servo received a tibbetts award 
in 2002 based on work done with the navy. 

 







 

x 

long term,  clear differences were noted 
in the rate of commercialization between 
those that participated in the tap and those 
that didn’t. those that participated in the 
tap were 30% more likely to be successful 
in transition to phase iii.
 

 







 

x 

 the small business innovation research 
program reauthorization act of 2000 
allowed companies to select their own 
vendor to provide technical assistance 
which could include access to a network 
of scientists and engineers. this option 
when selected by a company  was referred 
to as discretionary technical assistance 
and was an alternative to the agency 
provided vendor. 
 

 







 

x 

in response to a 2015 solicitation from the 
department of energy, dawnbreaker 
developed an extensive menu of services 
for phase i and phase 2 awardees. the 
menu of services was designed to provide 
numerous alternatives to companies of 
varying degree of sophistication.    

 







 

x 

with a shift to providing many service 
options, concurrent with the move away 
from the government sponsored events 
where one could bring partners/investors
 and companies together – process metrics 
were collected, which indicated the degree 
of satisfaction the small business had with 
the services provided
 

 







 

x 

the sbir/sttr reauthorization act of 2011 
drew attention to the need to improve the
 efforts to engage women, minorities and 
companies in underrepresented states in
 the sbir/sttr program.
 

 







 

x 

mr. manny oliver and christopher o’gwin 
from the department of energy were the 
champions for this initiative. 
 

 







 

x 

 metrics include the number of participants
 that submit proposals developed with 
dawnbreaker’s assistance and the 
percentage of those that win an award. 
variations on this program have been
 piloted with nih and usda.
 

 







 

x 

to increase the reach of the sbir/sttr 
programs, train the trainer (ttt) services 
were developed and provided to the 
networks of service providers including 
small business development centers 
(sbdc), procurement technical assistance 
centers (ptac) and incubators.

developing network contacts (devnc) 



when you need to reach out... 



there are times when you need to reach out to others – whether you are looking for potential customers, potential partners, or potential investors. but who should you call…and how do you address your fear of contacting them. the devnc is a unique market research tool designed to provide you with between 25 and 30 points of contact (poc). with each poc, information is included that provides insight about the person’s role. depending on their position, other information commonly included relates to their background, articles that they have written, conference presentations and other pertinent information. this type of information enables you to customize your correspondence. contact information is also included  – typically linkedin, email and phone number.
