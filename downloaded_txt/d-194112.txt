ski-hi institute






we are the ski-hi institute - a group of dedicated individuals whose goal is to enhance the lives of children with sensory impairments, their families, and service providers.
our work, begun in 1972, focuses on developing new programs, materials, and training for children who are deafblind, deaf or hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired, and those who work with them.
we are a part of the institute for disability research, policy and practice at utah state university in logan, utah.

western regional early intervention conference (wreic)
the western regional early intervention conference (wreic) supports professionals working with, and families of, children birth to three years old who are deaf/hard of hearing, blind/visually impaired, or deafblind. speakers and workshops focus on the most current research, technology, resources, and practices in our ever-evolving field. the conference will be held september 22-24, 2025, in albuquerque, nm.
wreic has been in place for over 35 years, making it one of the longest ongoing early intervention conferences in the country. in the early years of this conference, skihi staff pulled togeteher a coordinating committee and funding from programs in the western states of ut, co, nm, az, wy, nv, and id. the conference has continued to take place every other year, with these states taking turns hosting. but the planning continues to be done by a team of leaders from all of these states.
