always keep the areas around the eyes mouth and nose and also the neck 
well cared for and moisturized.

into the wrinkles before going to sleep. the next morning wash with warm
 water and dry with a rough towel firmly. once again rub in the cream - 
in the direction opposite to the wrinkles. wait for ½ an hour and wash, 
avoid using soap.


tip 2:

rub the pulp of a ripe papaya on the face and leave for ½ an hour before washing.
