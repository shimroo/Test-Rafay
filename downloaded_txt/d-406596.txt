how did they know that four was my ocd number



 farmwife tagged me with a unique meme. go to her post and there is the sweetest photo, in complete contradition to the one i am showing here.if you wanna play along, here's how it works.1. go to the 4th picture folder on your computer.2. post the 4th picture in that folder.3. explain the picture.4. tag 4 more people.she also gives a nice explanation of why they chose the number four.i must confess, however, that i was excited at the number 4, being as when i get stressed, i count things in multiples of four. there you have it, another reason to wonder about my sanity and advise me to stay away from heat sources and sharp objects.as for the photograph above, i think i shot it in anticipation of a post about the fact that we bought a new mattress and box springs for our upstairs guest room, only to discover that the box springs couldn't squeeze through the doorway up the stairs. so, we had to stow them in the garage and have a series of 2 x 6 boards cut to become the foundation of the mattress. sad, boring and true. this was shot at the hardware store.now, as for the tagging. let's see, how about any of you that wish to participate do. i'm feeling a bit lax in the rule department these days. have at it.

taking bets



so, we joined a new fitness facility. i won't call it a gym because it's associated with our local hospital and all dedicated to wellness and such. which is a good thing because it's been so long since i've been such a facility that i might need medical attention.i officially became a member january 1, but since i still can't take a full breath of air, i haven't been "able" to go yet. (translation: i've been too busy and too lazy.)tonight we are supposed to go. cynical even gave me an edict: "i'll be really tired tonight, but make me go."it's raining. it's nasty and seriously sad outside.who is taking bets as to whether we go or not?ps: i published the photograph of tangerines on our kitchen table to prove that we have more than fudge, candy cane kisses and butter cookies in our house. there is some nutrition available if we so choose.

anybody baking bread?



 i wish i was writing a post about all of the things i accomplished today. if i did, i'd be lying. in truth i've done little or nothing today. seems i just couldn't get myself motivated to do much more than watch a marathon of "the secret life of the american teenager." i should be ashamed of myself, but i really am not. i should have repainted the wall in the kitchen. i should have organized my basket of receipts. i should have taken a walk. maybe i should have at least finished my resolution list. but i did none of the above.i did manage to tidy up a bit. i did harvest some crops on my facebook farm and i did a load of laundry. perhaps my biggest accomplishment (outside of the aforementioned marathon) was making dinner, such as it was. just some steamed asparagus, baked and marinated pork chops, and garlic-parsley potatoes. i was quite satisfied with myself, particularly in that everything was actually pretty good and done at about the same time. this from a girl who grew up with her mom rewarming foods repeatedly in an attempt to keep them warm.as for the rest of my evening, there are a few more episodes of this show still to go and cynical baked some cookies. i'm not sure what has captivated me with this show, except maybe i was able to watch it, not think much and get to see molly ringwold all grown up. and it made me realize all the more that i never want to relive high school whether in my mind or in reality.off to search for some easy online yeast bread recipes. any of you have one to share?

reflecting and planning



cynical and i typically spend our new year's eve at home. i make up bunches of finger foods. we dine on lil smokies, shrimp, veggies and wine. he sleeps. i watch movies and knit. it's a peaceful wrap-up for the year gone by and a nice welcome for the one to come.this year, however, we joined some family and friends for a proper party. i must admit, it was tough for both of us to stay up that late after all of the mayhem of a game called "spoons", cards, margaritas, charades and other antics that i'd rather not share. (oh, come on, it's us, how wild could it have been.) new year's came and passed and i felt as if something was missing.i suspect what i was craving was that big block of private, quiet time when i contemplate the year gone by and make big plans for the year to come. yes, i actually write down resolutions and often i even refer to them throughout the year. they are well planned, well-thought-out and very reflective of the person i want to be. now, they aren't always kept, followed or even thoroughly considered. but, i do make a good faith effort, at least in the planning phase.so, this year's resolution writing is happening a tad later than usual. but, i figure, what's a few days when you are preparing for an entire year, right?some are too personal to share, but if you are super nice and incredibly patient, i might let you peek at a few. for instance, i want to learn to bake bread and plant a garden. (speaking of patience, we could all use a dose of it in 2009, don't you think?)what are your plans for 2009?

gratitude



i've been doing some pouting and whining lately, lamenting over illness, leaks and roofing. in an effort to dig my way out of this horrible mood, i thought instead of tallying the repair bills or the number of times i have blown my nose, i thought i'd count my blessings and perhaps ask for a little input.humor me for a moment as i list a few things i am grateful for today:1. i am thankful that we were able to find two reliable and sensible workmen to brave the cold and help us with all of our water issues.2. i am grateful for the time i have gotten to spend with loved ones over the holiday.3. peppermint flavored stuff: ice cream, kisses, coffee. . .4. the sunshine streaming through the windows. even though the temperatures have dropped, the sun is shining, bringing beautiful light into the house..5. creative, caring people. i am surrounded, both online and offline, by creative and kind people. what a blessing.and now onto the interactive part of this post. soon i'll be making my resolutions or plans for the new year. what are you hoping to accomplish in 2009. i'd like to reach beyond the typical weight loss and financial goals. maybe dig a little deeper.

miracles and other events



when we came home christmas eve, we spied a miracle in the living room. in the event you don't believe it, i snapped the photograph above. you see, our little eli (on the right) isn't what i'd call a "social being". in fact, he resents our very existence and spends his days spying on us. and izzie, well, she's her own girl, independent and unforgiving.it seems, however, that the two decided to put aside their grudges and share our chair. i am not sure if it was the true christmas spirit or perhaps a chill in the air.

about me





ragged around the edges


i am simply a girl with a lot to say and no one to listen.  i wear my hair in pigtails every chance i get. 

this blog is private, i am not sharing it with family and friends, just you strangers. it's a chance for me to be honest without reprecussion. if you are a member of my family or an uninvited friend and find it, shame on you for snooping and you shouldn't have made me so self-conscious that i can't share this stuff with you in person.
