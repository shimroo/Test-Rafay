delusions and illusions





they're a guy in my small town who proudly wanders around wearing a half-white wig, a robe with symbols all over it, and carrying a staff. i think he's pretending to be a wizard.  this isn't for halloween, this is all year round.have a good look at these two weirdos.when someone says "i identify as..." i hear the words "i'm pretending to be..."they're, nuts, right? like my local wizard, they're crazy people, pretending to be something they're not.right?are they actually crazy, or is something else going on here?neither one of these two would be where they are right now without the image they are projecting.  and this has to be the most prestigious job either has ever had in their lives.the above image, and many other examples from bruce jenner to desmond is amazing have been bothering me for a while.  i used to think, why don't people call this foolishness out?  why do they allow this, and in the case of these two, why is the us federal government putting people like this in charge of anything? i mean, look at what they've done just being in charge of their own lives.i'll get back to these two guys later.  first though, i want you to look at the next two pictures.  forget everything you know about the people in these pictures, just look at the images projected:two happy, successful families, right?  everyone smiling, all together, dressed well, healthy.those are the images projected.  nobody is perfect of course, and no family is without its black sheep, but if you didn't know anything about any of the people involved you'd think these were just two happy families.the difference is that one group actually is a happy family, and the other group is just projecting the illusion of same.back to the weirdos up top. the image they are actually showing is that of a couple of crazy people, but they're not crazy.  you read that right. assistant health secretary rachel levine and deputy assistant nuclear energy secretary sam brinton are not acting like this because they're crazy.  they're not delusional.instead, they're illusional. like my hometown wizard, they are projecting an image to the world.  unlike the wizard though, they're insisting that you accept the image as reality.and if people do accept it, that's real power.back to the bidens and the trumps.  the trump family has its turmoils of course, but by any standard they're well-adjusted people and highly successful, all of them.  the biden family on the other hand reads like a bad soap opera.  ashley biden in her diary talked about showering with her dad, and hunter biden's laptop is full of some really disturbing images of hunter with children, besides all of the financial shenanigans. and of course there's a couple of people missing from the biden portrait: hunter's daughter and the stripper baby momma.but as long as the fbi can suppress the diary and the laptop, and as long as the 99% democrat media plays ball, they can keep that swept under the rug, out of sight, where they can't destroy the illusion.  because the reality would destroy the illusion.and the illusion is all they have.  the illusion that in a close election in wisconsin 4800 ballots in a row would only have votes for a single candidate (odds: 10 to the power of 1594 to 1).  the illusion that biden actually won the election.  the illusion that a bunch of unarmed people milling around the capitol on january 6th was an insurrection, and the illusion that violent riots by the left and the chaz autonomous zone weren't insurrection.they're projecting an image, and demanding you accept it as reality.  and if you do, that's real power for them.  they're not delusional.  they know the truth.  but they prefer and insist that you accept the illusion.because for now, the illusion gives them power.the problem with illusions of course is that they're not real.  no amount of people accepting the illusion can make it become real.  in the end, reality itself is real, and nothing else is.but it's what they've got, and it gives them power for now.  and the longer it goes, the more firmly entrenched in power they become, the harder they have to push the illusion.  because, if people stop accepting the illusion they lose power.the us needs a healthy dose of reality in the november election.

enough lies





 enough.trump won the election. the whole world saw it happen in real time.  the supreme court - 7 out of 9 anyhow - were in violation of their oaths to uphold the constitution, and are cowards.the election was stolen by massive, blatant fraud.  there was no single source; it was across the country and in many different ways.  one of the biggest was the mail-in ballots, necessitated by the paranoid, hysterical reaction to covid, driven chiefly by the american legacy media.  those "mail-in" ballots included: ballots that had never been creased, as would happen if they had been put in an envelope and mailed; thousands of identical ballots only marked for biden and nothing down-ticket - and by identical i mean identical, down to a missing patch of black in the exact same spot on every ballot; ballots that had no chain of custody at all, just the honor of mark zuckerberg; and ballots received from the deceased.stolen elections have consequences. look at the price of gas.  look at the keystone pipeline killed, while the russian's pipeline to europe is dandy.  that's a consequence of fraudulently installing a dementia patient as president, who is now begging opec to ramp up production rather than get out of the way of a pipeline already under construction from alberta.stolen elections have consequences. look at afghanistan.  the us just up and left, poof gone.  they didn't bother to help the people who had helped them as interpreters and information sources, oh no.  those people are on their own now that the taliban are back in charge.  they're so desperate to get out of there that they're swarming the runways at kabul, piling on 800 at a time in cargo planes, and even hanging on to the outsides of the planes, only to fall to their deaths when their grips inevitably give way.enough lies!men are not women.  women are not men.  bruce jenner is a mentally disturbed man, not a woman named caitlyn.  laurel hubbard ought to be ashamed of himself.when gay men in san francisco put out a video of them singing about coming for your children, they're not mocking the squares, they mean it.  these people are insane, and pandering to their insane ideas like gay marriage is like mixing poison with food and calling the result edible.enough lies!joe biden isn't the problem.  he barely knows what day it is.  he proudly announces to the press that his butt has been wiped as he strolls to the waiting helicopter.  that wasn't a joke or hyperbole, it happened. he isn't in charge of his own faculties, much less the country, and hasn't been since before the campaign even started.  even the nomination process was a sham, and even then kamala harris didn't get a single delegate!  there is no single person in charge, that much is apparent.  there is a committee, or competing factions within the democrat party, or a bit of both.  the leadership looks incoherent, because it is.white supremacy isn't the problem in the united states.  marxist anti-americanism is the problem, and it uses every tool at its disposal to drive americans apart.  race, class, sex, every crack has a wedge and they're pounding on it.  what drove people to vote for trump wasn't racism, it was patriotism.  what happened on january 6th wasn't a riot or an insurrection, it was a protest by people who saw that their vote didn't count, that the counting was a fraud.  there were 800 thousand people there.  if it was a riot, not one brick would have been left standing atop another.  if it was an insurrection, at least one person would have arrived armed with a gun. if it was a riot or insurrection, the capitol police wouldn't have been inviting people in or taking selfies with them.  the one person killed was an unarmed protestor, a veteran, shot by a capitol police officer.  she was surrounded by police in swat gear, and if she was an actual threat could have been subdued by those men.  instead the shot that killed her might have missed and hit one of them instead.the people arrested on the 6th have been held in solitary confinement without trial.remember last year?  remember when black lives matter and antifa caused over 2 billion dollars in damage to businesses?  remember when they burned down the church across the street from the white house?  remember more than 30 people killed in the riots?  none of those people were even charged!remember antifa declaring their own country, the capitol hill autonomous zone?  that's sedition, for those unclear on the definition.  no jail for them.does anyone think that a two-tier justice system based on politics is really a good idea?  democrats always innocent, until they aren't useful anymore - right, harvey weinstein? - republicans always guilty, and if they aren't we'll fake the evidence?  that's a recipe for civil war.and that leads me to think that the group in charge of america wants another american civil war.they need america out of the way and preoccupied for a while.enough lies.these covid vaccines are unnecessary.  there are already well-tested, safe drugs used for other ailments - such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, vitamin d, and zinc - that can cure and perhaps even prevent covid.  south korea published a study on google docs on march 13, 2020, stating as much, and they've had the lowest covid death rate in the world.  these vaccines they're trying to force everyone to get?  if everyone gets them, then there is no control group to tell whether they are effective or not.  we have no idea what the long term side effects will be, because a long term hasn't passed yet.  for the majority of people, these unknown risks from the vaccine are far greater than the known risks of the virus.  the masks and social distancing and lockdowns only hurt the economy of every jurisdiction that imposed them.enough lies.the whole trump/russia thing was cooked up because hillary needed an excuse as to why she lost an election rigged in her favor.  all the pollsters were paid to show she had a 97%+ chance of winning. all the people who mattered said she would win, nudge wink.  they tried to blame comey (who let her off the hook instead of charging her with her 30 thousand plus felonies), then they tried to blame wikileaks, and finally settled on russia.  and the fbi and justice department knew right from the start that the entire steele dossier was a fabrication, yet pursued it for three years and spent 40 million dollars, and couldn't find a single law broken by trump.  they had to make up evidence to get a fisa warrant on carter page. result?  a knuckle slap for one guy, and durham will deliver his report as soon as godot gets here.enough lies.  the lies get built on top of lies on top of lies, ever more absurd.  they have to in order to keep the con going.  that, and dalrymple's observation that propaganda is designed to break the will of people, to get them to accept and better yet repeat lies, because emasculated liars are easy to control.the truth will come out, and people will see it, even if they are forced to see it as the german people were forced to see the concentration camps at the end of ww2. the truth has the advantage of being true.  it's hard for a liar to keep a story straight, because it is a fiction.  truth doesn't have that problem.enough lies.  the maricopa county audit results will be released soon, and we all know they will show trump actually won arizona.  there's already audits in georgia and pennsylvania.  it might not overturn the result of the 2020 debacle, but it should be a death blow to the democrat party.  if not, it will be a death blow to freedom for everyone in the world.

are we in an endgame?





 i've read enough history to see what's about to happen in the united states if this fraud stands.i've also seen donald trump be a couple of moves ahead of these dullards occupying seats once held by far better men, for years, running rings around them.  he has multiple trump cards, all the time.  he may yet have another trump card.i am reminded of the chinese curse: "may you live in interesting times".  what i have witnessed over the last year has been absolutely transparent to me all along.  covid, murder hornets ffs, the anti-police riots in cities all over the us and even spreading into england and canada.  and then the travesty in november, which has every mathematician and accountant in the world up in arms.we all know the next ten days are going to be some of the most dangerous of our lives.  everything is up in the air.  the behavior of the left has gone from irritating to annoying to downright totalitarian.  i don't know how long i'll be able to speak.  i've been censored multiple times on facebook; i'm closing my fb account as i write this, just downloading my photos. eff'em.it's like the left in the usa has decided this is it, they're all in.  they're going to destroy the usa.  that's the goal.  after that, it's a one-world communist government.  there will be no escape, unless elon musk manages to pull off a miracle, and he may not have enough time.democracy is done.  oh, they may allow the population the illusion that they get to decide anything, but it no longer matters how the population votes.  they heeded stalin's advice, and now there will never be another fair election.  they can just stuff the ballot boxes.  and that's not just in the usa.  that's everywhere in the world.  no incumbent need ever worry about retaining their seat, no matter what the public thinks of them.  now the politicians serve different masters; the constituents are irrelevant.the fat lady is warming up her pipes, but she hasn't started singing yet.  if nothing happens between now and the inauguration and the fraud stands, then god help us all.  at best - at best - it would be a civil war in the usa.  that's the best-case scenario.  the scenarios get worse from there: either a world war or the entire population of the world enslaved (except for a new aristocracy, of course).and if trump does have a trump card?  the best case scenario is slightly better, but it could slide into civil war anyway.  the best case scenario if he's got a trump card is that there would be some public trials of a whole bunch of senior officials - of both parties.and yeah, that could lead to civil war too.  but it's probably the only way to avoid it at this point.  the soap box is gone, the ballot box is gone, the jury box may be gone - when all peaceable means of resolving political conflict are exhausted, only one box remains.of course, i don't have some sort of special powers to see what's coming.  i've studied history, lots of it, and certain parallels are hard to ignore. but i'm not the only one who can see what's coming - that's why ammunition sales were through the roof in 2020.  while the left was burning down their own cities this summer, the right was arming itself and spending time practicing at the gun range.this is one thing that makes the worst-case scenario anything but inevitable.  americans are used to freedom, but not many have had to experience life without it or had to fight to keep it.  but they will, and they will.

humanity needs the frontier





 130 years ago, my great-great grandfather hauled himself and his young family from prussia to western canada.  my great-grandfather was three years old at the time.there were no trees here suitable for building houses - nothing one could make planks with, just willow and the like in the river valleys and coulees. so, for three years they lived in a sod house.  the floor was dirt, the walls and roof were sod.  for three canadian winters.  there was a railroad but no roads.there was no help out here, except for the neighbors, who all lived miles apart.  all of them immigrants, they often didn't even speak each other's languages.  there were police back then, north west mounted police, but they were only a handful of men responsible for an area the size of europe.  and forget about telephones; fifteen years later when alberta became a province, the premier had a telephone.  his telephone number was 5.why?  why did they leave europe in 1890, leaving behind roads and houses and established farms and civilization to sail across the atlantic and then take a train out to the middle of nowhere, and then walk for miles to their land?freedom.back in prussia, it was pretty easy to see which way the wind was blowing.  much like today. both my gggpaw and his brother had heard about the free land they were giving away in canada, if you would only make improvements to the land.  the government of canada needed people and infrastructure.(there was a problem for gggpaw, though.  he had two sons and a daughter.  his brother had three daughters.  at the time, if someone chose to emigrate from prussia and they had young sons, then an exit tax on each boy was applied.  it amounted to a small fortune, because each boy was a potential future soldier for the army.  so, the legend goes, there was a poker game and the three nieces' birth certificates became part of the pot, and great-great-grandpaw cheated and took the pot, dressed the boys up as girls (2 and 3 years old), and passed them off as girls until they got to canada.  great grandpaw had a hell of a time proving he was entitled to a pension when he was 75.  but i digress.)it was worth it, coming halfway around the world to one of the harshest climates in the world, miles and miles away from neighbors and civilization and government.by the time he died in 1935 at the age of 75, my great-great-grandfather helped turn what was once a sea of grass into houses and farms and roads and cars and a growing city of edmonton.  he built the mill after which the millwoods area of edmonton is named, and that area is itself was built in the 1970s on his son's - my great-grandfather's - farm.if you knew where to look, it was still possible to see where the original sod house had been up until the 1990s, when that was obliterated by the need to widen a road. there are still some buildings standing and in use today that were built by my great-great-grandfather, including a blacksmith shop that has been used by auto mechanics for decades, and a bank that has been in use continuously since he built it.humanity needs a place like edmonton was 130 years ago.  a place for people to build anew. a place for people like my great-great-grandfather.  if you took the same man, and transported him in a time machine from 1920 to today, and showed him what had changed, he would marvel at first at the wonders of the future.but then he'd have started reading the newspapers and the internet and watched the news. and he would have realized that the place he had fled in 1890 had followed his descendants here in 2020..and, if elon musk succeeds in getting people to mars, i'll be fleeing earth the same way great-great-grandpaw fled prussia circa 1890.  i won't be living in a sod house, but that's a technicality: sod contains grass.  i'll still be living under the dirt, in a can, breathing canned and recycled air.  but i'll be free.and if i and others like me succeed on mars, the same lumbering beast that crept from prussia to canada will follow humanity to mars and beyond - except right on the edge.  that frontier will be the only place the karens won't be.

popping a zit





i used to joke that i didn't know what disturbed me more: that there is a video on youtube entitled world's biggest zit, or that it has more than five million views.

i'll just pause right here, because we all know what's going to happen in the next few seconds.

ok, welcome back.  well, that was educational, wasn't it? at least you've been spared the smell.

ya gotta wonder, how does it ever get that bad?  how does someone let something like that just fester and grow and surely it must hurt after a while?  but, people are wishful thinkers - "oh maybe it'll just go away on its own, no big deal... ok any time now it'll just pop on its own or something... " and it gets worse and worse and worse, until they just can't stand it anymore, and voila les videos.

but really, it's easy to understand how it happens.  gradually.  something like that doesn't grow overnight, or a couple of weeks.  sometimes it takes months or even years.

a common political analogy is the boiled frog.  if you put a frog into really hot water, he jumps out.  but, if you put him in the water and slowly turn up the heat, he gets used to it and doesn't react, and eventually it's too late for the frog.

that analogy explains why a dollar today buys half of what a dollar bought twenty years ago.  it explains how marxists took over the universities (and as per iowahawk, gutted them, skinned them, then wore them as a skin suit while demanding respect).  you also see it in the whole woke idiocy.

the boiling frog analogy has one glaring limitation.  it describes a gradual progression to some undesirable end state, and that's where it stops.  once the frog boils and the undesirable end state reached, that's where the analogy stops.

but people as a whole are not a single frog, and while individual people die society as a whole does not, at least not yet. there is no "end state" for the system that is society, only periods of apparent stability.

once society reaches some undesirable state, it doesn't just sit there.  it might let the situation fester and grow, until it is too painful and must be dealt with.  and when it does finally deal with that problem, the initial results aren't pretty.  and the more deep-rooted the problem, the longer it has built up under the surface, the more rancid it has become, and the more pressure that builds up, the more painful the initial rupture will be and the effluent all the more vile and nauseating.

in a way, the last century has been a boiling frog, and the last four years more like popping a zit.  a lot of zits.  the riots are a part of it, too, and though most of the participants are larping idiots, they are unwittingly breaking the skin and extruding what the universities have become.  the legacy media, and in particular the white house press hacks, are getting their little heads popped regularly.  and a whole lot of institutions from the cdc to the who to the fda down to local mayors are exposing themselves as incompetent, to be as charitable as possible.

it's happening now, and it has happened in the past.  sudden, history changing events happen because a situation builds up over a long time until it becomes intolerable, and then the change is very sudden and a lot of ugliness is exposed.

expect a lot more drainage before healing begins.

same as it ever was





so, i haven't blogged at all since the 2016 us presidential election.  and, nothing has changed.

well, that isn't entirely true.  trump has been unique in my experience: a politician who does in office exactly what he promised on the campaign trail.  and because he actually had to produce results in the real world for decades before becoming a politician, he has been running rings around the "professional" politicians. 

but what i wrote in my last post two years ago, well, that hasn't changed at all.  the vast majority of reporters and entertainers are still extremely political, and all on one side.  open the new york times or watch cnn, if you've got some ipecac handy.  every story about trump is negative.  they'll inject negative comments about trump in stories that have nothing to do with him.  day after day, pounding on trump and the people who voted for him.

but events have a way of disrupting the narrative.  it's like the old joke about going broke.  hey journalists, how did you lose all credibility with the public? "slowly, then all at once."

there is a reason that advertising revenue is way down across the board for these major news organizations: they've been insulting and lying to over half their potential audience, and the audience has thus left them behind.  and it's finally hitting the bottom line, resulting in massive layoffs at buzzfeed and huffington post and mcclatchy and other "news" sites.

and they still haven't learned their lesson.  if you're going to be a news site, then just tell us the news.  leave your personal opinions out of it.  be professional.

either do that, or learn to code.

why should we care what you have to say?





hello, cnn.  hi, new york times, take a seat, oprah, there's one for you right next to michael moore and leo dicaprio. all the rest of you in the legacy media, there's some folding chairs in the back, go ahead, make yourselves comfortable.  sorry, amy schumer, either stand or just sit on the floor.

ok, looks like everyone's here, may as well get this started.  it's been a week since trump won.  look, admit it, it's over, he won.  and he has a pen and a phone, and all the demonstrations in the streets are not going to change the fact that he is going to be the president in january.  it's done.

look, amy, this is a closed meeting, not a rally.  put the sign down and stop chanting.  there's no cameras here.  and he is your president.

anyhow, that's not why i called you all here today.  i wanted to talk to you about something more important.

have you noticed the ratings are down?  not just cnn and abc and cbs and nbc either.  print circulation is down across the board.  times, how much is your advertising revenue down this year?  and not just the legacy media either.  hollywood, have you noticed that bollywood is breathing down your necks?  what are domestic ticket sales looking like, year over year?

this year, the whole lot of you went all-in for hillary clinton.  sure, some of you paid some lip service to feeling the bern, but we all knew the fix was in after what happened to hillary in 2008.  it was her turn and she was a woman and republicans are stupid and evil to stand in the way of progress amirite?

pay attention, leo, this is important.  you all pulled as hard as you could for hillary, didn't you?  didn't you pass her debate questions in the primaries and stab bernie in the back?  didn't you hush up all mention of her crimes and paint the fbi as incompetent meddlers?  didn't you skew your polling samples as far to the democrat side as you could get away with?  didn't you make pariahs out of anyone who suggested trump might have a chance?

you all tried your very best and used all the influence you had, didn't you?

and what happened?  she lost.

stop blubbering, amy.  can you get over the fact that she lost long enough to connect those sentences together in your head?  you tried everything you had and used all the pull you could and the american people didn't buy it.  at least, enough of them didn't buy it they either stayed home or voted for trump.

so what does that tell you about your actual influence over elections, ap?  still think you guys are worth 15 points at the polls?  here's a scary thought - what if you are worth 15 points and you still lost?

are you even worth those 15 points at the polls anymore?  70 million people read matt drudge every day, what's your audience cbs news?

julian assange by himself now has more credibility than all of you put together.  that's an important word, credibility.  it's the only thing a news organization really has to sell.  when the national enquirer has a better long-term track record in their political reporting than you do, what does that say about your credibility?

once your credibility is gone, what do you have left to sell?  how are you different from the weekly world news?  and why should anyone pay attention to what you have to say now?
