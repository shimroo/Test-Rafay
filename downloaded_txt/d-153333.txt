     good       based on 220 reviews                       jennifer m  september 17, 2024.   verified don’t get bamboozled into the 1960s
i chose the nassau inn for its beachfront location and the allure of "amazing beach views." while the location was undeniably convenient, the room itself was a letdown. despite the staff's assurances of a recent renovation, the bathroom featured tile that looked straight out of the 1960s, which immediately gave the space an outdated and worn feel. it was weird because some things looked new, then others like the furniture were well dated and really didn’t flow. overall, just weird vibes. while the hotel does have a prime spot by the beach, the room i was given was far from the modern, comfortable beach retreat i had envisioned. adding to the surprise was the discovery that some of the other units were much more modern and in line with 21st-century standards. it turns out that these units are privately owned, which explains the inconsistency in quality. this makes it even more puzzling why the nassau inn markets itself as a hotel when there's such a stark difference between the rooms. if you're planning a stay, be sure to ask for photos of the exact unit you'll be renting. i see now that they are available on their website, so you can see exactly what you are getting. the condition of the unit can vary greatly, and you don't want to end up with a room that feels like a time capsule from several decades ago. i’ll share some photos i found for example. despite its prime location, the nassau inn didn't quite live up to expectations. i won’t be back, there’s far better places to stay for a better price.             guido52530  august 4, 2024.   verified worst travel experience ever
my wife and i have stayed here many times but this year was definitely our last. the nassau seems to have increased their rates but cut back on service. when we go on vacation we don’t expect to become maids. believe it or not, daily maid service no longer exists. we had to put out our trash for pickup. they never dropped off clean trash bags to replace the ones we put out. i had to go to the lobby to request new ones. my wife was making the bed and straightening out the room daily. i would put out the towels daily as suggested but they never dropped off clean ones. i had to go down to the lobby every day to pick up clean ones. in addition, no one ever came in to sweep up, clean the tub, etc. seems unsanitary. no one ever offered a reduction for putting us out. the biggest bummer was the fact that they had the audacity to leave an envelope in the room to “tip the maid”. my feeling is that they should have put something in the envelope for us. if it wasn’t so serious it would be funny and when i told friends about it “unbelievable”.             voyager06041281916  july 29, 2024.   verified not worth the money.
we had to wait almost an hour after check in for our room to be ready along with 6 other families. when we arrived in our room, the mattress protector was dirty and had someone else’s hair on it. after inspecting the bed, the sheets were dirty and full of sand so they did not change the bed sheets obviously. the floor were extremely dirty as if they didn’t mop which i think should bear minimum for the price you pay. the wifi i not good either. even after connecting i didn’t have any service at all. as far as the parking spots go, you can nearly get out of your car cause that are so close together and they only give 1 spot per room so the other guest had to street park. i have never written a review and i don’t really have high expectations but i really feel at $350 a night the service and amenities should be upgraded.             bryce s  july 26, 2024.   verified nassau inn
nassau inn was amazing, location was on point, staff was wonderful, room was cleaned & supplies were always available. hope the slide to the pool comes back and activities for the kids would be great too. definitely returning!… big thank you to the house keeper who helped my famuky stay another night             seaside27033293389  july 10, 2024.   verified amazing views
amazing views of ocean! great location and pool, close to boardwalk shops and stone's throw from the beach. well appointed rooms and great amenities. pool is refreshing and great on a hot summer day. would return if staying in wildwood. cape may is also a close drive from here.             ron c  july 1, 2024.   verified another great stay at nassau
another great stay at #309 in the nassau inn. the whole facility is very well maintained and the pool and staff are always great. perfect cost/location/ facility combination. proximity to the beach, the quite end of the boards is perfect. easy walk to saturday night concerts in centennial park and you can see friday night fireworks from the deck.             cindy w  june 13, 2024.   verified not what we expected
the staff was extremely nice, but had every excuse for why the pool wasn’t open. even though we paid a premium dollar to stay here. we figured it was worth it since it’s beachfront. the marketing all advertises a heated salt water pool. so we were excited. but the pool never opened. there were construction workers in and out of rooms. none of the patio furniture or outside setups were open or very welcoming. it’s sad because it seemed like a nice place and reviews from the past were good. manager said there are new owners who are renovating, which is nice but maybe better when you’re closed? overall we expected better. it seemed like it would be a nice place from the reviews, but we’re staying across the street for half the price next year.             suzanne s  june 12, 2024.   verified the best place to stay for 52 years!!! fabulous memories!
my family has been coming here since 1972. it is the best place around. the nassau is always clean, the staff is always helpful and the other renters are always friendly. it’s close to the boardwalk for fun rides, arcades, water parks and right on the beach, yet far away enough for a quiet evening of sitting on the deck eating ice cream and playing games. we highly recommend the nassau inn.             kyle l  june 9, 2024.   verified excellent hotel with great airbnb hosts and hotel staff, highly recommend. affordable, accommodating and comfortable.
robyn was fantastic as my airbnb host; i highly recommend her and her husband as hosts, i stayed in unit 401. also, the hotel staff was also fantastic. they're very friendly and accommodating. she is very sweet and helpful, and the room was spotless and as described. she also will respond quickly to your messages, plus give you tips and recommendations if you're new to the area. the hotel is a primal location, close to the boardwalk, and near the beach and nearby restaurants, and it's affordable. it comes with 2 hd tvs with cable, for room entertainment, the a/c unit works great, and it's spacious, too. there's 2 chairs on the deck, for people watching, and to enjoy the weather and the ocean view. the check-in and check-out processes were fast and easy. on the 3rd floor, there's also a washer and dryer unit and an ice machine. would definitely do it again. 5/5 experience.             freezes w  may 28, 2024.   verified not the same nassau we loved
overall, my stay was okay, but several things stood out. they no longer offer daily maid service, so trash piled up, towels were dirty, and no one came by to even ask about replacements. we didn't have anywhere to put the trash. we also heard there are new owners, so the whole family-friendly nassau seems to have been replaced with a corporation that wants to charge more but offer less. we plan to return later in the summer but are considering cancelling to rebook somewhere else.                  excellent       based on 318 reviews                       heidi starr  september 9, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. raymond was a wonderful host! rm 403 was beautifully updated, loved the shower, especially!
we were greeted warmly and enthusiastically by the management team. parking was a bit tight, but a non issue; we appreciated that it was included in the room price.
having a balcony could have been nice, but with folks smoking outside and passing by it was not private or something we took advantage of :(
we fell in love with wildwood crest! so charming, clean and friendly             seif juban  september 8, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. very confused by the ratings in these areas. this place is a little on the pricey side for really being just a motel. the proximity to the beach is very nice but overall i will never return.  the parking is extremely tight. i am sure they are trying to fit as many cars as possible but it’s extremely annoying.  the place is pretty outdated especially the bathrooms. the towels also did not appear clean. the doors are paper thin. however,the staff is very nice. if its helps, i can’t imagine this place is different than any other motels in the area. also wifi is useless.             shane becker  september 8, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. we really loved the location of this inn right beside the beach, and the service was excellent, especially since our young kids caused a few unintentional issues along the way. the pool was heated and felt really nice even on 60-70 degree breezy days. the only thing i would change about this inn is the beds. we stayed in room 403 with 2 double beds, and maybe i'm older and feel the aches and pains more, but the beds were hard and bouncy. so every time my husband moved, i bounced around too and my back hurt the next day too. but, if beds aren't an issue, the inn is amazing!             alexandra tarasov  september 3, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. overall nice experience. perfect quiet location. rooms are dated (we got "lucky" to have clumps of dust hanging on the curtains and plywood board on one of the beds) but we stayed for the beach and not for the hotel itself so it didn't really bother us.
make sure you choose ocean view if you want private balcony otherwise your "premium room with balcony" will be room with balcony that you'd share with everyone (expedia description wasn't clear).
free parking is a plus as well as the heated pool (was useful on chilly day with strong wind where sand on the beach just sandblasts you). nice picnic area with ocean view.
overall nice but next time we'll go elsewhere.             lisa dulac  september 2, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. great location to the beach .pool was nice and clean staff is friendly and prompt with any issues had a lamp that was broken fixed in 5 minutes. condo was clean, mattress need upgrades and were full size not queen. ac. seems to mot keep room cool and shuts off.  room 303             ilene sloan  august 30, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. such a great place to stay!
on the beach, very clean, rooms are very nicely updated, too.
pool is super clean, bbq's for anyone to use.
definitely would go back!             lani roskes  august 23, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. our stay in room 403 was great! it was like staying in a hotel for a better rate. instructions from the host were clear, he was responsive to questions and the room was exactly as pictured. would definitely stay here again!             don pray  august 17, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. great visit to wildwood crest at the nassau inn for a 3 night stay.  rooms are all condos, have been updated and  managed by front desk. super convenient to the beach (across the street) and pool is excellent.  parking space for all cars but spaces are narrow.  staff at ni is top drawer and if we had things to be addressed in the room, the handyman was there within 5 minutes.  we were in rooms 308 and 210, both d models with a large living room with full kitchen and a separate br with 2 full size beds.  maid service daily.  view of the ocean from our room.  all rooms have a view of the ocean.             jocelyn lopez  august 13, 2024.   trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. place and location was nice. it was right by the beach so it was a quick walk. my only complaint is that the ac in the room barely worked, so it was very hot and i don’t know his name, but the older guy at the check in desk was very rude and rushy.

☺ good location fir the boardwalk.

☹ air conditioner in the bedroom was very noisy. luckily the nights were cool and we didn’t need it to sleep, or else we would have requested a room change. i reported to the manager on checkout. smokers on the balcony made it impossible to stay outside.             mary  september 7, 2024.   10verified terrific wish we stayed longer!
☺ we were so pleased with our stay at the nassau inn   the staff was very friendly and nice. the rooms was beautiful. i would only recommend one thing. i’m our room there was a moldy smell in the bedroom. please take up the carpet in the bedroom. then  be an above 10!! we’re definitely coming back next year!! the pool was spotless the whole hotel was! thank you so much!!

☹ just pick up the carpeting in the bedroom. it has a very stale and moldy smell. other than that your hotel is spotless! new and beautiful.             kristen  september 6, 2024.   10verified exceptional
