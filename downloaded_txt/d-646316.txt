bridging cape cod and golfgrowing up in southeastern massachusetts, we were lucky enough to go to cape cod every summer.  for most of those years, playing golf on the cape meant mini golf!  as we’ve gotten older, we still love mini golf, but we also have this insatiable love for real golf.  we are certainly not pros - one of us is a single-digit handicap, while the other can most often be found looking for his ball in the woods. but we are fans of the game, we play as much as we can, and especially love to explore new golf courses. when our parents moved to cape cod full-time in 2017, we started on a quest to play a new course whenever we visited throughout the summer. (our yearly father’s day tradition is to play a cape course with our dad.) at the end of nearly every round, we found ourselves really impressed with the courses. the sandy, pine-lined courses with ocean breezes posed particularly challenging and usually really interesting tests.however, when we looked to find more courses, we found that there was a lack of good information on the internet about the public options beyond what you can get from the courses themselves.  there seemed like a need for some objective reviews of courses from some average golfers. thus, capecodgolfguys.com was born!thanks for joining us on our journey to play all of the golf courses on cape cod. we aim to provide accurate, objective, and sometimes humorous insight (view our ratings methodology) into what you should expect to find at these courses. we hope these reviews will help you find your next course to play when you next visit the cape.
