back in the early 1950s, a small group of st. louis couples were looking for an out-of-the-way place to get together and enjoy the warm sun and fresh air on their skin. they found a 40-acre piece of land for sale in franklin county and, on weekends, proceeded to carve out campsites and a common area on the flat hilltop.74 years later, the club has over 200 members, and we welcome hundreds of visitors annually.to learn more about the club, please visit our about us page.for our rates/fees, rules, or more information about being nude for the first time, please visit our first visit page.once you’ve checked this off your bucket list, you’ll probably want to come back…
