chairman's expectations




the current strategic environment requires that our force continue to advance and adapt to the changing character of war. we must always be prepared to fight and win our nation's next war. i am confident in our joint force. our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, guardians, and civilian teammates form the most capable fighting force in the world.

in my message to the joint force on 2 october 2023, i articulated my expectations for the joint force:

honing our warfighting skill has primacy in all we do
  
modernize and aggressively lead with new concepts and approaches
  
trust is the foundation of our profession








chairman's leadership library











chairman's focus on global integration



“the joint chiefs of staff, in view of their global responsibilities and their perspective with respect to the worldwide strategic situation, are in a better position than any single theater commander to assess the risk of general war. moreover, the joint chiefs of staff are best able to judge our own military resources with which to meet that risk.” chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen. omar n. bradley in 1951 to the senate foreign relations committee
