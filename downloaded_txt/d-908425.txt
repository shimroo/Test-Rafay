the gold standard of fire accreditation
for agencies offering fire service certification, pro board accreditation is the gold standard of third party assessment and an affirmation that your testing process is fair, valid and reliable.
as a candidate, certification from a pro board accredited agency demonstrates that you were tested by a process that went through the scrutiny of accreditation and that your certification, from an accredited agency, has the value of the pro board seal of approval.
