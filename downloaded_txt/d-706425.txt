mood: cheerfuli'm so sick of the abused crap.  either it's an excuse for bad behavior or it's an excuse to hate.  i was passed around to my birth family starting at age "i remember" as a little sex toy, and you know what?i don't care.  i don't care to file charges, i don't care to make their lives a living hell, even though they destroyed me, my little sisters and my older sister and brothers life.  i don't care!here's why:  i got adopted by two individuals who taught me that love can in fact conquer all.  i was adopted and loved through every thing i could do to push them away.  i was loved even after they knew my "shameful secret"  i could use the abused card, but you know what?  it's an excuse!!!  i could bitch and bemoan all of the injustices that happen in the world, or i can actually try and make a difference.  i could say " woe is me" or i could affect change.when all you do is focus on the negative, then you never see the positive.  and there is so much great about us, the world, nature and things yet discovered, that i refuse to give in to the dark side of " oh, woe is me"man up and put your big girl panties on, and get to things that really matter.  you and me.  you, me and the rest of the world.  try to be a decent human being, and hope that you can be forgiven for your failings at times.people who are guilty should always pay, in one way or another, but lets spend less time worrying about them, and spend more time worrying about yourself, ourselves...me.

music: anything garth brooksiei sincerely hope that mr. white house will do what's best for this country.  i do.with that being said, i hope everyone is ok with what's going on in d.c. right now.i hope everyone is ok with a bill that will send kids to camps where they must wear a govm't uniform for at least a year.  no, truly, there won't be any indoctrination.i hope everyone is ok with bailing out corporations that exist, in, but also out of the u.s. but not the bailing out of, at one time, the largest employer in u.s.( g.m. motor corp., i.e. small towns across america)i hope everyone is ok with the cost of electricity going up ( cap-n-trade mutha-fuggahs!).  i hope the fucking great white hype was fucking worth this country turning into a fascist state.you want real change?  it doesn't start in the white house, it starts with your elected officials.  and these are the people let the b.s. slide through.  even through the bush era...they are the ones who allowed shit to happen.  that is all.
