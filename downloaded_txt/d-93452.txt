testimonial 



what our client say? 








i bought a ceo package from the embroidery warehouse in january, i received crash course from our technician michael. it took me a couple of day to learn but now i feel like an expert. thanks mike !




 

thanks john and teresa!













i don´t have a butterfly but i am a technician for many brands, including chinese ones. i definitely recommend the butterfly to my clients over any other brand. this is a quality built machine.
