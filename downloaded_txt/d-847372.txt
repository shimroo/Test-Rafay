kite
kiteboarding on the central coast is diverse and oh so fun! little waves in shallow water to deep waters and barrels. twin tips, surfboards and foils!! come learn on our beaches or ride with us.










fly
we are blessed with the most incredible area to paraglide.  from enjoying the ridge along shell beach, watching the surf at montana de oro, and enjoying the coast in cayucos and beyond we have a diverse set of sights to behold.  see our world in a way that few can, book a lesson, tandem flight, or contact a local to join in and fly!










whale watching
morro bay is one of the most incredible places to see whales and wildlife year round.  book your adventure in with amazing local businesses and have fun!










sup & kayak
the central coast is a magical place to enjoy the ocean.  from a sup or kayak you can explore the caves and beauty of our area from another vantage point.
