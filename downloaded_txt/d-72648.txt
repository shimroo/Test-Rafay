psiquad 3-colorable

a4 paper
here's one of those solutions that's so mathematically perfect that i can't believe that i'm the one that found it. all rectangles are similar to the outer rectangle, which has area 200. theoretically, 50, 64, 72, 81, 98, 100, 121, 128, 144 can be added to get a similar rectangle with area 1058. i picked this set because there were lots of potential edge-matches, but i got forced to a solution where no edges matched. 



didrafters and taco chips
george sicherman: the below shapes are the 13 didrafters. arrange 8 of the 13 didrafters to make a solid rectangle. then make nine convex shapes. then add a few more pieces for the taco chips puzzles.

new tetrad
walter trump has found a new tetrad.



sparse rulers mostly solved ||||.......................|....|...|...|...|...|...|..|..|
i solved sparse rulers and it's all written up in my blog article hitting all the marks. sparse rulers allow the measuring of all distances up to length n. b. wichmann almost completely solved the problem in 1963. from wichmann's sparse ruler recipe, mn - rnd(√(3 n+9/4)) can be shown to usually be 0 or 1 (the excess). the length 58 ruler at the top is conjectured to be the longest sparse ruler with fewer marks than a wichmann construction, but no proof is known. adding a single mark to the end of wichmann's construction allows the building of excess-01 rulers for all lengths over 257992. my code found solutions for hundreds of difficult smaller lengths such as 1792, 5657 and 16617 to establish that excess-01 rulers always exist.



orchard problem
in a previous blog on the orchard problem i mention "if you do not like points at infinity, arrange 3 heptagons of 7 points to make a 4-configuration of 21 lines through 21 points." in the next paragraph i mention the record for 22 points. that record was beaten dec 2019. this new solution is the 21 point 4-configuration with an extra tree at the center. how could i have missed spotting that?

balanced magic square
if weights of the same amount are substituted for the numbers of each square, the balance point will be at the exact center of each square. the first is a magic square, the others are its 2nd, 3rd, and 4th power. 48 order-4 magic squares remain balanced under squaring, but this is the unique square to remain balanced with the 3rd and 4th power.



6-punch triangles
there are 24 ways to put spots on the corners/edges of an equilateral triangle, with 1-sided rotational symmetry. they fit nicely into a hexagon with matching. with 2-sided rotational symmetry, there are 20 ways -- can they make an icosahedron with edge matching?  bryce herdt:  "first, each vertex must be surrounded by either 0 or 5 corner holes, and there must be six of each vertex. there are four tiles with no corner holes; these must share the six no-hole vertices, and can do so in one of two ways.      note the four tiles have twelve corners total. by the pigeonhole principle, we can say that at least one vertex belongs to two or more triangles. but since each vertex has only five neighboring vertices, then whether or not the two triangles just mentioned share an edge, there must be two triangles that actually do share an edge. repeating this logic shows that three, then all four triangles with solid corners are connected in one tetriamond. this can't be the c shape, as that would make five faces with no corner holes, but the other two shapes are fine.      with that fiddly part out of the way, note that in either case, the four solid-corner tiles form a single cluster with six perimeter edges and six internal edges in three pairs. these four tiles have six holes among their edges, and an even number of these must be internal, leaving an even number (two or four) for the perimeter.      now consider the six triangles with one corner hole. call the edge opposite this hole the "base"; these bases ought to match up to the cluster's six edges. but three of these bases have holes, and three do not. there is no way to match the three holes to the cluster's even number of perimeter holes, qed."
