international art photography contemporary photography for collectors...desirable work by talented photographers often exists unseen. viewing portfolios for a national sunday colour supplement in the uk i saw a vast amount of beautiful work and realised most other people would never have the opportunity.  with this in mind i have developed this online gallery to bring some of this work to the attention of everyone who might like to see or buy it, and at the same time provide the photographers with an outlet for their work. the photography i have selected is produced by photographers who are dedicated to the craft that is the medium for their art.  the work is for those who simply enjoy photographic art or those potential collectors who would like the opportunity to own genuine contemporary photographic prints by international photographers, that might one day become family heirlooms.  the prints are available in small editions and for sale at affordable prices to reflect this category of the collectors market.   all prints are unframed unless otherwise stated. framing can be quoted for on request. a deposit will secure a print.   the balance must be paid in full by installment or otherwise before delivery.  orders will be despatched within a week to 10 days from the date of receipt or within 1 month when a new print is made. all orders will be despatched using standard packaging and courier services for shipping photographic prints. all costs for this service will be passed on to the buyer.  commissionsmany of the photographers are available for private commissions subject to availability.  please contact me with your requirements.consultancy servicea consultancy service is available subject to a fee.
