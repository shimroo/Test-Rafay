third-party  excavation is the leading cause of underground pipeline damage. this damage is  frequently caused by the excavator’s failure to request the location of utility  facilities within construction limits. state law requires anyone performing  excavation activity to call alabama 811 at least 48 hours before digging or  excavating. before you start any excavation activity on your property, contact  alabama 811 at 811 or 1 (800) 292-8525. member  underground facility operators will mark the location of their lines at no cost  to you.  
                      
examples of excavation activities include planting trees or  landscaping, building a fence, installing a swimming pool or any other major  construction project. be safe and remember to contact alabama 811 before  beginning any excavation activities on your property.
