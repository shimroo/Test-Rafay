	 how to listen to "the sulfur hour" and the best eye wash for dry eyes
	 
    


patrick mcgean, sulfur man, has been a guest on patrick timpone's one radio network show several times. the podcasts of these shows are at this link:
podcasts of patrick mcgean on oneradionetwork

thursdays, 9pm to 11pm eastern daylight time for live show:
the sulfur hour with doc stump and patrick mcgean
click on any of the avr 1 streams
                  or
the sulfur hour with doc stump and patrick mcgean on tune in
  
patrick mcgean used to prepare human eyes for corneal transplant.
"the sulfur, in the msm, crosses the cornea bearing oxygen. sulfur is an oxygen transporter and can rejuvenate the kidneys. the national institute of health has said, sulfur can protect and repair the damage from radiation exposure. in 1931, otto warburg discovered that cancer is a lack of intercellular oxygen."
sulfur testimonials from one radio network listeners  

for the best eye wash for dry eyes, patrick mcgean said to add 1 teaspoon of msm to 4 ounces of hot water. heating the water removes the chlorine. i added 1/2 a teaspoon of msm to 2 ounces of distilled water, and poured this into an empty spray bottle. i find the spray bottle more convenient than a dropper bottle or eye cup. i found this also makes a great sinus spray.

patrick mcgean has said very few msm products work. many compaies add anti-caking agents to their msm. patrick tests and distributes masses amounts of msm. i have tried several different brands of msm without any effect. i ordered patrick mcgean's pure organic sulfur from one radio network website and found it very effective. their order page is at this link:

	 how to listen to seeds of nutritional wisdom with dr. chris greene - my favorite show
	 
    


this is a complete update of my january 8, 2009, posting how to listen to wake up to nutrition with dr. chris greene - my favorite show, since everything has changed, including the name of the show. dr. chris greene, host of seeds of nutritional wisdom, still discusses the differences between synthetic and whole food supplements. he spends more time reading from the work of dr. royal lee and others. his explanations, of how the work of these pioneers in nutrition relates to many of the today's diseases, are so fascinating. i am grateful that standard process still makes available the great line of products that dr. royal lee developed. useful info on bone support, detoxification, digestion, immune health, and more. still my favorite show.

sunday, 2pm to 4pm eastern time

update:  dr. chris greene has decided to stop doing the show. because of some of the things he talked about, his sponsors did not want to be associated with the show. sad that, these days, it's not enough to be right and tell the truth.

	 dr. anthony heaney, m.d., ph.d.: "link between fructose and cancer proliferation shown in study."
	 
    


dr. ronald hoffman talked about a study done by researchers at ucla's jonsson cancer center in 2010. the entire posting can be viewed at pancreatic cancers use fructose, common in a western diet, to fuel growth.  dr. anthony heaney, m.d., ph.d., is an associate professor of medicine and neurosurgery, a jonsson cancer center researcher, and senior author of the study. sources of fructose in the western diet include cane sugar (sucrose) and high fructose corn syrup (hfcs), a corn-based sweetener that has been on the market since about 1970. hfcs accounts for more than 40 percent of the caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages, and it is the sole sweetener used in american soft drinks. dr. heaney said, "as in anti-smoking campaigns, a federal effort should be launched to reduce refined fructose intake. i think this paper has a lot of public health implications. hopefully, at the federal level there will be some effort to step back on the amount of hfcs in our diets. while this study was done in pancreatic cancer, these finding may not be unique to that cancer type."see my january 25, 2005, posting - how to listen to health talk with dr. ronald hoffman.

	 advice to get rid of chronic sinusitis from master herbalist david christopher
	 
    


master herbalist david christopher is the son of the famous master herbalist john r. christopher. dr. john r. christopher began formulating his world renowned herbal formulas in 1945. he developed a training program for herbalists and the school of natural healing in 1953.this advice was given on the "a healthier you" radio show by master herbalist david christopher and his co host and wife, fawn, who is also a master herbalist.important note: david christopher recommends taking 2 capsules 3 times a day, rather than the extract of the formulas. since the capsules are a lower strength than the extract, you can take them as long as you need or desire to strengthen and tonify. no need to worry about stopping for periods of time, which is necessary with extracts. dr. christopher's formulas need to be taken 20 to 30 minutes away from each other so they work effectively. if you take more than one formula at a time, you are changing the formula ratios. to save money, you can buy a pound of powder, a capsule machine, and empty capsules. dr. christopher's formulas are in size "0" vegetable capsules. you can choose a size"0" capsule machine and size "0" vegetable capsules when you order from dr. christopher's herb shop. one pound of powdered herbs will fill about 800 to 1200 capsules.take dr. john r. christopher's "three day cleansing program". if you become very hungry toward the evening, you may have one or two apples with the apple juice.  click the following link for a pdf with more info on the 3 day juice cleanse. a food based cleanse is the best type of cleanse.after your cleanse, follow dr. john r. christopher's "mucusless diet". tasty and healthy vegan or vegetarian recipes on dr. christopher's herbal legacy website.don't jog or walk on main streets (vehicle exhaust).don't take drugs for sinus problems or have surgery.dr. john christopher's glandular system formula will reduce the swelling of the congested and infected lymph glands in the neck, breast, groin, under arm pits, etc. when the body can't eliminate waste fast enough, the lymphatic system stores it until the body can eliminate it. the mullein in this formula is known as a "drainer". rebounding also helps to drain the lymph system. save $35 on one of best rebounders by ordering david hall's cellerciser from dr. christopher's school of natural healing. if you click the link, you can watch four interesting videos about rebounding at the bottom of the school's webpage.dr. john chrisropher's immucalm formula calms and strengthens the immune system. allergies to certain foods, plants, or animals, and auto-immune disease are signs of an overactive immune system.dr. john christopher's sinus plus formula helps to open up sinus passageways, stop infection, and cleanse the sinus area.dr. john christopher's nose ointment also helps to open up sinus passageways. a small amount is applied around and inside the nose opening. refrigerate after opening.dr. john christopher's sensei menthol rub is a nasal decongestant that helps to relieve sinus pressure. a small amount is applied behind both ears, across the underside of the jaw, and on the chest. a small amount can also be put in the medicine cup of a warm mist humidifier. it is a blend of herbs and natural oils. smells better than vicks vaporub, which is made from petroleum. refrigerate after opening.

ann wigmore was diagnosed with various illnesses and terminal colon cancer in the 1950s. her grandmother was an herbalist and used herbs and plants as a village healer in lithuania. recalling her grandmother's work from her childhood, ann healed herself and many others with herbs and plants. the ann wigmore raw living foods lifestyle developed into the hipocrates health institute in boston. fifty years later, the hipocrates health institute in west palm beach, fl, the creative health institute in union city, mi, and the ann wigmore institute in puerto rico are still using the ann wigmore lifestyle to heal. if your're willing to change your lifestyle, you can stay 3 weeks at hhi in west palm beach, fl to learn the lifestyle while living it, detox, and enjoy great raw food. they also uniquely test your blood, which is evaluated by their doctor. hhi will yearly, for life, test your blood (without having to go to hhi) for no additional charge. chi and awi have similar 2 week programs, but they don't test your blood.just click on the following link and you can read the book in your browser or download it as a free pdf. dr. ann wigmore's raw living foods free ebook - "why suffer?" how i overcame illness & pain naturally"hippocrates health institute, west palm beach, flchi, union city, miann wigmore institute, puerto rico ann wigmore foundation

	 alternative help for hypertension
	 
    


dr. julian whitaker, host of healthy talk radio, has said that "drugs for high blood pressure overwork the kidneys. this does lower blood pressure, but eventually leads to kidney failure." he recommends minerals for lowering blood pressure. considering our depleted soil, this really makes sense. now colloidal minerals is a unique source of highly absorbable, water-soluble minerals and trace elements derived from prehistoric plant deposits. this now product is screened for heavy metals. it contains dozens of minerals and trace minerals, not just a few, like a regular supplement. the link below will lead to both plain and raspberry flavors of now foods colloidal minerals, 32 fl oz, at iherb.com.now foods colloidal minerals, 32 fl oz, at iherb.comherbalist wendy wilson, host of herb talk live, read from a 2006 study done by the national academy of sciences. "if we are exposed to herbicide agents, it creates hypertension." she said, "courtesy of monsanto, we are eating foods spliced with herbicides' dna." she suggested avoiding gmo foods and pesticides by buying organic.the mediterranean diet and 30 minutes of walking a day has been recommended by gary null. foods for this diet are listed in this posting:new studies show mediterranean diet lowers alzheimer's & pvd (peripheral vascular disease) riskthe link below is for a great online source of organic and kosher nuts, nut butters, olive oils, olives, dried fruits, seeds, honey, and powders.living tree community foodssee my january 28, 2005, posting - how to listen to the debra ray show, healthy talk radio. debra ray's radio and streaming audio health show has been bringing researched health information to listeners since 1982.see my july 02, 2005, posting - gout relief! & how to listen to herb talk live.
