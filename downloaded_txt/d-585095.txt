 homeschool curriculum development


anne's school placehomeschool curriculum developmentthe purpose of prophecy…
april 4, 2011 by anne here is a great quote by christine miller,
“the purpose of prophecy is not to give christians a crystal ball into future events. its purpose, once what is prophesied has clearly been seen to come to pass, is to produce the conviction that the god of the bible is god, thus inspiring repentance, and faith.”
using the book of revelation to teach history
march 26, 2011 by anne there are many good history curriculum available to homeschoolers today. why write another one? one reason is that we want to use the bible as our primary textbook when homeschooling our children. we believe that the bible is 100% accurate and was written by our creator; therefore, it contains the most important information that our creator wants us to know.
history is no exception. while the bible’s account of history varies substantially from secular accounts, we believe that only the bible’s record is accurate and true.
many curriculum use the bible to teach from creation until the roman empire. the problem comes when we must then teach the rest of time, from the roman empire to modern times. there are so many things to teach our children that it becomes difficult to know which historical facts are the most important.
several years ago, i was first introduced to a view of the book of revelation called the “historicist” view, which simply means that the events foretold in the book would be revealed over the remaining periods of history, from the writing of the book by john until jesus returns to set up his heavenly kingdom at the end of time.
i have always been taught a “futurist” view of revelation, that all of the prophecies it contains will be fulfilled in a yet-future time.
i am not arguing one way or the other. i believe that god is big enough and wise enough to be able to do both. there are many examples of prophecies in the old testament that were fulfilled during the lifetime of the prophet and yet had another fulfillment that pointed to jesus, the messiah. (see, for instance, isaiah 7:14 and matthew 1:23.) in my mind, the book of revelation could easily be interpreted from both an historical and a futurist viewpoint.
isaac newton, who was a staunch defender of the historicist view of revelation, wrote the following:
“the folly of interpreters has been, to fortel times and things by this  prophecy, as if god designed to make them prophets. by this rashness  they have not only exposed themselves, but brought the prophecy also  into centempt.” (isaac newton, observations upon the prophecies of daniel and the apocalypse of st. john, p. 251. read more here…)
when we see how god wrote down the history of the modern world in the book of revelation, and how it has been fulfilled accurately and completely, all the way up until our current times, our faith in the providence and wisdom of god is greatly strengthened.
“as for god, his way is perfect: the word of the lord is tried [proven]: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him” (psalm 18:30, kjv).
“who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell? every word of god is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar” (proverbs 30:4-6, kjv).
one very nice feature of using scripture to tell history is that, especially when scripture is committed to memory, our children are provided with a mental timeline. they will be able to put all other historical and current events into their proper perspective, always seen from god’s viewpoint.
our prayer is that, by telling all of history (from creation to modern times) from god’s perspective as written in the book of revelation, we will cover the most important details, the things that god most wants our children to know and understand. we hope you’ll join us!
