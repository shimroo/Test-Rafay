           transferring from air force active duty? 
        

the air force offers two separate programs for active duty airmen transitioning to the air force reserve. contact your in-service recruiter for more details on requirements and how to get started.













palace chase


for active-duty airmen who have served half of their enlistment, are interested in leaving, but do not have a separation date.
growth
when you transfer into the air force reserve through the palace chase program you will continue to grow valuable career skills and benefits.
early release
airmen approaching the halfway point of their first enlistment, or officers near two-thirds of their commitment can apply. if accepted, the term of enlistment with the guard depends on the amount of time left on the initial active-duty contract.









palace front


for active-duty airmen who have chosen to leave the air force and are within six months of completing their enlistment contract.
part-time / full-time
you can serve in the location of your choice either full-time or part-time, one weekend per month and two weeks per year.
benefits
when you transfer through the palace front program you can maintain your rank and current job or cross-train into another. you'll also continue enjoying the benefits of the air force without any break.

learn more about reservists programs.
 




what are the basic requirements to join?



to join the air force reserve, you must be between the ages of 17 and have not reached your 42nd birthday, a current u.s. citizen, and have obtained either a high school diploma or ged. applicants can’t have any serious law violations or drug use or serious health problems. 
additionally, you must pass the armed services aptitude battery (asvab) and a physical. the asvab covers four critical areas: arithmetic reasoning, mathematics, word knowledge and paragraph comprehension. this is used to determine whether you’re a good fit for the air force reserve and the best career field to place you in.




can i work a full-time job with the air force reserve?



                    yes, while most of the air force reserve careers are part time, we offer numerous full-time careers for those who are willing. these positions are available to you once you’ve been fully trained and established in your reserve unit.
                



how many years will i have to serve?



                    your initial military service obligation (mso) will require you to serve for six years (one weekend a month and two weeks once a year) plus two years of inactive service. during inactive service, you’re not expected to attend drills but could be called upon by the president to serve. subsequent enlistments can range from two to six years.
                



how often does the air force reserve deploy?



deployment depends on your afsc (air force specialty code), your assigned unit and the needs of the air force at any given time. in general, there’s no set deployment schedule for reservists. 
most reservist missions will be for logistics and support, but some specialties such as the security forces are more combat-oriented. while it’s not unusual to not deploy at all, all reservists have to deploy when the circumstances require.

 




how much will i get paid?



                    reservist pay is based on the days served. pay rate is determined by whether they serve on the weekend (inactive-duty training) or active duty (two-week annual tour). pay also depends on your rank and years served.
