                      optimal: how to sustain personal and  organizational excellence every day
by: daniel goleman and cary cherniss
as co-chairs of consortium for research on emotional intelligence (creio) for 25 years we have  been tracking research on emotional intelligence, a field that saw a critical  mass of findings during this period. in optimal we draw on that body of data to both review the evidence that supports the  concept, and to add new implications.â   creio members may find useful a study done at harvard business school on  the subjective experience of workers’ “good days,” where they are more  productive, creative, engaged, happy, and connected to co-workers â and the  evidence tying such days to emotionally intelligent leadership.
by  now, we observe, the concepts of emotional intelligence have been absorbed by  many organizations into their cultural dna; ei may no longer be labelled as  such, but rather couched in terms more compatible with the frameworks and  language already in use in a given outfit. as consultant know, this means  approaching an organization to give advice on ei may mean learning the language  they use for this skill set.
in optimal we review the data for the  importance of ei in organizations, including the several meta-analyses done by  the research group that includes creio member ron humphrey. this data and other  such findings yield quite positive results for the impact of ei, both in  leaders and workers generally.
for  example, a meta-analysis of over 65,000 entrepreneurs finds that ei is twice as  important in their success as is iq. this finding corrects the general  impression left by studies that follow students into their careers, that have  found iq more important â that will be true since iq is a good predictor of  what professions people can enter, with higher iq predicting being able to  complete advanced training like an mba or md. but once people are in a given  profession, iq fails to predict success, while ei correlates more strongly with  becoming an outstanding performer or leader.
other  topics covered include:
the new names commonly given ei  self-management abilities, like ‘agility’, ‘growth mindset’, and ‘resilience’.
how ei can help prevent burnout
the types of empathy and why they matter  immensely in organizations, particularly in leaders
what emotionally intelligent leadership  looks like, and what such leaders actually do
how ei looks at the team level, how to  spot strengths and weaknesses, and how teams can go about strengthening their  ei
ei training that works
key steps in building an ei culture
finally, we speculate on the future of ei,  and why it will need to work as a complement to other abilities like creativity  and innovation, finding an inspiring sense of purpose, and systems thinking.


guidelines for best practice
these guidelines are based on an   exhaustive review of the research literature in training and development,   counseling and psychotherapy, and behavior change. the guidelines are additive   and synergistic; to be effective, social and emotional learning experiences need   not adhere to all of these guidelines, but the chances for success increase with   each one that is followed. read moreâ» if you are interested in reading the full technical report on emotional intelligence in the workplace published by the consortium on research on emotional intelligence in organizations, click here to download your free copy.
the business case for emotional intelligence
the following 19 points build a case   for how emotional intelligence contributes to the bottom line in any work   organization. based on data from a variety of sources, it can be a valuable tool   for hr practitioners and managers who need to make the case in their own   organizations. the consortium also invites submissions of other research for the   business case. all submissions will be reviewed to determine their   suitability. read moreâ»
