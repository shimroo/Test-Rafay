halito!

          greetings from the choctaw indian reservation. we invite you to join us july 10-13 for our 74th annual choctaw indian fair. the fair takes place on our centuries-old homeland in beautiful choctaw, mississippi. we gather each july to celebrate our heritage and share our beautiful and vibrant culture with our friends and neighbors. this year’s fair theme is:
        
"the choctaw spirit lives on"

          fairgoers will experience the magnificent journey of our people through historical and cultural displays, social dancing, tribal arts & crafts, choctaw stickball – the granddaddy of all field sports – as well as the choctaw indian princess pageant and traditional choctaw food. the fair also offers carnival rides and games for the young and old alike, shawi’s discovery zone and chart-topping musical acts each night. there’s something for everyone at the choctaw indian fair – we’ll see you soon!
        
yakoki!
