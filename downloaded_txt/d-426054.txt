magical weddings 



our romantic venue makes it one of the best locations for small weddings on the chesapeake bay. the dog and oyster micro-vineyard is our largest on-property venue for up to 75 guests. for larger ceremonies, we can avail ourselves of our town’s commons and/or north commons – both just across the street. for more intimate ceremonies, our quaint gardens, the front steps of the inn, and our boat, true love, are all available for your wedding. our talented chef will surprise you with exquisite plated meals or food stations for your wedding dinner.

dog and oyster vineyard 



we offer much more than an irvington bed and breakfast. we also have a lovely, inviting, dog-friendly micro-vineyard with an elegant tent we relocated to the front of the inn. there we offer exquisite wine tastings and feature fresh, local oysters that pair perfectly with our wines.it’s one of only three places in the world where grapes were grown next to waters where oysters are grown, resulting in the terroir of the grape to be the same as the merroir of the oyster.

a wonderful experience 







 













				we had an absolutely delightful experience probably the best bed and breakfast in virginia, the hope & and glory inn. the owners and staff were all so welcoming, attentive, helpful and accomodating! the personal attention was truly appreciated and definitely exceeded our expectations. chef meseret's level of customer service was outstanding. her culinary talents made our anniversary weekend a fabulous gastronomical event! peggy really took the time to provide us with excellent recommendations. we also really appreciated the covid preventative measures and compliance that they took, as that is a primary concern for us at this time. the breakfast delivered to the door of our cottage every morning was such a nice touch. we loved having the bikes to use around town and used them to travel to the vineyard which was just down the road. the staff at the dog and oyster were also so friendly and down to earth. just an all-around nice place to have a special getaway!

boat cruises on true love 



the list of reasons to stay at our irvington hotel goes on and on, including the fact that we offer seasonal cruises on a fortier-26 named true love. step aboard and spend an hour scenery-gazing and soaking in the natural beauty of the creatures of the water as we lead you through the charming coves of carter’s creek. we can also include a collectible souvenir bag with a bottle of wine and charcuterie. it’s one of the best things to do in irvington, va.
