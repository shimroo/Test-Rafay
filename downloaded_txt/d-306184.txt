how does hiclone work?




hiclone has a series of fins, it's installed into the air induction pipe between the air filter and engine or inter-cooler and engine, also pre-turbo, as the air is being sucked or blown past the hiclone the fins make the air spin, the hiclone doesn’t move, it makes the air move.
by spinning the air you'll get a much better mixture between the air and fuel, this gives you better combustion and more power from the fuel, more power means you'll use your right foot less, hence greatly improving your fuel economy.
spinning the air also creates a vortex that wants to and does suck more air in, so you'll get a bit of a double whammy, more air and a better mixture.
are hiclones easy to install?
yes, they are very easy to install. check out johns installation video to see just how easy it is! in most cases you'll only need a screwdriver and a pair of gloves. they take around 10 -15 minutes to install and then your ready to hit the highway and enjoy the extra power and excellent fuel savings that the hiclone product will deliver.
if at any time you have questions, contact john directly on free call 04 3863 9594 or email john@hicloneqld.com and a speedy answer will be delivered.

 hiclones will give you 5-15%  increase in power/torque and up to 24% better fuel economy!
