sturgis
the
                            sturgis rally
                            - yes it's full of the strange and the bizarre. there
                            are some you wouldn't want to meet in the afternoon
                            sunshine, let alone in the dark of the night - scantily
                            clad women traipse around.

                            and then there are the friendships - philosophical
                            discussions over a brew - thousands and thousands
                            and even hundreds of thousands of harley davidsons
                            barreling through the ponderosa pine covered mountains...
                            every sturgis
                            web cam is listed here, as well.

                            if you ever make one motorcycle rally in your life,
                            make this one. the place is legendary. and for good
                            reason.

tooling
                            down the interstate. the land of bikes is dead ahead.
                            you can see a couple miles. to the west rise the black
                            hills - a mountain range of dark green draped with
                            ponderosa pine trees. inviting and cool
from
                            hundreds of miles away you're surrounded by them.
                            the roar of the harley is everywhere. there are a
                            few indians. once in awhile a bmw. and the japanese
                            bikes come, too. as at the other sites
                            on the web.
a
                            week of heaven and harley davidson
for
                            the next week or more you'll be in a place unlike
                            any other in the world. there are more harley davidson
                            motorcycles and bikers converged here than anywhere
                            else on the planet.

                            they come from many countries and all over the united
                            states. there is everything here. burned out greasers,
                            peter fonda, people so stoned they don't know where
                            they are at, attorneys in the upper income tax bracket,
                            dope dealers who should be, factory workers, lonely
                            women, and women who will never be lonely. 

                            all of them have one thing in common - the fun and
                            craziness of the offbeat life. with 
                            biker chicks abounding.
