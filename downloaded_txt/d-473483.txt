who we are 



first we would like to introduce ourselves. we are a local union of the printing packaging production workers union of north america. we are a highly responsible, respected and effective organization that represents workers in all phases of the packaging, publishing and printing industry. the history of our union can be traced back to 1882, when local one was founded on the banks of the hudson river in jersey city, new jersey by the romar fishing club. 



our members work in shops that range in size from a handful of employees to multinational companies that employ thousands of workers. they work on newspaper plants, commercial offset plants, binding and fishing plants, packaging, production, desktop publishing firms as well as digital prepress shops. today, we are helping out members meet the challenges of the future by focusing on the ever changing technologies and issues facing every working man and woman.
