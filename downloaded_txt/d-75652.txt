welcome to america’s lutheran cathedral™. historic trinity has been sharing the love of jesus in downtown detroit since 1850. as a national, state, and local historical designated site, historic trinity is known across the world as the most majestic lutheran cathedral in america. the uniqueness of our downtown location, the breathtaking beauty of our sanctuary and our worship services distinguish us as a destination church, but we are a church beyond the walls.
we are a proud neighbor in the historic eastern market district. we provide secure and lighted off street parking, easy access only two blocks from i-75 exit 51b, air-conditioned facilities, and complete handicap accessibility.
