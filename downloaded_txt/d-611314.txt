"gained 43 lbs. of muscular 

bodyweight!"

i just wanted to thank you for your tips and advice that you have given to me since i began 

training back in october 2003. i am now beginning to have the physique that i have always 

wanted, my skinny frame has become a distant memory although i still look at photos of 

myself taken three years ago to remind me not to return that way. i will always either 

maintain the way i look now, or maybe continue to try to get bigger. when i began training, 

at 6' 2", i was 187 pounds and very thin, i now weigh 230 pounds and people i have known for 

a long time comment on how big i look now, which is what i have always wished for. 
 
the main reason why i want to thank you is because, like many other beginners, the first two 

years of my training i just concentrated on having a big upper body, i wanted big arms and 

that was it, and i was frustrated and writing to you for your advice on how to get big arms. 

i did train my legs once a week, but my chest, shoulders back and arm workouts were my 

priority, and i was getting nowhere, my arms grew a bit but not as much as i wanted them to. 

but just a few months ago, i read your tips on making deadlifts and squats a priority, 

squatting one and a half times my own bodyweight for 20 reps, and this is what changed my 

physique. i cannot squat one and a half times my own bodyweight for 20 reps yet, i can do 

about 4 reps, but making my leg routine my main workout has given me my overall mass, my 

arms are now becoming huge, forearms especially.
 
this has been a great breakthrough for me, thanks to you, and i hope that there will be 

others who gain like me through taking your advice.
 
thanks lee. keep up the good work.

g'day lee,

i visited your site a while back and and purchased your e-book and just wanted to send you a quick email to let you know how i'm going with it.

"put 40 lbs. on his bench 
and 90 lbs. on his squat"

i'm 41 years young and i downloaded and printed the 

bio-genetic muscle building book.  i've read it cover to cover.  i started working out 2 

years ago and i've made some decent gains, but am always wanting more.  since i read your 

bio-genetic program, i changed my diet and training radically.

i'm 4 weeks into this now.  the biggest hurdle i've had is getting paste 225 on the flat 

bench.  when i started this program, i could get one, maybe two reps with a spot - now i do 

4 or 5 without a spot.....7 or 8 with a spot to force them out.  earlier this week, i did 

265 for one rep!  more than 40 pounds on my bench in 4 weeks.  when i started 4 weeks ago, 

225 for squats was pushing it.  i just did 315 for squats today and it wasn't too hard.  

people are noticing that i'm putting on alot of size in my chest, shoulders and arms.  this 
program is working!

thanks for the program and all the good info. 

i'll keep you posted.
