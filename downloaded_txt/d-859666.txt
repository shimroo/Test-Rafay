how we create our lives

















are there areas of your life that aren't working?
if you have a relationship or any area of life that isn't working, there is something under the surface that is creating the problem.
this underlying condition makes us defensive and creates a state of fear and upset. it destroys our ability to find solutions and magnifies the problem. in relationships, it creates conflict and destroys love.
the moment this condition is removed, you restore your ability to see clearly. solutions appear and the problem area starts clearing up. bill ferguson can show you how.
the underlying condition
