way back in 1985 i took the basic hunter's education class at sabre's gun club in lima, oh at the ripe old age of 11.  at that time there were no digital records kept by the state, no unique # issued to you for wildlife officers or agencies to call up to verify you took the course - all you got was a business sized card stating you completed the course with your name on it, the date and location you took

those who have been around our forum for a while may remember that when athlon optics first hit the scene back in 2014 i was pretty skeptical about them. at the time they were an unknown entity, and between the spec sheets, prices, and abundance of overwhelmingly positive reviews they were getting online it all just sounded far too good to be true. after all, athlon optics was just another brand that sprung up copying the vortex business model of spec'ing out optics from chinese

if one were able to hop into a time machine and go back to the mid 2000's to visit a gun shop, they would find that most every new bolt-action hunting rifle on the rack was equipped with iron sights. for whatever reason, just a few years later you would be hard pressed to find any new bolt-action hunting rifle in the rack with irons.

back in 2019 we published a brief piece on the h.w. cooey machine and arms company which contained a link to a great article on the history of said company which was ultimately purchased by savage arms in 1995 to provide them with a means to re-enter the rimfire market.  this evening, while browsing through some older articles on one of my favorite publication's website i stumbled upon

since the introduction of the axis in 2010, savage arms has made several revisions to the design of the firing pin and the firing pin spring.  the original design featured a heavier firing pin as well as a one-piece firing pin spring.  this original design worked extremely well and provided sufficient energy to reliably ignite primers.
