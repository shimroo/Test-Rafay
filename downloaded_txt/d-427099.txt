	 nichols lures
	 



lake fork flutter spoons   i know you are going to think i am crazy,  but i have so many men to get christmas gifts for and i didn't know what to get them until i visited this website, nichols lures.  my dad, brother, uncles and cousins, go fishing all the time.  so what better gift to give them than this lake fork flutter spoons. the hottest spoon now on lake fork.  nichols lures shattered glass hologram spoons available in 2 weights and sizes. as you can see, this 5" lake fork flutter spoon is very small compared to the shad that they eat on a regular basis.  lake fork flutter spoons are going to be a hit under the christmas tree this year....yeah, no more sweaters!!!!!

japanese cherry blossom goat milk lotion wow, i love the smell of this japanese cherry blossom hand lotion.  my hands feel so soft using goat milk lotion.  chicken mash farms carries body sprays, body lotions, candles, lip balms, and so much more.  i no longer have to go spend so much money at that store at the mall, i now just shop online from chicken mash farms for some of the best fragrances i have ever smelt!
