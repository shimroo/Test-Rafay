maryland center for legal assistance (mcla) 

the maryland center for legal assistance (mcla) expands access to justice by providing free, compassionate, innovative, and high-quality legal services. through comprehensive legal advice, education, and collaboration with community partners, we empower all people, regardless of means or background, to navigate the civil legal system with confidence.
the help centers deal with a wide range of civil legal matters, including landlord-tenant, consumer matters such as debt collection and credit card cases, child support, and criminal record expungements to remove barriers to obtaining housing, employment, and child custody.
