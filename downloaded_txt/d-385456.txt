sail handling beyond your expectations 














from the deck up





we are addicted to sailing and probably the nerdiest crew you have ever met. your passion is our work and our mission is to make your sailing more enjoyable, whatever it takes. enjoy our site and welcome on board!
attention to detail
in our search for perfection, no detail is considered too small. this applies to everything, from the choice of materials to stringent testing of the finished product. seldén’s business philosophy can be summed up as quality thinking and system thinking, and a continuous quest to achieve the best possible function for each product.
our heritage
manufacturing of masts is the foundation of seldén and what has brought us to where we are today. adapting to new technologies has always come natural to us and since the start in the 60’s we have gone from wooden masts to anodized aluminium and further on through generations of different mast ranges. today we are the dominating manufacturer of complete sail handling systems and deck hardware for dinghies, keelboats and yachts up to 80’
recent launches
our product development never stops and we have recently launched products we really want you to check out.

























aluminium masts






all our standard rigs are custom made
extruded aluminium is an excellent material for making masts. this is where seldén has earned its reputation as world leader in mast making. today seldén offers a full range of masts in both aluminium and carbon fiber. all rigs are custom-made, through every calculation and detail, for each individual boat. we know how much depends on the rig, and there is no room for compromise.

carbon masts






carbon composite combines stiffness and strength with low weight. seldén low-weight carbon spars have accentuated longitudinal and lateral stiffness for more precise rig tuning. all experienced racing sailors know what this means in terms of increased upwind performance and boat speed.

downwind furlers






the power and acceleration achieved when unfurling a code 0 or an asymmetric spinnaker is spectacular.
– it will make your sailing more fun.
simply hoist the furled sail, release the furling line, pull on the sheet and you have added horse power to your sailing and given your crew a positive sailing experience. to douse the sail, ease the sheet, pull the continuous furling line and secure it in the purpose made twin cam block. once the sail is furled it can be neatly dropped and coiled into a bag or left hoisted for later use. seldén provide all necessary accessories for safe and carefree furling of “off-the-wind” sails.
