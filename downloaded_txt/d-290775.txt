time tunnel: the empire"★★★★★ time tunnel: the empire was a crazy good adventure that i would have never expected from this sci-fi style book. it is a must-read that i could hardly put down.” — manhattan book review“★★★★...eerie similarities to our current political climate cannot be denied….this book also ends on a great cliffhanger, leaving the reader wanting much more.”  — san francisco book review"in this second installment of a series, todd (time tunnel: the twin towers, 2019) continues exploring the intriguing possibilities of time travel, backing up his speculations with well-researched history and believable science. though adept at setting up exciting, tense confrontations, the author is also a thoughtful writer, and his characters are appropriately vulnerable, though padma is hailed as the messiah of lakota prophecy and kyle has modern weaponry. todd’s lakota camp and the town of deadwood come vividly alive with well-chosen, telling details such as the checkerboard that sits atop a general store’s cracker barrel. the cliffhanger ending will leave readers eager for the next volume.”  — kirkus"★★★★★ just like the first novel in the series the twin towers, the empire is full of action, intrigue, and suspense. richard todd does a fantastic job of retelling historical events, which are brilliantly researched.” — seattle book review"★★★★★ relationships are tested in this story; the only way to know how you truly feel about someone is to throw them in a situation together for which they are totally unprepared. the reader is able to delve deeper into the feelings of the characters and grasp a better understanding for the motivation of their actions. as in twin towers, there is action galore, and the empire includes another story from history that originally ended badly, but now occurs in a way we would have liked for it to have played out. the ending was a complete shock, with another phase in the time tunnel series coming at a later date.” — tulsa book review
