all
        full construction plans and study plans are now available as electronic
        pdf files which can be sent to you as email attachments, for you to
        download.

        when you go to order a plan you will have a choice of two buy now
        buttons - one for the printed plans (to be sent by post) and the other
        for the electronic pdf version of the plan, which will be sent to your
