interaction styles* 
the how
interaction styles is based on observable behavior patterns that are quite similar to the popular social styles models and disc®. interaction styles tells us the "how" of our behavior. it refers to patterns of interaction that are both highly contextual and yet innate. knowing our interaction style helps us locate interpersonal conflicts and situational energy drains. it gives us a map for greater flexibility in our interactions with others.

history of the four interaction styles
throughout the ages, observers of human behavior have repeatedly identified patterns or configurations of behavior. such holistic sorting of behavior patterns has been recorded for at least twenty-five centuries. ancient philosophers described four dispositions called temperaments-a choleric, a phlegmatic, a melancholic, and a sanguine. interpretations of these patterns have varied over the years, with two distinct interpretations, one is david keirsey's temperament theory and the other relates to the interaction style model. 




most twentieth-century psychologists abandoned holistic observation of human behavior for a microscopic examination of parts, fragments, traits, and so on. to them, all human beings were basically alike-and individual differences were due to chance or conditioning-yet many of them ultimately described patterns that resemble our holistic view. 
the seeds were sown for the interaction style model in the 1920s. in 1928, william marston wrote about the emotional basis for our behavior. john geier built on marston's work and developed the disc® instrument. geier looked at traits and clusters of traits that would help us understand how we behave in the "social field." then came a long string of frameworks and instruments that described the social styles of people. these frameworks yielded descriptions similar to geier's interpretation of marston's work. 

many of these authors referenced the work of carl jung, isabel myers, and katharine briggs. their primary focus, in contrast to jung, was on outer behavior, not inner states. some even reference keirsey's temperament theory. they seemed to not realize they were referencing separate models. 
all of these models suggest that these styles or types are inborn. in the meantime, studies continue to be conducted on the various "temperamental" traits that can be identified and tracked over time with physiological measures. many of these traits seem to relate to the interaction styles patterns.

chart-the-course™
the 
theme is having a course of action 
to follow. people of this stylefocus 
on knowing what to do and keeping 
themselves, the group, or the project 
on track. they prefer to enter a 
situation having an idea of what 
is to happen. they identify a process 
to accomplish a goal and have a 
somewhat contained tension as they 
work to create and monitor a plan. 
the aim is not the plan itself, 
but to use it as a guide to move 
things along toward the goal. their 
informed and deliberate decisions 
are based on analyzing, outlining, 
conceptualizing or foreseeing what 
needs to be done. 



behind-the-scenes™
the 
theme is getting the best result 
possible. people of this style 
focus on understanding and working 
with the process to create a positive 
outcome. they see value in many 
contributions and consult outside 
inputs to make an informed decision. 
they aim to integrate various 
information sources and accommodate 
differing points of view. they 
approach others with a quiet, 
calm style that may not show their 
strong convictions. producing, 
sustaining, defining, and clarifying 
are all ways they support a group's 
process. they typically have more 
patience than most with the time 
it takes to gain support through 
consensus for a project or to 
refine the result. 





in-charge™
the 
theme is getting things accomplished 
through people. people of this style 
are focused on results, often taking 
action quickly. they often have 
a driving energy with an intention 
to lead a group to the goal. they 
make decisions quickly to keep themselves 
and others on task, on target, and 
on time. they hate wasting time 
and having to back track. mentoring, 
executing actions, supervising, 
and mobilizing resources are all 
ways they get things accomplished. 
they notice right away what is not 
working in a situation and become 
painfully aware of what needs to 
be fixed, healed, or corrected. 




get-things-going™
the 
theme is persuading and involving 
others. they thrive in facilitator 
or catalyst roles and aim to inspire 
others to move to action, facilitating 
the process. their focus is on 
interaction, often with an expressive 
style. they get-things-going™ with 
upbeat energy, enthusiasm, or 
excitement, which can be contagious. 
exploring options and possibilities, 
making preparations, discovering 
new ideas, and sharing insights 
are all ways they get people moving 
along. they want decisions to 
be participative and enthusiastic, 
with everyone involved and engaged. 
 




 
things-in-common

directing versus informing communications-ways we influence others
initiating versus responding roles-ways to define relationships
control versus movement focus-where we focus our attention when interacting

 
these dynamics are always operating in a situation, and if we become polarized along these dimensions as we interact with others, miscommunication and misunderstanding are probable and likely to result in destructive conflict. however, we need to remember that we always have at least one aspect in common with someone of a different interaction style.
