media appearancesbecause of his extensive high profile, federal white collar  criminal defense experience, mr. wisenberg appears frequently on a wide range of national media outlets, including fox news, pbs, nbc, cbs and npr. [recent media appearances]
 







wisenberg wrote the bookwhite collar crime: securities fraud (3rd ed. 2016), published by thomson reuters–one of the world’s leading legal publishing houses. numerous white collar crimes are discussed, including: mail and wire fraud, securities fraud, bank and mortgage fraud, tax crimes, false statements and obstruction of justice, federal criminal investigations, and antitrust offenses. 











11 



eleven federal felony indictments dismissed. 




 



“a post-indictment dismissal is an event that occurs with the same sort of infrequency as the passage of haley’s comet.” danilewitz & acevedo, the champion, september/october 2022.
mr. wisenberg has obtained this result 11 times for 11 clients.
these results are not typical. nor were they obtained through any special relationship mr. wisenberg had with federal prosecutors.  every federal white collar case is unique and past success is no guarantee of future results. these dismissals occurred through a combination of circumstances, including long hours, hard work, and attention to detail. 




more details
in each of these 11 cases, all felony charges against mr. wisenberg’s clients were dismissed. in seven of these cases, no other charges of any kind were brought against mr. wisenberg’s clients. in three cases, the clients were required to plead guilty to misdemeanor offenses and received probation. in one case, the client pled guilty to three tax misdemeanors and was sentenced to one year and one day.
