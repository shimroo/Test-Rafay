what our families are saying
 





"please accept this note as our sincere appreciation to the both of you for the time you spent with us and our son recently with regard to his diagnostic evaluation. throughout the process, we were very pleased with your thoroughness, willingness to answer our questions, and ability to direct us to appropriate resources. in addition, you were able to provide a comfortable, non-threatening environment for our son, enabling you to observe him without anxiety on his part - for that we are very thankful!"
mother of 9 a year old, metro atlanta
 

 
 




"i can highly recommend dr. robert montgomery who is not only a licensed psychologist but also a bcba. he and his wife did a thorough evaluation that helped us get great services at school. the eval. was covered by my insurance and medicaid. i paid for him to come to my daughter's eligibility meeting and it was worth every penny and then some. his company is located in woodstock and is called reinforcement unlimited, llc."
