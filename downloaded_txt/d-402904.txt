								featured website



the a-listed 
								picture house in campbeltown is an amazing 
								survivor and holder of several records. it is 
								now the oldest purpose-built cinema in scotland 
								still showing films, the only cinema in scotland 
								still with atmospheric-style decoration, and one 
								of the few cinema buildings that remains 
								undivided, allowing films to be seen from a 
								choice of stalls or balcony. it also unusually 
								has never had a name change!
