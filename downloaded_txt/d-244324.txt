what distinguishes ehs?








experience washington
taking full advantage of all the nation's capital has to offer, our signature washington program creates hundreds of opportunities for experiential learning, hearing from and collaborating with experts in trailblazing, history-making organizations.












meet our faculty
whether in the classroom, on the field, at seated lunch, or in the audience, episcopal faculty are there; they are present and available. they are masters of their subjects, enthusiastic supporters, advisors, and mentors. ninety percent of faculty live on campus, either on dorm or in faculty housing.












feed your creative spirit
the need to experience and create resides in the human spirit. it is our job at episcopal to honor that fundamental desire by uncovering it in some and nourishing it in all.












join a legacy of athletic achievement
the maroon are 48 interscholastic teams, including 29 varsity in 17 different sports. over 80% of our students participate each year in athletics, and they do so on and around world-class facilities used in the past for training by us national teams.












savor the weekends
weekends at episcopal are a time to unwind, to explore, to connect – and, sometimes, to just relax! our weekend activites program works to make sure each weekend offers a wide range of opportunities for all students, all included in the cost of tuition!














the world is closer here

		wake up each morning surrounded by friends. spend your days with teachers who know you so well they are practically family. live and learn and work and play in a beautiful place that feels almost like home. here you are minutes from the heart of the nation's capital, where you will go often to learn how the world works as you prepare for your future. at every step you are valued, challenged, and supported. along the way, you will discover who you are – and what you might become.
