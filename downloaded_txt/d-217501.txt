cervical screening












cervical screening

                    a cervical screening test every five years is the best way to prevent cervical cancer. learn more about how cervical screening saves lives.
                























cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers—having a cervical screening test every five years is the best way to prevent it.the cervical screening test prevents cervical cancer by looking for the presence of the human papillomavirus (hpv). almost all cervical cancers are caused by hpv.hpv is a common infection, passed through sexual contact, which usually clears up by itself in one to two years. if you are aged 25 to 74, have a cervix and have ever been sexually active, it is recommended that you have a cervical screening test every five years—even if you have had the hpv vaccination.in december 2017, the cervical screening test replaced the pap test (sometimes called the 'pap smear').this improved change supports the aims of the national cervical screening program to reduce the number of cervical cancer deaths by encouraging more women to get screening. by working together, we aim to eliminate cervical cancer by the 2030s.
