children's health insurance program

the children's health insurance program — or chip — is pennsylvania's program to provide health coverage to uninsured children and teens who are not eligible for or enrolled in medicaid/medical assistance. 
regardless of the reasons your children might not have health insurance, chip may be able to help you. 






apply for chip





apply for medicaid





 























there are a lot of reasons why kids or teens might not have health insurance —maybe their parents lost a job, don't have health insurance at work, or maybe other options just cost too much. 









whatever the reason, if your child or teen is uninsured and ineligible for or enrolled in medical assistance, the children's health insurance program — or chip — may be able to help. having high-quality, low-cost health insurance helps put your mind at ease.
