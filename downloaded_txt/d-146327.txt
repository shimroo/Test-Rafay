did you know? 


cobblestone was the original natural material used as a form of pavement, concrete and stone hardscape design. cobblestone streets date as far back as the 3rd and 4th centuries.

 


wood fences


wood fences come in a variety of designs from basic boards to unique cuts which can be stenciled and or finished with finial design. wood fencing is affordable, durable, offers noise cancelling and added privacy for your yard. at sungreen our primary choice for fencing lumbar is cedar wood and treated pine, as both of these materials are resilient and will withstand decay. post installation, wood fencing offers you the flexibility to paint or stain your wood a wide variety of colors suiting your own personal taste and needs. when choosing a wood fence you must keep in mind that wood fencing must be maintained in order to keep the fence in good shape, so though it sports a natural and exclusive aesthetic for your outdoor living space, there will be a maintenance commitment to keep it looking its absolute best from season to season






 

chainlink fencing





chain link fencing is an affordable, durable, low maintenance fencing option. for what it lacks in beauty it makes up in practicality and it still leaves your outdoor space feeling more open than wood or vinyl fencing options. there are two options for chain link fencing: regular brushed metal or vinyl (black or green) covered metal.

 

ornamental fences





an ornamental fence is the elegant alternative to a regular metal fence. made of similar materials such as steel, iron or aluminum. ornamental fences offer the security and open area feel of a metal fence, with a more complex and sophisticated design.

 

metal fences





metal fencing is very beautiful and pleasing to the eye, it’s strong, durable and virtually indestructible. the timeless beauty of metal fences has been and will always be in style. it is lower maintenance than wood fencing; however, will still need some maintenance from time to to time to prevent rusting.






 


vinyl fencing

vinyl fencing can offer you a very similar aesthetic to wood fencing with much lower maintenance. the fencing comes with wood like textures and the material is equally if not more durable than traditional wood. it comes in an assortment of colors and will maintain its look over long period of time; no need to worry about fading or peeling with vinyl material. its strong and flexible and will never be at the risk of rotting, decomposing or rusting.
