the grande dame of hotels in charleston
when planters inn was built in 1844, it secured the best location  of all charleston hotels. today, the iconic hotel famously presides over the corner of market & meeting street — the very heart of historic charleston, south carolina.

planters inn is south carolina’s only relais & châteaux hotel. our historic hotel is an oasis of beauty and gentility for guests who appreciate luxury, personal space, and added privacy.
