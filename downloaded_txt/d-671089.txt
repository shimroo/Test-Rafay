welcome to brae!
the mission of the bioresource and agricultural engineering department is the study, teaching, and practice of engineering and systems management support for agriculture. our students "learn by doing" in laboratory-intensive classes. through practical design and problem-solving experiences, our students receive the skills, the tools, and the opportunity to build what they design.
