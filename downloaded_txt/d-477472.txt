for the love of frenchies!
many years ago my husband and i were fortunate to purchase our first french bulldog (mia) from luis and patty sosa (bandog french bulldogs). we were immediately “bitten by the frenchie bug”! since that time these little guys have taken over our lives. we’ve become forever hooked on this breed and have produced many champions, group winners and bis and biss winning french bulldogs.
our frenchies live in our home. they are socialized, happy, good natured little guys and girls.. we do some selective breeding, and tend to be rather selfish with what is produced.
our main objective is to improve our line and to produce happy, healthy frenchies who conform to the akc breed standard as closely as possible.
i’m a long time member of the fbdca and a board member, past president and akc delegate of the mississippi state kennel club.
please take a look at our frenchies and be sure to look at their pedigrees. we believe you’ll soon notice that we are very interested in quality.
