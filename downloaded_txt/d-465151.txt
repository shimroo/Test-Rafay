								it started with an idea—one great idea from a 27-year-old stock analyst.
								joe mansueto thought it was unfair that people didn’t have access to the same information as financial professionals.
								so he hired a few people and set up shop in his apartment—to deliver investment research to everyone.
							 our story our mission: to empower investor success 
								we didn’t know then what the company would look like today,
								but we knew the commitment to our mission—to empower investor success—wouldn’t change.
								we’ve empowered investors all over the world,
								and we’re continuing to look for new ways to help people achieve financial security.
