open letter to vidcon





open letter to vidcon 

you don't think you need a harassment policy?http://www.ccfinlay.com/blog/so-i-asked-vidcon-for-a.htmltake a look at the other cons. arisia for example has a code of conduct, and they take it damn seriously.http://2013.arisia.org/code_of_conductbeing the hot new thing doesn't make it a good idea to ignore the wisdom of those who've been doing this longer than you have. vidcon is getting a nasty reputation as the meat market for predators, so unless you want your attendee list to look more like the "serial convention" from "sandman" than comic con, pull your heads out of the sand and take a good hard look at the problems your convention is facing.note: comic con has a harassment policy too:http://www.comic-con.org/cci/convention-policies

a bit of rebooting





i've had a web site at this url for about 14 years now. it's been reinvented a few times, but it's been a while since i took advantage of the features offered by prohosting.com. as a result i've shut down the old hosting account and will be using blogspot's free services for the time being. my personal blog is still at blog.matthewmiller.net.
