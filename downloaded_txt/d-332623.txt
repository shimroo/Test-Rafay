		west coast surf shop is on the high street in abersoch, at the sunny, southern tip of the llyn peninsula in north wales, uk.
we have been in the current building since 1995 and built our first website shortly after. we try and keep a range of surfboards for both beginner and experienced surfers and piles of bodyboards. we specialise in action sports wetsuits by rip curl, c-skins and patagonia.â  we have plenty of wetsuit accessories, patagonia and rip curl clothing, ray-ban and bloc sunglasses and we even have some hamboard skateboards.

our 'hell's mouth surf school' is open from may until november.



if you would rather not have a lesson we also hire surfboards out at â£15 per day or â£50 per week and wetsuits are also  â£15 per day and â£50 per week.

free delivery.... when you spend over â£75 your goods are delivered fast & free to your door (except surfboards which cost â£30 and can only be delivered to mainland addresses. boards over 6'8" can only be delivered within 100 miles). normal delivery in the uk is 1 to 3 days but deliveries across the eu are very unpredictable. import duty will also now sometimes be added by your country's customs. we can't send surfboards outside mainland uk at the moment.
